" in an interview with german newsmagazine der spiegel , 69-year-old archbishop of freiburg , robert zollitsch , who is now head of the german catholic church , said that celibacy and the unmarried lives of priests were a " gift , " but not essential . furthermore , he said it would be a " revolution " if the celibacy tradition within the catholic church were dissolved . this week 's publication of the interview prompted a swift response from regensburg 's bishop , gerhard-ludwig müller . " all of the specifics of being a priest and the corresponding rules of celibacy could not be expanded upon , as a theological context would require , in a quick interview , " he said in a press release . " the second vatican council made clear in article 16 - " decree on the ministry and life of priests " - what the decisive requirements are , " müller added .
" that is and will remain the policy of the catholic church . " no end to strife in sight bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : zollitsch -lrb- l -rrb- follows in the footsteps of cardinal karl lehmann müller maintained that no one should presume that the celibacy rules of the catholic church would be abolished . germany 's süddeutsche zeitung daily pointed out in its tuesday edition that such a refutation of zollitsch 's stance reflects the displeasure it caused among the more conservative bishops in the german bishops ' conference , an assembly of the bishops and archbishops of all the german dioceses . yet the majority of bishops within the conference voted for zollitsch last week as the new head of the german catholic church . the archbishop of freiburg is not only known for his more liberal views on celibacy , he has also professed his support for day-care nurseries for children -lrb- as opposed to the more traditional view that mothers should stay at home -rrb- . he has also said that he was n't necessarily opposed to the german government drawing up legal guidelines for gay and lesbian partnerships - a view strongly rejected by pope benedict xvi . dw staff -lrb- als -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

19 , amidst a german probe into whether many of germany 's top executives used bank accounts in liechtenstein to conceal assets from tax authorities .
" spying on our clients is unthinkable , " prince alois said .
" does a state have the right to obtain information by breaking the law in a friendly state and probably also contravening its own laws ? "
information purchased by germany 's foreign intelligence agency , the bnd , from an as-yet unnamed source led to the resignation of deutsche post ceo klaus zumwinkel on feb .
15 .
he and hundreds of other wealthy germans are now the subject of a tax-evasion inquiry .
prince alois said that the probe encroached upon the sovereignty of his country and that liechtenstein would fight back .
" we 'll be considering further legal steps to protect our citizens and investors from these sorts of investigatory methods , which do not conform to liechtenstein law , " he said .
the prince also said that the information , for which the bnd paid between 4 and 5 million euros -lrb- $ 6-7.5 million -rrb- , was likely a list of clients at the lgt bank group stolen by a former bank employee in 2002 .

wallner added that his office was looking into possible legal action against the person who sold the information .
but liechtenstein - a tiny principality with around 35,000 citizens and roughly twice as many registered companies - is known for its business friendly tradition of banking secrecy and is often considered a tax haven .
liechtenstein 's leadership is trying to portray the asset-concealment scandal as a case of one of europe 's largest countries running roughshod over one of its smallest .

the czech republic was nominated as the leader of the pack . the eight countries were among 14 states to be classified as " consolidated democracies " in the bertelsmann transformation index 2008 -lrb- bti -rrb- .
the findings were made public in the german newspaper die welt a day before their official release .
the baltic republic latvia is the only country that has managed to move up into the lead group since the last study in 2006 .
romania and bulgaria , which joined the eu at the start of 2007 , made it into the second best group .
they were described as being at a stage of " advanced transformation " .
their accession to the european union was deemed to have acted as a strong incentive for political change .
results less positive in turkey bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : this turkish woman is clearly enthusiastic about the democratic process by contrast , turkey 's eagerness to embrace political reform was judged to have flagged since it started accession discussions , with insufficient acceptance of democratic institutions .
but the study 's authors felt the country had made economic progress .
overall , however , the findings of the study make depressing reading .
while nominally the number of democracies is on the rise , more and more are developing autocratic features , according to the bti 's results .
officially , 75 of the 125 states examined have a democratic system with free elections , separation of powers and civil rights - five more than in 2006 .
the number of countries that have introduced free and fair elections over the last two years has risen by 10 to 79 .
some democracies seriously flawed bildunterschrift : vladimir putin goes down better at home than abroad but only 23 of those states do not have serious deficiencies .
over forty of them were classified as " defective democracies " and ten of them as " very defective democracies " , including russia .
venezuela has dropped to join that group .
in eight countries , the situation has deteriorated considerably .
thailand has slipped from being classed as a " defective democracy " to a " moderate autocracy " since the military coup .
but liberia , on the other hand , is now once again categorized as a democratic state . project leader hauke hartmann told die welt that democracies which remain instable for a longer period are particularly endangered .
" the longer a country remains in such a state , the more sceptical the population becomes towards the democratic system and its institutions , " she said .
fifty states do not even fulfil minimal democratic criteria .
somalia brings up the rear both in terms of political and economic change and as far as its government 's reform efforts are concerned .
the transformation index does not include established industrialized nations , such as germany . dw staff -lrb- jg -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

they were described as being at a stage of " advanced transformation " .
their accession to the european union was deemed to have acted as a strong incentive for political change .
results less positive in turkey bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : this turkish woman is clearly enthusiastic about the democratic process by contrast , turkey 's eagerness to embrace political reform was judged to have flagged since it started accession discussions , with insufficient acceptance of democratic institutions .
but the study 's authors felt the country had made economic progress .
overall , however , the findings of the study make depressing reading .
while nominally the number of democracies is on the rise , more and more are developing autocratic features , according to the bti 's results .
officially , 75 of the 125 states examined have a democratic system with free elections , separation of powers and civil rights - five more than in 2006 .
the number of countries that have introduced free and fair elections over the last two years has risen by 10 to 79 .
some democracies seriously flawed bildunterschrift : vladimir putin goes down better at home than abroad but only 23 of those states do not have serious deficiencies .
over forty of them were classified as " defective democracies " and ten of them as " very defective democracies " , including russia .
venezuela has dropped to join that group .
in eight countries , the situation has deteriorated considerably .
thailand has slipped from being classed as a " defective democracy " to a " moderate autocracy " since the military coup .
but liberia , on the other hand , is now once again categorized as a democratic state . project leader hauke hartmann told die welt that democracies which remain instable for a longer period are particularly endangered .
" the longer a country remains in such a state , the more sceptical the population becomes towards the democratic system and its institutions , " she said .
fifty states do not even fulfil minimal democratic criteria .
somalia brings up the rear both in terms of political and economic change and as far as its government 's reform efforts are concerned .
the transformation index does not include established industrialized nations , such as germany . dw staff -lrb- jg -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

that 's one-third less than the previous year .
the statistics also showed that the number of non-eu citizens who came to germany to attend university or to learn the language had also dropped by around 3,000 , to 31,400 .
it 's proof that the government is not living up to its promises , said politician volker wissing .
the parliamentarian , who represents the opposition free market-liberal fdp and focuses on fiscal policy , had pressed the government to provide data on the subject after having often heard business owners bemoan germany 's lack of skilled labor .
german companies have for years complained of a lack of qualified professionals in critical high-tech sectors , warning that it could seriously undermine the country 's competitiveness in an increasingly globalized world .
studies have shown that the skills crunch costs the german economy billions , hampering the growth of high-tech industries . the dismal figures are a gauge of how attractive germany is to high-tech specialists , wissing told dw-world.de. bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : scientists in germany who work with stem cells are restricted in their research " the federal government says it will improve the situation , but it 's obviously not doing so , " he added .
" when even the germans do n't want to stay here , it 's no surprise that foreign specialists are n't attracted , " wissing said .
the country 's federal statistics office said late last year that record numbers of qualified germans were leaving to take up jobs overseas with german emigration reaching its highest level in over 50 years in 2006 .
skilled workers bypass germany wissing pointed out that skilled young people search for work or educational opportunities in places that are competitive and can offer them a future perspective .
he said germany lagged behind other countries in that respect due to shortcomings in the " underfinanced " health care system and the tax system 's " lack of transparency . "
he also criticized the government 's " sluggish acceptance of modern technology . "
" we have so many questions when it comes to gene technology -lsb- for example -rsb- , and there are places in the world where there are n't , " wissing said .
a recent study commissioned by the german economics ministry said that the economic loss resulting from unfilled jobs could amount to more than 20 million euros -lrb- $ 26.8 million -rrb- or one percent of gross domestic product .
the crunch is particularly acute in areas such as engineering , the metal and electronics industry and the services sector .
young brains are missing in academic subjects such as mathematics , natural sciences and technology , the study said .
it calculated that germany would lack up to 95,000 engineers and 135,000 scientists by 2014 . dw staff -lrb- ncy -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

19 .
the german arms manufacturer contacted the program shortly before the report was aired on monday night and said it would cut all its ties to the us firm , according to " report mainz . "
the german company on its web site described its work with blackwater as a " unique and strategic partnership " in which the two firms were cooperating to develop " special edition " firearms and offer training courses in the united states to use heckler & koch weapons .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the firms ' cooperation was meant to be about training courses in north carolina there was no mention of iraq or afghanistan , and the company reportedly denied it had developed a weapon for blackwater , as reported by the tv program . the german government had not given heckler & koch permission to provide blackwater with firearms , " report mainz " said , referring to information it received from germany 's economics ministry .
exploiting a loophole ?
heckler & koch would not provide the program with information as to how blackwater got its weapons .
however , it may have taken advantage of a loophole by merely transferring the firearms to its us subsidiary , which then handed over the wares , the report suggested .
blackwater has been under intense scrutiny from the us congress as a result of the high number of civilian deaths and injuries the company has caused in iraq .
the most controversial incident was in september , when blackwater guards were said to have fatally shot 17 iraqi civilians in baghdad .
the company is neither subject to iraqi law , nor governed by us military tribunals , which allows it to operate without fear of repercussions .
politicians want oversight " it is scandalous and unacceptable that a german arms company cooperates with such a lawless mercenary troop … although it must know that this firm is involved in illegal killings in iraq , " green party parliamentarian hans christian ströbele told the program 's reporters .
the social democrats ' foreign policy spokesman , gert weisskirchen , called for legislation to prevent german firms from participating in the " privatization of war " and said that " such cooperation should be scrutinized . "
free democratic party parliamentarian werner hoyer echoed those comments , saying that there was a gap in legislation that needed to be closed . dw staff -lrb- ncy -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

19 .
the german arms manufacturer contacted the program shortly before the report was aired on monday night and said it would cut all its ties to the us firm , according to " report mainz . "
the german company on its web site described its work with blackwater as a " unique and strategic partnership " in which the two firms were cooperating to develop " special edition " firearms and offer training courses in the united states to use heckler & koch weapons .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the firms ' cooperation was meant to be about training courses in north carolina there was no mention of iraq or afghanistan , and the company reportedly denied it had developed a weapon for blackwater , as reported by the tv program . the german government had not given heckler & koch permission to provide blackwater with firearms , " report mainz " said , referring to information it received from germany 's economics ministry .
exploiting a loophole ?
heckler & koch would not provide the program with information as to how blackwater got its weapons .
however , it may have taken advantage of a loophole by merely transferring the firearms to its us subsidiary , which then handed over the wares , the report suggested .
blackwater has been under intense scrutiny from the us congress as a result of the high number of civilian deaths and injuries the company has caused in iraq .
the most controversial incident was in september , when blackwater guards were said to have fatally shot 17 iraqi civilians in baghdad .
the company is neither subject to iraqi law , nor governed by us military tribunals , which allows it to operate without fear of repercussions .
politicians want oversight " it is scandalous and unacceptable that a german arms company cooperates with such a lawless mercenary troop … although it must know that this firm is involved in illegal killings in iraq , " green party parliamentarian hans christian ströbele told the program 's reporters .
the social democrats ' foreign policy spokesman , gert weisskirchen , called for legislation to prevent german firms from participating in the " privatization of war " and said that " such cooperation should be scrutinized . "
free democratic party parliamentarian werner hoyer echoed those comments , saying that there was a gap in legislation that needed to be closed . dw staff -lrb- ncy -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

but will he and switzlerland be a marriage made in heaven or a high-profile bust ? hitzfeld signed a two-year contract to coach this year 's european championship co-host , after he was unanimously confirmed by both the swiss football league and the swiss soccer federation .
he 'll be taking over from jakob " koebi " kuhn , the popular swiss skipper who 's voluntarily stepping down after the euro 2008 .
hitzfeld was born near the german border with switzerland , and his new post represents something of a professional homecoming .
his first coaching job was with swiss club zug , and he spent a very productive three years at grasshoppers zurich , where he won four trophies .
" the pressure and the expectations will be high , but it will also be possible to keep an overview , " hitzfield told reporters in the run-up to his appointment .
hitzfeld 's first task is to ensure the swiss qualify for the 2010 world cup - a manageable job since switzerland have a relatively weak group .
impressive resume , mediocre current form bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : but his current stint with bayern has n't been as successful having won the champions league with both dortmund and bayern munich , hitzfeld has an unparalleled record among active coaches .
but he 's never headed a national side , and success with switzerland is anything but assured .
his second stint at the helm of bayern , which began a year ago , has seen mixed results .
munich only finished fourth in the bundesliga last season and have n't dominated the field this season either - despite spending a club-record amount on transfers during the summer .
early this year , hitzfeld agreed to step down as bayern 's coach after the 2007-2008 campaign .
the move was portrayed as voluntary to the media , but many soccer experts believed his contract would not have been extended , had he wanted to stay .
and switzerland , though a respectable european side , are hardly a soccer powerhouse , raising questions as to whether a 59-year-old coach will have enough innovative energy to take them to a higher level .
still , european national teams have profited in the past from older german coaches - in 2004 , otto rehhagel led rank outsiders greece to an astonishing european championship .
swiss fans will hope that hitzfeld can replicate something of that unlikely success . dw staff -lrb- jc -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" he said that the eu wanted to reiterate its " willingness to engage with cuba in a constructive political dialogue .

that 's one-third less than the previous year .
the statistics also showed that the number of non-eu citizens who came to germany to attend university or to learn the language had also dropped by around 3,000 , to 31,400 .
it 's proof that the government is not living up to its promises , said politician volker wissing .
the parliamentarian , who represents the opposition free market-liberal fdp and focuses on fiscal policy , had pressed the government to provide data on the subject after having often heard business owners bemoan germany 's lack of skilled labor .
german companies have for years complained of a lack of qualified professionals in critical high-tech sectors , warning that it could seriously undermine the country 's competitiveness in an increasingly globalized world .
studies have shown that the skills crunch costs the german economy billions , hampering the growth of high-tech industries . the dismal figures are a gauge of how attractive germany is to high-tech specialists , wissing told dw-world.de. bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : scientists in germany who work with stem cells are restricted in their research " the federal government says it will improve the situation , but it 's obviously not doing so , " he added .
" when even the germans do n't want to stay here , it 's no surprise that foreign specialists are n't attracted , " wissing said .
the country 's federal statistics office said late last year that record numbers of qualified germans were leaving to take up jobs overseas with german emigration reaching its highest level in over 50 years in 2006 .
skilled workers bypass germany wissing pointed out that skilled young people search for work or educational opportunities in places that are competitive and can offer them a future perspective .
he said germany lagged behind other countries in that respect due to shortcomings in the " underfinanced " health care system and the tax system 's " lack of transparency . "
he also criticized the government 's " sluggish acceptance of modern technology . "
" we have so many questions when it comes to gene technology -lsb- for example -rsb- , and there are places in the world where there are n't , " wissing said .
a recent study commissioned by the german economics ministry said that the economic loss resulting from unfilled jobs could amount to more than 20 million euros -lrb- $ 26.8 million -rrb- or one percent of gross domestic product .
the crunch is particularly acute in areas such as engineering , the metal and electronics industry and the services sector .
young brains are missing in academic subjects such as mathematics , natural sciences and technology , the study said .

the czech republic was nominated as the leader of the pack . the eight countries were among 14 states to be classified as " consolidated democracies " in the bertelsmann transformation index 2008 -lrb- bti -rrb- .
the findings were made public in the german newspaper die welt a day before their official release .
the baltic republic latvia is the only country that has managed to move up into the lead group since the last study in 2006 .
romania and bulgaria , which joined the eu at the start of 2007 , made it into the second best group .
they were described as being at a stage of " advanced transformation " .
their accession to the european union was deemed to have acted as a strong incentive for political change .
results less positive in turkey bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : this turkish woman is clearly enthusiastic about the democratic process by contrast , turkey 's eagerness to embrace political reform was judged to have flagged since it started accession discussions , with insufficient acceptance of democratic institutions .
but the study 's authors felt the country had made economic progress .
overall , however , the findings of the study make depressing reading .
while nominally the number of democracies is on the rise , more and more are developing autocratic features , according to the bti 's results .
officially , 75 of the 125 states examined have a democratic system with free elections , separation of powers and civil rights - five more than in 2006 .
the number of countries that have introduced free and fair elections over the last two years has risen by 10 to 79 .
some democracies seriously flawed bildunterschrift : vladimir putin goes down better at home than abroad but only 23 of those states do not have serious deficiencies .
over forty of them were classified as " defective democracies " and ten of them as " very defective democracies " , including russia .
venezuela has dropped to join that group .
in eight countries , the situation has deteriorated considerably .
thailand has slipped from being classed as a " defective democracy " to a " moderate autocracy " since the military coup .
but liberia , on the other hand , is now once again categorized as a democratic state . project leader hauke hartmann told die welt that democracies which remain instable for a longer period are particularly endangered .
" the longer a country remains in such a state , the more sceptical the population becomes towards the democratic system and its institutions , " she said .
fifty states do not even fulfil minimal democratic criteria .
somalia brings up the rear both in terms of political and economic change and as far as its government 's reform efforts are concerned .
the transformation index does not include established industrialized nations , such as germany . dw staff -lrb- jg -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

19 .
the german arms manufacturer contacted the program shortly before the report was aired on monday night and said it would cut all its ties to the us firm , according to " report mainz . "
the german company on its web site described its work with blackwater as a " unique and strategic partnership " in which the two firms were cooperating to develop " special edition " firearms and offer training courses in the united states to use heckler & koch weapons .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the firms ' cooperation was meant to be about training courses in north carolina there was no mention of iraq or afghanistan , and the company reportedly denied it had developed a weapon for blackwater , as reported by the tv program . the german government had not given heckler & koch permission to provide blackwater with firearms , " report mainz " said , referring to information it received from germany 's economics ministry .
exploiting a loophole ?
heckler & koch would not provide the program with information as to how blackwater got its weapons .
however , it may have taken advantage of a loophole by merely transferring the firearms to its us subsidiary , which then handed over the wares , the report suggested .
blackwater has been under intense scrutiny from the us congress as a result of the high number of civilian deaths and injuries the company has caused in iraq .
the most controversial incident was in september , when blackwater guards were said to have fatally shot 17 iraqi civilians in baghdad .
the company is neither subject to iraqi law , nor governed by us military tribunals , which allows it to operate without fear of repercussions .
politicians want oversight " it is scandalous and unacceptable that a german arms company cooperates with such a lawless mercenary troop … although it must know that this firm is involved in illegal killings in iraq , " green party parliamentarian hans christian ströbele told the program 's reporters .
the social democrats ' foreign policy spokesman , gert weisskirchen , called for legislation to prevent german firms from participating in the " privatization of war " and said that " such cooperation should be scrutinized . "

19 , amidst a german probe into whether many of germany 's top executives used bank accounts in liechtenstein to conceal assets from tax authorities .
" spying on our clients is unthinkable , " prince alois said .
" does a state have the right to obtain information by breaking the law in a friendly state and probably also contravening its own laws ? "
information purchased by germany 's foreign intelligence agency , the bnd , from an as-yet unnamed source led to the resignation of deutsche post ceo klaus zumwinkel on feb .
15 .
he and hundreds of other wealthy germans are now the subject of a tax-evasion inquiry .
prince alois said that the probe encroached upon the sovereignty of his country and that liechtenstein would fight back .
" we 'll be considering further legal steps to protect our citizens and investors from these sorts of investigatory methods , which do not conform to liechtenstein law , " he said .
the prince also said that the information , for which the bnd paid between 4 and 5 million euros -lrb- $ 6-7.5 million -rrb- , was likely a list of clients at the lgt bank group stolen by a former bank employee in 2002 .
a mouse that 's roaring bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : liechtenstein is both picturesque and extremely business-friendly but it 's not just liechtenstein 's monarchy who is hopping mad at how the german government came by the incriminating data .
" i find it strange , to say the least , that german officials handed over money to a criminal in order to obtain stolen goods in his possession , " liechtenstein state prosecutor robert wallner told the berliner zeitung newspaper .
wallner added that his office was looking into possible legal action against the person who sold the information .
but liechtenstein - a tiny principality with around 35,000 citizens and roughly twice as many registered companies - is known for its business friendly tradition of banking secrecy and is often considered a tax haven .
liechtenstein 's leadership is trying to portray the asset-concealment scandal as a case of one of europe 's largest countries running roughshod over one of its smallest .
" germany has clearly failed to understand how one behaves toward a friendly state , " prince alois said .
" we are a small country and we want good relations with our neighbours , but we are also a sovereign state . "
but german chancellor angela merkel has said she will press liechtenstein 's prime minister otmar hasler for better cooperation in uncovering tax fraud , when the two leaders meet on wednesday in berlin . dw staff -lrb- jc -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

19 .
the german arms manufacturer contacted the program shortly before the report was aired on monday night and said it would cut all its ties to the us firm , according to " report mainz . "
the german company on its web site described its work with blackwater as a " unique and strategic partnership " in which the two firms were cooperating to develop " special edition " firearms and offer training courses in the united states to use heckler & koch weapons .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the firms ' cooperation was meant to be about training courses in north carolina there was no mention of iraq or afghanistan , and the company reportedly denied it had developed a weapon for blackwater , as reported by the tv program . the german government had not given heckler & koch permission to provide blackwater with firearms , " report mainz " said , referring to information it received from germany 's economics ministry .
exploiting a loophole ?
heckler & koch would not provide the program with information as to how blackwater got its weapons .
however , it may have taken advantage of a loophole by merely transferring the firearms to its us subsidiary , which then handed over the wares , the report suggested .
blackwater has been under intense scrutiny from the us congress as a result of the high number of civilian deaths and injuries the company has caused in iraq .
the most controversial incident was in september , when blackwater guards were said to have fatally shot 17 iraqi civilians in baghdad .
the company is neither subject to iraqi law , nor governed by us military tribunals , which allows it to operate without fear of repercussions .
politicians want oversight " it is scandalous and unacceptable that a german arms company cooperates with such a lawless mercenary troop … although it must know that this firm is involved in illegal killings in iraq , " green party parliamentarian hans christian ströbele told the program 's reporters .
the social democrats ' foreign policy spokesman , gert weisskirchen , called for legislation to prevent german firms from participating in the " privatization of war " and said that " such cooperation should be scrutinized . "

" in an interview with german newsmagazine der spiegel , 69-year-old archbishop of freiburg , robert zollitsch , who is now head of the german catholic church , said that celibacy and the unmarried lives of priests were a " gift , " but not essential . furthermore , he said it would be a " revolution " if the celibacy tradition within the catholic church were dissolved . this week 's publication of the interview prompted a swift response from regensburg 's bishop , gerhard-ludwig müller . " all of the specifics of being a priest and the corresponding rules of celibacy could not be expanded upon , as a theological context would require , in a quick interview , " he said in a press release . " the second vatican council made clear in article 16 - " decree on the ministry and life of priests " - what the decisive requirements are , " müller added .
" that is and will remain the policy of the catholic church . " no end to strife in sight bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : zollitsch -lrb- l -rrb- follows in the footsteps of cardinal karl lehmann müller maintained that no one should presume that the celibacy rules of the catholic church would be abolished . germany 's süddeutsche zeitung daily pointed out in its tuesday edition that such a refutation of zollitsch 's stance reflects the displeasure it caused among the more conservative bishops in the german bishops ' conference , an assembly of the bishops and archbishops of all the german dioceses . yet the majority of bishops within the conference voted for zollitsch last week as the new head of the german catholic church . the archbishop of freiburg is not only known for his more liberal views on celibacy , he has also professed his support for day-care nurseries for children -lrb- as opposed to the more traditional view that mothers should stay at home -rrb- . he has also said that he was n't necessarily opposed to the german government drawing up legal guidelines for gay and lesbian partnerships - a view strongly rejected by pope benedict xvi . dw staff -lrb- als -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" spying on our clients is unthinkable , " prince alois said .
" does a state have the right to obtain information by breaking the law in a friendly state and probably also contravening its own laws ? "
information purchased by germany 's foreign intelligence agency , the bnd , from an as-yet unnamed source led to the resignation of deutsche post ceo klaus zumwinkel on feb .

he and hundreds of other wealthy germans are now the subject of a tax-evasion inquiry .
prince alois said that the probe encroached upon the sovereignty of his country and that liechtenstein would fight back .
" we 'll be considering further legal steps to protect our citizens and investors from these sorts of investigatory methods , which do not conform to liechtenstein law , " he said .

wallner added that his office was looking into possible legal action against the person who sold the information .

liechtenstein 's leadership is trying to portray the asset-concealment scandal as a case of one of europe 's largest countries running roughshod over one of its smallest .
" germany has clearly failed to understand how one behaves toward a friendly state , " prince alois said .

its task is to represent german sciences in international assemblies . german education and research minister annette schavan said that the academy is to be " the voice of german sciences in international contexts . " she and her colleagues from the 16 german states reached the decision in berlin on monday , feb .
18 . schavan said the academy was to independently focus on scientific topics affecting society and present the results to politicians and the public in a suitable form .

19 .
the german arms manufacturer contacted the program shortly before the report was aired on monday night and said it would cut all its ties to the us firm , according to " report mainz . "
the german company on its web site described its work with blackwater as a " unique and strategic partnership " in which the two firms were cooperating to develop " special edition " firearms and offer training courses in the united states to use heckler & koch weapons .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the firms ' cooperation was meant to be about training courses in north carolina there was no mention of iraq or afghanistan , and the company reportedly denied it had developed a weapon for blackwater , as reported by the tv program . the german government had not given heckler & koch permission to provide blackwater with firearms , " report mainz " said , referring to information it received from germany 's economics ministry .
exploiting a loophole ?
heckler & koch would not provide the program with information as to how blackwater got its weapons .
however , it may have taken advantage of a loophole by merely transferring the firearms to its us subsidiary , which then handed over the wares , the report suggested .
blackwater has been under intense scrutiny from the us congress as a result of the high number of civilian deaths and injuries the company has caused in iraq .
the most controversial incident was in september , when blackwater guards were said to have fatally shot 17 iraqi civilians in baghdad .
the company is neither subject to iraqi law , nor governed by us military tribunals , which allows it to operate without fear of repercussions .
politicians want oversight " it is scandalous and unacceptable that a german arms company cooperates with such a lawless mercenary troop … although it must know that this firm is involved in illegal killings in iraq , " green party parliamentarian hans christian ströbele told the program 's reporters .
the social democrats ' foreign policy spokesman , gert weisskirchen , called for legislation to prevent german firms from participating in the " privatization of war " and said that " such cooperation should be scrutinized . "
free democratic party parliamentarian werner hoyer echoed those comments , saying that there was a gap in legislation that needed to be closed . dw staff -lrb- ncy -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

19 .
the german arms manufacturer contacted the program shortly before the report was aired on monday night and said it would cut all its ties to the us firm , according to " report mainz . "
the german company on its web site described its work with blackwater as a " unique and strategic partnership " in which the two firms were cooperating to develop " special edition " firearms and offer training courses in the united states to use heckler & koch weapons .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the firms ' cooperation was meant to be about training courses in north carolina there was no mention of iraq or afghanistan , and the company reportedly denied it had developed a weapon for blackwater , as reported by the tv program . the german government had not given heckler & koch permission to provide blackwater with firearms , " report mainz " said , referring to information it received from germany 's economics ministry .
exploiting a loophole ?
heckler & koch would not provide the program with information as to how blackwater got its weapons .
however , it may have taken advantage of a loophole by merely transferring the firearms to its us subsidiary , which then handed over the wares , the report suggested .
blackwater has been under intense scrutiny from the us congress as a result of the high number of civilian deaths and injuries the company has caused in iraq .
the most controversial incident was in september , when blackwater guards were said to have fatally shot 17 iraqi civilians in baghdad .
the company is neither subject to iraqi law , nor governed by us military tribunals , which allows it to operate without fear of repercussions .
politicians want oversight " it is scandalous and unacceptable that a german arms company cooperates with such a lawless mercenary troop … although it must know that this firm is involved in illegal killings in iraq , " green party parliamentarian hans christian ströbele told the program 's reporters .
the social democrats ' foreign policy spokesman , gert weisskirchen , called for legislation to prevent german firms from participating in the " privatization of war " and said that " such cooperation should be scrutinized . "

bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the firms ' cooperation was meant to be about training courses in north carolina there was no mention of iraq or afghanistan , and the company reportedly denied it had developed a weapon for blackwater , as reported by the tv program . the german government had not given heckler & koch permission to provide blackwater with firearms , " report mainz " said , referring to information it received from germany 's economics ministry .
exploiting a loophole ?
heckler & koch would not provide the program with information as to how blackwater got its weapons .
however , it may have taken advantage of a loophole by merely transferring the firearms to its us subsidiary , which then handed over the wares , the report suggested .
blackwater has been under intense scrutiny from the us congress as a result of the high number of civilian deaths and injuries the company has caused in iraq .
the most controversial incident was in september , when blackwater guards were said to have fatally shot 17 iraqi civilians in baghdad .
the company is neither subject to iraqi law , nor governed by us military tribunals , which allows it to operate without fear of repercussions .
politicians want oversight " it is scandalous and unacceptable that a german arms company cooperates with such a lawless mercenary troop … although it must know that this firm is involved in illegal killings in iraq , " green party parliamentarian hans christian ströbele told the program 's reporters .
the social democrats ' foreign policy spokesman , gert weisskirchen , called for legislation to prevent german firms from participating in the " privatization of war " and said that " such cooperation should be scrutinized . "
free democratic party parliamentarian werner hoyer echoed those comments , saying that there was a gap in legislation that needed to be closed . dw staff -lrb- ncy -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" in an interview with german newsmagazine der spiegel , 69-year-old archbishop of freiburg , robert zollitsch , who is now head of the german catholic church , said that celibacy and the unmarried lives of priests were a " gift , " but not essential . furthermore , he said it would be a " revolution " if the celibacy tradition within the catholic church were dissolved . this week 's publication of the interview prompted a swift response from regensburg 's bishop , gerhard-ludwig müller . " all of the specifics of being a priest and the corresponding rules of celibacy could not be expanded upon , as a theological context would require , in a quick interview , " he said in a press release . " the second vatican council made clear in article 16 - " decree on the ministry and life of priests " - what the decisive requirements are , " müller added .
" that is and will remain the policy of the catholic church . " no end to strife in sight bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : zollitsch -lrb- l -rrb- follows in the footsteps of cardinal karl lehmann müller maintained that no one should presume that the celibacy rules of the catholic church would be abolished . germany 's süddeutsche zeitung daily pointed out in its tuesday edition that such a refutation of zollitsch 's stance reflects the displeasure it caused among the more conservative bishops in the german bishops ' conference , an assembly of the bishops and archbishops of all the german dioceses . yet the majority of bishops within the conference voted for zollitsch last week as the new head of the german catholic church . the archbishop of freiburg is not only known for his more liberal views on celibacy , he has also professed his support for day-care nurseries for children -lrb- as opposed to the more traditional view that mothers should stay at home -rrb- . he has also said that he was n't necessarily opposed to the german government drawing up legal guidelines for gay and lesbian partnerships - a view strongly rejected by pope benedict xvi . dw staff -lrb- als -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

but will he and switzlerland be a marriage made in heaven or a high-profile bust ? hitzfeld signed a two-year contract to coach this year 's european championship co-host , after he was unanimously confirmed by both the swiss football league and the swiss soccer federation .
he 'll be taking over from jakob " koebi " kuhn , the popular swiss skipper who 's voluntarily stepping down after the euro 2008 .
hitzfeld was born near the german border with switzerland , and his new post represents something of a professional homecoming .
his first coaching job was with swiss club zug , and he spent a very productive three years at grasshoppers zurich , where he won four trophies .
" the pressure and the expectations will be high , but it will also be possible to keep an overview , " hitzfield told reporters in the run-up to his appointment .
hitzfeld 's first task is to ensure the swiss qualify for the 2010 world cup - a manageable job since switzerland have a relatively weak group .
impressive resume , mediocre current form bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : but his current stint with bayern has n't been as successful having won the champions league with both dortmund and bayern munich , hitzfeld has an unparalleled record among active coaches .
but he 's never headed a national side , and success with switzerland is anything but assured .
his second stint at the helm of bayern , which began a year ago , has seen mixed results .
munich only finished fourth in the bundesliga last season and have n't dominated the field this season either - despite spending a club-record amount on transfers during the summer .
early this year , hitzfeld agreed to step down as bayern 's coach after the 2007-2008 campaign .
the move was portrayed as voluntary to the media , but many soccer experts believed his contract would not have been extended , had he wanted to stay .
and switzerland , though a respectable european side , are hardly a soccer powerhouse , raising questions as to whether a 59-year-old coach will have enough innovative energy to take them to a higher level .
still , european national teams have profited in the past from older german coaches - in 2004 , otto rehhagel led rank outsiders greece to an astonishing european championship .

that 's one-third less than the previous year .
the statistics also showed that the number of non-eu citizens who came to germany to attend university or to learn the language had also dropped by around 3,000 , to 31,400 .
it 's proof that the government is not living up to its promises , said politician volker wissing .
the parliamentarian , who represents the opposition free market-liberal fdp and focuses on fiscal policy , had pressed the government to provide data on the subject after having often heard business owners bemoan germany 's lack of skilled labor .
german companies have for years complained of a lack of qualified professionals in critical high-tech sectors , warning that it could seriously undermine the country 's competitiveness in an increasingly globalized world .
studies have shown that the skills crunch costs the german economy billions , hampering the growth of high-tech industries . the dismal figures are a gauge of how attractive germany is to high-tech specialists , wissing told dw-world.de. bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : scientists in germany who work with stem cells are restricted in their research " the federal government says it will improve the situation , but it 's obviously not doing so , " he added .

the country 's federal statistics office said late last year that record numbers of qualified germans were leaving to take up jobs overseas with german emigration reaching its highest level in over 50 years in 2006 .
skilled workers bypass germany wissing pointed out that skilled young people search for work or educational opportunities in places that are competitive and can offer them a future perspective .
he said germany lagged behind other countries in that respect due to shortcomings in the " underfinanced " health care system and the tax system 's " lack of transparency . "
he also criticized the government 's " sluggish acceptance of modern technology . "
" we have so many questions when it comes to gene technology -lsb- for example -rsb- , and there are places in the world where there are n't , " wissing said .
a recent study commissioned by the german economics ministry said that the economic loss resulting from unfilled jobs could amount to more than 20 million euros -lrb- $ 26.8 million -rrb- or one percent of gross domestic product .
the crunch is particularly acute in areas such as engineering , the metal and electronics industry and the services sector .

that 's one-third less than the previous year .
the statistics also showed that the number of non-eu citizens who came to germany to attend university or to learn the language had also dropped by around 3,000 , to 31,400 .
it 's proof that the government is not living up to its promises , said politician volker wissing .
the parliamentarian , who represents the opposition free market-liberal fdp and focuses on fiscal policy , had pressed the government to provide data on the subject after having often heard business owners bemoan germany 's lack of skilled labor .
german companies have for years complained of a lack of qualified professionals in critical high-tech sectors , warning that it could seriously undermine the country 's competitiveness in an increasingly globalized world .
studies have shown that the skills crunch costs the german economy billions , hampering the growth of high-tech industries . the dismal figures are a gauge of how attractive germany is to high-tech specialists , wissing told dw-world.de. bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : scientists in germany who work with stem cells are restricted in their research " the federal government says it will improve the situation , but it 's obviously not doing so , " he added .
" when even the germans do n't want to stay here , it 's no surprise that foreign specialists are n't attracted , " wissing said .
the country 's federal statistics office said late last year that record numbers of qualified germans were leaving to take up jobs overseas with german emigration reaching its highest level in over 50 years in 2006 .
skilled workers bypass germany wissing pointed out that skilled young people search for work or educational opportunities in places that are competitive and can offer them a future perspective .
he said germany lagged behind other countries in that respect due to shortcomings in the " underfinanced " health care system and the tax system 's " lack of transparency . "
he also criticized the government 's " sluggish acceptance of modern technology . "
" we have so many questions when it comes to gene technology -lsb- for example -rsb- , and there are places in the world where there are n't , " wissing said .
a recent study commissioned by the german economics ministry said that the economic loss resulting from unfilled jobs could amount to more than 20 million euros -lrb- $ 26.8 million -rrb- or one percent of gross domestic product .
the crunch is particularly acute in areas such as engineering , the metal and electronics industry and the services sector .
young brains are missing in academic subjects such as mathematics , natural sciences and technology , the study said .

the czech republic was nominated as the leader of the pack . the eight countries were among 14 states to be classified as " consolidated democracies " in the bertelsmann transformation index 2008 -lrb- bti -rrb- .
the findings were made public in the german newspaper die welt a day before their official release .
the baltic republic latvia is the only country that has managed to move up into the lead group since the last study in 2006 .
romania and bulgaria , which joined the eu at the start of 2007 , made it into the second best group .

kosovo police manning the post called for help from the nato peacekeeping force , kfor , which said it was stepping in .
kfor forces in the district include french , danish , belgian and american units . there were no reported casualties , and a spokesperson for the 17,000-strong , nato-led kosovo peacekeeping forces kfor told the afp news agency that the incidents were " regrettable . "
in the nearby town of mitrovica , around a thousand ethnic serbs demonstrated against independence for kosovo , which is overwhelmingly albanian .
the protestors chanted " kosovo is serbia " and marched to a bridge spanning the river that divides mitrovica 's serbian and albanian districts .
along the way , they attacked a nato vehicle with sticks and stones .
kosovo has been under united nations administration since 1999 , when nato drove serbian forces out of the territory . solana swing-by bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the eu hopes it can help preserve stability in kosovo amidst the unrest , the european union 's foreign policy chief javier solana paid a brief visit to kosovo for discussions with kosovar president fatmir sedjiu and prime minister hashim thaci .
" we are good friends of kosovo , and kosovo is good friends with the european union , " said solana in a brief statement to reporters . an independent kosovo would be a potential candidate for accession to the eu - a very distant prospect , to which solana also alluded .
" the european perspective of all of the countries of the region is open , " solana said .
" the joy that has been shown on the streets of pristina and all over kosovo has now to be converted into constructive and positive energy , to move towards the development of society . "
the eu is preparing a 2000-strong contingent to take over the un 's duties in kosovo .
serbia has fiercely rejected the idea of kosovo becoming a full-fledged nation .
independence splits world opinion bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : angry serbs destroy and burn un vehicles most western nations support kosovo 's independence .
the united states , britain and france have all recognized kosovo as a nation , and most other eu nations , including germany , are set to follow suit .
but some eu member states with minority separatist movements , most prominently spain , have rejected the declaration from the kosovan capital pristina .
and china and especially russia oppose the creation of an independent kosovo .
russian foreign minister sergei lavrov said he had talked to his american counterpart condoleezza rice by phone about kosovo on monday , february 18 .
" on our side , we confirmed our principled position on the unacceptability of one-sided acts of pristina declaring its independence , " lavrov wrote in a brief official statement .
" we underlined the dangerous consequences of such a step , fraught as it is with the destruction of the principles of peace and order and international stability , which have been developed over decades .

the findings were made public in the german newspaper die welt a day before their official release .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de technology -pipe- 19.02.2008 despite demand , germany attracts few skilled foreign workers großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : skilled workers coming to europe are increasingly bypassing germany germany 's long-standing skills crunch in high-tech fields such as it and medicine has worsened with statistics showing a sharp drop in the number of qualified foreigners heading to europe 's largest economy . only 23,400 people from non-european union countries came to germany for work in 2007 , according to the country 's federal labor ministry .
that 's one-third less than the previous year .
the statistics also showed that the number of non-eu citizens who came to germany to attend university or to learn the language had also dropped by around 3,000 , to 31,400 .
it 's proof that the government is not living up to its promises , said politician volker wissing .
the parliamentarian , who represents the opposition free market-liberal fdp and focuses on fiscal policy , had pressed the government to provide data on the subject after having often heard business owners bemoan germany 's lack of skilled labor .
german companies have for years complained of a lack of qualified professionals in critical high-tech sectors , warning that it could seriously undermine the country 's competitiveness in an increasingly globalized world .
studies have shown that the skills crunch costs the german economy billions , hampering the growth of high-tech industries . the dismal figures are a gauge of how attractive germany is to high-tech specialists , wissing told dw-world.de. bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : scientists in germany who work with stem cells are restricted in their research " the federal government says it will improve the situation , but it 's obviously not doing so , " he added .
" when even the germans do n't want to stay here , it 's no surprise that foreign specialists are n't attracted , " wissing said .
the country 's federal statistics office said late last year that record numbers of qualified germans were leaving to take up jobs overseas with german emigration reaching its highest level in over 50 years in 2006 .
skilled workers bypass germany wissing pointed out that skilled young people search for work or educational opportunities in places that are competitive and can offer them a future perspective .
he said germany lagged behind other countries in that respect due to shortcomings in the " underfinanced " health care system and the tax system 's " lack of transparency . "
he also criticized the government 's " sluggish acceptance of modern technology . "
" we have so many questions when it comes to gene technology -lsb- for example -rsb- , and there are places in the world where there are n't , " wissing said .
a recent study commissioned by the german economics ministry said that the economic loss resulting from unfilled jobs could amount to more than 20 million euros -lrb- $ 26.8 million -rrb- or one percent of gross domestic product .
the crunch is particularly acute in areas such as engineering , the metal and electronics industry and the services sector .
young brains are missing in academic subjects such as mathematics , natural sciences and technology , the study said .
it calculated that germany would lack up to 95,000 engineers and 135,000 scientists by 2014 . dw staff -lrb- ncy -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

19 .
the german arms manufacturer contacted the program shortly before the report was aired on monday night and said it would cut all its ties to the us firm , according to " report mainz . "
the german company on its web site described its work with blackwater as a " unique and strategic partnership " in which the two firms were cooperating to develop " special edition " firearms and offer training courses in the united states to use heckler & koch weapons .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the firms ' cooperation was meant to be about training courses in north carolina there was no mention of iraq or afghanistan , and the company reportedly denied it had developed a weapon for blackwater , as reported by the tv program . the german government had not given heckler & koch permission to provide blackwater with firearms , " report mainz " said , referring to information it received from germany 's economics ministry .
exploiting a loophole ?
heckler & koch would not provide the program with information as to how blackwater got its weapons .
however , it may have taken advantage of a loophole by merely transferring the firearms to its us subsidiary , which then handed over the wares , the report suggested .
blackwater has been under intense scrutiny from the us congress as a result of the high number of civilian deaths and injuries the company has caused in iraq .
the most controversial incident was in september , when blackwater guards were said to have fatally shot 17 iraqi civilians in baghdad .
the company is neither subject to iraqi law , nor governed by us military tribunals , which allows it to operate without fear of repercussions .
politicians want oversight " it is scandalous and unacceptable that a german arms company cooperates with such a lawless mercenary troop … although it must know that this firm is involved in illegal killings in iraq , " green party parliamentarian hans christian ströbele told the program 's reporters .
the social democrats ' foreign policy spokesman , gert weisskirchen , called for legislation to prevent german firms from participating in the " privatization of war " and said that " such cooperation should be scrutinized . "

however , it may have taken advantage of a loophole by merely transferring the firearms to its us subsidiary , which then handed over the wares , the report suggested .
blackwater has been under intense scrutiny from the us congress as a result of the high number of civilian deaths and injuries the company has caused in iraq .
the most controversial incident was in september , when blackwater guards were said to have fatally shot 17 iraqi civilians in baghdad .
the company is neither subject to iraqi law , nor governed by us military tribunals , which allows it to operate without fear of repercussions .
politicians want oversight " it is scandalous and unacceptable that a german arms company cooperates with such a lawless mercenary troop … although it must know that this firm is involved in illegal killings in iraq , " green party parliamentarian hans christian ströbele told the program 's reporters .
the social democrats ' foreign policy spokesman , gert weisskirchen , called for legislation to prevent german firms from participating in the " privatization of war " and said that " such cooperation should be scrutinized . "
free democratic party parliamentarian werner hoyer echoed those comments , saying that there was a gap in legislation that needed to be closed . dw staff -lrb- ncy -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

but will he and switzlerland be a marriage made in heaven or a high-profile bust ? hitzfeld signed a two-year contract to coach this year 's european championship co-host , after he was unanimously confirmed by both the swiss football league and the swiss soccer federation .
he 'll be taking over from jakob " koebi " kuhn , the popular swiss skipper who 's voluntarily stepping down after the euro 2008 .
hitzfeld was born near the german border with switzerland , and his new post represents something of a professional homecoming .
his first coaching job was with swiss club zug , and he spent a very productive three years at grasshoppers zurich , where he won four trophies .
" the pressure and the expectations will be high , but it will also be possible to keep an overview , " hitzfield told reporters in the run-up to his appointment .
hitzfeld 's first task is to ensure the swiss qualify for the 2010 world cup - a manageable job since switzerland have a relatively weak group .
impressive resume , mediocre current form bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : but his current stint with bayern has n't been as successful having won the champions league with both dortmund and bayern munich , hitzfeld has an unparalleled record among active coaches .
but he 's never headed a national side , and success with switzerland is anything but assured .
his second stint at the helm of bayern , which began a year ago , has seen mixed results .
munich only finished fourth in the bundesliga last season and have n't dominated the field this season either - despite spending a club-record amount on transfers during the summer .
early this year , hitzfeld agreed to step down as bayern 's coach after the 2007-2008 campaign .
the move was portrayed as voluntary to the media , but many soccer experts believed his contract would not have been extended , had he wanted to stay .
and switzerland , though a respectable european side , are hardly a soccer powerhouse , raising questions as to whether a 59-year-old coach will have enough innovative energy to take them to a higher level .
still , european national teams have profited in the past from older german coaches - in 2004 , otto rehhagel led rank outsiders greece to an astonishing european championship .
swiss fans will hope that hitzfeld can replicate something of that unlikely success . dw staff -lrb- jc -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the naming of such an institute has been under discussion for over a decade . the national academy is to foster cooperation between scientists from various disciplines and , to that end , work closely with the german academy of science and engineering -lrb- acatech -rrb- in munich and the berlin-brandenburg academy of sciences .

19 , amidst a german probe into whether many of germany 's top executives used bank accounts in liechtenstein to conceal assets from tax authorities .
" spying on our clients is unthinkable , " prince alois said .
" does a state have the right to obtain information by breaking the law in a friendly state and probably also contravening its own laws ? "
information purchased by germany 's foreign intelligence agency , the bnd , from an as-yet unnamed source led to the resignation of deutsche post ceo klaus zumwinkel on feb .
15 .
he and hundreds of other wealthy germans are now the subject of a tax-evasion inquiry .
prince alois said that the probe encroached upon the sovereignty of his country and that liechtenstein would fight back .
" we 'll be considering further legal steps to protect our citizens and investors from these sorts of investigatory methods , which do not conform to liechtenstein law , " he said .
the prince also said that the information , for which the bnd paid between 4 and 5 million euros -lrb- $ 6-7.5 million -rrb- , was likely a list of clients at the lgt bank group stolen by a former bank employee in 2002 .

wallner added that his office was looking into possible legal action against the person who sold the information .
but liechtenstein - a tiny principality with around 35,000 citizens and roughly twice as many registered companies - is known for its business friendly tradition of banking secrecy and is often considered a tax haven .
liechtenstein 's leadership is trying to portray the asset-concealment scandal as a case of one of europe 's largest countries running roughshod over one of its smallest .

19 , amidst a german probe into whether many of germany 's top executives used bank accounts in liechtenstein to conceal assets from tax authorities .
" spying on our clients is unthinkable , " prince alois said .
" does a state have the right to obtain information by breaking the law in a friendly state and probably also contravening its own laws ? "
information purchased by germany 's foreign intelligence agency , the bnd , from an as-yet unnamed source led to the resignation of deutsche post ceo klaus zumwinkel on feb .
15 .
he and hundreds of other wealthy germans are now the subject of a tax-evasion inquiry .
prince alois said that the probe encroached upon the sovereignty of his country and that liechtenstein would fight back .
" we 'll be considering further legal steps to protect our citizens and investors from these sorts of investigatory methods , which do not conform to liechtenstein law , " he said .
the prince also said that the information , for which the bnd paid between 4 and 5 million euros -lrb- $ 6-7.5 million -rrb- , was likely a list of clients at the lgt bank group stolen by a former bank employee in 2002 .

" i find it strange , to say the least , that german officials handed over money to a criminal in order to obtain stolen goods in his possession , " liechtenstein state prosecutor robert wallner told the berliner zeitung newspaper .
wallner added that his office was looking into possible legal action against the person who sold the information .
but liechtenstein - a tiny principality with around 35,000 citizens and roughly twice as many registered companies - is known for its business friendly tradition of banking secrecy and is often considered a tax haven .
liechtenstein 's leadership is trying to portray the asset-concealment scandal as a case of one of europe 's largest countries running roughshod over one of its smallest .
" germany has clearly failed to understand how one behaves toward a friendly state , " prince alois said .
" we are a small country and we want good relations with our neighbours , but we are also a sovereign state . "

the czech republic was nominated as the leader of the pack . the eight countries were among 14 states to be classified as " consolidated democracies " in the bertelsmann transformation index 2008 -lrb- bti -rrb- .
the findings were made public in the german newspaper die welt a day before their official release .
the baltic republic latvia is the only country that has managed to move up into the lead group since the last study in 2006 .
romania and bulgaria , which joined the eu at the start of 2007 , made it into the second best group .
they were described as being at a stage of " advanced transformation " .
their accession to the european union was deemed to have acted as a strong incentive for political change .
results less positive in turkey bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : this turkish woman is clearly enthusiastic about the democratic process by contrast , turkey 's eagerness to embrace political reform was judged to have flagged since it started accession discussions , with insufficient acceptance of democratic institutions .
but the study 's authors felt the country had made economic progress .
overall , however , the findings of the study make depressing reading .

that 's one-third less than the previous year .
the statistics also showed that the number of non-eu citizens who came to germany to attend university or to learn the language had also dropped by around 3,000 , to 31,400 .
it 's proof that the government is not living up to its promises , said politician volker wissing .
the parliamentarian , who represents the opposition free market-liberal fdp and focuses on fiscal policy , had pressed the government to provide data on the subject after having often heard business owners bemoan germany 's lack of skilled labor .
german companies have for years complained of a lack of qualified professionals in critical high-tech sectors , warning that it could seriously undermine the country 's competitiveness in an increasingly globalized world .

the country 's federal statistics office said late last year that record numbers of qualified germans were leaving to take up jobs overseas with german emigration reaching its highest level in over 50 years in 2006 .
skilled workers bypass germany wissing pointed out that skilled young people search for work or educational opportunities in places that are competitive and can offer them a future perspective .
he said germany lagged behind other countries in that respect due to shortcomings in the " underfinanced " health care system and the tax system 's " lack of transparency . "
he also criticized the government 's " sluggish acceptance of modern technology . "
" we have so many questions when it comes to gene technology -lsb- for example -rsb- , and there are places in the world where there are n't , " wissing said .
a recent study commissioned by the german economics ministry said that the economic loss resulting from unfilled jobs could amount to more than 20 million euros -lrb- $ 26.8 million -rrb- or one percent of gross domestic product .
the crunch is particularly acute in areas such as engineering , the metal and electronics industry and the services sector .

the parliamentarian , who represents the opposition free market-liberal fdp and focuses on fiscal policy , had pressed the government to provide data on the subject after having often heard business owners bemoan germany 's lack of skilled labor .
german companies have for years complained of a lack of qualified professionals in critical high-tech sectors , warning that it could seriously undermine the country 's competitiveness in an increasingly globalized world .
studies have shown that the skills crunch costs the german economy billions , hampering the growth of high-tech industries . the dismal figures are a gauge of how attractive germany is to high-tech specialists , wissing told dw-world.de. bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : scientists in germany who work with stem cells are restricted in their research " the federal government says it will improve the situation , but it 's obviously not doing so , " he added .
" when even the germans do n't want to stay here , it 's no surprise that foreign specialists are n't attracted , " wissing said .
the country 's federal statistics office said late last year that record numbers of qualified germans were leaving to take up jobs overseas with german emigration reaching its highest level in over 50 years in 2006 .
skilled workers bypass germany wissing pointed out that skilled young people search for work or educational opportunities in places that are competitive and can offer them a future perspective .
he said germany lagged behind other countries in that respect due to shortcomings in the " underfinanced " health care system and the tax system 's " lack of transparency . "
he also criticized the government 's " sluggish acceptance of modern technology . "
" we have so many questions when it comes to gene technology -lsb- for example -rsb- , and there are places in the world where there are n't , " wissing said .
a recent study commissioned by the german economics ministry said that the economic loss resulting from unfilled jobs could amount to more than 20 million euros -lrb- $ 26.8 million -rrb- or one percent of gross domestic product .
the crunch is particularly acute in areas such as engineering , the metal and electronics industry and the services sector .

19 , amidst a german probe into whether many of germany 's top executives used bank accounts in liechtenstein to conceal assets from tax authorities .
" spying on our clients is unthinkable , " prince alois said .
" does a state have the right to obtain information by breaking the law in a friendly state and probably also contravening its own laws ? "
information purchased by germany 's foreign intelligence agency , the bnd , from an as-yet unnamed source led to the resignation of deutsche post ceo klaus zumwinkel on feb .
15 .
he and hundreds of other wealthy germans are now the subject of a tax-evasion inquiry .
prince alois said that the probe encroached upon the sovereignty of his country and that liechtenstein would fight back .
" we 'll be considering further legal steps to protect our citizens and investors from these sorts of investigatory methods , which do not conform to liechtenstein law , " he said .
the prince also said that the information , for which the bnd paid between 4 and 5 million euros -lrb- $ 6-7.5 million -rrb- , was likely a list of clients at the lgt bank group stolen by a former bank employee in 2002 .

" i find it strange , to say the least , that german officials handed over money to a criminal in order to obtain stolen goods in his possession , " liechtenstein state prosecutor robert wallner told the berliner zeitung newspaper .
wallner added that his office was looking into possible legal action against the person who sold the information .
but liechtenstein - a tiny principality with around 35,000 citizens and roughly twice as many registered companies - is known for its business friendly tradition of banking secrecy and is often considered a tax haven .
liechtenstein 's leadership is trying to portray the asset-concealment scandal as a case of one of europe 's largest countries running roughshod over one of its smallest .
" germany has clearly failed to understand how one behaves toward a friendly state , " prince alois said .
" we are a small country and we want good relations with our neighbours , but we are also a sovereign state . "

19 , amidst a german probe into whether many of germany 's top executives used bank accounts in liechtenstein to conceal assets from tax authorities .
" spying on our clients is unthinkable , " prince alois said .
" does a state have the right to obtain information by breaking the law in a friendly state and probably also contravening its own laws ? "
information purchased by germany 's foreign intelligence agency , the bnd , from an as-yet unnamed source led to the resignation of deutsche post ceo klaus zumwinkel on feb .
15 .
he and hundreds of other wealthy germans are now the subject of a tax-evasion inquiry .
prince alois said that the probe encroached upon the sovereignty of his country and that liechtenstein would fight back .
" we 'll be considering further legal steps to protect our citizens and investors from these sorts of investigatory methods , which do not conform to liechtenstein law , " he said .
the prince also said that the information , for which the bnd paid between 4 and 5 million euros -lrb- $ 6-7.5 million -rrb- , was likely a list of clients at the lgt bank group stolen by a former bank employee in 2002 .

wallner added that his office was looking into possible legal action against the person who sold the information .

liechtenstein 's leadership is trying to portray the asset-concealment scandal as a case of one of europe 's largest countries running roughshod over one of its smallest .

19 .
the german arms manufacturer contacted the program shortly before the report was aired on monday night and said it would cut all its ties to the us firm , according to " report mainz . "
the german company on its web site described its work with blackwater as a " unique and strategic partnership " in which the two firms were cooperating to develop " special edition " firearms and offer training courses in the united states to use heckler & koch weapons .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the firms ' cooperation was meant to be about training courses in north carolina there was no mention of iraq or afghanistan , and the company reportedly denied it had developed a weapon for blackwater , as reported by the tv program . the german government had not given heckler & koch permission to provide blackwater with firearms , " report mainz " said , referring to information it received from germany 's economics ministry .
exploiting a loophole ?
heckler & koch would not provide the program with information as to how blackwater got its weapons .
however , it may have taken advantage of a loophole by merely transferring the firearms to its us subsidiary , which then handed over the wares , the report suggested .
blackwater has been under intense scrutiny from the us congress as a result of the high number of civilian deaths and injuries the company has caused in iraq .
the most controversial incident was in september , when blackwater guards were said to have fatally shot 17 iraqi civilians in baghdad .
the company is neither subject to iraqi law , nor governed by us military tribunals , which allows it to operate without fear of repercussions .
politicians want oversight " it is scandalous and unacceptable that a german arms company cooperates with such a lawless mercenary troop … although it must know that this firm is involved in illegal killings in iraq , " green party parliamentarian hans christian ströbele told the program 's reporters .
the social democrats ' foreign policy spokesman , gert weisskirchen , called for legislation to prevent german firms from participating in the " privatization of war " and said that " such cooperation should be scrutinized . "
free democratic party parliamentarian werner hoyer echoed those comments , saying that there was a gap in legislation that needed to be closed . dw staff -lrb- ncy -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

19 .
the german arms manufacturer contacted the program shortly before the report was aired on monday night and said it would cut all its ties to the us firm , according to " report mainz . "
the german company on its web site described its work with blackwater as a " unique and strategic partnership " in which the two firms were cooperating to develop " special edition " firearms and offer training courses in the united states to use heckler & koch weapons .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the firms ' cooperation was meant to be about training courses in north carolina there was no mention of iraq or afghanistan , and the company reportedly denied it had developed a weapon for blackwater , as reported by the tv program . the german government had not given heckler & koch permission to provide blackwater with firearms , " report mainz " said , referring to information it received from germany 's economics ministry .
exploiting a loophole ?
heckler & koch would not provide the program with information as to how blackwater got its weapons .
however , it may have taken advantage of a loophole by merely transferring the firearms to its us subsidiary , which then handed over the wares , the report suggested .
blackwater has been under intense scrutiny from the us congress as a result of the high number of civilian deaths and injuries the company has caused in iraq .
the most controversial incident was in september , when blackwater guards were said to have fatally shot 17 iraqi civilians in baghdad .
the company is neither subject to iraqi law , nor governed by us military tribunals , which allows it to operate without fear of repercussions .
politicians want oversight " it is scandalous and unacceptable that a german arms company cooperates with such a lawless mercenary troop … although it must know that this firm is involved in illegal killings in iraq , " green party parliamentarian hans christian ströbele told the program 's reporters .
the social democrats ' foreign policy spokesman , gert weisskirchen , called for legislation to prevent german firms from participating in the " privatization of war " and said that " such cooperation should be scrutinized . "

" in an interview with german newsmagazine der spiegel , 69-year-old archbishop of freiburg , robert zollitsch , who is now head of the german catholic church , said that celibacy and the unmarried lives of priests were a " gift , " but not essential . furthermore , he said it would be a " revolution " if the celibacy tradition within the catholic church were dissolved . this week 's publication of the interview prompted a swift response from regensburg 's bishop , gerhard-ludwig müller . " all of the specifics of being a priest and the corresponding rules of celibacy could not be expanded upon , as a theological context would require , in a quick interview , " he said in a press release .

19 .
the german arms manufacturer contacted the program shortly before the report was aired on monday night and said it would cut all its ties to the us firm , according to " report mainz . "
the german company on its web site described its work with blackwater as a " unique and strategic partnership " in which the two firms were cooperating to develop " special edition " firearms and offer training courses in the united states to use heckler & koch weapons .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the firms ' cooperation was meant to be about training courses in north carolina there was no mention of iraq or afghanistan , and the company reportedly denied it had developed a weapon for blackwater , as reported by the tv program . the german government had not given heckler & koch permission to provide blackwater with firearms , " report mainz " said , referring to information it received from germany 's economics ministry .
exploiting a loophole ?
heckler & koch would not provide the program with information as to how blackwater got its weapons .
however , it may have taken advantage of a loophole by merely transferring the firearms to its us subsidiary , which then handed over the wares , the report suggested .
blackwater has been under intense scrutiny from the us congress as a result of the high number of civilian deaths and injuries the company has caused in iraq .
the most controversial incident was in september , when blackwater guards were said to have fatally shot 17 iraqi civilians in baghdad .
the company is neither subject to iraqi law , nor governed by us military tribunals , which allows it to operate without fear of repercussions .
politicians want oversight " it is scandalous and unacceptable that a german arms company cooperates with such a lawless mercenary troop … although it must know that this firm is involved in illegal killings in iraq , " green party parliamentarian hans christian ströbele told the program 's reporters .
the social democrats ' foreign policy spokesman , gert weisskirchen , called for legislation to prevent german firms from participating in the " privatization of war " and said that " such cooperation should be scrutinized . "
free democratic party parliamentarian werner hoyer echoed those comments , saying that there was a gap in legislation that needed to be closed . dw staff -lrb- ncy -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

19 , amidst a german probe into whether many of germany 's top executives used bank accounts in liechtenstein to conceal assets from tax authorities .
" spying on our clients is unthinkable , " prince alois said .
" does a state have the right to obtain information by breaking the law in a friendly state and probably also contravening its own laws ? "
information purchased by germany 's foreign intelligence agency , the bnd , from an as-yet unnamed source led to the resignation of deutsche post ceo klaus zumwinkel on feb .
15 .
he and hundreds of other wealthy germans are now the subject of a tax-evasion inquiry .
prince alois said that the probe encroached upon the sovereignty of his country and that liechtenstein would fight back .
" we 'll be considering further legal steps to protect our citizens and investors from these sorts of investigatory methods , which do not conform to liechtenstein law , " he said .
the prince also said that the information , for which the bnd paid between 4 and 5 million euros -lrb- $ 6-7.5 million -rrb- , was likely a list of clients at the lgt bank group stolen by a former bank employee in 2002 .
a mouse that 's roaring bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : liechtenstein is both picturesque and extremely business-friendly but it 's not just liechtenstein 's monarchy who is hopping mad at how the german government came by the incriminating data .
" i find it strange , to say the least , that german officials handed over money to a criminal in order to obtain stolen goods in his possession , " liechtenstein state prosecutor robert wallner told the berliner zeitung newspaper .
wallner added that his office was looking into possible legal action against the person who sold the information .
but liechtenstein - a tiny principality with around 35,000 citizens and roughly twice as many registered companies - is known for its business friendly tradition of banking secrecy and is often considered a tax haven .
liechtenstein 's leadership is trying to portray the asset-concealment scandal as a case of one of europe 's largest countries running roughshod over one of its smallest .
" germany has clearly failed to understand how one behaves toward a friendly state , " prince alois said .
" we are a small country and we want good relations with our neighbours , but we are also a sovereign state . "
but german chancellor angela merkel has said she will press liechtenstein 's prime minister otmar hasler for better cooperation in uncovering tax fraud , when the two leaders meet on wednesday in berlin . dw staff -lrb- jc -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

kosovo police manning the post called for help from the nato peacekeeping force , kfor , which said it was stepping in .
kfor forces in the district include french , danish , belgian and american units . there were no reported casualties , and a spokesperson for the 17,000-strong , nato-led kosovo peacekeeping forces kfor told the afp news agency that the incidents were " regrettable . "
in the nearby town of mitrovica , around a thousand ethnic serbs demonstrated against independence for kosovo , which is overwhelmingly albanian .
the protestors chanted " kosovo is serbia " and marched to a bridge spanning the river that divides mitrovica 's serbian and albanian districts .
along the way , they attacked a nato vehicle with sticks and stones .
kosovo has been under united nations administration since 1999 , when nato drove serbian forces out of the territory . solana swing-by bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the eu hopes it can help preserve stability in kosovo amidst the unrest , the european union 's foreign policy chief javier solana paid a brief visit to kosovo for discussions with kosovar president fatmir sedjiu and prime minister hashim thaci .
" we are good friends of kosovo , and kosovo is good friends with the european union , " said solana in a brief statement to reporters . an independent kosovo would be a potential candidate for accession to the eu - a very distant prospect , to which solana also alluded .
" the european perspective of all of the countries of the region is open , " solana said .
" the joy that has been shown on the streets of pristina and all over kosovo has now to be converted into constructive and positive energy , to move towards the development of society . "

the united states , britain and france have all recognized kosovo as a nation , and most other eu nations , including germany , are set to follow suit .
but some eu member states with minority separatist movements , most prominently spain , have rejected the declaration from the kosovan capital pristina .
and china and especially russia oppose the creation of an independent kosovo .
russian foreign minister sergei lavrov said he had talked to his american counterpart condoleezza rice by phone about kosovo on monday , february 18 .
" on our side , we confirmed our principled position on the unacceptability of one-sided acts of pristina declaring its independence , " lavrov wrote in a brief official statement .

in the nearby town of mitrovica , around a thousand ethnic serbs demonstrated against independence for kosovo , which is overwhelmingly albanian .
the protestors chanted " kosovo is serbia " and marched to a bridge spanning the river that divides mitrovica 's serbian and albanian districts .
along the way , they attacked a nato vehicle with sticks and stones .

" we are good friends of kosovo , and kosovo is good friends with the european union , " said solana in a brief statement to reporters . an independent kosovo would be a potential candidate for accession to the eu - a very distant prospect , to which solana also alluded .
" the european perspective of all of the countries of the region is open , " solana said .
" the joy that has been shown on the streets of pristina and all over kosovo has now to be converted into constructive and positive energy , to move towards the development of society . "
the eu is preparing a 2000-strong contingent to take over the un 's duties in kosovo .
serbia has fiercely rejected the idea of kosovo becoming a full-fledged nation .

the united states , britain and france have all recognized kosovo as a nation , and most other eu nations , including germany , are set to follow suit .
but some eu member states with minority separatist movements , most prominently spain , have rejected the declaration from the kosovan capital pristina .
and china and especially russia oppose the creation of an independent kosovo .
russian foreign minister sergei lavrov said he had talked to his american counterpart condoleezza rice by phone about kosovo on monday , february 18 .
" on our side , we confirmed our principled position on the unacceptability of one-sided acts of pristina declaring its independence , " lavrov wrote in a brief official statement .

19 .
the german arms manufacturer contacted the program shortly before the report was aired on monday night and said it would cut all its ties to the us firm , according to " report mainz . "
the german company on its web site described its work with blackwater as a " unique and strategic partnership " in which the two firms were cooperating to develop " special edition " firearms and offer training courses in the united states to use heckler & koch weapons .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the firms ' cooperation was meant to be about training courses in north carolina there was no mention of iraq or afghanistan , and the company reportedly denied it had developed a weapon for blackwater , as reported by the tv program . the german government had not given heckler & koch permission to provide blackwater with firearms , " report mainz " said , referring to information it received from germany 's economics ministry .
exploiting a loophole ?
heckler & koch would not provide the program with information as to how blackwater got its weapons .
however , it may have taken advantage of a loophole by merely transferring the firearms to its us subsidiary , which then handed over the wares , the report suggested .
blackwater has been under intense scrutiny from the us congress as a result of the high number of civilian deaths and injuries the company has caused in iraq .
the most controversial incident was in september , when blackwater guards were said to have fatally shot 17 iraqi civilians in baghdad .
the company is neither subject to iraqi law , nor governed by us military tribunals , which allows it to operate without fear of repercussions .
politicians want oversight " it is scandalous and unacceptable that a german arms company cooperates with such a lawless mercenary troop … although it must know that this firm is involved in illegal killings in iraq , " green party parliamentarian hans christian ströbele told the program 's reporters .
the social democrats ' foreign policy spokesman , gert weisskirchen , called for legislation to prevent german firms from participating in the " privatization of war " and said that " such cooperation should be scrutinized . "
free democratic party parliamentarian werner hoyer echoed those comments , saying that there was a gap in legislation that needed to be closed . dw staff -lrb- ncy -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

that 's one-third less than the previous year .
the statistics also showed that the number of non-eu citizens who came to germany to attend university or to learn the language had also dropped by around 3,000 , to 31,400 .
it 's proof that the government is not living up to its promises , said politician volker wissing .
the parliamentarian , who represents the opposition free market-liberal fdp and focuses on fiscal policy , had pressed the government to provide data on the subject after having often heard business owners bemoan germany 's lack of skilled labor .
german companies have for years complained of a lack of qualified professionals in critical high-tech sectors , warning that it could seriously undermine the country 's competitiveness in an increasingly globalized world .
studies have shown that the skills crunch costs the german economy billions , hampering the growth of high-tech industries . the dismal figures are a gauge of how attractive germany is to high-tech specialists , wissing told dw-world.de. bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : scientists in germany who work with stem cells are restricted in their research " the federal government says it will improve the situation , but it 's obviously not doing so , " he added .
" when even the germans do n't want to stay here , it 's no surprise that foreign specialists are n't attracted , " wissing said .
the country 's federal statistics office said late last year that record numbers of qualified germans were leaving to take up jobs overseas with german emigration reaching its highest level in over 50 years in 2006 .
skilled workers bypass germany wissing pointed out that skilled young people search for work or educational opportunities in places that are competitive and can offer them a future perspective .
he said germany lagged behind other countries in that respect due to shortcomings in the " underfinanced " health care system and the tax system 's " lack of transparency . "
he also criticized the government 's " sluggish acceptance of modern technology . "
" we have so many questions when it comes to gene technology -lsb- for example -rsb- , and there are places in the world where there are n't , " wissing said .
a recent study commissioned by the german economics ministry said that the economic loss resulting from unfilled jobs could amount to more than 20 million euros -lrb- $ 26.8 million -rrb- or one percent of gross domestic product .
the crunch is particularly acute in areas such as engineering , the metal and electronics industry and the services sector .
young brains are missing in academic subjects such as mathematics , natural sciences and technology , the study said .

19 , amidst a german probe into whether many of germany 's top executives used bank accounts in liechtenstein to conceal assets from tax authorities .
" spying on our clients is unthinkable , " prince alois said .
" does a state have the right to obtain information by breaking the law in a friendly state and probably also contravening its own laws ? "
information purchased by germany 's foreign intelligence agency , the bnd , from an as-yet unnamed source led to the resignation of deutsche post ceo klaus zumwinkel on feb .
15 .
he and hundreds of other wealthy germans are now the subject of a tax-evasion inquiry .
prince alois said that the probe encroached upon the sovereignty of his country and that liechtenstein would fight back .
" we 'll be considering further legal steps to protect our citizens and investors from these sorts of investigatory methods , which do not conform to liechtenstein law , " he said .
the prince also said that the information , for which the bnd paid between 4 and 5 million euros -lrb- $ 6-7.5 million -rrb- , was likely a list of clients at the lgt bank group stolen by a former bank employee in 2002 .
a mouse that 's roaring bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : liechtenstein is both picturesque and extremely business-friendly but it 's not just liechtenstein 's monarchy who is hopping mad at how the german government came by the incriminating data .
" i find it strange , to say the least , that german officials handed over money to a criminal in order to obtain stolen goods in his possession , " liechtenstein state prosecutor robert wallner told the berliner zeitung newspaper .
wallner added that his office was looking into possible legal action against the person who sold the information .
but liechtenstein - a tiny principality with around 35,000 citizens and roughly twice as many registered companies - is known for its business friendly tradition of banking secrecy and is often considered a tax haven .
liechtenstein 's leadership is trying to portray the asset-concealment scandal as a case of one of europe 's largest countries running roughshod over one of its smallest .
" germany has clearly failed to understand how one behaves toward a friendly state , " prince alois said .
" we are a small country and we want good relations with our neighbours , but we are also a sovereign state . "
but german chancellor angela merkel has said she will press liechtenstein 's prime minister otmar hasler for better cooperation in uncovering tax fraud , when the two leaders meet on wednesday in berlin . dw staff -lrb- jc -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the country 's federal statistics office said late last year that record numbers of qualified germans were leaving to take up jobs overseas with german emigration reaching its highest level in over 50 years in 2006 .
skilled workers bypass germany wissing pointed out that skilled young people search for work or educational opportunities in places that are competitive and can offer them a future perspective .
he said germany lagged behind other countries in that respect due to shortcomings in the " underfinanced " health care system and the tax system 's " lack of transparency . "
he also criticized the government 's " sluggish acceptance of modern technology . "
" we have so many questions when it comes to gene technology -lsb- for example -rsb- , and there are places in the world where there are n't , " wissing said .
a recent study commissioned by the german economics ministry said that the economic loss resulting from unfilled jobs could amount to more than 20 million euros -lrb- $ 26.8 million -rrb- or one percent of gross domestic product .
the crunch is particularly acute in areas such as engineering , the metal and electronics industry and the services sector .
young brains are missing in academic subjects such as mathematics , natural sciences and technology , the study said .
it calculated that germany would lack up to 95,000 engineers and 135,000 scientists by 2014 . dw staff -lrb- ncy -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

kosovo police manning the post called for help from the nato peacekeeping force , kfor , which said it was stepping in .
kfor forces in the district include french , danish , belgian and american units . there were no reported casualties , and a spokesperson for the 17,000-strong , nato-led kosovo peacekeeping forces kfor told the afp news agency that the incidents were " regrettable . "
in the nearby town of mitrovica , around a thousand ethnic serbs demonstrated against independence for kosovo , which is overwhelmingly albanian .
the protestors chanted " kosovo is serbia " and marched to a bridge spanning the river that divides mitrovica 's serbian and albanian districts .
along the way , they attacked a nato vehicle with sticks and stones .
kosovo has been under united nations administration since 1999 , when nato drove serbian forces out of the territory . solana swing-by bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the eu hopes it can help preserve stability in kosovo amidst the unrest , the european union 's foreign policy chief javier solana paid a brief visit to kosovo for discussions with kosovar president fatmir sedjiu and prime minister hashim thaci .
" we are good friends of kosovo , and kosovo is good friends with the european union , " said solana in a brief statement to reporters . an independent kosovo would be a potential candidate for accession to the eu - a very distant prospect , to which solana also alluded .
" the european perspective of all of the countries of the region is open , " solana said .
" the joy that has been shown on the streets of pristina and all over kosovo has now to be converted into constructive and positive energy , to move towards the development of society . "
the eu is preparing a 2000-strong contingent to take over the un 's duties in kosovo .
serbia has fiercely rejected the idea of kosovo becoming a full-fledged nation .
independence splits world opinion bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : angry serbs destroy and burn un vehicles most western nations support kosovo 's independence .
the united states , britain and france have all recognized kosovo as a nation , and most other eu nations , including germany , are set to follow suit .
but some eu member states with minority separatist movements , most prominently spain , have rejected the declaration from the kosovan capital pristina .
and china and especially russia oppose the creation of an independent kosovo .
russian foreign minister sergei lavrov said he had talked to his american counterpart condoleezza rice by phone about kosovo on monday , february 18 .
" on our side , we confirmed our principled position on the unacceptability of one-sided acts of pristina declaring its independence , " lavrov wrote in a brief official statement .

" in an interview with german newsmagazine der spiegel , 69-year-old archbishop of freiburg , robert zollitsch , who is now head of the german catholic church , said that celibacy and the unmarried lives of priests were a " gift , " but not essential . furthermore , he said it would be a " revolution " if the celibacy tradition within the catholic church were dissolved . this week 's publication of the interview prompted a swift response from regensburg 's bishop , gerhard-ludwig müller . " all of the specifics of being a priest and the corresponding rules of celibacy could not be expanded upon , as a theological context would require , in a quick interview , " he said in a press release . " the second vatican council made clear in article 16 - " decree on the ministry and life of priests " - what the decisive requirements are , " müller added .
" that is and will remain the policy of the catholic church . " no end to strife in sight bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : zollitsch -lrb- l -rrb- follows in the footsteps of cardinal karl lehmann müller maintained that no one should presume that the celibacy rules of the catholic church would be abolished . germany 's süddeutsche zeitung daily pointed out in its tuesday edition that such a refutation of zollitsch 's stance reflects the displeasure it caused among the more conservative bishops in the german bishops ' conference , an assembly of the bishops and archbishops of all the german dioceses . yet the majority of bishops within the conference voted for zollitsch last week as the new head of the german catholic church . the archbishop of freiburg is not only known for his more liberal views on celibacy , he has also professed his support for day-care nurseries for children -lrb- as opposed to the more traditional view that mothers should stay at home -rrb- . he has also said that he was n't necessarily opposed to the german government drawing up legal guidelines for gay and lesbian partnerships - a view strongly rejected by pope benedict xvi . dw staff -lrb- als -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

19 , amidst a german probe into whether many of germany 's top executives used bank accounts in liechtenstein to conceal assets from tax authorities .
" spying on our clients is unthinkable , " prince alois said .
" does a state have the right to obtain information by breaking the law in a friendly state and probably also contravening its own laws ? "
information purchased by germany 's foreign intelligence agency , the bnd , from an as-yet unnamed source led to the resignation of deutsche post ceo klaus zumwinkel on feb .
15 .
he and hundreds of other wealthy germans are now the subject of a tax-evasion inquiry .
prince alois said that the probe encroached upon the sovereignty of his country and that liechtenstein would fight back .
" we 'll be considering further legal steps to protect our citizens and investors from these sorts of investigatory methods , which do not conform to liechtenstein law , " he said .
the prince also said that the information , for which the bnd paid between 4 and 5 million euros -lrb- $ 6-7.5 million -rrb- , was likely a list of clients at the lgt bank group stolen by a former bank employee in 2002 .
a mouse that 's roaring bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : liechtenstein is both picturesque and extremely business-friendly but it 's not just liechtenstein 's monarchy who is hopping mad at how the german government came by the incriminating data .
" i find it strange , to say the least , that german officials handed over money to a criminal in order to obtain stolen goods in his possession , " liechtenstein state prosecutor robert wallner told the berliner zeitung newspaper .
wallner added that his office was looking into possible legal action against the person who sold the information .
but liechtenstein - a tiny principality with around 35,000 citizens and roughly twice as many registered companies - is known for its business friendly tradition of banking secrecy and is often considered a tax haven .
liechtenstein 's leadership is trying to portray the asset-concealment scandal as a case of one of europe 's largest countries running roughshod over one of its smallest .
" germany has clearly failed to understand how one behaves toward a friendly state , " prince alois said .
" we are a small country and we want good relations with our neighbours , but we are also a sovereign state . "

19 , amidst a german probe into whether many of germany 's top executives used bank accounts in liechtenstein to conceal assets from tax authorities .
" spying on our clients is unthinkable , " prince alois said .
" does a state have the right to obtain information by breaking the law in a friendly state and probably also contravening its own laws ? "
information purchased by germany 's foreign intelligence agency , the bnd , from an as-yet unnamed source led to the resignation of deutsche post ceo klaus zumwinkel on feb .
15 .
he and hundreds of other wealthy germans are now the subject of a tax-evasion inquiry .
prince alois said that the probe encroached upon the sovereignty of his country and that liechtenstein would fight back .
" we 'll be considering further legal steps to protect our citizens and investors from these sorts of investigatory methods , which do not conform to liechtenstein law , " he said .
the prince also said that the information , for which the bnd paid between 4 and 5 million euros -lrb- $ 6-7.5 million -rrb- , was likely a list of clients at the lgt bank group stolen by a former bank employee in 2002 .
a mouse that 's roaring bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : liechtenstein is both picturesque and extremely business-friendly but it 's not just liechtenstein 's monarchy who is hopping mad at how the german government came by the incriminating data .
" i find it strange , to say the least , that german officials handed over money to a criminal in order to obtain stolen goods in his possession , " liechtenstein state prosecutor robert wallner told the berliner zeitung newspaper .
wallner added that his office was looking into possible legal action against the person who sold the information .
but liechtenstein - a tiny principality with around 35,000 citizens and roughly twice as many registered companies - is known for its business friendly tradition of banking secrecy and is often considered a tax haven .
liechtenstein 's leadership is trying to portray the asset-concealment scandal as a case of one of europe 's largest countries running roughshod over one of its smallest .
" germany has clearly failed to understand how one behaves toward a friendly state , " prince alois said .
" we are a small country and we want good relations with our neighbours , but we are also a sovereign state . "
but german chancellor angela merkel has said she will press liechtenstein 's prime minister otmar hasler for better cooperation in uncovering tax fraud , when the two leaders meet on wednesday in berlin . dw staff -lrb- jc -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

19 .
the german arms manufacturer contacted the program shortly before the report was aired on monday night and said it would cut all its ties to the us firm , according to " report mainz . "
the german company on its web site described its work with blackwater as a " unique and strategic partnership " in which the two firms were cooperating to develop " special edition " firearms and offer training courses in the united states to use heckler & koch weapons .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the firms ' cooperation was meant to be about training courses in north carolina there was no mention of iraq or afghanistan , and the company reportedly denied it had developed a weapon for blackwater , as reported by the tv program . the german government had not given heckler & koch permission to provide blackwater with firearms , " report mainz " said , referring to information it received from germany 's economics ministry .
exploiting a loophole ?
heckler & koch would not provide the program with information as to how blackwater got its weapons .
however , it may have taken advantage of a loophole by merely transferring the firearms to its us subsidiary , which then handed over the wares , the report suggested .
blackwater has been under intense scrutiny from the us congress as a result of the high number of civilian deaths and injuries the company has caused in iraq .
the most controversial incident was in september , when blackwater guards were said to have fatally shot 17 iraqi civilians in baghdad .
the company is neither subject to iraqi law , nor governed by us military tribunals , which allows it to operate without fear of repercussions .
politicians want oversight " it is scandalous and unacceptable that a german arms company cooperates with such a lawless mercenary troop … although it must know that this firm is involved in illegal killings in iraq , " green party parliamentarian hans christian ströbele told the program 's reporters .
the social democrats ' foreign policy spokesman , gert weisskirchen , called for legislation to prevent german firms from participating in the " privatization of war " and said that " such cooperation should be scrutinized . "

19 .
the german arms manufacturer contacted the program shortly before the report was aired on monday night and said it would cut all its ties to the us firm , according to " report mainz . "
the german company on its web site described its work with blackwater as a " unique and strategic partnership " in which the two firms were cooperating to develop " special edition " firearms and offer training courses in the united states to use heckler & koch weapons .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the firms ' cooperation was meant to be about training courses in north carolina there was no mention of iraq or afghanistan , and the company reportedly denied it had developed a weapon for blackwater , as reported by the tv program . the german government had not given heckler & koch permission to provide blackwater with firearms , " report mainz " said , referring to information it received from germany 's economics ministry .
exploiting a loophole ?
heckler & koch would not provide the program with information as to how blackwater got its weapons .
however , it may have taken advantage of a loophole by merely transferring the firearms to its us subsidiary , which then handed over the wares , the report suggested .
blackwater has been under intense scrutiny from the us congress as a result of the high number of civilian deaths and injuries the company has caused in iraq .
the most controversial incident was in september , when blackwater guards were said to have fatally shot 17 iraqi civilians in baghdad .
the company is neither subject to iraqi law , nor governed by us military tribunals , which allows it to operate without fear of repercussions .
politicians want oversight " it is scandalous and unacceptable that a german arms company cooperates with such a lawless mercenary troop … although it must know that this firm is involved in illegal killings in iraq , " green party parliamentarian hans christian ströbele told the program 's reporters .
the social democrats ' foreign policy spokesman , gert weisskirchen , called for legislation to prevent german firms from participating in the " privatization of war " and said that " such cooperation should be scrutinized . "

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de technology -pipe- 19.02.2008 despite demand , germany attracts few skilled foreign workers großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : skilled workers coming to europe are increasingly bypassing germany germany 's long-standing skills crunch in high-tech fields such as it and medicine has worsened with statistics showing a sharp drop in the number of qualified foreigners heading to europe 's largest economy . only 23,400 people from non-european union countries came to germany for work in 2007 , according to the country 's federal labor ministry .
that 's one-third less than the previous year .
the statistics also showed that the number of non-eu citizens who came to germany to attend university or to learn the language had also dropped by around 3,000 , to 31,400 .
it 's proof that the government is not living up to its promises , said politician volker wissing .
the parliamentarian , who represents the opposition free market-liberal fdp and focuses on fiscal policy , had pressed the government to provide data on the subject after having often heard business owners bemoan germany 's lack of skilled labor .
german companies have for years complained of a lack of qualified professionals in critical high-tech sectors , warning that it could seriously undermine the country 's competitiveness in an increasingly globalized world .
studies have shown that the skills crunch costs the german economy billions , hampering the growth of high-tech industries . the dismal figures are a gauge of how attractive germany is to high-tech specialists , wissing told dw-world.de. bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : scientists in germany who work with stem cells are restricted in their research " the federal government says it will improve the situation , but it 's obviously not doing so , " he added .
" when even the germans do n't want to stay here , it 's no surprise that foreign specialists are n't attracted , " wissing said .
the country 's federal statistics office said late last year that record numbers of qualified germans were leaving to take up jobs overseas with german emigration reaching its highest level in over 50 years in 2006 .
skilled workers bypass germany wissing pointed out that skilled young people search for work or educational opportunities in places that are competitive and can offer them a future perspective .
he said germany lagged behind other countries in that respect due to shortcomings in the " underfinanced " health care system and the tax system 's " lack of transparency . "
he also criticized the government 's " sluggish acceptance of modern technology . "
" we have so many questions when it comes to gene technology -lsb- for example -rsb- , and there are places in the world where there are n't , " wissing said .
a recent study commissioned by the german economics ministry said that the economic loss resulting from unfilled jobs could amount to more than 20 million euros -lrb- $ 26.8 million -rrb- or one percent of gross domestic product .
the crunch is particularly acute in areas such as engineering , the metal and electronics industry and the services sector .
young brains are missing in academic subjects such as mathematics , natural sciences and technology , the study said .
it calculated that germany would lack up to 95,000 engineers and 135,000 scientists by 2014 . dw staff -lrb- ncy -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

that 's one-third less than the previous year .
the statistics also showed that the number of non-eu citizens who came to germany to attend university or to learn the language had also dropped by around 3,000 , to 31,400 .
it 's proof that the government is not living up to its promises , said politician volker wissing .
the parliamentarian , who represents the opposition free market-liberal fdp and focuses on fiscal policy , had pressed the government to provide data on the subject after having often heard business owners bemoan germany 's lack of skilled labor .
german companies have for years complained of a lack of qualified professionals in critical high-tech sectors , warning that it could seriously undermine the country 's competitiveness in an increasingly globalized world .
studies have shown that the skills crunch costs the german economy billions , hampering the growth of high-tech industries . the dismal figures are a gauge of how attractive germany is to high-tech specialists , wissing told dw-world.de. bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : scientists in germany who work with stem cells are restricted in their research " the federal government says it will improve the situation , but it 's obviously not doing so , " he added .
" when even the germans do n't want to stay here , it 's no surprise that foreign specialists are n't attracted , " wissing said .
the country 's federal statistics office said late last year that record numbers of qualified germans were leaving to take up jobs overseas with german emigration reaching its highest level in over 50 years in 2006 .
skilled workers bypass germany wissing pointed out that skilled young people search for work or educational opportunities in places that are competitive and can offer them a future perspective .
he said germany lagged behind other countries in that respect due to shortcomings in the " underfinanced " health care system and the tax system 's " lack of transparency . "
he also criticized the government 's " sluggish acceptance of modern technology . "
" we have so many questions when it comes to gene technology -lsb- for example -rsb- , and there are places in the world where there are n't , " wissing said .
a recent study commissioned by the german economics ministry said that the economic loss resulting from unfilled jobs could amount to more than 20 million euros -lrb- $ 26.8 million -rrb- or one percent of gross domestic product .
the crunch is particularly acute in areas such as engineering , the metal and electronics industry and the services sector .
young brains are missing in academic subjects such as mathematics , natural sciences and technology , the study said .

that 's one-third less than the previous year .
the statistics also showed that the number of non-eu citizens who came to germany to attend university or to learn the language had also dropped by around 3,000 , to 31,400 .
it 's proof that the government is not living up to its promises , said politician volker wissing .
the parliamentarian , who represents the opposition free market-liberal fdp and focuses on fiscal policy , had pressed the government to provide data on the subject after having often heard business owners bemoan germany 's lack of skilled labor .
german companies have for years complained of a lack of qualified professionals in critical high-tech sectors , warning that it could seriously undermine the country 's competitiveness in an increasingly globalized world .
studies have shown that the skills crunch costs the german economy billions , hampering the growth of high-tech industries . the dismal figures are a gauge of how attractive germany is to high-tech specialists , wissing told dw-world.de. bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : scientists in germany who work with stem cells are restricted in their research " the federal government says it will improve the situation , but it 's obviously not doing so , " he added .
" when even the germans do n't want to stay here , it 's no surprise that foreign specialists are n't attracted , " wissing said .
the country 's federal statistics office said late last year that record numbers of qualified germans were leaving to take up jobs overseas with german emigration reaching its highest level in over 50 years in 2006 .
skilled workers bypass germany wissing pointed out that skilled young people search for work or educational opportunities in places that are competitive and can offer them a future perspective .
he said germany lagged behind other countries in that respect due to shortcomings in the " underfinanced " health care system and the tax system 's " lack of transparency . "
he also criticized the government 's " sluggish acceptance of modern technology . "
" we have so many questions when it comes to gene technology -lsb- for example -rsb- , and there are places in the world where there are n't , " wissing said .
a recent study commissioned by the german economics ministry said that the economic loss resulting from unfilled jobs could amount to more than 20 million euros -lrb- $ 26.8 million -rrb- or one percent of gross domestic product .
the crunch is particularly acute in areas such as engineering , the metal and electronics industry and the services sector .
young brains are missing in academic subjects such as mathematics , natural sciences and technology , the study said .
it calculated that germany would lack up to 95,000 engineers and 135,000 scientists by 2014 . dw staff -lrb- ncy -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" in an interview with german newsmagazine der spiegel , 69-year-old archbishop of freiburg , robert zollitsch , who is now head of the german catholic church , said that celibacy and the unmarried lives of priests were a " gift , " but not essential . furthermore , he said it would be a " revolution " if the celibacy tradition within the catholic church were dissolved . this week 's publication of the interview prompted a swift response from regensburg 's bishop , gerhard-ludwig müller . " all of the specifics of being a priest and the corresponding rules of celibacy could not be expanded upon , as a theological context would require , in a quick interview , " he said in a press release . " the second vatican council made clear in article 16 - " decree on the ministry and life of priests " - what the decisive requirements are , " müller added .
" that is and will remain the policy of the catholic church . " no end to strife in sight bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : zollitsch -lrb- l -rrb- follows in the footsteps of cardinal karl lehmann müller maintained that no one should presume that the celibacy rules of the catholic church would be abolished . germany 's süddeutsche zeitung daily pointed out in its tuesday edition that such a refutation of zollitsch 's stance reflects the displeasure it caused among the more conservative bishops in the german bishops ' conference , an assembly of the bishops and archbishops of all the german dioceses . yet the majority of bishops within the conference voted for zollitsch last week as the new head of the german catholic church . the archbishop of freiburg is not only known for his more liberal views on celibacy , he has also professed his support for day-care nurseries for children -lrb- as opposed to the more traditional view that mothers should stay at home -rrb- . he has also said that he was n't necessarily opposed to the german government drawing up legal guidelines for gay and lesbian partnerships - a view strongly rejected by pope benedict xvi . dw staff -lrb- als -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

kosovo police manning the post called for help from the nato peacekeeping force , kfor , which said it was stepping in .
kfor forces in the district include french , danish , belgian and american units . there were no reported casualties , and a spokesperson for the 17,000-strong , nato-led kosovo peacekeeping forces kfor told the afp news agency that the incidents were " regrettable . "
in the nearby town of mitrovica , around a thousand ethnic serbs demonstrated against independence for kosovo , which is overwhelmingly albanian .
the protestors chanted " kosovo is serbia " and marched to a bridge spanning the river that divides mitrovica 's serbian and albanian districts .
along the way , they attacked a nato vehicle with sticks and stones .
kosovo has been under united nations administration since 1999 , when nato drove serbian forces out of the territory . solana swing-by bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the eu hopes it can help preserve stability in kosovo amidst the unrest , the european union 's foreign policy chief javier solana paid a brief visit to kosovo for discussions with kosovar president fatmir sedjiu and prime minister hashim thaci .
" we are good friends of kosovo , and kosovo is good friends with the european union , " said solana in a brief statement to reporters . an independent kosovo would be a potential candidate for accession to the eu - a very distant prospect , to which solana also alluded .
" the european perspective of all of the countries of the region is open , " solana said .
" the joy that has been shown on the streets of pristina and all over kosovo has now to be converted into constructive and positive energy , to move towards the development of society . "
the eu is preparing a 2000-strong contingent to take over the un 's duties in kosovo .
serbia has fiercely rejected the idea of kosovo becoming a full-fledged nation .

the united states , britain and france have all recognized kosovo as a nation , and most other eu nations , including germany , are set to follow suit .
but some eu member states with minority separatist movements , most prominently spain , have rejected the declaration from the kosovan capital pristina .
and china and especially russia oppose the creation of an independent kosovo .
russian foreign minister sergei lavrov said he had talked to his american counterpart condoleezza rice by phone about kosovo on monday , february 18 .
" on our side , we confirmed our principled position on the unacceptability of one-sided acts of pristina declaring its independence , " lavrov wrote in a brief official statement .
" we underlined the dangerous consequences of such a step , fraught as it is with the destruction of the principles of peace and order and international stability , which have been developed over decades .

" in an interview with german newsmagazine der spiegel , 69-year-old archbishop of freiburg , robert zollitsch , who is now head of the german catholic church , said that celibacy and the unmarried lives of priests were a " gift , " but not essential . furthermore , he said it would be a " revolution " if the celibacy tradition within the catholic church were dissolved . this week 's publication of the interview prompted a swift response from regensburg 's bishop , gerhard-ludwig müller . " all of the specifics of being a priest and the corresponding rules of celibacy could not be expanded upon , as a theological context would require , in a quick interview , " he said in a press release . " the second vatican council made clear in article 16 - " decree on the ministry and life of priests " - what the decisive requirements are , " müller added .
" that is and will remain the policy of the catholic church . " no end to strife in sight bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : zollitsch -lrb- l -rrb- follows in the footsteps of cardinal karl lehmann müller maintained that no one should presume that the celibacy rules of the catholic church would be abolished . germany 's süddeutsche zeitung daily pointed out in its tuesday edition that such a refutation of zollitsch 's stance reflects the displeasure it caused among the more conservative bishops in the german bishops ' conference , an assembly of the bishops and archbishops of all the german dioceses . yet the majority of bishops within the conference voted for zollitsch last week as the new head of the german catholic church . the archbishop of freiburg is not only known for his more liberal views on celibacy , he has also professed his support for day-care nurseries for children -lrb- as opposed to the more traditional view that mothers should stay at home -rrb- . he has also said that he was n't necessarily opposed to the german government drawing up legal guidelines for gay and lesbian partnerships - a view strongly rejected by pope benedict xvi . dw staff -lrb- als -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the czech republic was nominated as the leader of the pack . the eight countries were among 14 states to be classified as " consolidated democracies " in the bertelsmann transformation index 2008 -lrb- bti -rrb- .
the findings were made public in the german newspaper die welt a day before their official release .
the baltic republic latvia is the only country that has managed to move up into the lead group since the last study in 2006 .
romania and bulgaria , which joined the eu at the start of 2007 , made it into the second best group .
they were described as being at a stage of " advanced transformation " .
their accession to the european union was deemed to have acted as a strong incentive for political change .
results less positive in turkey bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : this turkish woman is clearly enthusiastic about the democratic process by contrast , turkey 's eagerness to embrace political reform was judged to have flagged since it started accession discussions , with insufficient acceptance of democratic institutions .
but the study 's authors felt the country had made economic progress .
overall , however , the findings of the study make depressing reading .
while nominally the number of democracies is on the rise , more and more are developing autocratic features , according to the bti 's results .
officially , 75 of the 125 states examined have a democratic system with free elections , separation of powers and civil rights - five more than in 2006 .
the number of countries that have introduced free and fair elections over the last two years has risen by 10 to 79 .
some democracies seriously flawed bildunterschrift : vladimir putin goes down better at home than abroad but only 23 of those states do not have serious deficiencies .
over forty of them were classified as " defective democracies " and ten of them as " very defective democracies " , including russia .
venezuela has dropped to join that group .
in eight countries , the situation has deteriorated considerably .
thailand has slipped from being classed as a " defective democracy " to a " moderate autocracy " since the military coup .
but liberia , on the other hand , is now once again categorized as a democratic state . project leader hauke hartmann told die welt that democracies which remain instable for a longer period are particularly endangered .
" the longer a country remains in such a state , the more sceptical the population becomes towards the democratic system and its institutions , " she said .
fifty states do not even fulfil minimal democratic criteria .
somalia brings up the rear both in terms of political and economic change and as far as its government 's reform efforts are concerned .
the transformation index does not include established industrialized nations , such as germany . dw staff -lrb- jg -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

19 , amidst a german probe into whether many of germany 's top executives used bank accounts in liechtenstein to conceal assets from tax authorities .
" spying on our clients is unthinkable , " prince alois said .
" does a state have the right to obtain information by breaking the law in a friendly state and probably also contravening its own laws ? "
information purchased by germany 's foreign intelligence agency , the bnd , from an as-yet unnamed source led to the resignation of deutsche post ceo klaus zumwinkel on feb .
15 .
he and hundreds of other wealthy germans are now the subject of a tax-evasion inquiry .
prince alois said that the probe encroached upon the sovereignty of his country and that liechtenstein would fight back .
" we 'll be considering further legal steps to protect our citizens and investors from these sorts of investigatory methods , which do not conform to liechtenstein law , " he said .
the prince also said that the information , for which the bnd paid between 4 and 5 million euros -lrb- $ 6-7.5 million -rrb- , was likely a list of clients at the lgt bank group stolen by a former bank employee in 2002 .

" i find it strange , to say the least , that german officials handed over money to a criminal in order to obtain stolen goods in his possession , " liechtenstein state prosecutor robert wallner told the berliner zeitung newspaper .
wallner added that his office was looking into possible legal action against the person who sold the information .
but liechtenstein - a tiny principality with around 35,000 citizens and roughly twice as many registered companies - is known for its business friendly tradition of banking secrecy and is often considered a tax haven .
liechtenstein 's leadership is trying to portray the asset-concealment scandal as a case of one of europe 's largest countries running roughshod over one of its smallest .
" germany has clearly failed to understand how one behaves toward a friendly state , " prince alois said .
" we are a small country and we want good relations with our neighbours , but we are also a sovereign state . "

the prince also said that the information , for which the bnd paid between 4 and 5 million euros -lrb- $ 6-7.5 million -rrb- , was likely a list of clients at the lgt bank group stolen by a former bank employee in 2002 .
a mouse that 's roaring bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : liechtenstein is both picturesque and extremely business-friendly but it 's not just liechtenstein 's monarchy who is hopping mad at how the german government came by the incriminating data .
" i find it strange , to say the least , that german officials handed over money to a criminal in order to obtain stolen goods in his possession , " liechtenstein state prosecutor robert wallner told the berliner zeitung newspaper .
wallner added that his office was looking into possible legal action against the person who sold the information .
but liechtenstein - a tiny principality with around 35,000 citizens and roughly twice as many registered companies - is known for its business friendly tradition of banking secrecy and is often considered a tax haven .
liechtenstein 's leadership is trying to portray the asset-concealment scandal as a case of one of europe 's largest countries running roughshod over one of its smallest .
" germany has clearly failed to understand how one behaves toward a friendly state , " prince alois said .
" we are a small country and we want good relations with our neighbours , but we are also a sovereign state . "
but german chancellor angela merkel has said she will press liechtenstein 's prime minister otmar hasler for better cooperation in uncovering tax fraud , when the two leaders meet on wednesday in berlin . dw staff -lrb- jc -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the czech republic was nominated as the leader of the pack . the eight countries were among 14 states to be classified as " consolidated democracies " in the bertelsmann transformation index 2008 -lrb- bti -rrb- .
the findings were made public in the german newspaper die welt a day before their official release .
the baltic republic latvia is the only country that has managed to move up into the lead group since the last study in 2006 .
romania and bulgaria , which joined the eu at the start of 2007 , made it into the second best group .

officially , 75 of the 125 states examined have a democratic system with free elections , separation of powers and civil rights - five more than in 2006 .
the number of countries that have introduced free and fair elections over the last two years has risen by 10 to 79 .
some democracies seriously flawed bildunterschrift : vladimir putin goes down better at home than abroad but only 23 of those states do not have serious deficiencies .
over forty of them were classified as " defective democracies " and ten of them as " very defective democracies " , including russia .
venezuela has dropped to join that group .
in eight countries , the situation has deteriorated considerably .
thailand has slipped from being classed as a " defective democracy " to a " moderate autocracy " since the military coup .
but liberia , on the other hand , is now once again categorized as a democratic state . project leader hauke hartmann told die welt that democracies which remain instable for a longer period are particularly endangered .
" the longer a country remains in such a state , the more sceptical the population becomes towards the democratic system and its institutions , " she said .
fifty states do not even fulfil minimal democratic criteria .
somalia brings up the rear both in terms of political and economic change and as far as its government 's reform efforts are concerned .
the transformation index does not include established industrialized nations , such as germany . dw staff -lrb- jg -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

kosovo police manning the post called for help from the nato peacekeeping force , kfor , which said it was stepping in .
kfor forces in the district include french , danish , belgian and american units . there were no reported casualties , and a spokesperson for the 17,000-strong , nato-led kosovo peacekeeping forces kfor told the afp news agency that the incidents were " regrettable . "
in the nearby town of mitrovica , around a thousand ethnic serbs demonstrated against independence for kosovo , which is overwhelmingly albanian .
the protestors chanted " kosovo is serbia " and marched to a bridge spanning the river that divides mitrovica 's serbian and albanian districts .
along the way , they attacked a nato vehicle with sticks and stones .

and china and especially russia oppose the creation of an independent kosovo .
russian foreign minister sergei lavrov said he had talked to his american counterpart condoleezza rice by phone about kosovo on monday , february 18 .
" on our side , we confirmed our principled position on the unacceptability of one-sided acts of pristina declaring its independence , " lavrov wrote in a brief official statement .
" we underlined the dangerous consequences of such a step , fraught as it is with the destruction of the principles of peace and order and international stability , which have been developed over decades .

19 .
the german arms manufacturer contacted the program shortly before the report was aired on monday night and said it would cut all its ties to the us firm , according to " report mainz . "
the german company on its web site described its work with blackwater as a " unique and strategic partnership " in which the two firms were cooperating to develop " special edition " firearms and offer training courses in the united states to use heckler & koch weapons .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the firms ' cooperation was meant to be about training courses in north carolina there was no mention of iraq or afghanistan , and the company reportedly denied it had developed a weapon for blackwater , as reported by the tv program . the german government had not given heckler & koch permission to provide blackwater with firearms , " report mainz " said , referring to information it received from germany 's economics ministry .
exploiting a loophole ?
heckler & koch would not provide the program with information as to how blackwater got its weapons .
however , it may have taken advantage of a loophole by merely transferring the firearms to its us subsidiary , which then handed over the wares , the report suggested .
blackwater has been under intense scrutiny from the us congress as a result of the high number of civilian deaths and injuries the company has caused in iraq .
the most controversial incident was in september , when blackwater guards were said to have fatally shot 17 iraqi civilians in baghdad .
the company is neither subject to iraqi law , nor governed by us military tribunals , which allows it to operate without fear of repercussions .
politicians want oversight " it is scandalous and unacceptable that a german arms company cooperates with such a lawless mercenary troop … although it must know that this firm is involved in illegal killings in iraq , " green party parliamentarian hans christian ströbele told the program 's reporters .
the social democrats ' foreign policy spokesman , gert weisskirchen , called for legislation to prevent german firms from participating in the " privatization of war " and said that " such cooperation should be scrutinized . "

19 .
the german arms manufacturer contacted the program shortly before the report was aired on monday night and said it would cut all its ties to the us firm , according to " report mainz . "
the german company on its web site described its work with blackwater as a " unique and strategic partnership " in which the two firms were cooperating to develop " special edition " firearms and offer training courses in the united states to use heckler & koch weapons .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the firms ' cooperation was meant to be about training courses in north carolina there was no mention of iraq or afghanistan , and the company reportedly denied it had developed a weapon for blackwater , as reported by the tv program . the german government had not given heckler & koch permission to provide blackwater with firearms , " report mainz " said , referring to information it received from germany 's economics ministry .
exploiting a loophole ?
heckler & koch would not provide the program with information as to how blackwater got its weapons .
however , it may have taken advantage of a loophole by merely transferring the firearms to its us subsidiary , which then handed over the wares , the report suggested .
blackwater has been under intense scrutiny from the us congress as a result of the high number of civilian deaths and injuries the company has caused in iraq .
the most controversial incident was in september , when blackwater guards were said to have fatally shot 17 iraqi civilians in baghdad .
the company is neither subject to iraqi law , nor governed by us military tribunals , which allows it to operate without fear of repercussions .
politicians want oversight " it is scandalous and unacceptable that a german arms company cooperates with such a lawless mercenary troop … although it must know that this firm is involved in illegal killings in iraq , " green party parliamentarian hans christian ströbele told the program 's reporters .
the social democrats ' foreign policy spokesman , gert weisskirchen , called for legislation to prevent german firms from participating in the " privatization of war " and said that " such cooperation should be scrutinized . "
free democratic party parliamentarian werner hoyer echoed those comments , saying that there was a gap in legislation that needed to be closed . dw staff -lrb- ncy -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

bbc news -pipe- americas -pipe- castro : profile of the great survivor bbc news / americas graphics version bbc sport home news front page -pipe- africa -pipe- americas -pipe- asia-pacific -pipe- europe -pipe- middle east -pipe- south asia -pipe- uk -pipe- uk election -pipe- business -pipe- health -pipe- science & environment -pipe- technology -pipe- entertainment -pipe- also in the news -pipe- have your say -pipe- tuesday , 19 february 2008 , 08:02 gmt castro : profile of the great survivor fidel castro , who has announced he is stepping down as cuba 's president , has run the country for so long that nearly three-quarters of its people have known no other leader .
although the us has tried hard to get rid of him , president castro outlasted no fewer than nine american presidents since he took power in 1959 .
in july 2006 president castro underwent emergency intestinal surgery and has not attended any public events since .
though officials say their leader is recuperating , his prolonged absence has raised questions about his health .
on 19 february 2008 he announced : " i neither will aspire to nor will i accept , the position of president of the council of state and commander in chief . "
he had hinted as much on 17 december , in a letter read out on cuban television in which he said he had a duty not to cling on to power or stand in the way of a younger generation .
while his -lrb- also elderly -rrb- brother raul has been acting president since last year , the reference to younger leaders suggests raul may not automatically succeed him .
the question that remains is whether cuba 's communist revolution will outlast fidel castro .
wealthy family the communist leader - known for his long-winded anti-american rhetoric - was born fidel alejandro castro ruz in 1926 to a wealthy , landowning family .
he received a jesuit education , and graduated from havana university as a lawyer .
but , shocked by the contrast between his own comfortable lifestyle and the dire poverty of so many others , he became a marxist-leninist revolutionary .
in 1953 , he took up arms against the regime of president fulgencio batista .
aiming to spark a popular revolt , on 26 july mr castro led more than 100 followers in a failed attack on the moncada military barracks in santiago de cuba .
fidel castro and his brother raul survived , but were imprisoned .
amnestied after two years , mr castro continued to campaign against the batista regime while in exile in mexico , and established a guerrilla force known as the 26 july movement .
his revolutionary ideals attracted support in cuba and in 1959 his forces overthrew batista , whose regime had become a byword for corruption , decadence and inequality .
cuba 's new rulers - who included the legendary argentine revolutionary che guevara - promised to give the land back to the people and to defend the rights of the poor .
cold war battleground fidel castro insisted his ideology was , first and foremost , cuban .
" there is not communism or marxism , but representative democracy and social justice in a well-planned economy , " he said at the time .
he was soon snubbed by us president dwight eisenhower and claimed he was driven into the arms of the soviet union and its leader , nikita khrushchev .
cuba became a cold war battleground .
in april 1961 , the us attempted to topple the castro government by recruiting a private army of cuban exiles to invade the island .
at the bay of pigs , cuban troops repulsed the invaders , killing many and capturing 1,000 .
missile crisis a year later , us reconnaissance planes discovered soviet missiles on their way to sites in cuba .
the world was suddenly confronted with the possibility of all-out nuclear war .
the superpowers stood eyeball to eyeball , but it was the soviet leader who gave way , pulling his missiles out of cuba in return for a secret withdrawal of us weapons from turkey .
fidel castro , though , had become america 's enemy number one .
the cia tried to assassinate him - more than 600 times , according to one cuban minister .
getting him to smoke a cigar packed with explosives was one idea .
other anti-castro plots were even more bizarre , including one to make his beard fall out and ridicule him .
the soviet union poured money into cuba .
it bought the bulk of the island 's sugar harvest and in return its ships crammed into havana harbour , bringing in desperately needed goods to beat the american blockade .
despite his reliance on russian help , president castro put cuba at the head of the newly emerging non-aligned movement .
yet , in africa especially , he took sides , sending his troops in to support marxist guerrillas in angola and mozambique in the 1970s .
exodus but the 1980s era of soviet leader mikhail gorbachev proved catastrophic for president castro 's revolution .
moscow in effect pulled the plug on the cuban economy by refusing to take its sugar any more .
still under american blockade and with its soviet lifeline cut off , chronic shortages and empty shelves in cuba were inevitable .
tempers grew shorter as the food queues grew longer .
by the mid-1990s , many cubans had had enough .
thousands took to the sea in a waterborne exodus to florida .
many drowned .
it was a crushing vote of no-confidence in their leader .
even his own daughter alina fernandez prefers a life of exile as a dissident in miami to rule under her " despotic " father .
state of the nation president castro has used us hostility as a reason to reject democratic reforms to his one-party state .
but cuba under his rule has made impressive domestic strides .
good medical care is freely available for all , there is 98 % literacy , and cuba 's infant mortality rates compare favourably with western nations .
fidel castro retains his ability to rattle and irritate the us , lately engaging in a diplomatic tussle with the us interests section over a propaganda display outside the building .
he has also engineered a rapprochement with oil-rich venezuela , run by his great friend , hugo chavez .

although the us has tried hard to get rid of him , president castro outlasted no fewer than nine american presidents since he took power in 1959 .
in july 2006 president castro underwent emergency intestinal surgery and has not attended any public events since .
though officials say their leader is recuperating , his prolonged absence has raised questions about his health .
on 19 february 2008 he announced : " i neither will aspire to nor will i accept , the position of president of the council of state and commander in chief . "
he had hinted as much on 17 december , in a letter read out on cuban television in which he said he had a duty not to cling on to power or stand in the way of a younger generation .
while his -lrb- also elderly -rrb- brother raul has been acting president since last year , the reference to younger leaders suggests raul may not automatically succeed him .
the question that remains is whether cuba 's communist revolution will outlast fidel castro .
wealthy family the communist leader - known for his long-winded anti-american rhetoric - was born fidel alejandro castro ruz in 1926 to a wealthy , landowning family .
he received a jesuit education , and graduated from havana university as a lawyer .
but , shocked by the contrast between his own comfortable lifestyle and the dire poverty of so many others , he became a marxist-leninist revolutionary .
in 1953 , he took up arms against the regime of president fulgencio batista .
aiming to spark a popular revolt , on 26 july mr castro led more than 100 followers in a failed attack on the moncada military barracks in santiago de cuba .
fidel castro and his brother raul survived , but were imprisoned .
amnestied after two years , mr castro continued to campaign against the batista regime while in exile in mexico , and established a guerrilla force known as the 26 july movement .
his revolutionary ideals attracted support in cuba and in 1959 his forces overthrew batista , whose regime had become a byword for corruption , decadence and inequality .
cuba 's new rulers - who included the legendary argentine revolutionary che guevara - promised to give the land back to the people and to defend the rights of the poor .
cold war battleground fidel castro insisted his ideology was , first and foremost , cuban .
" there is not communism or marxism , but representative democracy and social justice in a well-planned economy , " he said at the time .
he was soon snubbed by us president dwight eisenhower and claimed he was driven into the arms of the soviet union and its leader , nikita khrushchev .
cuba became a cold war battleground .
in april 1961 , the us attempted to topple the castro government by recruiting a private army of cuban exiles to invade the island .
at the bay of pigs , cuban troops repulsed the invaders , killing many and capturing 1,000 .
missile crisis a year later , us reconnaissance planes discovered soviet missiles on their way to sites in cuba .
the world was suddenly confronted with the possibility of all-out nuclear war .
the superpowers stood eyeball to eyeball , but it was the soviet leader who gave way , pulling his missiles out of cuba in return for a secret withdrawal of us weapons from turkey .
fidel castro , though , had become america 's enemy number one .
the cia tried to assassinate him - more than 600 times , according to one cuban minister .
getting him to smoke a cigar packed with explosives was one idea .
other anti-castro plots were even more bizarre , including one to make his beard fall out and ridicule him .
the soviet union poured money into cuba .
it bought the bulk of the island 's sugar harvest and in return its ships crammed into havana harbour , bringing in desperately needed goods to beat the american blockade .
despite his reliance on russian help , president castro put cuba at the head of the newly emerging non-aligned movement .
yet , in africa especially , he took sides , sending his troops in to support marxist guerrillas in angola and mozambique in the 1970s .
exodus but the 1980s era of soviet leader mikhail gorbachev proved catastrophic for president castro 's revolution .
moscow in effect pulled the plug on the cuban economy by refusing to take its sugar any more .
still under american blockade and with its soviet lifeline cut off , chronic shortages and empty shelves in cuba were inevitable .
tempers grew shorter as the food queues grew longer .
by the mid-1990s , many cubans had had enough .
thousands took to the sea in a waterborne exodus to florida .
many drowned .
it was a crushing vote of no-confidence in their leader .
even his own daughter alina fernandez prefers a life of exile as a dissident in miami to rule under her " despotic " father .
state of the nation president castro has used us hostility as a reason to reject democratic reforms to his one-party state .
but cuba under his rule has made impressive domestic strides .
good medical care is freely available for all , there is 98 % literacy , and cuba 's infant mortality rates compare favourably with western nations .
fidel castro retains his ability to rattle and irritate the us , lately engaging in a diplomatic tussle with the us interests section over a propaganda display outside the building .
he has also engineered a rapprochement with oil-rich venezuela , run by his great friend , hugo chavez .
while many cubans undoubtedly detest castro , others genuinely love him .
he is the david who stood up to the goliath of america .
even after nearly 50 years , he remains a divisive figure .

wealthy family the communist leader - known for his long-winded anti-american rhetoric - was born fidel alejandro castro ruz in 1926 to a wealthy , landowning family .
he received a jesuit education , and graduated from havana university as a lawyer .
but , shocked by the contrast between his own comfortable lifestyle and the dire poverty of so many others , he became a marxist-leninist revolutionary .
castro 's band included che guevara in 1953 , he took up arms against the regime of president fulgencio batista .
aiming to spark a popular revolt , on 26 july mr castro led more than 100 followers in a failed attack on the moncada military barracks in santiago de cuba .
fidel castro and his brother raul survived , but were imprisoned .
amnestied after two years , mr castro continued to campaign against the batista regime while in exile in mexico , and established a guerrilla force known as the 26 july movement .
his revolutionary ideals attracted support in cuba and in 1959 his forces overthrew batista , whose regime had become a byword for corruption , decadence and inequality .
cuba 's new rulers - who included the legendary argentine revolutionary che guevara - promised to give the land back to the people and to defend the rights of the poor .
cold war battleground fidel castro insisted his ideology was , first and foremost , cuban .
" there is not communism or marxism , but representative democracy and social justice in a well-planned economy , " he said at the time .
castro 's bond with khrushchev alienated the us he was soon snubbed by us president dwight eisenhower and claimed he was driven into the arms of the soviet union and its leader , nikita khrushchev .
cuba became a cold war battleground .
in april 1961 , the us attempted to topple the castro government by recruiting a private army of cuban exiles to invade the island .
at the bay of pigs , cuban troops repulsed the invaders , killing many and capturing 1,000 .
missile crisis a year later , us reconnaissance planes discovered soviet missiles on their way to sites in cuba .
the world was suddenly confronted with the possibility of all-out nuclear war .
the superpowers stood eyeball to eyeball , but it was the soviet leader who gave way , pulling his missiles out of cuba in return for a secret withdrawal of us weapons from turkey .
fidel castro , though , had become america 's enemy number one .
the cia tried to assassinate him - more than 600 times , according to one cuban minister .
getting him to smoke a cigar packed with explosives was one idea .
other anti-castro plots were even more bizarre , including one to make his beard fall out and ridicule him .
fidel castro : america 's most wanted the soviet union poured money into cuba .
it bought the bulk of the island 's sugar harvest and in return its ships crammed into havana harbour , bringing in desperately needed goods to beat the american blockade .
despite his reliance on russian help , president castro put cuba at the head of the newly emerging non-aligned movement .
yet , in africa especially , he took sides , sending his troops in to support marxist guerrillas in angola and mozambique in the 1970s .
exodus but the 1980s era of soviet leader mikhail gorbachev proved catastrophic for president castro 's revolution .
moscow in effect pulled the plug on the cuban economy by refusing to take its sugar any more .
still under american blockade and with its soviet lifeline cut off , chronic shortages and empty shelves in cuba were inevitable .
tempers grew shorter as the food queues grew longer .
by the mid-1990s , many cubans had had enough .
thousands took to the sea in a waterborne exodus to florida .
many drowned .
it was a crushing vote of no-confidence in their leader .
even his own daughter alina fernandez prefers a life of exile as a dissident in miami to rule under her " despotic " father .
state of the nation president castro has used us hostility as a reason to reject democratic reforms to his one-party state .
but cuba under his rule has made impressive domestic strides .
pope john paul ii criticised castro 's human rights record good medical care is freely available for all , there is 98 % literacy , and cuba 's infant mortality rates compare favourably with western nations .
fidel castro retains his ability to rattle and irritate the us , lately engaging in a diplomatic tussle with the us interests section over a propaganda display outside the building .
he has also engineered a rapprochement with oil-rich venezuela , run by his great friend , hugo chavez .
while many cubans undoubtedly detest castro , others genuinely love him .
he is the david who stood up to the goliath of america .
even after nearly 50 years , he remains a divisive figure .

his revolutionary ideals attracted support in cuba and in 1959 his forces overthrew batista , whose regime had become a byword for corruption , decadence and inequality .
cuba 's new rulers - who included the legendary argentine revolutionary che guevara - promised to give the land back to the people and to defend the rights of the poor .
cold war battleground fidel castro insisted his ideology was , first and foremost , cuban .
" there is not communism or marxism , but representative democracy and social justice in a well-planned economy , " he said at the time .
castro 's bond with khrushchev alienated the us he was soon snubbed by us president dwight eisenhower and claimed he was driven into the arms of the soviet union and its leader , nikita khrushchev .
cuba became a cold war battleground .
in april 1961 , the us attempted to topple the castro government by recruiting a private army of cuban exiles to invade the island .
at the bay of pigs , cuban troops repulsed the invaders , killing many and capturing 1,000 .
missile crisis a year later , us reconnaissance planes discovered soviet missiles on their way to sites in cuba .
the world was suddenly confronted with the possibility of all-out nuclear war .
the superpowers stood eyeball to eyeball , but it was the soviet leader who gave way , pulling his missiles out of cuba in return for a secret withdrawal of us weapons from turkey .
fidel castro , though , had become america 's enemy number one .
the cia tried to assassinate him - more than 600 times , according to one cuban minister .
getting him to smoke a cigar packed with explosives was one idea .
other anti-castro plots were even more bizarre , including one to make his beard fall out and ridicule him .
fidel castro : america 's most wanted the soviet union poured money into cuba .
it bought the bulk of the island 's sugar harvest and in return its ships crammed into havana harbour , bringing in desperately needed goods to beat the american blockade .
despite his reliance on russian help , president castro put cuba at the head of the newly emerging non-aligned movement .
yet , in africa especially , he took sides , sending his troops in to support marxist guerrillas in angola and mozambique in the 1970s .
exodus but the 1980s era of soviet leader mikhail gorbachev proved catastrophic for president castro 's revolution .
moscow in effect pulled the plug on the cuban economy by refusing to take its sugar any more .
still under american blockade and with its soviet lifeline cut off , chronic shortages and empty shelves in cuba were inevitable .
tempers grew shorter as the food queues grew longer .
by the mid-1990s , many cubans had had enough .
thousands took to the sea in a waterborne exodus to florida .
many drowned .
it was a crushing vote of no-confidence in their leader .
even his own daughter alina fernandez prefers a life of exile as a dissident in miami to rule under her " despotic " father .
state of the nation president castro has used us hostility as a reason to reject democratic reforms to his one-party state .
but cuba under his rule has made impressive domestic strides .
pope john paul ii criticised castro 's human rights record good medical care is freely available for all , there is 98 % literacy , and cuba 's infant mortality rates compare favourably with western nations .
fidel castro retains his ability to rattle and irritate the us , lately engaging in a diplomatic tussle with the us interests section over a propaganda display outside the building .
he has also engineered a rapprochement with oil-rich venezuela , run by his great friend , hugo chavez .
while many cubans undoubtedly detest castro , others genuinely love him .
he is the david who stood up to the goliath of america .
even after nearly 50 years , he remains a divisive figure .

scientists say fathers who smoke and drink should be aware they are potentially not just damaging themselves , but also their heirs .
tests on rats showed sperm damage caused by exposure to garden chemicals remained up to four generations later .
the us study was presented to the american association for the advancement of science -lrb- aaas -rrb- . "
if i was a young man i would not drink very heavily and not smoke two packets of cigarettes a day while i was trying to conceive a child " professor cynthia daniels rutgers university it suggests that a father 's health plays a greater role in the health of future generations than has been thought .
a team from the university of idaho in moscow tested the effects of a hormone-disrupting fungicide chemical called vinclozolin on embryonic rats .
the chemical altered genes in the sperm , including a number associated with human prostate cancer .
rats exposed to it show signs of damage and overgrowth of the prostate , infertility and kidney problems .
the defects were also present in animals four generations on .
the scientists admitted that the rats were exposed to very high levels of vinclozolin .
proof of principle but they argued that their work shows that once toxins cause defects in sperm they can be passed down the generations .
professor cynthia daniels , from rutgers university in new jersey , has written books on male and female reproduction .
she said men who drank a lot of alcohol had been shown to have increased rates of sperm defects ; and nicotine from tobacco found its way into seminal fluid as well as blood .
professor daniels said : " we need to open up our eyes and look at the evidence .
" my advice to young couples would be moderation .
substances that have an impact on reproduction are often also carcinogenic .
" if i was a young man i would not drink very heavily and not smoke two packets of cigarettes a day while i was trying to conceive a child . "
professor neil mcclure , a fertility expert at queen 's university belfast , uk , said the dna in sperm cells was more tightly packed than in other cells , and so , to some extent , was protected from damage .
however , once sperm cell dna was damaged , it had no mechanism by which to effect repairs .
he said : " there is no doubt that if you smoke like a chimney or drink vast amounts of alcohol it will result in sperm damage , and probably damage in the dna of the sperm .
" my advice to any man trying for a baby would be to lead as healthy a lifestyle as possible . "

tests on rats showed sperm damage caused by exposure to garden chemicals remained up to four generations later .
the us study was presented to the american association for the advancement of science -lrb- aaas -rrb- .
if i was a young man i would not drink very heavily and not smoke two packets of cigarettes a day while i was trying to conceive a child professor cynthia daniels rutgers university it suggests that a father 's health plays a greater role in the health of future generations than has been thought .
a team from the university of idaho in moscow tested the effects of a hormone-disrupting fungicide chemical called vinclozolin on embryonic rats .
the chemical altered genes in the sperm , including a number associated with human prostate cancer .
rats exposed to it show signs of damage and overgrowth of the prostate , infertility and kidney problems .
the defects were also present in animals four generations on .
the scientists admitted that the rats were exposed to very high levels of vinclozolin .
proof of principle but they argued that their work shows that once toxins cause defects in sperm they can be passed down the generations .
professor cynthia daniels , from rutgers university in new jersey , has written books on male and female reproduction .
she said men who drank a lot of alcohol had been shown to have increased rates of sperm defects ; and nicotine from tobacco found its way into seminal fluid as well as blood .
professor daniels said : " we need to open up our eyes and look at the evidence .
" my advice to young couples would be moderation .
substances that have an impact on reproduction are often also carcinogenic .
" if i was a young man i would not drink very heavily and not smoke two packets of cigarettes a day while i was trying to conceive a child . "
professor neil mcclure , a fertility expert at queen 's university belfast , uk , said the dna in sperm cells was more tightly packed than in other cells , and so , to some extent , was protected from damage .
however , once sperm cell dna was damaged , it had no mechanism by which to effect repairs .
he said : " there is no doubt that if you smoke like a chimney or drink vast amounts of alcohol it will result in sperm damage , and probably damage in the dna of the sperm .
" my advice to any man trying for a baby would be to lead as healthy a lifestyle as possible . "

the price of chocolate and sweets made by confectionery firm cadbury schweppes could be about to increase in order to offset rising raw material costs .
the company , whose brands include dairy milk chocolate and trident gum , said it would seek to lift prices because costs were set to rise by 5-6 % in 2008 .
its comments came as it reported a 9 % fall in annual profits to £ 670m -lrb- $ 1.3bn -rrb- as restructuring costs rose .
cadbury is currently in the process of spinning off its american drinks unit .
split revenues at cadbury schweppes ' confectionery business grew by 7 % in 2007 , the firm said , the best performance in a decade .

cadbury added that the demerger of the north american drinks business - which includes brands such as dr pepper and snapple - was set to be completed in the second quarter of the year .
originally , cadbury had been trying to sell the drinks business , but the turbulence in the world 's financial markets last year scuppered these plans , so the firm opted to spin it off instead .
the company said that following the division of the firm , roger carr , currently deputy chairman , would be appointed chairman of the new confectionery company , which will be called just cadbury .
wayne sanders , former president and chief executive of kimberly-clark , will become chairman of the new drinks company , dr pepper snapple group .

in a message published in the on-line version of the state newspaper , granma , mr castro said he would not accept another term as president and commander-in-chief of the armed forces when the new cuban parliament meets on sunday .
the following are excerpts from the message , translated by bbc monitoring : " dear compatriots , i promised you on 15 february that in my next reflections i would touch on a subject of interest for many compatriots .
this time that reflection takes the form of a message ...
i held the honourable position of president for a period of many years ...
before that i had held the post of prime minister for nearly 18 years .
i always exercised the necessary prerogatives to carry forward our revolutionary work with the support of the vast majority of the people .
knowing about my critical state of health , many people overseas thought that my provisional resignation from the post of president of the council of state on 31 july 2006 , leaving it in the hands of the first vice-president , raul castro , was definitive .
raul himself , who also holds the post of minister of the revolutionary armed forces on his own merit , and my other comrades in the party leadership and the state , were reluctant to think of me removed from my posts despite my precarious state of health ...
preparing the people for my psychological and political absence was my primary obligation after so many years of struggle .
i never ceased to say that we were dealing with a recuperation that was " not free from risk " .
my desire was always to carry out my duties until my final breath .

in a message published in the on-line version of the state newspaper , granma , mr castro said he would not accept another term as president and commander-in-chief of the armed forces when the new cuban parliament meets on sunday .
the following are excerpts from the message , translated by bbc monitoring : " dear compatriots , i promised you on 15 february that in my next reflections i would touch on a subject of interest for many compatriots .
this time that reflection takes the form of a message ...
i held the honourable position of president for a period of many years ...
before that i had held the post of prime minister for nearly 18 years .
i always exercised the necessary prerogatives to carry forward our revolutionary work with the support of the vast majority of the people .
knowing about my critical state of health , many people overseas thought that my provisional resignation from the post of president of the council of state on 31 july 2006 , leaving it in the hands of the first vice-president , raul castro , was definitive .
raul himself , who also holds the post of minister of the revolutionary armed forces on his own merit , and my other comrades in the party leadership and the state , were reluctant to think of me removed from my posts despite my precarious state of health ...
preparing the people for my psychological and political absence was my primary obligation after so many years of struggle .
i never ceased to say that we were dealing with a recuperation that was " not free from risk " .
my desire was always to carry out my duties until my final breath .

after invasion and a series of overlapping civil wars in wwii , a lid was kept on national aspirations by the creation of a federation of six nominally equal republics .
in serbia , kosovo and vojvodina were given autonomous status .
but from 1991 yugoslavia fell apart .
a series of splits saw the bloodiest fighting in croatia and bosnia .
a peace deal created the self-governing bosnian serb republic -lrb- republika srpska -rrb- and muslim croat federation .
kosovo become a un protectorate after inter-ethnic fighting and nato bombardment in 1999 .
in 2003 yugoslavia disappeared from the map of europe .
replaced for a short time by the looser union of serbia and montenegro , the latter broke away in 2006 .
two years later , kosovo 's majority ethnic albanians declared independence from serbia .

the campaign urges people to call a dedicated helpline to report fears about the safety and welfare of vulnerable children .
the hotline will provide a link to child protection services , and has been branded the " fourth emergency service " .
children 's groups said they hoped it would encourage people to report their concerns .
a scheme piloting the child protection line has already been running in parts of scotland .
we hope this one line , where people can go and have a trained caller take their call and point them in the right direction , will make a difference addie stevenson aberlour childcare trust concerned people can report a range of behaviour , from seeing children wandering alone at night to cases of physical abuse - including where parents are neglecting children through drink or drug abuse .
the service is now being advertised across the country as part of the two-month campaign , with advertisements in local press and radio as well as posters in places such as gp surgeries , libraries and sports centres .
adam ingram , minister for children and early years , who visited a family support centre in fife to launch the drive , told bbc radio scotland the government was asking people to take responsibility .
" children find it hard to speak up about their own cruel treatment or neglect , " he said .
" that 's why we are asking responsible adults , either friends or family , relatives or neighbours , to do just that . "
taking responsibility the helpline will be manned by trained professionals who will filter out hoax calls and requests for information .
when a caller is put through after that process , a " robust " risk assessment will be made .
chief constable colin mckerracher welcomed the launch children 's groups said they hoped the helpline would encourage friends , relatives and neighbours to come forward .
addie stevenson , the chief executive of aberlour childcare trust , said : " the public , friends , families , often want to ring us and pass something on , but it 's very daunting .
" we hope this one line , where people can go and have a trained caller take their call and point them in the right direction , will make a difference . "
grampian police chief constable colin mckerracher , who is chairman of the north east of scotland child protection committee , welcomed the launch of the campaign .
" i hope that the public will become increasingly aware of the child protection line over the weeks and months ahead , " he said .
' real opportunity ' " if people become more confident in letting us know about children who they suspect may be at risk then they create a real opportunity for the victim 's suffering to be alleviated through the intervention of professionals .
" we understand very well that many people are put off reporting their concerns because they do not know who to contact . "
he added : " please do not think it is a waste of time and that your concerns will not be listened to .
by calling the helpline , you could well be making a big difference to that child 's life . "
there are more than 2,500 children on child protection registers in scotland , and as many as 160,000 youngsters are reported to be currently living with drug or alcohol abusers .
figures released in july showed that almost 7,000 addicts who are prescribed with the heroin replacement methadone had children under 16 living with them .
ministers have previously said the problem of child neglect is one of the most serious facing scotland .
the child protection line 0800 022 3222 is open 24 hours a day .

saga , a firm which specializes in services for the over-50s , estimates a four-year stay in a care home will soar from £ 112,312 to £ 223,476 by 2028 .
care home fees are continuing to rise well above inflation .
with life expectancy rising , saga warns many more people need to think about how they would fund their care .
preparing for the future cost of care is an issue few people want to consider andrew goodsell saga men in non-manual jobs can now expect to live to nearly 80 on average , and women until 83 .
andrew goodsell , chief executive of saga , said : " those faced with funding care now will already know the extent of that financial burden , however preparing for the future cost of care is an issue few people want to consider .
" with the cost of funding care expected to consistently increase above inflation , it 's critical that those already paying for care , or those planning for the future ensure they take advice from a fully qualified adviser . "
helping out saga based its calculations on care home fees continuing to rise by 3.5 % above inflation .
anyone in england who has assets over £ 21,500 is liable to pay for their own care , and many elderly people faced with the costs of long term care have been forced to sell their homes to fund it .
in wales , full self-funding kicks in at £ 22,000 , and scotland at £ 20,750 .
however , many are still entitled to some state benefits , and saga said it was concerned that people were not consulting properly qualified financial advisors to find out how they could be helped .
the government is due to publish a green paper later this year , examining the future of care and the contributions of the individual against those of the state .
annie stevenson , help the aged 's senior policy advisor for health and social care , said : " this comes as no surprise - help the aged have been warning about the consequences of inadequate planning and funding for social care for a long time .
" introducing a fair and sustainable funding settlement for adult social care is crucial to transforming our ailing care system into one that is personalised , easy to understand and accessible .
" the promised green paper , expected later this year , presents a once-in-a-generation opportunity for brave and radical reform of the system . "

environment minister jane davidson said " sensitively but extensively exploited " use of wind , marine and biomass energy could make this happen .
she said wales could " lead the battle " against climate change , as its coal powered the industrial revolution .
a deadline of 13 may for responses from the public has been set .
ms davidson launched the so-called " route map " on renewable energy in cwmbran .
' lagging behind ' " our small country is already taking steps on the road towards a low carbon energy economy , " she said .
" just as we led the world in energy development during the 19th century when our coal powered the industrial revolution , we again have a great opportunity to lead in the battle against climate change .
" if everyone in wales works together on this i am confident that our community can make a very real contribution to tackling one of the biggest problems facing the world community . "
route map proposals encourage wave and tidal energy with " minimum environmental distrubance " proceed in a " measured way " to use wales 's wind resource change planning guidance to make it easier for people to install wind turbines , solar panels etc at home explore new options for river hydroelectric power make the most of biomass such as forests , crops or residual waste materials ensure all new buildings in wales are built to the highest possible low carbon standards develop a strong " green jobs " strategy source : welsh assembly government consultation document -lrb- pdf -rrb- the document suggests wales could create far more electricity than it consumes with around half coming from marine sources .
another third would come from expanding wind energy and most of the rest from sustainable biomass - turning wood , crops and waste into energy .
the assembly government said the ambitious programme would demonstrate to the world what even small countries can do to maximise use of their natural renewable resources .
it said that along with plans for energy efficiency , skills and research and development , it would be a major step towards making wales a low carbon energy economy .
friends of the earth cymru -lrb- foe -rrb- said the aim to be self-sufficient in renewable energy was " ambitious , but it is the right ambition " .
gordon james , foe director , said : " we particularly welcome the commitment to raise the target for renewable energy , and the recognition of the key role that wind energy must play if we are to reach any targets at all .
" wind energy is the most advanced renewable energy technology , and it can make a difference now . "
however , the group said it supported large tidal lagoons rather than the idea of a severn barrage .
ms davidson believes the targets could still be reached , whether the barrage goes ahead or not .
before the announcement , the british wind energy association -lrb- bwea -rrb- expressed concern that wales was " lagging behind " on its current targets .
john woodruff , bwea cymru chairman , said : " the energy routemap must have teeth , setting out clear targets for delivering increased wind energy .
" wind presents great economic opportunities and the potential for wales to become a world class centre of excellence for the development and manufacturing of low carbon technologies . "
morgan parry , head of wwf cymru , said : " big bold decisions must be made early on in order for a report such as this to really impact positively on the bigger picture .
" all credible parties agree that the quickest , cheapest and most effective route to reducing co2 emissions is to reduce energy demand in the first place . "
this would include making existing homes more energy efficient and making new buildings zero carbon , he said .

environment minister jane davidson said " sensitively but extensively exploited " use of wind , marine and biomass energy could make this happen .
she said wales could " lead the battle " against climate change , as its coal powered the industrial revolution .
a deadline of 13 may for responses from the public has been set .
ms davidson launched the so-called " route map " on renewable energy in cwmbran .
' lagging behind ' " our small country is already taking steps on the road towards a low carbon energy economy , " she said .
" just as we led the world in energy development during the 19th century when our coal powered the industrial revolution , we again have a great opportunity to lead in the battle against climate change .
" if everyone in wales works together on this i am confident that our community can make a very real contribution to tackling one of the biggest problems facing the world community . "
route map proposals encourage wave and tidal energy with " minimum environmental distrubance " proceed in a " measured way " to use wales 's wind resource change planning guidance to make it easier for people to install wind turbines , solar panels etc at home explore new options for river hydroelectric power make the most of biomass such as forests , crops or residual waste materials ensure all new buildings in wales are built to the highest possible low carbon standards develop a strong " green jobs " strategy source : welsh assembly government consultation document -lrb- pdf -rrb- the document suggests wales could create far more electricity than it consumes with around half coming from marine sources .
another third would come from expanding wind energy and most of the rest from sustainable biomass - turning wood , crops and waste into energy .
the assembly government said the ambitious programme would demonstrate to the world what even small countries can do to maximise use of their natural renewable resources .
it said that along with plans for energy efficiency , skills and research and development , it would be a major step towards making wales a low carbon energy economy .
friends of the earth cymru -lrb- foe -rrb- said the aim to be self-sufficient in renewable energy was " ambitious , but it is the right ambition " .
gordon james , foe director , said : " we particularly welcome the commitment to raise the target for renewable energy , and the recognition of the key role that wind energy must play if we are to reach any targets at all .
" wind energy is the most advanced renewable energy technology , and it can make a difference now . "
however , the group said it supported large tidal lagoons rather than the idea of a severn barrage .
ms davidson believes the targets could still be reached , whether the barrage goes ahead or not .
before the announcement , the british wind energy association -lrb- bwea -rrb- expressed concern that wales was " lagging behind " on its current targets .
john woodruff , bwea cymru chairman , said : " the energy routemap must have teeth , setting out clear targets for delivering increased wind energy .
" wind presents great economic opportunities and the potential for wales to become a world class centre of excellence for the development and manufacturing of low carbon technologies . "
morgan parry , head of wwf cymru , said : " big bold decisions must be made early on in order for a report such as this to really impact positively on the bigger picture .
" all credible parties agree that the quickest , cheapest and most effective route to reducing co2 emissions is to reduce energy demand in the first place . "
this would include making existing homes more energy efficient and making new buildings zero carbon , he said .

a campaign has been started by swimmers who are angry that the art deco facility - aberdeen 's oldest pool - has fallen victim to council cutbacks .
however , lib dem councillor john stewart has said closure could pave the way for an olympic version instead .
he said it should have a " positive impact " on hopes for the pool .
apply pressure mr stewart said discussions over the years had shown aberdeen had a large public pool availability compared with other areas .
he said : " it was made clear if we were going to argue for another we would have to take steps .
" it should have a positive impact on the pressure we are able to put on for a 50m pool . "
one 79-year-old swimming enthusiast has launched a campaign in an attempt to save the bon accord baths .
george pettifer has launched a petition and is organising a rally .
he is also planning to protest around the city with a sandwich board .
the city council said it needed to close the pool because it was costing too much to run .

it became extinct in england and wales 150 years ago but continues to be sighted in scottish woods and moorland .
some estimates suggest just 400 survive - although there could be up to 4,000 .
now scottish natural heritage is asking everyone who uses the countryside to take part in a year-long survey and report sightings of the timid animal .
the conservation body hopes to assess numbers and distribution .
the count is being carried out as part of the scottish government 's species action framework and is an effort to safeguard the rare mammal .
last survivor minister for environment michael russell is due to launch the survey at the highland wildlife park , near kincraig , which has captive purebred wildcats .

" they 're often seen at dusk and at dawn or in the dark so it can be quite difficult to determine what a wildcat is in the field . "
the animal is the last surviving native member of the cat family to be found in the wild in britain .
it has been listed in the species action framework for conservation effort over the next five years in an attempt to improve its habitat and reduce threats of cross breeding with feral domestic cats .
the scottish wildcat has survived by clinging on in habitat margins between mountain and moorland and forest and fields , preying on rabbits , small birds and mammals .

the news came as s & n reported profits of £ 444m for 2007 , unchanged on 2006 , with uk profits down 8 % because of the smoking ban and poor summer weather .
the uk 's largest brewer , whose brands include foster 's and john smith 's , has agreed to be bought by carlsberg and heineken for £ 7.8bn -lrb- $ 15.3bn -rrb- .
separately , danish firm carlsberg saw its annual profits rise sharply .
carlsberg said 2007 's net profit reached 2.3bn danish kroner -lrb- £ 233m -rrb- , up from 1.88bn kroner the year before .
although carlsberg 's results beat forecasts , it also highlighted rising costs as a concern .
" the marked increase in raw material prices will make 2008 a challenging year , so it will be more important that ever to focus on value growth in sales and efficiency in the organisation , " said carlsberg chief executive jorgen rasmussen .
cider growth s & n said its planned price increases were needed to counter higher input costs , which it forecast would rise by 8.5 % in 2008 .
it also said it would begin moves to cut costs .
performance in western europe was poor in 2007 , after " unprecedented poor weather " across key markets , but the firm predicted the situation would improve in 2008 .
on the plus side , while the uk beer market shrank in 2007 , the volume of cider sales increased by more than 15 % during the period .
under the terms of the sale of s & n , heineken will take over the firm 's uk business , while carlsberg will get its overseas assets , including s & n 's stake in baltic beverages holding -lrb- bbh -rrb- which will give it full control of the brewer of the baltika beer brand .

he told the radio times that the verbal jousting of david cameron and gordon brown reminded him of the comedians frankie howerd and les dawson .
" prime minister 's questions , that 's two guys getting it on there , " mr forsyth , who hosts strictly come dancing , said .
he even records the weekly half-hour sessions , he added .
mr forsyth , who turns 80 on friday , has been in show business for more than 60 years , hosting programmes such as sunday night at the london palladium , the generation game and play your cards right .
he has presented strictly come dancing on bbc one since 2004 .
' furious ' in an interview with jeremy vine for the radio times , mr forsyth said : " prime minister 's questions , that 's two guys getting it on there .
at times it 's pure variety , pure vaudeville .
" it 's all the people i used to work with , frankie howerd and les dawson .
i love it , that 's why i tape it .
last week i forgot , and i was furious for the rest of the day . "
but this oversight became a blessing to the makers of bbc one 's late-night political show this week .
mr forsyth said : " i rang them -lsb- the bbc -rsb- to ask for a tape of the prime minister 's questions i 'd missed , but when i said my name the woman who answered thought it was a crank call .
" then they realised it really was me . "
the programme 's staff then booked the entertainer to share his political views - other commitments allowing he is expected to appear in april .
it is not the first time that this week , fronted by andrew neil , has tangoed with the sequinned world of ballroom dancing .

he told the radio times that the verbal jousting of david cameron and gordon brown reminded him of the comedians frankie howerd and les dawson .
" prime minister 's questions , that 's two guys getting it on there , " mr forsyth , who hosts strictly come dancing , said .
he even records the weekly half-hour sessions , he added .
mr forsyth , who turns 80 on friday , has been in show business for more than 60 years , hosting programmes such as sunday night at the london palladium , the generation game and play your cards right .
he has presented strictly come dancing on bbc one since 2004 .
' furious ' in an interview with jeremy vine for the radio times , mr forsyth said : " prime minister 's questions , that 's two guys getting it on there .
at times it 's pure variety , pure vaudeville .
" it 's all the people i used to work with , frankie howerd and les dawson .
i love it , that 's why i tape it .
last week i forgot , and i was furious for the rest of the day . "
did n't they do well : mr forsyth equated politicians to comedians but this oversight became a blessing to the makers of bbc one 's late-night political show this week .
mr forsyth said : " i rang them -lsb- the bbc -rsb- to ask for a tape of the prime minister 's questions i 'd missed , but when i said my name the woman who answered thought it was a crank call .
" then they realised it really was me . "
the programme 's staff then booked the entertainer to share his political views - other commitments allowing he is expected to appear in april .
it is not the first time that this week , fronted by andrew neil , has tangoed with the sequinned world of ballroom dancing .
in december , the then acting liberal democrat leader vince cable performed a routine with alesha dixon , the winner of the last series of strictly come dancing .
mr forsyth , also famed for his love of golf and catchphrases such as " points mean prizes " and " nice to see to , to see you - nice " , was awarded an obe in 1998 and a cbe in 2006 .
