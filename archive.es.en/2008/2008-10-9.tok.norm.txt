christian ehler , a member of the european parliament , talks to deutsche welle about what the eu nations can do about it . deutsche welle : some eu countries have created unlimited guarantees for savings accounts .
how much sense do these unilateral actions make ?
christian ehler : i think that it certainly makes sense , in the current crisis , to regain the trust of customers by undertaking these sorts of national guarantees for bank accounts .
in the long term , of course , it is n't a solution , because you have to keep in mind that small countries , like iceland , would be completely overwhelmed if their banking sectors were to hand out such guarantees . one potential consequence has been discussed .
namely that customers would transfer their money to other countries which have wide reaching guarantees , to what extent might that result in unfair competition on the housing market ?
i believe that the current situation makes it even more important that we regain people 's trust .
out of all the parties involved , consumers are reacting the more reasonably .
nevertheless , it has to be said that consumers want to know that their money is safe in these sorts of situations .
so far it has been really important to send this signal .
in the long run that is n't a solution because it could perpetuate unfair competition .
i think that for now it 's just a temporary solution and it 's a step in the right direction wo n't the eu countries have to work together if they want a widespread rescue packet like the one in the us ?
they ca n't , plain and simple .
there are two reasons for this .
the one is money market policy .
there we have the european central bank .
that 's the biggest hero of the international finance crisis .
it was different in america , where on the one side there was the markets with liquidity , which had to ensure that the on the other side interests would n't sink too low , which brought put us in danger of inflation .
that 's what we do in money market policy because there we have a contractual basis .
when it comes to financial policy , every eu country has its own sovereignty .
they each have responsibility over their national own banking supervision .
because of that they have to take on risks nationally .
that can change when some member countries are no longer able to do that .
but just look at the reactions on sunday to the quick decisions , which were necessary in the case of hypo real estate .
the idea that 27 member countries could all agree and the idea that it would come with a high risk that some countries would be forced to come up with billions of euros to bail out a bank in greece or the netherlands does n't seem to me to be really feasible at the moment . after the mini summit over the weekend the french president , nicolas sarkozy , announced that the eu stability and growth pact will be softened .
so countries can still contract more debts .
is that a good sign ?
i not only believe that it is n't a good sign , but that it 's wrong , plain and simple .
the instuments that we have there , namely the stability and growth pact , have proven themselves reliable .
and it is clearly defined in the stability pact how much national debt a nation must have and still be able to respond in a flexible way to special situations – and the collapse of large european banks is a special situation .
but that has nothing to do with the fact that we can not and will not tolerate the relatively lax french deal with their finance policies in the stability pact .
keep this in mind : the things that are necessary for a state to intervene in order to stabilize the financial market is made possible by the stability and growth pact .
everything else is just decoration and does n't make much sense . christain ehler is an economist and member of the european parliament and sits on the finance committee . interview : guenther birkenstock -lrb- mrm -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the money will be used " exclusively " to fund the research and development of " carbon-free cars , that is vehicles with the least possible emission of carbon dioxide , whether electric cars or hybrids , " sarkozy said .
in his speech , the french president also said he would ask the european commission to loosen regulations on state subsidies to enable eu governments to better support policies that benefit the environment .
the looser regulations would serve to " align the eu 's state-aid framework with the aims we are pursuing within the scope of our climate-energy package , " sarkozy said .

9 , said the deutsche fussball liga -lrb- dfl -rrb- aims to raise its income from television rights sold abroad from 20 million euros per year to 35 million euros over the next three years .
the dfl 's goal was to claw back lost ground and rake in a foreign income comparable to the spanish and the italian leagues , which earn around 60 million euros per year , dfl official christian seifert was quoted as saying .
the english premier league is by far the most profitable competition in europe with around 300 million euros generated each year outside england .
key foreign markets include asia , where bundesliga champions bayern munich played after finishing the season 2007-2008 , and the middle east , which is a growing destination for winter-break training camps of clubs .
die welt said the dfl had set aside 2 million euros for bonus payments and that clubs playing or training abroad would work closely with the dfl .
uefa head criticizes foreign ownership bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : uefa president michel platini says foreign ownership should be regulated the decision by german soccer officials to spread the good word about the bundesliga comes amid criticism by european soccer chief michel platini of the high rates of foreign ownership of some of europe 's largest clubs .
he said a soccer club 's identity was firmly connected not only to its location and fans , but also to its owners and players , and that if neither of the latter exhibited any resemblance to either of the former , then that was a recipe for the loss of soccer individuality and uniqueness .
" do you want in liverpool an arab sheikh as president with one brazilian coach and nine or 11 african players ?
" where is liverpool in that ?
we have to make some rules .
" what is football ?
football is a game and this game has become popular because of the identity .
you have to have identity .
that is where football 's popularity lies . "
platini , a former french national team midfield magician , said he would investigate the possibility of regulating foreign ownership of clubs across europe , but admitted that varying european national constitutions would be a substantial hurdle to overcome in that quest .
football debt to be examined bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : playing rosters are pushing english clubs into record levels of debt a top uefa official said wednesday that the financial requirements model used for teams in the german and swiss national leagues was viable for use as the basis for a europe-wide system to regulate club debt .
david taylor , uefa general secretary , told a conference in london that the european soccer body would launch talks next week on potential changes to the way clubs are licensed with the aim of reviewing how they run their finances .
several clubs , notably from england , dominate european competitions , believed possible because of the exorbitant debts they all shoulder .
" we can not let things stay as they are , " taylor said .
" in some countries like germany and switzerland , stronger requirements are put on clubs in terms of bank guarantees and having no negative equity .
these are the models we have to look at . "
on tuesday , the chairman of england 's football association , lord david triesman , put the combined debt of english clubs at around 3 billion pounds .
he warned of " very tangible dangers " to large clubs such as liverpool , manchester united and chelsea in the current uncertain financial times . dw staff -lrb- dfm -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

imf analysts also predicted that germany , europe 's largest economy , will stall in 2009 and france 's will grow by a marginal 0.2 percent .
italy and spain will see their economies shrink by 0.2 percent , according to the semi-annual world economic outlook .
with european nations " moving close to or into recession , " the imf urged forceful action by policymakers to combat the crisis with measures such as lower interest rates .
ecb chief : " collect yourselves " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : wall street dropped even after the fed announced interest rate cuts hours before the report 's release , the european central bank and the us federal reserve led key central banks in a coordinated emergency cut in benchmark rates by 0.5 percentage points .
european central bank chief jean-claude trichet called the move " a significant signal of confidence to the markets . "
speaking on france 3 television , he told viewers , " we can say to the markets we have regained control over price stability in the medium term . "
markets continued to fall nevertheless , with wall street down more than two percent , london and frankfurt more than five percent , and paris more than six percent .
" we all together call upon the market participants who are in this state of intense turbulence , we tell them to collect themselves , there are elements of confidence out there , " said the ecb chief , ahead of the annual meetings of the imf and world bank to be held this weekend in washington .
" excessive pessimism is ill advised . "
on a brighter note , the imf said falling real estate prices in europe are less likely to set off a major housing-related credit crunch than in the us .
higher savings rates , lower debt , more prudent mortgage lending and much more limited opportunities for equity withdrawal on real estate work in europe 's favor , the report said .

appeal to european policymakers still , the imf appealed to eu governments to move " toward more joint responsibility and accountability for financial stability " and urged european policymakers to make prudent choices .
" restoring confidence now requires a decisive commitment to concerted and coordinated action to alleviate financial stresses and avoid the serious risk of backtracking on european financial integration , " imf analysts said .
euro zone governments , whose deficit spending is limited by rules meant to protect the euro 's value , should focus emergency injections " on measures to stabilize the financial sector , as needed , " the report said .
eu finance ministers , scrambling to react to the spill-over , agreed tuesday to more than double the public guarantee for private bank deposits to at least 50,000 euros -lrb- $ 68,000 -rrb- .
dexia gets relief from benelux meanwhile , the governments of belgium , france and luxembourg have agreed to a plan to help the struggling bank dexia , belgium 's le soir newspaper reported thursday .

the move comes despite a 6.4 billion euro bailout package that the three governments put together for dexia last week .

" we all together call upon the market participants who are in this state of intense turbulence , we tell them to collect themselves , there are elements of confidence out there , " said the ecb chief , ahead of the annual meetings of the imf and world bank to be held this weekend in washington .
" excessive pessimism is ill advised . "
on a brighter note , the imf said falling real estate prices in europe are less likely to set off a major housing-related credit crunch than in the us .
higher savings rates , lower debt , more prudent mortgage lending and much more limited opportunities for equity withdrawal on real estate work in europe 's favor , the report said .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : prudent lending practices in europe have kept the housing market from turning upside down the downturn in residential real estate will , however , have " an appreciable short-term impact " in countries like ireland , spain and britain .
austria , germany and switzerland appear the least at risk in that respect , the imf said .
appeal to european policymakers still , the imf appealed to eu governments to move " toward more joint responsibility and accountability for financial stability " and urged european policymakers to make prudent choices .
" restoring confidence now requires a decisive commitment to concerted and coordinated action to alleviate financial stresses and avoid the serious risk of backtracking on european financial integration , " imf analysts said .
euro zone governments , whose deficit spending is limited by rules meant to protect the euro 's value , should focus emergency injections " on measures to stabilize the financial sector , as needed , " the report said .
eu finance ministers , scrambling to react to the spill-over , agreed tuesday to more than double the public guarantee for private bank deposits to at least 50,000 euros -lrb- $ 68,000 -rrb- .
dexia gets relief from benelux meanwhile , the governments of belgium , france and luxembourg have agreed to a plan to help the struggling bank dexia , belgium 's le soir newspaper reported thursday .
the plan would create a special vehicle to absorb the bank 's toxic assets and provide fresh liquidity .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : shares in dexia have fallen more than 70 percent in the last year " there will be a public guarantee from the french , belgian and luxembourg states on a maximum 4.5 billion euros that dexia is going to borrow on the market , " a source close to the luxembourg government told afp news agency .
the move comes despite a 6.4 billion euro bailout package that the three governments put together for dexia last week .
the idea of splitting the bank into national units was abandoned at talks between high-ranking officials from france , belgium and luxembourg that were being held through the night in brussels , according to le soir .
dexia 's shares rose sharply on the news , climbing 18 percent in the first 15 minutes of trading on thursday .
the franco-belgian bank is one of the top 20 banks in the euro zone , with some 5.5 million clients in belgium , france , luxembourg , slovakia and turkey . dw staff -lrb- cat -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" we need to have the opportunity to go after drug lords and drug laboratories and try and interrupt this flow of cash , " he told reporters at a two-day meeting of nato defense ministers which began thursday in budapest , hungary .
general john craddock , nato operations commander , likewise appealed to the members of the 26-nation alliance for the authority to attack laboratories , trafficking networks and drug lords in afghanistan to knock the wind out of the resurgent insurgency .
several member states remain sceptical of such a plan , however , with nations such as germany fearing any extension of nato 's role in afghanistan may lead to more violence , and , as a result , a turn of the tide of public support among afghans away from the western alliance .
gates also pushed his counterparts to increase their troop contributions in afghanistan , despite european reluctance to do so .
nato currently has a force of 50,700 soldiers in afghanistan , up from about 45,000 six months ago .
the german parliament agreed tuesday , oct .
7 to increase its contribution by 1,000 soldiers , raising its total to 4,500 .
the us contingent in afghanistan currently stands at 33,000 , including 13,000 under nato command .
georgian membership bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : saakashvili has called on nato to fulfil its pledges gates also used the first day of the budapest talks to further pitch georgian membership of nato , in spite of fierce opposition from russia and scepticism within the alliance .
" i urge our allies to support -lrb- the membership action plan -rrb- for georgia in december and to support georgia 's efforts to accomplish needed reform , " gates said alongside his georgian counterpart , davit kezerashvili , after the meeting .
nato leaders meeting in bucharest in april promised georgia it would be able to join the alliance at an unspecified future date .
but they postponed any decision on a possible membership action plan -lrb- map -rrb- until a foreign ministers ' meeting planned for december .
german chancellor angela merkel effectively blocked the map offer to georgia and ukraine in bucharest , arguing that it was too early for them to join the alliance .
“ heads of government of the alliance declared unanimously in april in bucharest that georgia should be a member of the alliance , " gates said in budapest .
" the question is whether we can get this accomplished at the foreign ministers ' meeting in december . "
kezerashvili said thursday that nato membership remained his country 's " top security priority . "

" allies agreed to have nato ships address piracy off of the coast of somalia soon , and escort world food program ships , in complementarity with other parties , for instance the eu , " a nato diplomat said during the talks .

" we need to have the opportunity to go after drug lords and drug laboratories and try and interrupt this flow of cash , " he told reporters at a two-day meeting of nato defense ministers which began thursday in budapest , hungary .
general john craddock , nato operations commander , likewise appealed to the members of the 26-nation alliance for the authority to attack laboratories , trafficking networks and drug lords in afghanistan to knock the wind out of the resurgent insurgency .
several member states remain sceptical of such a plan , however , with nations such as germany fearing any extension of nato 's role in afghanistan may lead to more violence , and , as a result , a turn of the tide of public support among afghans away from the western alliance .
gates also pushed his counterparts to increase their troop contributions in afghanistan , despite european reluctance to do so .
nato currently has a force of 50,700 soldiers in afghanistan , up from about 45,000 six months ago .
the german parliament agreed tuesday , oct .

" i urge our allies to support -lrb- the membership action plan -rrb- for georgia in december and to support georgia 's efforts to accomplish needed reform , " gates said alongside his georgian counterpart , davit kezerashvili , after the meeting .
nato leaders meeting in bucharest in april promised georgia it would be able to join the alliance at an unspecified future date .
but they postponed any decision on a possible membership action plan -lrb- map -rrb- until a foreign ministers ' meeting planned for december .
german chancellor angela merkel effectively blocked the map offer to georgia and ukraine in bucharest , arguing that it was too early for them to join the alliance .
“ heads of government of the alliance declared unanimously in april in bucharest that georgia should be a member of the alliance , " gates said in budapest .

customers who are not told about extra charges when they place their order will not have to pay those charges , says the proposal , which was issued wednesday , oct .
8 .
the retailer will also have to guarantee delivery anywhere within the eu within 30 days .
they will also have to compensate the purchaser within a week if the product is damaged or fails to arrive .
user friendly additionally , customers will have the right to a 14-day " cooling-off period , " during which they can change their minds and send the product back .
and retailers will no longer be allowed to insert clauses such as " the trader is not responsible for mistakes made by his agents " into contracts .
nor will they be allowed to pre-check boxes on online order forms that commit customers to buying extra services unless the customer unchecks the boxes .
according to figures from the commission , approximately 150 million eu citizens shop online , but only 30 million look for products in other eu member states - spending on average 800 euros -lrb- $ 1,090 -rrb- per year in the process .
fear of fraud at the same time , identical products in different member states can vary enormously in price .
an eight-gigabyte ipod nano , for example , can range in price from 169.44 euros in britain to 268.96 euros in hungary , a commission study said .
eu officials are keen to boost the volume of cross-border e-shopping in the bloc .
however , european consumers are still reluctant to buy from web sites in other countries , largely for fear of fraud .
according to the commission , the proportion of europeans shopping online rose from 23 to 30 percent between 2005 and 2008 , but the proportion of those doing so abroad rose only from 6 to 7 percent . dpa news agency -lrb- kjb -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de finance -pipe- 09.10.2008 why the eu needs to unite to fight credit crunch großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : eu member states refused a french proposed eu-wide rescue fund so far every eu nation has reacted in its own way to the international financial crisis .
christian ehler , a member of the european parliament , talks to deutsche welle about what the eu nations can do about it . deutsche welle : some eu countries have created unlimited guarantees for savings accounts .
how much sense do these unilateral actions make ?
christian ehler : i think that it certainly makes sense , in the current crisis , to regain the trust of customers by undertaking these sorts of national guarantees for bank accounts .
in the long term , of course , it is n't a solution , because you have to keep in mind that small countries , like iceland , would be completely overwhelmed if their banking sectors were to hand out such guarantees . one potential consequence has been discussed .
namely that customers would transfer their money to other countries which have wide reaching guarantees , to what extent might that result in unfair competition on the housing market ?
i believe that the current situation makes it even more important that we regain people 's trust .
out of all the parties involved , consumers are reacting the more reasonably .
nevertheless , it has to be said that consumers want to know that their money is safe in these sorts of situations .
so far it has been really important to send this signal .
in the long run that is n't a solution because it could perpetuate unfair competition .
i think that for now it 's just a temporary solution and it 's a step in the right direction wo n't the eu countries have to work together if they want a widespread rescue packet like the one in the us ?
they ca n't , plain and simple .
there are two reasons for this .
the one is money market policy .
there we have the european central bank .
that 's the biggest hero of the international finance crisis .
it was different in america , where on the one side there was the markets with liquidity , which had to ensure that the on the other side interests would n't sink too low , which brought put us in danger of inflation .
that 's what we do in money market policy because there we have a contractual basis .
when it comes to financial policy , every eu country has its own sovereignty .
they each have responsibility over their national own banking supervision .
because of that they have to take on risks nationally .
that can change when some member countries are no longer able to do that .
but just look at the reactions on sunday to the quick decisions , which were necessary in the case of hypo real estate .
the idea that 27 member countries could all agree and the idea that it would come with a high risk that some countries would be forced to come up with billions of euros to bail out a bank in greece or the netherlands does n't seem to me to be really feasible at the moment . after the mini summit over the weekend the french president , nicolas sarkozy , announced that the eu stability and growth pact will be softened .
so countries can still contract more debts .
is that a good sign ?
i not only believe that it is n't a good sign , but that it 's wrong , plain and simple .
the instuments that we have there , namely the stability and growth pact , have proven themselves reliable .
and it is clearly defined in the stability pact how much national debt a nation must have and still be able to respond in a flexible way to special situations – and the collapse of large european banks is a special situation .
but that has nothing to do with the fact that we can not and will not tolerate the relatively lax french deal with their finance policies in the stability pact .
keep this in mind : the things that are necessary for a state to intervene in order to stabilize the financial market is made possible by the stability and growth pact .
everything else is just decoration and does n't make much sense . christain ehler is an economist and member of the european parliament and sits on the finance committee . interview : guenther birkenstock -lrb- mrm -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

christian ehler , a member of the european parliament , talks to deutsche welle about what the eu nations can do about it . deutsche welle : some eu countries have created unlimited guarantees for savings accounts .
how much sense do these unilateral actions make ?
christian ehler : i think that it certainly makes sense , in the current crisis , to regain the trust of customers by undertaking these sorts of national guarantees for bank accounts .
in the long term , of course , it is n't a solution , because you have to keep in mind that small countries , like iceland , would be completely overwhelmed if their banking sectors were to hand out such guarantees . one potential consequence has been discussed .
namely that customers would transfer their money to other countries which have wide reaching guarantees , to what extent might that result in unfair competition on the housing market ?
i believe that the current situation makes it even more important that we regain people 's trust .
out of all the parties involved , consumers are reacting the more reasonably .
nevertheless , it has to be said that consumers want to know that their money is safe in these sorts of situations .
so far it has been really important to send this signal .
in the long run that is n't a solution because it could perpetuate unfair competition .
i think that for now it 's just a temporary solution and it 's a step in the right direction wo n't the eu countries have to work together if they want a widespread rescue packet like the one in the us ?
they ca n't , plain and simple .
there are two reasons for this .
the one is money market policy .
there we have the european central bank .
that 's the biggest hero of the international finance crisis .
it was different in america , where on the one side there was the markets with liquidity , which had to ensure that the on the other side interests would n't sink too low , which brought put us in danger of inflation .
that 's what we do in money market policy because there we have a contractual basis .
when it comes to financial policy , every eu country has its own sovereignty .
they each have responsibility over their national own banking supervision .
because of that they have to take on risks nationally .
that can change when some member countries are no longer able to do that .
but just look at the reactions on sunday to the quick decisions , which were necessary in the case of hypo real estate .
the idea that 27 member countries could all agree and the idea that it would come with a high risk that some countries would be forced to come up with billions of euros to bail out a bank in greece or the netherlands does n't seem to me to be really feasible at the moment . after the mini summit over the weekend the french president , nicolas sarkozy , announced that the eu stability and growth pact will be softened .
so countries can still contract more debts .
is that a good sign ?
i not only believe that it is n't a good sign , but that it 's wrong , plain and simple .
the instuments that we have there , namely the stability and growth pact , have proven themselves reliable .
and it is clearly defined in the stability pact how much national debt a nation must have and still be able to respond in a flexible way to special situations – and the collapse of large european banks is a special situation .
but that has nothing to do with the fact that we can not and will not tolerate the relatively lax french deal with their finance policies in the stability pact .
keep this in mind : the things that are necessary for a state to intervene in order to stabilize the financial market is made possible by the stability and growth pact .
everything else is just decoration and does n't make much sense . christain ehler is an economist and member of the european parliament and sits on the finance committee . interview : guenther birkenstock -lrb- mrm -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

dw summarizes europe 's recent reactions to the financial crisis . fallout from the us real-estate slump has western europe facing " extraordinary financial stress , " and unwinding european banks ' exposure " will likely be long and arduous , " the international monetary fund said on wednesday , oct .
8 . it recommended eu governments coordinate their efforts to push for responsibility and accountability in the financial sector .
imf head dominique strauss-kahn said thursday that all non-coordinated action in the european union against the financial crisis " should be avoided , if not condemned . " " restoring confidence now requires a decisive commitment to concerted and coordinated action to alleviate financial stresses and avoid the serious risk of backtracking on european financial integration , " imf analysts added . until wednesday , when central banks around the world cut main interest rates in a coordinated effort , european nations had largely been left to their own designs in terms of solving the credit crunch after a french proposal for an eu-wide fund was shot down . dw reviews recent steps european financial leaders have recently taken to stabilize markets and shore up the international banking system . germany bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hypo real estate needed to be bailed out twice before it was rescued as europe 's largest economy , germany has n't been able to avoid the global credit crunch , despite early statements from finance minister peer steinbrueck that it was an american problem . the government bailed out commercial property lender hypo real estate to the tune 35 billion euros -lrb- $ 47.9 billion -rrb- .
to keep the bank customers from running to atm machines to withdrawal their money , the federal government has also guaranteed the security of all savings . iceland the european country most dramatically affected by the financial crisis , the entire nation of iceland is threatened with bankruptcy after the extent of its involvement in the financial sector .
by oct .
10 , the reykjavik government nationalized banks the country 's three biggest banks in a moved it said was intended to guarantee a functioning banking system . suffering from a lack of funds as foreign countries stop providing iceland with loans has lead the atlantic nation to schedule negotiations with russia next week .
moscow has reportedly expressed a willingness to give iceland a 4 billion euro loan .
since the beginning of the year , iceland 's currency , the krona , has lost half its value against the euro . ireland bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : look at how far that one dropped !
dublin drew ire from the european union for its decision in late september to guarantee all deposits at its biggest banks .
several eu nations then followed ireland 's lead and took similar measures .
but experts in some european capitals were irritated that ireland acted without consulting other nations .
the irish government , however , calmed nerves somewhat by extending blanket guarantees offered to irish banks to five foreign institutions operating on the emerald isle . britain british prime minister gordon brown announced his country 's 50 billion pound bank rescue plan on wednesday .
the plan included the partial nationalization of britain 's eight main banks , 200 billion pounds in short-term loans and 250 billion pounds in inter-bank loan guarantees . " extraordinary times call for ... bold and far-reaching solutions , " brown said while introducing the package .
" the global financial market has ceased to function , putting in danger the necessary flow of money to businesses and families on which all of us depend in our daily lives . " british bank stocks , in the days before the partial nationalization , had lost nearly half their value , italy bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : tremonti said a bare-bones banking system has served italy well italian officials have said their country 's somewhat less sophosociated financial system has left it in a better position to deal with international economic turmoil . in addition to vouching for italians ' savings , economy minister giulio tremonti said rome would consider whether to come to banks ' aid on a case-by-case basis .
italian media reported that the government was setting up a 50 billion euro rescue package that would save banks if necessary . france as two of french banks engaged in merger discussions that would result in the country 's largest banking group , paris issued plans wednesday to take stakes in troubled banks to keep them from bankruptcy . prime minister francois fillon said the government would create new structures allowing it to take over at failing banks and ensure the " continuity and stability of the french banking and finance system . "
he also said paris would have no qualms about replacing managers at nationalized banks with officials who enjoyed the finance ministry 's trust . belgium bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : much of the private sector turned its back on dexia belgium turned to former prime minister jean-luc dehaene is to head the board of the struggling franco-belgian financial service group dexia .
bnp paribas exec pierre mariani is slated to serve as chief executive . the group was saved thursday when the belgian , french and luxembourg came to its rescue for the second time in two weeks by guaranteeing loans after having already partially nationalized the local credit institute .
dexia shares had lost nearly two-thirds of their value before the announcement . but dexia is n't the only benelux bank to be affected .
the netherland nationalized their portion of the former belgian-dutch insurance and banking giant fortis while france 's bnp paribas and the belgium and luxembourg governments took over the remainder of fortis ' activities . dw staff -lrb- sms -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

officially , there have been no secret talks . the afghan government is not shy to acknowledge that it tries to win over members of the armed opposition .
insurgents who accept the government ’ s proposals to cooperate politically are granted amnesty and integrated into civilian life .
one example of such a won-over insurgent is wakil ahmad muttawakil - a former taliban foreign minister who , in 2005 , even ran for parliament - albeit without success .
so when rumours started circulating that a government delegation had met members of the taliban in saudi arabia , nobody was surprised .
but the government quickly denied the rumours .
“ there were no talks and no talks have been arranged , ” said government spokesman homayoun hamidzadeh .
“ but president karzai has always said that he is involved in talks with the saudi king to clarify whether he could play a mediating role in the peace process in afghanistan .
the afghan side would warmly welcome any progress in this matter and then take part in talks . ”
informal meeting of enormous import however , independent observers tell a different story .
it would seem that , at a recent festive supper held by saudi king abdullah in mecca , a group of afghan mps and government officials met a taliban representative and also envoys of gulbuddin hekmatyar , the head of the afghanistan islamic party .
although the afghan delegation did not have an official mandate , the informal meeting still has enormous political import .
it means that if talks were to become possible in the future thanks to saudi mediation , a taliban spokesman , who has claimed responsibility for a series of terrorist attacks , would become an acceptable political partner in kabul .
citha maass , from the german institute for international and security affairs , was not surprised to hear about the talks : “ there have been suggestions of secret negotiations for some time now .
it is increasingly clear that the insurgency can not be fought only with military means . ”
pre-election strategy maass also thought that president karzai was thinking strategically , ahead of next year ’ s elections .
he needs to secure votes in the volatile eastern and southern provinces of afghanistan .
although he was elected with about 55 percent of the votes four years ago , his popularity ratings have sunk to 17 percent .
“ if there are secret negotiations and the taliban agree not to disrupt the election process , then a political price will have to be paid .
this would likely entail that afghanistan ’ s political process stray even further away from democracy , ” said maass .

according to a press report released earlier in the day , turbulence on equity markets caused by the international financial crisis prompted the delay of the sale of a 24.9 percent stake , in what is set to be the last major privatisation in europe 's biggest economy .
deutsche bahn was to list a 24.9 percent stake in its freight and passenger unit on the stock market on october 27 .
but unnamed financial sources quoted by the financial times deutschland 's online edition said the initial public offering -lrb- ipo -rrb- will now not take place until november at the earliest .
the government was hoping to generate some five or six billion euros -lrb- seven or eight billion dollars -rrb- from the sale and chief executive hartmut mehdorn had already begun talking to potential investors in london and moscow , the ftd said .
however , there have been sharp falls in stock markets in recent days due to the international financial crisis .
the government is now worried that it would not get as much money as it hoped and that it would be better to wait for markets to recover .
german finance minister peer steinbrueck conceded on monday that the turbulence might force the listing to be postponed .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de finance -pipe- 09.10.2008 europe is heading toward recession , says imf großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : despite appeals to optimism , recession could hit europe europe is nearing recession and its banking system faces " extraordinary financial stress " that will not ease quickly , the imf said as the benelux countries agreed thursday to absorb flailing bank dexia 's toxic assets . economic growth in the 15 countries using the euro is facing a slump , decreasing from an average 1.3 percent this year to 0.2 percent in 2009 ; unemployment will increase from 7.6 percent to 8.3 percent , an imf report said wednesday , oct .
8 .
imf analysts also predicted that germany , europe 's largest economy , will stall in 2009 and france 's will grow by a marginal 0.2 percent .
italy and spain will see their economies shrink by 0.2 percent , according to the semi-annual world economic outlook .
with european nations " moving close to or into recession , " the imf urged forceful action by policymakers to combat the crisis with measures such as lower interest rates .
ecb chief : " collect yourselves " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : wall street dropped even after the fed announced interest rate cuts hours before the report 's release , the european central bank and the us federal reserve led key central banks in a coordinated emergency cut in benchmark rates by 0.5 percentage points .
european central bank chief jean-claude trichet called the move " a significant signal of confidence to the markets . "
speaking on france 3 television , he told viewers , " we can say to the markets we have regained control over price stability in the medium term . "
markets continued to fall nevertheless , with wall street down more than two percent , london and frankfurt more than five percent , and paris more than six percent .
" we all together call upon the market participants who are in this state of intense turbulence , we tell them to collect themselves , there are elements of confidence out there , " said the ecb chief , ahead of the annual meetings of the imf and world bank to be held this weekend in washington .
" excessive pessimism is ill advised . "
on a brighter note , the imf said falling real estate prices in europe are less likely to set off a major housing-related credit crunch than in the us .
higher savings rates , lower debt , more prudent mortgage lending and much more limited opportunities for equity withdrawal on real estate work in europe 's favor , the report said .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : prudent lending practices in europe have kept the housing market from turning upside down the downturn in residential real estate will , however , have " an appreciable short-term impact " in countries like ireland , spain and britain .
austria , germany and switzerland appear the least at risk in that respect , the imf said .
appeal to european policymakers still , the imf appealed to eu governments to move " toward more joint responsibility and accountability for financial stability " and urged european policymakers to make prudent choices .
" restoring confidence now requires a decisive commitment to concerted and coordinated action to alleviate financial stresses and avoid the serious risk of backtracking on european financial integration , " imf analysts said .
euro zone governments , whose deficit spending is limited by rules meant to protect the euro 's value , should focus emergency injections " on measures to stabilize the financial sector , as needed , " the report said .
eu finance ministers , scrambling to react to the spill-over , agreed tuesday to more than double the public guarantee for private bank deposits to at least 50,000 euros -lrb- $ 68,000 -rrb- .
dexia gets relief from benelux meanwhile , the governments of belgium , france and luxembourg have agreed to a plan to help the struggling bank dexia , belgium 's le soir newspaper reported thursday .
the plan would create a special vehicle to absorb the bank 's toxic assets and provide fresh liquidity .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : shares in dexia have fallen more than 70 percent in the last year " there will be a public guarantee from the french , belgian and luxembourg states on a maximum 4.5 billion euros that dexia is going to borrow on the market , " a source close to the luxembourg government told afp news agency .
the move comes despite a 6.4 billion euro bailout package that the three governments put together for dexia last week .
the idea of splitting the bank into national units was abandoned at talks between high-ranking officials from france , belgium and luxembourg that were being held through the night in brussels , according to le soir .
dexia 's shares rose sharply on the news , climbing 18 percent in the first 15 minutes of trading on thursday .
the franco-belgian bank is one of the top 20 banks in the euro zone , with some 5.5 million clients in belgium , france , luxembourg , slovakia and turkey . dw staff -lrb- cat -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

he said a soccer club 's identity was firmly connected not only to its location and fans , but also to its owners and players , and that if neither of the latter exhibited any resemblance to either of the former , then that was a recipe for the loss of soccer individuality and uniqueness .
" do you want in liverpool an arab sheikh as president with one brazilian coach and nine or 11 african players ?
" where is liverpool in that ?
we have to make some rules .

football is a game and this game has become popular because of the identity .
you have to have identity .

" in some countries like germany and switzerland , stronger requirements are put on clubs in terms of bank guarantees and having no negative equity .
these are the models we have to look at . "
on tuesday , the chairman of england 's football association , lord david triesman , put the combined debt of english clubs at around 3 billion pounds .
he warned of " very tangible dangers " to large clubs such as liverpool , manchester united and chelsea in the current uncertain financial times . dw staff -lrb- dfm -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" do you want in liverpool an arab sheikh as president with one brazilian coach and nine or 11 african players ?
" where is liverpool in that ?
we have to make some rules .
" what is football ?
football is a game and this game has become popular because of the identity .
you have to have identity .
that is where football 's popularity lies . "
platini , a former french national team midfield magician , said he would investigate the possibility of regulating foreign ownership of clubs across europe , but admitted that varying european national constitutions would be a substantial hurdle to overcome in that quest .
football debt to be examined bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : playing rosters are pushing english clubs into record levels of debt a top uefa official said wednesday that the financial requirements model used for teams in the german and swiss national leagues was viable for use as the basis for a europe-wide system to regulate club debt .
david taylor , uefa general secretary , told a conference in london that the european soccer body would launch talks next week on potential changes to the way clubs are licensed with the aim of reviewing how they run their finances .
several clubs , notably from england , dominate european competitions , believed possible because of the exorbitant debts they all shoulder .
" we can not let things stay as they are , " taylor said .
" in some countries like germany and switzerland , stronger requirements are put on clubs in terms of bank guarantees and having no negative equity .
these are the models we have to look at . "
on tuesday , the chairman of england 's football association , lord david triesman , put the combined debt of english clubs at around 3 billion pounds .
he warned of " very tangible dangers " to large clubs such as liverpool , manchester united and chelsea in the current uncertain financial times . dw staff -lrb- dfm -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

according to a press report released earlier in the day , turbulence on equity markets caused by the international financial crisis prompted the delay of the sale of a 24.9 percent stake , in what is set to be the last major privatisation in europe 's biggest economy .
deutsche bahn was to list a 24.9 percent stake in its freight and passenger unit on the stock market on october 27 .
but unnamed financial sources quoted by the financial times deutschland 's online edition said the initial public offering -lrb- ipo -rrb- will now not take place until november at the earliest .
the government was hoping to generate some five or six billion euros -lrb- seven or eight billion dollars -rrb- from the sale and chief executive hartmut mehdorn had already begun talking to potential investors in london and moscow , the ftd said .
however , there have been sharp falls in stock markets in recent days due to the international financial crisis .
the government is now worried that it would not get as much money as it hoped and that it would be better to wait for markets to recover .
german finance minister peer steinbrueck conceded on monday that the turbulence might force the listing to be postponed .

" we need to have the opportunity to go after drug lords and drug laboratories and try and interrupt this flow of cash , " he told reporters at a two-day meeting of nato defense ministers which began thursday in budapest , hungary .
general john craddock , nato operations commander , likewise appealed to the members of the 26-nation alliance for the authority to attack laboratories , trafficking networks and drug lords in afghanistan to knock the wind out of the resurgent insurgency .
several member states remain sceptical of such a plan , however , with nations such as germany fearing any extension of nato 's role in afghanistan may lead to more violence , and , as a result , a turn of the tide of public support among afghans away from the western alliance .
gates also pushed his counterparts to increase their troop contributions in afghanistan , despite european reluctance to do so .
nato currently has a force of 50,700 soldiers in afghanistan , up from about 45,000 six months ago .
the german parliament agreed tuesday , oct .
7 to increase its contribution by 1,000 soldiers , raising its total to 4,500 .
the us contingent in afghanistan currently stands at 33,000 , including 13,000 under nato command .
georgian membership bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : saakashvili has called on nato to fulfil its pledges gates also used the first day of the budapest talks to further pitch georgian membership of nato , in spite of fierce opposition from russia and scepticism within the alliance .
" i urge our allies to support -lrb- the membership action plan -rrb- for georgia in december and to support georgia 's efforts to accomplish needed reform , " gates said alongside his georgian counterpart , davit kezerashvili , after the meeting .
nato leaders meeting in bucharest in april promised georgia it would be able to join the alliance at an unspecified future date .
but they postponed any decision on a possible membership action plan -lrb- map -rrb- until a foreign ministers ' meeting planned for december .
german chancellor angela merkel effectively blocked the map offer to georgia and ukraine in bucharest , arguing that it was too early for them to join the alliance .
“ heads of government of the alliance declared unanimously in april in bucharest that georgia should be a member of the alliance , " gates said in budapest .
" the question is whether we can get this accomplished at the foreign ministers ' meeting in december . "
kezerashvili said thursday that nato membership remained his country 's " top security priority . "

" allies agreed to have nato ships address piracy off of the coast of somalia soon , and escort world food program ships , in complementarity with other parties , for instance the eu , " a nato diplomat said during the talks .

" we need to have the opportunity to go after drug lords and drug laboratories and try and interrupt this flow of cash , " he told reporters at a two-day meeting of nato defense ministers which began thursday in budapest , hungary .
general john craddock , nato operations commander , likewise appealed to the members of the 26-nation alliance for the authority to attack laboratories , trafficking networks and drug lords in afghanistan to knock the wind out of the resurgent insurgency .
several member states remain sceptical of such a plan , however , with nations such as germany fearing any extension of nato 's role in afghanistan may lead to more violence , and , as a result , a turn of the tide of public support among afghans away from the western alliance .
gates also pushed his counterparts to increase their troop contributions in afghanistan , despite european reluctance to do so .
nato currently has a force of 50,700 soldiers in afghanistan , up from about 45,000 six months ago .
the german parliament agreed tuesday , oct .
7 to increase its contribution by 1,000 soldiers , raising its total to 4,500 .
the us contingent in afghanistan currently stands at 33,000 , including 13,000 under nato command .
georgian membership bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : saakashvili has called on nato to fulfil its pledges gates also used the first day of the budapest talks to further pitch georgian membership of nato , in spite of fierce opposition from russia and scepticism within the alliance .
" i urge our allies to support -lrb- the membership action plan -rrb- for georgia in december and to support georgia 's efforts to accomplish needed reform , " gates said alongside his georgian counterpart , davit kezerashvili , after the meeting .
nato leaders meeting in bucharest in april promised georgia it would be able to join the alliance at an unspecified future date .
but they postponed any decision on a possible membership action plan -lrb- map -rrb- until a foreign ministers ' meeting planned for december .
german chancellor angela merkel effectively blocked the map offer to georgia and ukraine in bucharest , arguing that it was too early for them to join the alliance .
“ heads of government of the alliance declared unanimously in april in bucharest that georgia should be a member of the alliance , " gates said in budapest .
" the question is whether we can get this accomplished at the foreign ministers ' meeting in december . "
kezerashvili said thursday that nato membership remained his country 's " top security priority . "
somali piracy bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : somali pirates have seized some 32 vessels this year also to come from the meeting were pledges to combat piracy off the coast of somalia , where a plethora of attacks and vessel hijackings have caused millions of dollars in losses , led to the kidnapping of innocent seafarers and pushed up insurance costs for boats sailing near the lawless east african country .
" allies agreed to have nato ships address piracy off of the coast of somalia soon , and escort world food program ships , in complementarity with other parties , for instance the eu , " a nato diplomat said during the talks .
as many as nine eu nations could take part in the maritime operation , including belgium , cyprus , france , germany , lithuania , the netherlands , spain , sweden and possibly britain . dw staff -lrb- dfm -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" we need to have the opportunity to go after drug lords and drug laboratories and try and interrupt this flow of cash , " he told reporters at a two-day meeting of nato defense ministers which began thursday in budapest , hungary .
general john craddock , nato operations commander , likewise appealed to the members of the 26-nation alliance for the authority to attack laboratories , trafficking networks and drug lords in afghanistan to knock the wind out of the resurgent insurgency .
several member states remain sceptical of such a plan , however , with nations such as germany fearing any extension of nato 's role in afghanistan may lead to more violence , and , as a result , a turn of the tide of public support among afghans away from the western alliance .
gates also pushed his counterparts to increase their troop contributions in afghanistan , despite european reluctance to do so .
nato currently has a force of 50,700 soldiers in afghanistan , up from about 45,000 six months ago .
the german parliament agreed tuesday , oct .

nato leaders meeting in bucharest in april promised georgia it would be able to join the alliance at an unspecified future date .
but they postponed any decision on a possible membership action plan -lrb- map -rrb- until a foreign ministers ' meeting planned for december .
german chancellor angela merkel effectively blocked the map offer to georgia and ukraine in bucharest , arguing that it was too early for them to join the alliance .
“ heads of government of the alliance declared unanimously in april in bucharest that georgia should be a member of the alliance , " gates said in budapest .

" we need to have the opportunity to go after drug lords and drug laboratories and try and interrupt this flow of cash , " he told reporters at a two-day meeting of nato defense ministers which began thursday in budapest , hungary .
general john craddock , nato operations commander , likewise appealed to the members of the 26-nation alliance for the authority to attack laboratories , trafficking networks and drug lords in afghanistan to knock the wind out of the resurgent insurgency .
several member states remain sceptical of such a plan , however , with nations such as germany fearing any extension of nato 's role in afghanistan may lead to more violence , and , as a result , a turn of the tide of public support among afghans away from the western alliance .
gates also pushed his counterparts to increase their troop contributions in afghanistan , despite european reluctance to do so .
nato currently has a force of 50,700 soldiers in afghanistan , up from about 45,000 six months ago .
the german parliament agreed tuesday , oct .
7 to increase its contribution by 1,000 soldiers , raising its total to 4,500 .
the us contingent in afghanistan currently stands at 33,000 , including 13,000 under nato command .

" i urge our allies to support -lrb- the membership action plan -rrb- for georgia in december and to support georgia 's efforts to accomplish needed reform , " gates said alongside his georgian counterpart , davit kezerashvili , after the meeting .
nato leaders meeting in bucharest in april promised georgia it would be able to join the alliance at an unspecified future date .
but they postponed any decision on a possible membership action plan -lrb- map -rrb- until a foreign ministers ' meeting planned for december .
german chancellor angela merkel effectively blocked the map offer to georgia and ukraine in bucharest , arguing that it was too early for them to join the alliance .
“ heads of government of the alliance declared unanimously in april in bucharest that georgia should be a member of the alliance , " gates said in budapest .

despite his confidence in germany 's current soundness , the minister said that financial markets the world over , germany 's included , were still operating under a dense cloud of uncertainty and that he could not guarantee against any future nationalization plans for the nation 's banks .
" so far i do n't see the need for state takeovers in germany .
the german banking sector has been hit badly by the financial crisis but less hard " than in other countries , steinbrueck told the handelsblatt daily .
" but this might change as uncertainties about future developments are currently much too high , " he said as quoted by the paper .
the german government , together with banks and insurance companies , agreed late sunday , sept .
5 on a 50-billion-euro -lrb- $ 68 billion -rrb- deal to bail out the country 's stricken commercial property lender , hypo real estate .
steinbrueck said the german economy had been hit harder than previously expected , an impact which will leave its mark on the nation 's growth rate , slated to hover at between zero and 0.5 percent next year , down from the current forecast of 1.2 percent for 2009 .

" our forecast of 1.2 percent growth in 2009 will be revised down , " ecb board member lorenzo bini smaghi told the italian financial daily il sole 24 ore without citing the new figure .
the central bank had already down-scaled its previous eurozone growth forecast of 1.5 percent last month .
" the second quarter -lrb- 2008 -rrb- was negative , and the third may be as well .
there 's a risk of more or less zero growth for several quarters , " bini smaghi said .
" it will depend a lot on the positive impact that will come from lowering interest rates , from a more competitive euro and especially from a sharp drop in prices of raw materials . "
wednesday saw a coordinated effort by central banks around the world to cut interest rates as a joint response to the global financial crisis .
the ecb dropped its interest rate to 3.75 percent . the decision was taken in coordination with central banks in britain , canada , sweden , switzerland and the united states , the ecb said in a statement .

topolanek specifically slammed several eu members for providing unlimited bank deposit protection , calling it " a shameless step " that boosts liquidity in those countries at the expense of others .
" all these measures are absolutely artificial .
they contradict the eu 's substance , " news agency ctk quoted him as saying late wednesday during a visit to turkey .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de europe -pipe- 09.10.2008 europeans fight financial crisis together and alone großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : european governments have all started work on securing their banking sectors credits , guarantees , nationalization and rescue plans are some of the steps world leaders have taken to stabilize banks and stock markets .
dw summarizes europe 's recent reactions to the financial crisis . fallout from the us real-estate slump has western europe facing " extraordinary financial stress , " and unwinding european banks ' exposure " will likely be long and arduous , " the international monetary fund said on wednesday , oct .
8 . it recommended eu governments coordinate their efforts to push for responsibility and accountability in the financial sector .
imf head dominique strauss-kahn said thursday that all non-coordinated action in the european union against the financial crisis " should be avoided , if not condemned . " " restoring confidence now requires a decisive commitment to concerted and coordinated action to alleviate financial stresses and avoid the serious risk of backtracking on european financial integration , " imf analysts added . until wednesday , when central banks around the world cut main interest rates in a coordinated effort , european nations had largely been left to their own designs in terms of solving the credit crunch after a french proposal for an eu-wide fund was shot down . dw reviews recent steps european financial leaders have recently taken to stabilize markets and shore up the international banking system . germany bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hypo real estate needed to be bailed out twice before it was rescued as europe 's largest economy , germany has n't been able to avoid the global credit crunch , despite early statements from finance minister peer steinbrueck that it was an american problem . the government bailed out commercial property lender hypo real estate to the tune 35 billion euros -lrb- $ 47.9 billion -rrb- .
to keep the bank customers from running to atm machines to withdrawal their money , the federal government has also guaranteed the security of all savings . iceland the european country most dramatically affected by the financial crisis , the entire nation of iceland is threatened with bankruptcy after the extent of its involvement in the financial sector .
by oct .
10 , the reykjavik government nationalized banks the country 's three biggest banks in a moved it said was intended to guarantee a functioning banking system . suffering from a lack of funds as foreign countries stop providing iceland with loans has lead the atlantic nation to schedule negotiations with russia next week .
moscow has reportedly expressed a willingness to give iceland a 4 billion euro loan .
since the beginning of the year , iceland 's currency , the krona , has lost half its value against the euro . ireland bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : look at how far that one dropped !
dublin drew ire from the european union for its decision in late september to guarantee all deposits at its biggest banks .
several eu nations then followed ireland 's lead and took similar measures .
but experts in some european capitals were irritated that ireland acted without consulting other nations .
the irish government , however , calmed nerves somewhat by extending blanket guarantees offered to irish banks to five foreign institutions operating on the emerald isle . britain british prime minister gordon brown announced his country 's 50 billion pound bank rescue plan on wednesday .
the plan included the partial nationalization of britain 's eight main banks , 200 billion pounds in short-term loans and 250 billion pounds in inter-bank loan guarantees . " extraordinary times call for ... bold and far-reaching solutions , " brown said while introducing the package .
" the global financial market has ceased to function , putting in danger the necessary flow of money to businesses and families on which all of us depend in our daily lives . " british bank stocks , in the days before the partial nationalization , had lost nearly half their value , italy bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : tremonti said a bare-bones banking system has served italy well italian officials have said their country 's somewhat less sophosociated financial system has left it in a better position to deal with international economic turmoil . in addition to vouching for italians ' savings , economy minister giulio tremonti said rome would consider whether to come to banks ' aid on a case-by-case basis .

officials said they had sealed off the farm and planned to slaughter the whole flock of ducks at goerlitz , near the polish border .
the property contains more than 1,000 birds , mainly turkeys and geese .
germany 's national animal health laboratory on the baltic island of riems said the find was " somewhat surprising " as the infection alert had been reduced to moderate after an outbreak was beaten last december .
then , officials launched the largest-ever bird cull in germany , exterminating a massive 160,000 geese over a weekend in wachenroth , bavaria .
it remained unknown what proportion of wild birds in germany were infected , a spokeswoman said .
none of germany 's neighbours are currently reporting any h5n1 detections , with the virus having recently shown up in asia , from which scientists believe it had earlier spread to both europe and africa with migratory wild birds .
the virus can be deadly for humans if hygienic precautions are not followed .
human-to-human transmission of the virus has only occurred in very isolated cases and chiefly in asia .
scientists fear the virus could mutate into an easily transmittable human disease causing a pandemic .
the h5n1 strain of the bird flu virus has killed more than 200 people worldwide since 2003 .
bird flu variations in august , us scientists raised the prospect that a bird flu strain other than h5n1 could mutate to infect humans .
" since their introduction into land-based birds in 1988 , h9n2 avian influenza a viruses have caused multiple human infections and become endemic in domestic poultry in eurasia , " a study published in the journal of the public library of science had said .
" this particular influenza subtype has been evolving and acquiring characteristics that raise concerns that it may become more transmissible among humans .
" our results suggest that the establishment and prevalence of h9n2 viruses in poultry pose a significant threat for humans . " dw staff -lrb- dfm -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

france also reported new cases and upped its own alert .
-lrb- 06.07.2007 -rrb- bird flu cases confirmed in southern germany the deadly strain of the bird flu virus has resurfaced in germany in at least three birds the state of bavaria .
they are germany 's first confirmed cases this year .

christian ehler , a member of the european parliament , talks to deutsche welle about what the eu nations can do about it . deutsche welle : some eu countries have created unlimited guarantees for savings accounts .
how much sense do these unilateral actions make ?
christian ehler : i think that it certainly makes sense , in the current crisis , to regain the trust of customers by undertaking these sorts of national guarantees for bank accounts .
in the long term , of course , it is n't a solution , because you have to keep in mind that small countries , like iceland , would be completely overwhelmed if their banking sectors were to hand out such guarantees . one potential consequence has been discussed .
namely that customers would transfer their money to other countries which have wide reaching guarantees , to what extent might that result in unfair competition on the housing market ?
i believe that the current situation makes it even more important that we regain people 's trust .
out of all the parties involved , consumers are reacting the more reasonably .
nevertheless , it has to be said that consumers want to know that their money is safe in these sorts of situations .
so far it has been really important to send this signal .
in the long run that is n't a solution because it could perpetuate unfair competition .
i think that for now it 's just a temporary solution and it 's a step in the right direction wo n't the eu countries have to work together if they want a widespread rescue packet like the one in the us ?
they ca n't , plain and simple .
there are two reasons for this .
the one is money market policy .
there we have the european central bank .
that 's the biggest hero of the international finance crisis .
it was different in america , where on the one side there was the markets with liquidity , which had to ensure that the on the other side interests would n't sink too low , which brought put us in danger of inflation .
that 's what we do in money market policy because there we have a contractual basis .
when it comes to financial policy , every eu country has its own sovereignty .
they each have responsibility over their national own banking supervision .
because of that they have to take on risks nationally .
that can change when some member countries are no longer able to do that .
but just look at the reactions on sunday to the quick decisions , which were necessary in the case of hypo real estate .
the idea that 27 member countries could all agree and the idea that it would come with a high risk that some countries would be forced to come up with billions of euros to bail out a bank in greece or the netherlands does n't seem to me to be really feasible at the moment . after the mini summit over the weekend the french president , nicolas sarkozy , announced that the eu stability and growth pact will be softened .
so countries can still contract more debts .
is that a good sign ?
i not only believe that it is n't a good sign , but that it 's wrong , plain and simple .
the instuments that we have there , namely the stability and growth pact , have proven themselves reliable .
and it is clearly defined in the stability pact how much national debt a nation must have and still be able to respond in a flexible way to special situations – and the collapse of large european banks is a special situation .
but that has nothing to do with the fact that we can not and will not tolerate the relatively lax french deal with their finance policies in the stability pact .
keep this in mind : the things that are necessary for a state to intervene in order to stabilize the financial market is made possible by the stability and growth pact .
everything else is just decoration and does n't make much sense . christain ehler is an economist and member of the european parliament and sits on the finance committee . interview : guenther birkenstock -lrb- mrm -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

christian ehler , a member of the european parliament , talks to deutsche welle about what the eu nations can do about it . deutsche welle : some eu countries have created unlimited guarantees for savings accounts .
how much sense do these unilateral actions make ?
christian ehler : i think that it certainly makes sense , in the current crisis , to regain the trust of customers by undertaking these sorts of national guarantees for bank accounts .
in the long term , of course , it is n't a solution , because you have to keep in mind that small countries , like iceland , would be completely overwhelmed if their banking sectors were to hand out such guarantees . one potential consequence has been discussed .
namely that customers would transfer their money to other countries which have wide reaching guarantees , to what extent might that result in unfair competition on the housing market ?
i believe that the current situation makes it even more important that we regain people 's trust .
out of all the parties involved , consumers are reacting the more reasonably .
nevertheless , it has to be said that consumers want to know that their money is safe in these sorts of situations .
so far it has been really important to send this signal .
in the long run that is n't a solution because it could perpetuate unfair competition .
i think that for now it 's just a temporary solution and it 's a step in the right direction wo n't the eu countries have to work together if they want a widespread rescue packet like the one in the us ?
they ca n't , plain and simple .
there are two reasons for this .
the one is money market policy .
there we have the european central bank .
that 's the biggest hero of the international finance crisis .
it was different in america , where on the one side there was the markets with liquidity , which had to ensure that the on the other side interests would n't sink too low , which brought put us in danger of inflation .
that 's what we do in money market policy because there we have a contractual basis .
when it comes to financial policy , every eu country has its own sovereignty .
they each have responsibility over their national own banking supervision .
because of that they have to take on risks nationally .
that can change when some member countries are no longer able to do that .
but just look at the reactions on sunday to the quick decisions , which were necessary in the case of hypo real estate .
the idea that 27 member countries could all agree and the idea that it would come with a high risk that some countries would be forced to come up with billions of euros to bail out a bank in greece or the netherlands does n't seem to me to be really feasible at the moment . after the mini summit over the weekend the french president , nicolas sarkozy , announced that the eu stability and growth pact will be softened .
so countries can still contract more debts .
is that a good sign ?
i not only believe that it is n't a good sign , but that it 's wrong , plain and simple .
the instuments that we have there , namely the stability and growth pact , have proven themselves reliable .
and it is clearly defined in the stability pact how much national debt a nation must have and still be able to respond in a flexible way to special situations – and the collapse of large european banks is a special situation .
but that has nothing to do with the fact that we can not and will not tolerate the relatively lax french deal with their finance policies in the stability pact .
keep this in mind : the things that are necessary for a state to intervene in order to stabilize the financial market is made possible by the stability and growth pact .
everything else is just decoration and does n't make much sense . christain ehler is an economist and member of the european parliament and sits on the finance committee . interview : guenther birkenstock -lrb- mrm -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

officials said they had sealed off the farm and planned to slaughter the whole flock of ducks at goerlitz , near the polish border .

germany 's national animal health laboratory on the baltic island of riems said the find was " somewhat surprising " as the infection alert had been reduced to moderate after an outbreak was beaten last december .

officials said they had sealed off the farm and planned to slaughter the whole flock of ducks at goerlitz , near the polish border .
the property contains more than 1,000 birds , mainly turkeys and geese .
germany 's national animal health laboratory on the baltic island of riems said the find was " somewhat surprising " as the infection alert had been reduced to moderate after an outbreak was beaten last december .
then , officials launched the largest-ever bird cull in germany , exterminating a massive 160,000 geese over a weekend in wachenroth , bavaria .
it remained unknown what proportion of wild birds in germany were infected , a spokeswoman said .
none of germany 's neighbours are currently reporting any h5n1 detections , with the virus having recently shown up in asia , from which scientists believe it had earlier spread to both europe and africa with migratory wild birds .
the virus can be deadly for humans if hygienic precautions are not followed .
human-to-human transmission of the virus has only occurred in very isolated cases and chiefly in asia .
scientists fear the virus could mutate into an easily transmittable human disease causing a pandemic .
the h5n1 strain of the bird flu virus has killed more than 200 people worldwide since 2003 .
bird flu variations in august , us scientists raised the prospect that a bird flu strain other than h5n1 could mutate to infect humans .
" since their introduction into land-based birds in 1988 , h9n2 avian influenza a viruses have caused multiple human infections and become endemic in domestic poultry in eurasia , " a study published in the journal of the public library of science had said .
" this particular influenza subtype has been evolving and acquiring characteristics that raise concerns that it may become more transmissible among humans .
" our results suggest that the establishment and prevalence of h9n2 viruses in poultry pose a significant threat for humans . " dw staff -lrb- dfm -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de finance -pipe- 09.10.2008 why the eu needs to unite to fight credit crunch großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : eu member states refused a french proposed eu-wide rescue fund so far every eu nation has reacted in its own way to the international financial crisis .
christian ehler , a member of the european parliament , talks to deutsche welle about what the eu nations can do about it . deutsche welle : some eu countries have created unlimited guarantees for savings accounts .
how much sense do these unilateral actions make ?
christian ehler : i think that it certainly makes sense , in the current crisis , to regain the trust of customers by undertaking these sorts of national guarantees for bank accounts .
in the long term , of course , it is n't a solution , because you have to keep in mind that small countries , like iceland , would be completely overwhelmed if their banking sectors were to hand out such guarantees . one potential consequence has been discussed .
namely that customers would transfer their money to other countries which have wide reaching guarantees , to what extent might that result in unfair competition on the housing market ?
i believe that the current situation makes it even more important that we regain people 's trust .
out of all the parties involved , consumers are reacting the more reasonably .
nevertheless , it has to be said that consumers want to know that their money is safe in these sorts of situations .
so far it has been really important to send this signal .
in the long run that is n't a solution because it could perpetuate unfair competition .
i think that for now it 's just a temporary solution and it 's a step in the right direction wo n't the eu countries have to work together if they want a widespread rescue packet like the one in the us ?
they ca n't , plain and simple .
there are two reasons for this .
the one is money market policy .
there we have the european central bank .
that 's the biggest hero of the international finance crisis .
it was different in america , where on the one side there was the markets with liquidity , which had to ensure that the on the other side interests would n't sink too low , which brought put us in danger of inflation .
that 's what we do in money market policy because there we have a contractual basis .
when it comes to financial policy , every eu country has its own sovereignty .
they each have responsibility over their national own banking supervision .
because of that they have to take on risks nationally .
that can change when some member countries are no longer able to do that .
but just look at the reactions on sunday to the quick decisions , which were necessary in the case of hypo real estate .
the idea that 27 member countries could all agree and the idea that it would come with a high risk that some countries would be forced to come up with billions of euros to bail out a bank in greece or the netherlands does n't seem to me to be really feasible at the moment . after the mini summit over the weekend the french president , nicolas sarkozy , announced that the eu stability and growth pact will be softened .
so countries can still contract more debts .
is that a good sign ?
i not only believe that it is n't a good sign , but that it 's wrong , plain and simple .
the instuments that we have there , namely the stability and growth pact , have proven themselves reliable .
and it is clearly defined in the stability pact how much national debt a nation must have and still be able to respond in a flexible way to special situations – and the collapse of large european banks is a special situation .
but that has nothing to do with the fact that we can not and will not tolerate the relatively lax french deal with their finance policies in the stability pact .
keep this in mind : the things that are necessary for a state to intervene in order to stabilize the financial market is made possible by the stability and growth pact .
everything else is just decoration and does n't make much sense . christain ehler is an economist and member of the european parliament and sits on the finance committee . interview : guenther birkenstock -lrb- mrm -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de finance -pipe- 09.10.2008 europe is heading toward recession , says imf großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : despite appeals to optimism , recession could hit europe europe is nearing recession and its banking system faces " extraordinary financial stress " that will not ease quickly , the imf said as the benelux countries agreed thursday to absorb flailing bank dexia 's toxic assets . economic growth in the 15 countries using the euro is facing a slump , decreasing from an average 1.3 percent this year to 0.2 percent in 2009 ; unemployment will increase from 7.6 percent to 8.3 percent , an imf report said wednesday , oct .
8 .
imf analysts also predicted that germany , europe 's largest economy , will stall in 2009 and france 's will grow by a marginal 0.2 percent .
italy and spain will see their economies shrink by 0.2 percent , according to the semi-annual world economic outlook .
with european nations " moving close to or into recession , " the imf urged forceful action by policymakers to combat the crisis with measures such as lower interest rates .
ecb chief : " collect yourselves " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : wall street dropped even after the fed announced interest rate cuts hours before the report 's release , the european central bank and the us federal reserve led key central banks in a coordinated emergency cut in benchmark rates by 0.5 percentage points .
european central bank chief jean-claude trichet called the move " a significant signal of confidence to the markets . "
speaking on france 3 television , he told viewers , " we can say to the markets we have regained control over price stability in the medium term . "
markets continued to fall nevertheless , with wall street down more than two percent , london and frankfurt more than five percent , and paris more than six percent .
" we all together call upon the market participants who are in this state of intense turbulence , we tell them to collect themselves , there are elements of confidence out there , " said the ecb chief , ahead of the annual meetings of the imf and world bank to be held this weekend in washington .
" excessive pessimism is ill advised . "
on a brighter note , the imf said falling real estate prices in europe are less likely to set off a major housing-related credit crunch than in the us .
higher savings rates , lower debt , more prudent mortgage lending and much more limited opportunities for equity withdrawal on real estate work in europe 's favor , the report said .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : prudent lending practices in europe have kept the housing market from turning upside down the downturn in residential real estate will , however , have " an appreciable short-term impact " in countries like ireland , spain and britain .
austria , germany and switzerland appear the least at risk in that respect , the imf said .
appeal to european policymakers still , the imf appealed to eu governments to move " toward more joint responsibility and accountability for financial stability " and urged european policymakers to make prudent choices .
" restoring confidence now requires a decisive commitment to concerted and coordinated action to alleviate financial stresses and avoid the serious risk of backtracking on european financial integration , " imf analysts said .
euro zone governments , whose deficit spending is limited by rules meant to protect the euro 's value , should focus emergency injections " on measures to stabilize the financial sector , as needed , " the report said .

according to a press report released earlier in the day , turbulence on equity markets caused by the international financial crisis prompted the delay of the sale of a 24.9 percent stake , in what is set to be the last major privatisation in europe 's biggest economy .
deutsche bahn was to list a 24.9 percent stake in its freight and passenger unit on the stock market on october 27 .
but unnamed financial sources quoted by the financial times deutschland 's online edition said the initial public offering -lrb- ipo -rrb- will now not take place until november at the earliest .
the government was hoping to generate some five or six billion euros -lrb- seven or eight billion dollars -rrb- from the sale and chief executive hartmut mehdorn had already begun talking to potential investors in london and moscow , the ftd said .
however , there have been sharp falls in stock markets in recent days due to the international financial crisis .
the government is now worried that it would not get as much money as it hoped and that it would be better to wait for markets to recover .
german finance minister peer steinbrueck conceded on monday that the turbulence might force the listing to be postponed .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de asia -pipe- 09.10.2008 negotiating with the taliban großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : former taliban foreign minister wakil ahmad muttawakil was " won over " by the kabul government as western military officials question the chances of winning the war in afghanistan , kabul is informally seeking political compromise with taliban insurgents .
officially , there have been no secret talks . the afghan government is not shy to acknowledge that it tries to win over members of the armed opposition .
insurgents who accept the government ’ s proposals to cooperate politically are granted amnesty and integrated into civilian life .
one example of such a won-over insurgent is wakil ahmad muttawakil - a former taliban foreign minister who , in 2005 , even ran for parliament - albeit without success .
so when rumours started circulating that a government delegation had met members of the taliban in saudi arabia , nobody was surprised .
but the government quickly denied the rumours .
“ there were no talks and no talks have been arranged , ” said government spokesman homayoun hamidzadeh .
“ but president karzai has always said that he is involved in talks with the saudi king to clarify whether he could play a mediating role in the peace process in afghanistan .
the afghan side would warmly welcome any progress in this matter and then take part in talks . ”
informal meeting of enormous import however , independent observers tell a different story .

1 , was tipped to lead growth next year - 5.6 percent - followed by european union newcomers romania , 4.8 percent , and bulgaria , 4.2 percent .
with part of the baltics already believed to be in recession , the imf noted that southern europe 's continuing boom is based on much the same mix of consumer spending , loans and capital investment driven by western banks and companies .
inflation , while likely to ease in 2009 , is eating into people 's spending power . overall , the region from the baltics to bulgaria is headed for a third year of slowing growth , down to 3.5 percent in 2009 from a predicted 5.0 percent in 2008 , the imf said in a report released in washington .
and the risk that the region 's financial imbalances will spook investors is rising at a time of tighter credit , the semi-annual world economic outlook said . " growth is expected to continue to decelerate markedly , including on account of diminishing capital inflows and tighter financial constraints , " the survey said . indirect effect soaring food and energy prices are slowing consumer spending , while the global credit crunch and sickly growth in western europe - eastern europe 's main market - is weighing on investment and exports , the imf said .
it added that while banks operating in emerging europe have little direct exposure to the us subprime mortgage market , they and their foreign parents are affected by the widening turmoil in western europe . " the policy challenge is how to engineer a soft landing " while keeping the region on track toward western european living standards , imf analysts said . they foresee a clear three-way split for the european union 's emerging economies in 2009 : the three baltic nations ailing after a long spending and investment boom , with latvia 's economy shrinking by 2.2 percent ; central europe growing an average 3.6 percent ; and romania and bulgaria still going strong .
" like the baltics several years ago , these countries are still enjoying ' good times , " ' the imf said of the two south-eastern eu members . but romania , expected to lead the region this year with 8.6-percent growth , and bulgaria need to recognize the " more volatile external financing conditions " and rein in public spending , the report said .
underscoring the jitters , plunging share prices forced romania 's stock exchange in bucharest to halt trading for the day shortly after opening wednesday .
in the baltics , recovery is expected to begin during the second half of 2009 , but authorities should " resist the temptation to significantly ease fiscal policy in the downturn " and work toward balanced budgets , the imf added . dpa news agency -lrb- mrm -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

1 , was tipped to lead growth next year - 5.6 percent - followed by european union newcomers romania , 4.8 percent , and bulgaria , 4.2 percent .
with part of the baltics already believed to be in recession , the imf noted that southern europe 's continuing boom is based on much the same mix of consumer spending , loans and capital investment driven by western banks and companies .
inflation , while likely to ease in 2009 , is eating into people 's spending power . overall , the region from the baltics to bulgaria is headed for a third year of slowing growth , down to 3.5 percent in 2009 from a predicted 5.0 percent in 2008 , the imf said in a report released in washington .
and the risk that the region 's financial imbalances will spook investors is rising at a time of tighter credit , the semi-annual world economic outlook said . " growth is expected to continue to decelerate markedly , including on account of diminishing capital inflows and tighter financial constraints , " the survey said . indirect effect soaring food and energy prices are slowing consumer spending , while the global credit crunch and sickly growth in western europe - eastern europe 's main market - is weighing on investment and exports , the imf said .
it added that while banks operating in emerging europe have little direct exposure to the us subprime mortgage market , they and their foreign parents are affected by the widening turmoil in western europe . " the policy challenge is how to engineer a soft landing " while keeping the region on track toward western european living standards , imf analysts said . they foresee a clear three-way split for the european union 's emerging economies in 2009 : the three baltic nations ailing after a long spending and investment boom , with latvia 's economy shrinking by 2.2 percent ; central europe growing an average 3.6 percent ; and romania and bulgaria still going strong .
" like the baltics several years ago , these countries are still enjoying ' good times , " ' the imf said of the two south-eastern eu members . but romania , expected to lead the region this year with 8.6-percent growth , and bulgaria need to recognize the " more volatile external financing conditions " and rein in public spending , the report said .
underscoring the jitters , plunging share prices forced romania 's stock exchange in bucharest to halt trading for the day shortly after opening wednesday .
in the baltics , recovery is expected to begin during the second half of 2009 , but authorities should " resist the temptation to significantly ease fiscal policy in the downturn " and work toward balanced budgets , the imf added . dpa news agency -lrb- mrm -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

uefa head criticizes foreign ownership bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : uefa president michel platini says foreign ownership should be regulated the decision by german soccer officials to spread the good word about the bundesliga comes amid criticism by european soccer chief michel platini of the high rates of foreign ownership of some of europe 's largest clubs .
he said a soccer club 's identity was firmly connected not only to its location and fans , but also to its owners and players , and that if neither of the latter exhibited any resemblance to either of the former , then that was a recipe for the loss of soccer individuality and uniqueness .
" do you want in liverpool an arab sheikh as president with one brazilian coach and nine or 11 african players ?
" where is liverpool in that ?
we have to make some rules .
" what is football ?
football is a game and this game has become popular because of the identity .
you have to have identity .
that is where football 's popularity lies . "
platini , a former french national team midfield magician , said he would investigate the possibility of regulating foreign ownership of clubs across europe , but admitted that varying european national constitutions would be a substantial hurdle to overcome in that quest .
football debt to be examined bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : playing rosters are pushing english clubs into record levels of debt a top uefa official said wednesday that the financial requirements model used for teams in the german and swiss national leagues was viable for use as the basis for a europe-wide system to regulate club debt .
david taylor , uefa general secretary , told a conference in london that the european soccer body would launch talks next week on potential changes to the way clubs are licensed with the aim of reviewing how they run their finances .
several clubs , notably from england , dominate european competitions , believed possible because of the exorbitant debts they all shoulder .
" we can not let things stay as they are , " taylor said .
" in some countries like germany and switzerland , stronger requirements are put on clubs in terms of bank guarantees and having no negative equity .
these are the models we have to look at . "
on tuesday , the chairman of england 's football association , lord david triesman , put the combined debt of english clubs at around 3 billion pounds .
he warned of " very tangible dangers " to large clubs such as liverpool , manchester united and chelsea in the current uncertain financial times . dw staff -lrb- dfm -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

8 .
imf analysts also predicted that germany , europe 's largest economy , will stall in 2009 and france 's will grow by a marginal 0.2 percent .
italy and spain will see their economies shrink by 0.2 percent , according to the semi-annual world economic outlook .
with european nations " moving close to or into recession , " the imf urged forceful action by policymakers to combat the crisis with measures such as lower interest rates .
ecb chief : " collect yourselves " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : wall street dropped even after the fed announced interest rate cuts hours before the report 's release , the european central bank and the us federal reserve led key central banks in a coordinated emergency cut in benchmark rates by 0.5 percentage points .
european central bank chief jean-claude trichet called the move " a significant signal of confidence to the markets . "
speaking on france 3 television , he told viewers , " we can say to the markets we have regained control over price stability in the medium term . "
markets continued to fall nevertheless , with wall street down more than two percent , london and frankfurt more than five percent , and paris more than six percent .
" we all together call upon the market participants who are in this state of intense turbulence , we tell them to collect themselves , there are elements of confidence out there , " said the ecb chief , ahead of the annual meetings of the imf and world bank to be held this weekend in washington .
" excessive pessimism is ill advised . "
on a brighter note , the imf said falling real estate prices in europe are less likely to set off a major housing-related credit crunch than in the us .
higher savings rates , lower debt , more prudent mortgage lending and much more limited opportunities for equity withdrawal on real estate work in europe 's favor , the report said .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : prudent lending practices in europe have kept the housing market from turning upside down the downturn in residential real estate will , however , have " an appreciable short-term impact " in countries like ireland , spain and britain .
austria , germany and switzerland appear the least at risk in that respect , the imf said .
appeal to european policymakers still , the imf appealed to eu governments to move " toward more joint responsibility and accountability for financial stability " and urged european policymakers to make prudent choices .
" restoring confidence now requires a decisive commitment to concerted and coordinated action to alleviate financial stresses and avoid the serious risk of backtracking on european financial integration , " imf analysts said .
euro zone governments , whose deficit spending is limited by rules meant to protect the euro 's value , should focus emergency injections " on measures to stabilize the financial sector , as needed , " the report said .

1 , was tipped to lead growth next year - 5.6 percent - followed by european union newcomers romania , 4.8 percent , and bulgaria , 4.2 percent .
with part of the baltics already believed to be in recession , the imf noted that southern europe 's continuing boom is based on much the same mix of consumer spending , loans and capital investment driven by western banks and companies .
inflation , while likely to ease in 2009 , is eating into people 's spending power . overall , the region from the baltics to bulgaria is headed for a third year of slowing growth , down to 3.5 percent in 2009 from a predicted 5.0 percent in 2008 , the imf said in a report released in washington .
and the risk that the region 's financial imbalances will spook investors is rising at a time of tighter credit , the semi-annual world economic outlook said . " growth is expected to continue to decelerate markedly , including on account of diminishing capital inflows and tighter financial constraints , " the survey said . indirect effect soaring food and energy prices are slowing consumer spending , while the global credit crunch and sickly growth in western europe - eastern europe 's main market - is weighing on investment and exports , the imf said .
it added that while banks operating in emerging europe have little direct exposure to the us subprime mortgage market , they and their foreign parents are affected by the widening turmoil in western europe . " the policy challenge is how to engineer a soft landing " while keeping the region on track toward western european living standards , imf analysts said . they foresee a clear three-way split for the european union 's emerging economies in 2009 : the three baltic nations ailing after a long spending and investment boom , with latvia 's economy shrinking by 2.2 percent ; central europe growing an average 3.6 percent ; and romania and bulgaria still going strong .
" like the baltics several years ago , these countries are still enjoying ' good times , " ' the imf said of the two south-eastern eu members . but romania , expected to lead the region this year with 8.6-percent growth , and bulgaria need to recognize the " more volatile external financing conditions " and rein in public spending , the report said .
underscoring the jitters , plunging share prices forced romania 's stock exchange in bucharest to halt trading for the day shortly after opening wednesday .
in the baltics , recovery is expected to begin during the second half of 2009 , but authorities should " resist the temptation to significantly ease fiscal policy in the downturn " and work toward balanced budgets , the imf added . dpa news agency -lrb- mrm -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de economy -pipe- 09.10.2008 eastern europe heads for slowdown großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : so far eastern european economies have n't been directly affected by the financial crisis while eastern european economies have yet to be hit hard by the international financial crisis , the happenings in the west are causing a slowdown in many of the former soviet bloc nations . eastern europe 's slowing economies face growing risks from the global credit crunch , but most of the ex-communist regions will post faster growth than western europe in 2009 , the international monetary fund -lrb- imf -rrb- said wednesday . slovakia , which is slated to switch to the euro on jan .
1 , was tipped to lead growth next year - 5.6 percent - followed by european union newcomers romania , 4.8 percent , and bulgaria , 4.2 percent .
with part of the baltics already believed to be in recession , the imf noted that southern europe 's continuing boom is based on much the same mix of consumer spending , loans and capital investment driven by western banks and companies .
inflation , while likely to ease in 2009 , is eating into people 's spending power . overall , the region from the baltics to bulgaria is headed for a third year of slowing growth , down to 3.5 percent in 2009 from a predicted 5.0 percent in 2008 , the imf said in a report released in washington .
and the risk that the region 's financial imbalances will spook investors is rising at a time of tighter credit , the semi-annual world economic outlook said . " growth is expected to continue to decelerate markedly , including on account of diminishing capital inflows and tighter financial constraints , " the survey said . indirect effect soaring food and energy prices are slowing consumer spending , while the global credit crunch and sickly growth in western europe - eastern europe 's main market - is weighing on investment and exports , the imf said .
it added that while banks operating in emerging europe have little direct exposure to the us subprime mortgage market , they and their foreign parents are affected by the widening turmoil in western europe . " the policy challenge is how to engineer a soft landing " while keeping the region on track toward western european living standards , imf analysts said . they foresee a clear three-way split for the european union 's emerging economies in 2009 : the three baltic nations ailing after a long spending and investment boom , with latvia 's economy shrinking by 2.2 percent ; central europe growing an average 3.6 percent ; and romania and bulgaria still going strong .
" like the baltics several years ago , these countries are still enjoying ' good times , " ' the imf said of the two south-eastern eu members . but romania , expected to lead the region this year with 8.6-percent growth , and bulgaria need to recognize the " more volatile external financing conditions " and rein in public spending , the report said .
underscoring the jitters , plunging share prices forced romania 's stock exchange in bucharest to halt trading for the day shortly after opening wednesday .
in the baltics , recovery is expected to begin during the second half of 2009 , but authorities should " resist the temptation to significantly ease fiscal policy in the downturn " and work toward balanced budgets , the imf added . dpa news agency -lrb- mrm -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

with part of the baltics already believed to be in recession , the imf noted that southern europe 's continuing boom is based on much the same mix of consumer spending , loans and capital investment driven by western banks and companies .
inflation , while likely to ease in 2009 , is eating into people 's spending power . overall , the region from the baltics to bulgaria is headed for a third year of slowing growth , down to 3.5 percent in 2009 from a predicted 5.0 percent in 2008 , the imf said in a report released in washington .

" the policy challenge is how to engineer a soft landing " while keeping the region on track toward western european living standards , imf analysts said . they foresee a clear three-way split for the european union 's emerging economies in 2009 : the three baltic nations ailing after a long spending and investment boom , with latvia 's economy shrinking by 2.2 percent ; central europe growing an average 3.6 percent ; and romania and bulgaria still going strong .

officially , there have been no secret talks . the afghan government is not shy to acknowledge that it tries to win over members of the armed opposition .
insurgents who accept the government ’ s proposals to cooperate politically are granted amnesty and integrated into civilian life .
one example of such a won-over insurgent is wakil ahmad muttawakil - a former taliban foreign minister who , in 2005 , even ran for parliament - albeit without success .
so when rumours started circulating that a government delegation had met members of the taliban in saudi arabia , nobody was surprised .
but the government quickly denied the rumours .
“ there were no talks and no talks have been arranged , ” said government spokesman homayoun hamidzadeh .
“ but president karzai has always said that he is involved in talks with the saudi king to clarify whether he could play a mediating role in the peace process in afghanistan .
the afghan side would warmly welcome any progress in this matter and then take part in talks . ”
informal meeting of enormous import however , independent observers tell a different story .
it would seem that , at a recent festive supper held by saudi king abdullah in mecca , a group of afghan mps and government officials met a taliban representative and also envoys of gulbuddin hekmatyar , the head of the afghanistan islamic party .
although the afghan delegation did not have an official mandate , the informal meeting still has enormous political import .
it means that if talks were to become possible in the future thanks to saudi mediation , a taliban spokesman , who has claimed responsibility for a series of terrorist attacks , would become an acceptable political partner in kabul .
citha maass , from the german institute for international and security affairs , was not surprised to hear about the talks : “ there have been suggestions of secret negotiations for some time now .
it is increasingly clear that the insurgency can not be fought only with military means . ”
pre-election strategy maass also thought that president karzai was thinking strategically , ahead of next year ’ s elections .
he needs to secure votes in the volatile eastern and southern provinces of afghanistan .
although he was elected with about 55 percent of the votes four years ago , his popularity ratings have sunk to 17 percent .
“ if there are secret negotiations and the taliban agree not to disrupt the election process , then a political price will have to be paid .
this would likely entail that afghanistan ’ s political process stray even further away from democracy , ” said maass .
democratic freedoms within sharia law although the country ’ s constitution enshrines democratic freedoms , these are practised within the framework of islamic sharia law .
critics fear that if the taliban become once again part of the political sphere in kabul , they will misuse the constitution in favour of their own interpretation of islam .
officially , the taliban spokesmen have refused to take part in talks with what they call the puppet government in kabul until foreign forces leave the country .
however , some observers think that , with time , the older cadres - mullah mohammed omar and his supporters - might , as the taliban ’ s radical young cadres start questioning their authority more and more , seek their own salvation in a political compromise with the government . dw staff -lrb- act -rrb- 09/10/08 send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic 9799 global media forum human rights in a globalized world - challenges for the media singapore polls as singapore votes , not much change is likely with the people 's action party expected to win cherian george , adjunct senior research fellow at the institute of policy studies in singapore , talks about the likely outcome north korea amnesty international paints a horrifying picture of conditions in north korea 's prison camps .

officially , there have been no secret talks . the afghan government is not shy to acknowledge that it tries to win over members of the armed opposition .

so when rumours started circulating that a government delegation had met members of the taliban in saudi arabia , nobody was surprised .
but the government quickly denied the rumours .
“ there were no talks and no talks have been arranged , ” said government spokesman homayoun hamidzadeh .

although the afghan delegation did not have an official mandate , the informal meeting still has enormous political import .

he needs to secure votes in the volatile eastern and southern provinces of afghanistan .
although he was elected with about 55 percent of the votes four years ago , his popularity ratings have sunk to 17 percent .

the poll has been set for early december . yushchenko cited months of political infighting , parliament 's inability to pass critical legislation , and failure of a ruling coalition in early september as grounds for calling new elections . in an announcement on his web site on thursday , oct .
9 , he said fresh elections would take place on dec .
7 . in a short , nationally televised , pre-recorded speech broadcast on wednesday the orange revolution leader dissolved parliament as part of an agreement among top parties that new elections were necessary , as the legislature at the time had long been deadlocked . by constitutional statute early parliamentary elections are mandated in ukraine 60 days after a legislature is dissolved by presidential order .
yushchenko did not specify whether he had signed the order . before ceasing work , ukraine 's current parliament should amend the national budget to pay for the vote , which according to yushchenko , would allow ukrainians to select a brand new legislature .

some of yushchenko 's critics have called for the legislature to amend the constitution so ukrainians could choose a new president in the upcoming election despite his term officially set to end in 2010 . his opponents , including one-time orange revolution ally and current prime minister yulia tymoshenko and former prime minister viktor yanukovych , said the country must pick a new president , if it were to select a new legislature . yanukovych , leader of the pro-russia regions ukraine political party , predicted a strengthened position for his faction in the next legislature . " this is the death knell of the present -lrb- pro-european -rrb- government , " yanukovych said , in remarks reported by the interfax news agency .

8 .
imf analysts also predicted that germany , europe 's largest economy , will stall in 2009 and france 's will grow by a marginal 0.2 percent .
italy and spain will see their economies shrink by 0.2 percent , according to the semi-annual world economic outlook .
with european nations " moving close to or into recession , " the imf urged forceful action by policymakers to combat the crisis with measures such as lower interest rates .
ecb chief : " collect yourselves " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : wall street dropped even after the fed announced interest rate cuts hours before the report 's release , the european central bank and the us federal reserve led key central banks in a coordinated emergency cut in benchmark rates by 0.5 percentage points .
european central bank chief jean-claude trichet called the move " a significant signal of confidence to the markets . "
speaking on france 3 television , he told viewers , " we can say to the markets we have regained control over price stability in the medium term . "
markets continued to fall nevertheless , with wall street down more than two percent , london and frankfurt more than five percent , and paris more than six percent .
" we all together call upon the market participants who are in this state of intense turbulence , we tell them to collect themselves , there are elements of confidence out there , " said the ecb chief , ahead of the annual meetings of the imf and world bank to be held this weekend in washington .
" excessive pessimism is ill advised . "
on a brighter note , the imf said falling real estate prices in europe are less likely to set off a major housing-related credit crunch than in the us .
higher savings rates , lower debt , more prudent mortgage lending and much more limited opportunities for equity withdrawal on real estate work in europe 's favor , the report said .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : prudent lending practices in europe have kept the housing market from turning upside down the downturn in residential real estate will , however , have " an appreciable short-term impact " in countries like ireland , spain and britain .
austria , germany and switzerland appear the least at risk in that respect , the imf said .
appeal to european policymakers still , the imf appealed to eu governments to move " toward more joint responsibility and accountability for financial stability " and urged european policymakers to make prudent choices .
" restoring confidence now requires a decisive commitment to concerted and coordinated action to alleviate financial stresses and avoid the serious risk of backtracking on european financial integration , " imf analysts said .
euro zone governments , whose deficit spending is limited by rules meant to protect the euro 's value , should focus emergency injections " on measures to stabilize the financial sector , as needed , " the report said .
eu finance ministers , scrambling to react to the spill-over , agreed tuesday to more than double the public guarantee for private bank deposits to at least 50,000 euros -lrb- $ 68,000 -rrb- .
dexia gets relief from benelux meanwhile , the governments of belgium , france and luxembourg have agreed to a plan to help the struggling bank dexia , belgium 's le soir newspaper reported thursday .
the plan would create a special vehicle to absorb the bank 's toxic assets and provide fresh liquidity .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : shares in dexia have fallen more than 70 percent in the last year " there will be a public guarantee from the french , belgian and luxembourg states on a maximum 4.5 billion euros that dexia is going to borrow on the market , " a source close to the luxembourg government told afp news agency .
the move comes despite a 6.4 billion euro bailout package that the three governments put together for dexia last week .
the idea of splitting the bank into national units was abandoned at talks between high-ranking officials from france , belgium and luxembourg that were being held through the night in brussels , according to le soir .
dexia 's shares rose sharply on the news , climbing 18 percent in the first 15 minutes of trading on thursday .
the franco-belgian bank is one of the top 20 banks in the euro zone , with some 5.5 million clients in belgium , france , luxembourg , slovakia and turkey . dw staff -lrb- cat -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

christian ehler , a member of the european parliament , talks to deutsche welle about what the eu nations can do about it . deutsche welle : some eu countries have created unlimited guarantees for savings accounts .
how much sense do these unilateral actions make ?
christian ehler : i think that it certainly makes sense , in the current crisis , to regain the trust of customers by undertaking these sorts of national guarantees for bank accounts .
in the long term , of course , it is n't a solution , because you have to keep in mind that small countries , like iceland , would be completely overwhelmed if their banking sectors were to hand out such guarantees . one potential consequence has been discussed .
namely that customers would transfer their money to other countries which have wide reaching guarantees , to what extent might that result in unfair competition on the housing market ?
i believe that the current situation makes it even more important that we regain people 's trust .
out of all the parties involved , consumers are reacting the more reasonably .
nevertheless , it has to be said that consumers want to know that their money is safe in these sorts of situations .
so far it has been really important to send this signal .
in the long run that is n't a solution because it could perpetuate unfair competition .
i think that for now it 's just a temporary solution and it 's a step in the right direction wo n't the eu countries have to work together if they want a widespread rescue packet like the one in the us ?
they ca n't , plain and simple .
there are two reasons for this .
the one is money market policy .
there we have the european central bank .
that 's the biggest hero of the international finance crisis .
it was different in america , where on the one side there was the markets with liquidity , which had to ensure that the on the other side interests would n't sink too low , which brought put us in danger of inflation .
that 's what we do in money market policy because there we have a contractual basis .
when it comes to financial policy , every eu country has its own sovereignty .
they each have responsibility over their national own banking supervision .
because of that they have to take on risks nationally .
that can change when some member countries are no longer able to do that .
but just look at the reactions on sunday to the quick decisions , which were necessary in the case of hypo real estate .
the idea that 27 member countries could all agree and the idea that it would come with a high risk that some countries would be forced to come up with billions of euros to bail out a bank in greece or the netherlands does n't seem to me to be really feasible at the moment . after the mini summit over the weekend the french president , nicolas sarkozy , announced that the eu stability and growth pact will be softened .
so countries can still contract more debts .
is that a good sign ?
i not only believe that it is n't a good sign , but that it 's wrong , plain and simple .
the instuments that we have there , namely the stability and growth pact , have proven themselves reliable .
and it is clearly defined in the stability pact how much national debt a nation must have and still be able to respond in a flexible way to special situations – and the collapse of large european banks is a special situation .
but that has nothing to do with the fact that we can not and will not tolerate the relatively lax french deal with their finance policies in the stability pact .
keep this in mind : the things that are necessary for a state to intervene in order to stabilize the financial market is made possible by the stability and growth pact .

according to a press report released earlier in the day , turbulence on equity markets caused by the international financial crisis prompted the delay of the sale of a 24.9 percent stake , in what is set to be the last major privatisation in europe 's biggest economy .
deutsche bahn was to list a 24.9 percent stake in its freight and passenger unit on the stock market on october 27 .
but unnamed financial sources quoted by the financial times deutschland 's online edition said the initial public offering -lrb- ipo -rrb- will now not take place until november at the earliest .
the government was hoping to generate some five or six billion euros -lrb- seven or eight billion dollars -rrb- from the sale and chief executive hartmut mehdorn had already begun talking to potential investors in london and moscow , the ftd said .
however , there have been sharp falls in stock markets in recent days due to the international financial crisis .
the government is now worried that it would not get as much money as it hoped and that it would be better to wait for markets to recover .
german finance minister peer steinbrueck conceded on monday that the turbulence might force the listing to be postponed .
" we have to ask ourselves if the timing is right , " steinbrueck told reporters , noting " very unfavourable conditions in the market . " dw staff -lrb- mrm -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

officials said they had sealed off the farm and planned to slaughter the whole flock of ducks at goerlitz , near the polish border .
the property contains more than 1,000 birds , mainly turkeys and geese .
germany 's national animal health laboratory on the baltic island of riems said the find was " somewhat surprising " as the infection alert had been reduced to moderate after an outbreak was beaten last december .
then , officials launched the largest-ever bird cull in germany , exterminating a massive 160,000 geese over a weekend in wachenroth , bavaria .
it remained unknown what proportion of wild birds in germany were infected , a spokeswoman said .
none of germany 's neighbours are currently reporting any h5n1 detections , with the virus having recently shown up in asia , from which scientists believe it had earlier spread to both europe and africa with migratory wild birds .
the virus can be deadly for humans if hygienic precautions are not followed .
human-to-human transmission of the virus has only occurred in very isolated cases and chiefly in asia .

christian ehler , a member of the european parliament , talks to deutsche welle about what the eu nations can do about it . deutsche welle : some eu countries have created unlimited guarantees for savings accounts .
how much sense do these unilateral actions make ?
christian ehler : i think that it certainly makes sense , in the current crisis , to regain the trust of customers by undertaking these sorts of national guarantees for bank accounts .
in the long term , of course , it is n't a solution , because you have to keep in mind that small countries , like iceland , would be completely overwhelmed if their banking sectors were to hand out such guarantees . one potential consequence has been discussed .
namely that customers would transfer their money to other countries which have wide reaching guarantees , to what extent might that result in unfair competition on the housing market ?
i believe that the current situation makes it even more important that we regain people 's trust .
out of all the parties involved , consumers are reacting the more reasonably .
nevertheless , it has to be said that consumers want to know that their money is safe in these sorts of situations .
so far it has been really important to send this signal .
in the long run that is n't a solution because it could perpetuate unfair competition .
i think that for now it 's just a temporary solution and it 's a step in the right direction wo n't the eu countries have to work together if they want a widespread rescue packet like the one in the us ?
they ca n't , plain and simple .
there are two reasons for this .
the one is money market policy .

that 's what we do in money market policy because there we have a contractual basis .
when it comes to financial policy , every eu country has its own sovereignty .
they each have responsibility over their national own banking supervision .
because of that they have to take on risks nationally .
that can change when some member countries are no longer able to do that .
but just look at the reactions on sunday to the quick decisions , which were necessary in the case of hypo real estate .
the idea that 27 member countries could all agree and the idea that it would come with a high risk that some countries would be forced to come up with billions of euros to bail out a bank in greece or the netherlands does n't seem to me to be really feasible at the moment . after the mini summit over the weekend the french president , nicolas sarkozy , announced that the eu stability and growth pact will be softened .
so countries can still contract more debts .
is that a good sign ?
i not only believe that it is n't a good sign , but that it 's wrong , plain and simple .
the instuments that we have there , namely the stability and growth pact , have proven themselves reliable .

but that has nothing to do with the fact that we can not and will not tolerate the relatively lax french deal with their finance policies in the stability pact .

the plan included the partial nationalization of britain 's eight main banks , 200 billion pounds in short-term loans and 250 billion pounds in inter-bank loan guarantees . " extraordinary times call for ... bold and far-reaching solutions , " brown said while introducing the package .

despite his confidence in germany 's current soundness , the minister said that financial markets the world over , germany 's included , were still operating under a dense cloud of uncertainty and that he could not guarantee against any future nationalization plans for the nation 's banks .
" so far i do n't see the need for state takeovers in germany .
the german banking sector has been hit badly by the financial crisis but less hard " than in other countries , steinbrueck told the handelsblatt daily .
" but this might change as uncertainties about future developments are currently much too high , " he said as quoted by the paper .
the german government , together with banks and insurance companies , agreed late sunday , sept .

" our forecast of 1.2 percent growth in 2009 will be revised down , " ecb board member lorenzo bini smaghi told the italian financial daily il sole 24 ore without citing the new figure .
the central bank had already down-scaled its previous eurozone growth forecast of 1.5 percent last month .
" the second quarter -lrb- 2008 -rrb- was negative , and the third may be as well .
there 's a risk of more or less zero growth for several quarters , " bini smaghi said .
" it will depend a lot on the positive impact that will come from lowering interest rates , from a more competitive euro and especially from a sharp drop in prices of raw materials . "
wednesday saw a coordinated effort by central banks around the world to cut interest rates as a joint response to the global financial crisis .
the ecb dropped its interest rate to 3.75 percent . the decision was taken in coordination with central banks in britain , canada , sweden , switzerland and the united states , the ecb said in a statement .

topolanek specifically slammed several eu members for providing unlimited bank deposit protection , calling it " a shameless step " that boosts liquidity in those countries at the expense of others .
" all these measures are absolutely artificial .
they contradict the eu 's substance , " news agency ctk quoted him as saying late wednesday during a visit to turkey .

imf analysts also predicted that germany , europe 's largest economy , will stall in 2009 and france 's will grow by a marginal 0.2 percent .
italy and spain will see their economies shrink by 0.2 percent , according to the semi-annual world economic outlook .
with european nations " moving close to or into recession , " the imf urged forceful action by policymakers to combat the crisis with measures such as lower interest rates .
ecb chief : " collect yourselves " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : wall street dropped even after the fed announced interest rate cuts hours before the report 's release , the european central bank and the us federal reserve led key central banks in a coordinated emergency cut in benchmark rates by 0.5 percentage points .
european central bank chief jean-claude trichet called the move " a significant signal of confidence to the markets . "
speaking on france 3 television , he told viewers , " we can say to the markets we have regained control over price stability in the medium term . "
markets continued to fall nevertheless , with wall street down more than two percent , london and frankfurt more than five percent , and paris more than six percent .
" we all together call upon the market participants who are in this state of intense turbulence , we tell them to collect themselves , there are elements of confidence out there , " said the ecb chief , ahead of the annual meetings of the imf and world bank to be held this weekend in washington .
" excessive pessimism is ill advised . "
on a brighter note , the imf said falling real estate prices in europe are less likely to set off a major housing-related credit crunch than in the us .
higher savings rates , lower debt , more prudent mortgage lending and much more limited opportunities for equity withdrawal on real estate work in europe 's favor , the report said .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : prudent lending practices in europe have kept the housing market from turning upside down the downturn in residential real estate will , however , have " an appreciable short-term impact " in countries like ireland , spain and britain .
austria , germany and switzerland appear the least at risk in that respect , the imf said .
appeal to european policymakers still , the imf appealed to eu governments to move " toward more joint responsibility and accountability for financial stability " and urged european policymakers to make prudent choices .
" restoring confidence now requires a decisive commitment to concerted and coordinated action to alleviate financial stresses and avoid the serious risk of backtracking on european financial integration , " imf analysts said .
euro zone governments , whose deficit spending is limited by rules meant to protect the euro 's value , should focus emergency injections " on measures to stabilize the financial sector , as needed , " the report said .
eu finance ministers , scrambling to react to the spill-over , agreed tuesday to more than double the public guarantee for private bank deposits to at least 50,000 euros -lrb- $ 68,000 -rrb- .
dexia gets relief from benelux meanwhile , the governments of belgium , france and luxembourg have agreed to a plan to help the struggling bank dexia , belgium 's le soir newspaper reported thursday .
the plan would create a special vehicle to absorb the bank 's toxic assets and provide fresh liquidity .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : shares in dexia have fallen more than 70 percent in the last year " there will be a public guarantee from the french , belgian and luxembourg states on a maximum 4.5 billion euros that dexia is going to borrow on the market , " a source close to the luxembourg government told afp news agency .
the move comes despite a 6.4 billion euro bailout package that the three governments put together for dexia last week .
the idea of splitting the bank into national units was abandoned at talks between high-ranking officials from france , belgium and luxembourg that were being held through the night in brussels , according to le soir .
dexia 's shares rose sharply on the news , climbing 18 percent in the first 15 minutes of trading on thursday .
the franco-belgian bank is one of the top 20 banks in the euro zone , with some 5.5 million clients in belgium , france , luxembourg , slovakia and turkey . dw staff -lrb- cat -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" the policy challenge is how to engineer a soft landing " while keeping the region on track toward western european living standards , imf analysts said . they foresee a clear three-way split for the european union 's emerging economies in 2009 : the three baltic nations ailing after a long spending and investment boom , with latvia 's economy shrinking by 2.2 percent ; central europe growing an average 3.6 percent ; and romania and bulgaria still going strong .

underscoring the jitters , plunging share prices forced romania 's stock exchange in bucharest to halt trading for the day shortly after opening wednesday .

" the policy challenge is how to engineer a soft landing " while keeping the region on track toward western european living standards , imf analysts said . they foresee a clear three-way split for the european union 's emerging economies in 2009 : the three baltic nations ailing after a long spending and investment boom , with latvia 's economy shrinking by 2.2 percent ; central europe growing an average 3.6 percent ; and romania and bulgaria still going strong .
" like the baltics several years ago , these countries are still enjoying ' good times , " ' the imf said of the two south-eastern eu members . but romania , expected to lead the region this year with 8.6-percent growth , and bulgaria need to recognize the " more volatile external financing conditions " and rein in public spending , the report said .
underscoring the jitters , plunging share prices forced romania 's stock exchange in bucharest to halt trading for the day shortly after opening wednesday .
in the baltics , recovery is expected to begin during the second half of 2009 , but authorities should " resist the temptation to significantly ease fiscal policy in the downturn " and work toward balanced budgets , the imf added . dpa news agency -lrb- mrm -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

8 .
imf analysts also predicted that germany , europe 's largest economy , will stall in 2009 and france 's will grow by a marginal 0.2 percent .
italy and spain will see their economies shrink by 0.2 percent , according to the semi-annual world economic outlook .
with european nations " moving close to or into recession , " the imf urged forceful action by policymakers to combat the crisis with measures such as lower interest rates .
ecb chief : " collect yourselves " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : wall street dropped even after the fed announced interest rate cuts hours before the report 's release , the european central bank and the us federal reserve led key central banks in a coordinated emergency cut in benchmark rates by 0.5 percentage points .
european central bank chief jean-claude trichet called the move " a significant signal of confidence to the markets . "
speaking on france 3 television , he told viewers , " we can say to the markets we have regained control over price stability in the medium term . "
markets continued to fall nevertheless , with wall street down more than two percent , london and frankfurt more than five percent , and paris more than six percent .
" we all together call upon the market participants who are in this state of intense turbulence , we tell them to collect themselves , there are elements of confidence out there , " said the ecb chief , ahead of the annual meetings of the imf and world bank to be held this weekend in washington .
" excessive pessimism is ill advised . "
on a brighter note , the imf said falling real estate prices in europe are less likely to set off a major housing-related credit crunch than in the us .
higher savings rates , lower debt , more prudent mortgage lending and much more limited opportunities for equity withdrawal on real estate work in europe 's favor , the report said .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : prudent lending practices in europe have kept the housing market from turning upside down the downturn in residential real estate will , however , have " an appreciable short-term impact " in countries like ireland , spain and britain .
austria , germany and switzerland appear the least at risk in that respect , the imf said .
appeal to european policymakers still , the imf appealed to eu governments to move " toward more joint responsibility and accountability for financial stability " and urged european policymakers to make prudent choices .
" restoring confidence now requires a decisive commitment to concerted and coordinated action to alleviate financial stresses and avoid the serious risk of backtracking on european financial integration , " imf analysts said .
euro zone governments , whose deficit spending is limited by rules meant to protect the euro 's value , should focus emergency injections " on measures to stabilize the financial sector , as needed , " the report said .
eu finance ministers , scrambling to react to the spill-over , agreed tuesday to more than double the public guarantee for private bank deposits to at least 50,000 euros -lrb- $ 68,000 -rrb- .
dexia gets relief from benelux meanwhile , the governments of belgium , france and luxembourg have agreed to a plan to help the struggling bank dexia , belgium 's le soir newspaper reported thursday .
the plan would create a special vehicle to absorb the bank 's toxic assets and provide fresh liquidity .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : shares in dexia have fallen more than 70 percent in the last year " there will be a public guarantee from the french , belgian and luxembourg states on a maximum 4.5 billion euros that dexia is going to borrow on the market , " a source close to the luxembourg government told afp news agency .
the move comes despite a 6.4 billion euro bailout package that the three governments put together for dexia last week .
the idea of splitting the bank into national units was abandoned at talks between high-ranking officials from france , belgium and luxembourg that were being held through the night in brussels , according to le soir .
dexia 's shares rose sharply on the news , climbing 18 percent in the first 15 minutes of trading on thursday .
the franco-belgian bank is one of the top 20 banks in the euro zone , with some 5.5 million clients in belgium , france , luxembourg , slovakia and turkey . dw staff -lrb- cat -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

dw summarizes europe 's recent reactions to the financial crisis . fallout from the us real-estate slump has western europe facing " extraordinary financial stress , " and unwinding european banks ' exposure " will likely be long and arduous , " the international monetary fund said on wednesday , oct .
8 . it recommended eu governments coordinate their efforts to push for responsibility and accountability in the financial sector .
imf head dominique strauss-kahn said thursday that all non-coordinated action in the european union against the financial crisis " should be avoided , if not condemned . " " restoring confidence now requires a decisive commitment to concerted and coordinated action to alleviate financial stresses and avoid the serious risk of backtracking on european financial integration , " imf analysts added . until wednesday , when central banks around the world cut main interest rates in a coordinated effort , european nations had largely been left to their own designs in terms of solving the credit crunch after a french proposal for an eu-wide fund was shot down . dw reviews recent steps european financial leaders have recently taken to stabilize markets and shore up the international banking system . germany bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hypo real estate needed to be bailed out twice before it was rescued as europe 's largest economy , germany has n't been able to avoid the global credit crunch , despite early statements from finance minister peer steinbrueck that it was an american problem . the government bailed out commercial property lender hypo real estate to the tune 35 billion euros -lrb- $ 47.9 billion -rrb- .
to keep the bank customers from running to atm machines to withdrawal their money , the federal government has also guaranteed the security of all savings . iceland the european country most dramatically affected by the financial crisis , the entire nation of iceland is threatened with bankruptcy after the extent of its involvement in the financial sector .
by oct .

moscow has reportedly expressed a willingness to give iceland a 4 billion euro loan .
since the beginning of the year , iceland 's currency , the krona , has lost half its value against the euro . ireland bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : look at how far that one dropped !
dublin drew ire from the european union for its decision in late september to guarantee all deposits at its biggest banks .
several eu nations then followed ireland 's lead and took similar measures .
but experts in some european capitals were irritated that ireland acted without consulting other nations .
the irish government , however , calmed nerves somewhat by extending blanket guarantees offered to irish banks to five foreign institutions operating on the emerald isle . britain british prime minister gordon brown announced his country 's 50 billion pound bank rescue plan on wednesday .
the plan included the partial nationalization of britain 's eight main banks , 200 billion pounds in short-term loans and 250 billion pounds in inter-bank loan guarantees . " extraordinary times call for ... bold and far-reaching solutions , " brown said while introducing the package .
" the global financial market has ceased to function , putting in danger the necessary flow of money to businesses and families on which all of us depend in our daily lives . " british bank stocks , in the days before the partial nationalization , had lost nearly half their value , italy bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : tremonti said a bare-bones banking system has served italy well italian officials have said their country 's somewhat less sophosociated financial system has left it in a better position to deal with international economic turmoil . in addition to vouching for italians ' savings , economy minister giulio tremonti said rome would consider whether to come to banks ' aid on a case-by-case basis .
italian media reported that the government was setting up a 50 billion euro rescue package that would save banks if necessary . france as two of french banks engaged in merger discussions that would result in the country 's largest banking group , paris issued plans wednesday to take stakes in troubled banks to keep them from bankruptcy . prime minister francois fillon said the government would create new structures allowing it to take over at failing banks and ensure the " continuity and stability of the french banking and finance system . "
he also said paris would have no qualms about replacing managers at nationalized banks with officials who enjoyed the finance ministry 's trust . belgium bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : much of the private sector turned its back on dexia belgium turned to former prime minister jean-luc dehaene is to head the board of the struggling franco-belgian financial service group dexia .
bnp paribas exec pierre mariani is slated to serve as chief executive . the group was saved thursday when the belgian , french and luxembourg came to its rescue for the second time in two weeks by guaranteeing loans after having already partially nationalized the local credit institute .
dexia shares had lost nearly two-thirds of their value before the announcement . but dexia is n't the only benelux bank to be affected .

christian ehler , a member of the european parliament , talks to deutsche welle about what the eu nations can do about it . deutsche welle : some eu countries have created unlimited guarantees for savings accounts .
how much sense do these unilateral actions make ?
christian ehler : i think that it certainly makes sense , in the current crisis , to regain the trust of customers by undertaking these sorts of national guarantees for bank accounts .
in the long term , of course , it is n't a solution , because you have to keep in mind that small countries , like iceland , would be completely overwhelmed if their banking sectors were to hand out such guarantees . one potential consequence has been discussed .
namely that customers would transfer their money to other countries which have wide reaching guarantees , to what extent might that result in unfair competition on the housing market ?
i believe that the current situation makes it even more important that we regain people 's trust .
out of all the parties involved , consumers are reacting the more reasonably .
nevertheless , it has to be said that consumers want to know that their money is safe in these sorts of situations .
so far it has been really important to send this signal .
in the long run that is n't a solution because it could perpetuate unfair competition .
i think that for now it 's just a temporary solution and it 's a step in the right direction wo n't the eu countries have to work together if they want a widespread rescue packet like the one in the us ?
they ca n't , plain and simple .
there are two reasons for this .
the one is money market policy .
there we have the european central bank .
that 's the biggest hero of the international finance crisis .
it was different in america , where on the one side there was the markets with liquidity , which had to ensure that the on the other side interests would n't sink too low , which brought put us in danger of inflation .
that 's what we do in money market policy because there we have a contractual basis .
when it comes to financial policy , every eu country has its own sovereignty .
they each have responsibility over their national own banking supervision .
because of that they have to take on risks nationally .
that can change when some member countries are no longer able to do that .
but just look at the reactions on sunday to the quick decisions , which were necessary in the case of hypo real estate .
the idea that 27 member countries could all agree and the idea that it would come with a high risk that some countries would be forced to come up with billions of euros to bail out a bank in greece or the netherlands does n't seem to me to be really feasible at the moment . after the mini summit over the weekend the french president , nicolas sarkozy , announced that the eu stability and growth pact will be softened .
so countries can still contract more debts .
is that a good sign ?
i not only believe that it is n't a good sign , but that it 's wrong , plain and simple .
the instuments that we have there , namely the stability and growth pact , have proven themselves reliable .
and it is clearly defined in the stability pact how much national debt a nation must have and still be able to respond in a flexible way to special situations – and the collapse of large european banks is a special situation .
but that has nothing to do with the fact that we can not and will not tolerate the relatively lax french deal with their finance policies in the stability pact .
keep this in mind : the things that are necessary for a state to intervene in order to stabilize the financial market is made possible by the stability and growth pact .

" all these measures are absolutely artificial .

uefa head criticizes foreign ownership bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : uefa president michel platini says foreign ownership should be regulated the decision by german soccer officials to spread the good word about the bundesliga comes amid criticism by european soccer chief michel platini of the high rates of foreign ownership of some of europe 's largest clubs .
he said a soccer club 's identity was firmly connected not only to its location and fans , but also to its owners and players , and that if neither of the latter exhibited any resemblance to either of the former , then that was a recipe for the loss of soccer individuality and uniqueness .
" do you want in liverpool an arab sheikh as president with one brazilian coach and nine or 11 african players ?

several member states remain sceptical of such a plan , however , with nations such as germany fearing any extension of nato 's role in afghanistan may lead to more violence , and , as a result , a turn of the tide of public support among afghans away from the western alliance .
gates also pushed his counterparts to increase their troop contributions in afghanistan , despite european reluctance to do so .
nato currently has a force of 50,700 soldiers in afghanistan , up from about 45,000 six months ago .
the german parliament agreed tuesday , oct .
7 to increase its contribution by 1,000 soldiers , raising its total to 4,500 .
the us contingent in afghanistan currently stands at 33,000 , including 13,000 under nato command .
georgian membership bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : saakashvili has called on nato to fulfil its pledges gates also used the first day of the budapest talks to further pitch georgian membership of nato , in spite of fierce opposition from russia and scepticism within the alliance .
" i urge our allies to support -lrb- the membership action plan -rrb- for georgia in december and to support georgia 's efforts to accomplish needed reform , " gates said alongside his georgian counterpart , davit kezerashvili , after the meeting .
nato leaders meeting in bucharest in april promised georgia it would be able to join the alliance at an unspecified future date .
but they postponed any decision on a possible membership action plan -lrb- map -rrb- until a foreign ministers ' meeting planned for december .
german chancellor angela merkel effectively blocked the map offer to georgia and ukraine in bucharest , arguing that it was too early for them to join the alliance .
“ heads of government of the alliance declared unanimously in april in bucharest that georgia should be a member of the alliance , " gates said in budapest .
" the question is whether we can get this accomplished at the foreign ministers ' meeting in december . "
kezerashvili said thursday that nato membership remained his country 's " top security priority . "

" allies agreed to have nato ships address piracy off of the coast of somalia soon , and escort world food program ships , in complementarity with other parties , for instance the eu , " a nato diplomat said during the talks .
as many as nine eu nations could take part in the maritime operation , including belgium , cyprus , france , germany , lithuania , the netherlands , spain , sweden and possibly britain . dw staff -lrb- dfm -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the federal ministry of the interior said the raids were carried out without any arrests .
authorities sought to obtain evidence against the homeland-loyal german youth , which goes by the german abbreviation hdj and is loosely linked to the far-right national democratic party , in preparation for a possible ban on the group .
the domestic spokesperson for the left party , ulla jelpke , said that she hopes the searches are the first step toward a ban on the group that first came to the public 's attention over the summer when a raid on a youth camp in mecklenburg west pomerania was carried out .
following the most recent raids , secretary of state august hanning said that the information would hopefully provide clarity on the organization. which some have said that hdj publications are " anti-semitic and racist . "
the group , founded in 1990 , is accused of being a right-wing extremist organization .
hdj publications were said by the ministry to be " anti-semitic and racist " and that " the hdj 's self-image is near in spirit to the ideology historically of the nazis . "
according to the federal ministry of the interior , the group maintains connections to the far-right national democratic party -lrb- npd -rrb- as well as other neo-nazi groups , including the kameradschafsszene . dw staff -lrb- cat -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de finance -pipe- 09.10.2008 why the eu needs to unite to fight credit crunch großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : eu member states refused a french proposed eu-wide rescue fund so far every eu nation has reacted in its own way to the international financial crisis .
christian ehler , a member of the european parliament , talks to deutsche welle about what the eu nations can do about it . deutsche welle : some eu countries have created unlimited guarantees for savings accounts .
how much sense do these unilateral actions make ?
christian ehler : i think that it certainly makes sense , in the current crisis , to regain the trust of customers by undertaking these sorts of national guarantees for bank accounts .
in the long term , of course , it is n't a solution , because you have to keep in mind that small countries , like iceland , would be completely overwhelmed if their banking sectors were to hand out such guarantees . one potential consequence has been discussed .
namely that customers would transfer their money to other countries which have wide reaching guarantees , to what extent might that result in unfair competition on the housing market ?
i believe that the current situation makes it even more important that we regain people 's trust .
out of all the parties involved , consumers are reacting the more reasonably .
nevertheless , it has to be said that consumers want to know that their money is safe in these sorts of situations .
so far it has been really important to send this signal .
in the long run that is n't a solution because it could perpetuate unfair competition .
i think that for now it 's just a temporary solution and it 's a step in the right direction wo n't the eu countries have to work together if they want a widespread rescue packet like the one in the us ?
they ca n't , plain and simple .
there are two reasons for this .
the one is money market policy .
there we have the european central bank .
that 's the biggest hero of the international finance crisis .
it was different in america , where on the one side there was the markets with liquidity , which had to ensure that the on the other side interests would n't sink too low , which brought put us in danger of inflation .
that 's what we do in money market policy because there we have a contractual basis .
when it comes to financial policy , every eu country has its own sovereignty .
they each have responsibility over their national own banking supervision .
because of that they have to take on risks nationally .
that can change when some member countries are no longer able to do that .
but just look at the reactions on sunday to the quick decisions , which were necessary in the case of hypo real estate .
the idea that 27 member countries could all agree and the idea that it would come with a high risk that some countries would be forced to come up with billions of euros to bail out a bank in greece or the netherlands does n't seem to me to be really feasible at the moment . after the mini summit over the weekend the french president , nicolas sarkozy , announced that the eu stability and growth pact will be softened .
so countries can still contract more debts .
is that a good sign ?
i not only believe that it is n't a good sign , but that it 's wrong , plain and simple .
the instuments that we have there , namely the stability and growth pact , have proven themselves reliable .
and it is clearly defined in the stability pact how much national debt a nation must have and still be able to respond in a flexible way to special situations – and the collapse of large european banks is a special situation .
but that has nothing to do with the fact that we can not and will not tolerate the relatively lax french deal with their finance policies in the stability pact .
keep this in mind : the things that are necessary for a state to intervene in order to stabilize the financial market is made possible by the stability and growth pact .
everything else is just decoration and does n't make much sense . christain ehler is an economist and member of the european parliament and sits on the finance committee . interview : guenther birkenstock -lrb- mrm -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the federal ministry of the interior said the raids were carried out without any arrests .
authorities sought to obtain evidence against the homeland-loyal german youth , which goes by the german abbreviation hdj and is loosely linked to the far-right national democratic party , in preparation for a possible ban on the group .
the domestic spokesperson for the left party , ulla jelpke , said that she hopes the searches are the first step toward a ban on the group that first came to the public 's attention over the summer when a raid on a youth camp in mecklenburg west pomerania was carried out .
following the most recent raids , secretary of state august hanning said that the information would hopefully provide clarity on the organization. which some have said that hdj publications are " anti-semitic and racist . "
the group , founded in 1990 , is accused of being a right-wing extremist organization .
hdj publications were said by the ministry to be " anti-semitic and racist " and that " the hdj 's self-image is near in spirit to the ideology historically of the nazis . "
according to the federal ministry of the interior , the group maintains connections to the far-right national democratic party -lrb- npd -rrb- as well as other neo-nazi groups , including the kameradschafsszene . dw staff -lrb- cat -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" we need to have the opportunity to go after drug lords and drug laboratories and try and interrupt this flow of cash , " he told reporters at a two-day meeting of nato defense ministers which began thursday in budapest , hungary .
general john craddock , nato operations commander , likewise appealed to the members of the 26-nation alliance for the authority to attack laboratories , trafficking networks and drug lords in afghanistan to knock the wind out of the resurgent insurgency .
several member states remain sceptical of such a plan , however , with nations such as germany fearing any extension of nato 's role in afghanistan may lead to more violence , and , as a result , a turn of the tide of public support among afghans away from the western alliance .
gates also pushed his counterparts to increase their troop contributions in afghanistan , despite european reluctance to do so .
nato currently has a force of 50,700 soldiers in afghanistan , up from about 45,000 six months ago .
the german parliament agreed tuesday , oct .

german chancellor angela merkel effectively blocked the map offer to georgia and ukraine in bucharest , arguing that it was too early for them to join the alliance .

customers who are not told about extra charges when they place their order will not have to pay those charges , says the proposal , which was issued wednesday , oct .
8 .
the retailer will also have to guarantee delivery anywhere within the eu within 30 days .
they will also have to compensate the purchaser within a week if the product is damaged or fails to arrive .
user friendly additionally , customers will have the right to a 14-day " cooling-off period , " during which they can change their minds and send the product back .
and retailers will no longer be allowed to insert clauses such as " the trader is not responsible for mistakes made by his agents " into contracts .
nor will they be allowed to pre-check boxes on online order forms that commit customers to buying extra services unless the customer unchecks the boxes .
according to figures from the commission , approximately 150 million eu citizens shop online , but only 30 million look for products in other eu member states - spending on average 800 euros -lrb- $ 1,090 -rrb- per year in the process .
fear of fraud at the same time , identical products in different member states can vary enormously in price .
an eight-gigabyte ipod nano , for example , can range in price from 169.44 euros in britain to 268.96 euros in hungary , a commission study said .
eu officials are keen to boost the volume of cross-border e-shopping in the bloc .
however , european consumers are still reluctant to buy from web sites in other countries , largely for fear of fraud .
according to the commission , the proportion of europeans shopping online rose from 23 to 30 percent between 2005 and 2008 , but the proportion of those doing so abroad rose only from 6 to 7 percent . dpa news agency -lrb- kjb -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de nato -pipe- 09.10.2008 us calls for more troops in afghanistan großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : us secretary of defense robert gates has called for more troops and effort in afghanistan the us has called on fellow nato members to allow the alliance to attack the flourishing opium trade in afghanistan in an effort to weaken the taliban . us defense secretary robert gates said the drugs trade brought windfalls of up to $ 80 million a year for the taliban insurgency in afghanistan .
" we need to have the opportunity to go after drug lords and drug laboratories and try and interrupt this flow of cash , " he told reporters at a two-day meeting of nato defense ministers which began thursday in budapest , hungary .
general john craddock , nato operations commander , likewise appealed to the members of the 26-nation alliance for the authority to attack laboratories , trafficking networks and drug lords in afghanistan to knock the wind out of the resurgent insurgency .
several member states remain sceptical of such a plan , however , with nations such as germany fearing any extension of nato 's role in afghanistan may lead to more violence , and , as a result , a turn of the tide of public support among afghans away from the western alliance .
gates also pushed his counterparts to increase their troop contributions in afghanistan , despite european reluctance to do so .
nato currently has a force of 50,700 soldiers in afghanistan , up from about 45,000 six months ago .
the german parliament agreed tuesday , oct .
7 to increase its contribution by 1,000 soldiers , raising its total to 4,500 .
the us contingent in afghanistan currently stands at 33,000 , including 13,000 under nato command .
georgian membership bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : saakashvili has called on nato to fulfil its pledges gates also used the first day of the budapest talks to further pitch georgian membership of nato , in spite of fierce opposition from russia and scepticism within the alliance .
" i urge our allies to support -lrb- the membership action plan -rrb- for georgia in december and to support georgia 's efforts to accomplish needed reform , " gates said alongside his georgian counterpart , davit kezerashvili , after the meeting .
nato leaders meeting in bucharest in april promised georgia it would be able to join the alliance at an unspecified future date .
but they postponed any decision on a possible membership action plan -lrb- map -rrb- until a foreign ministers ' meeting planned for december .
german chancellor angela merkel effectively blocked the map offer to georgia and ukraine in bucharest , arguing that it was too early for them to join the alliance .
“ heads of government of the alliance declared unanimously in april in bucharest that georgia should be a member of the alliance , " gates said in budapest .
" the question is whether we can get this accomplished at the foreign ministers ' meeting in december . "
kezerashvili said thursday that nato membership remained his country 's " top security priority . "
somali piracy bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : somali pirates have seized some 32 vessels this year also to come from the meeting were pledges to combat piracy off the coast of somalia , where a plethora of attacks and vessel hijackings have caused millions of dollars in losses , led to the kidnapping of innocent seafarers and pushed up insurance costs for boats sailing near the lawless east african country .
" allies agreed to have nato ships address piracy off of the coast of somalia soon , and escort world food program ships , in complementarity with other parties , for instance the eu , " a nato diplomat said during the talks .
as many as nine eu nations could take part in the maritime operation , including belgium , cyprus , france , germany , lithuania , the netherlands , spain , sweden and possibly britain . dw staff -lrb- dfm -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

despite his confidence in germany 's current soundness , the minister said that financial markets the world over , germany 's included , were still operating under a dense cloud of uncertainty and that he could not guarantee against any future nationalization plans for the nation 's banks .
" so far i do n't see the need for state takeovers in germany .
the german banking sector has been hit badly by the financial crisis but less hard " than in other countries , steinbrueck told the handelsblatt daily .
" but this might change as uncertainties about future developments are currently much too high , " he said as quoted by the paper .
the german government , together with banks and insurance companies , agreed late sunday , sept .
5 on a 50-billion-euro -lrb- $ 68 billion -rrb- deal to bail out the country 's stricken commercial property lender , hypo real estate .
steinbrueck said the german economy had been hit harder than previously expected , an impact which will leave its mark on the nation 's growth rate , slated to hover at between zero and 0.5 percent next year , down from the current forecast of 1.2 percent for 2009 .
european slow down bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the european central bank was among several banking bodies to drop interest rates germany 's growth predicament parallels that of the eurozone , which the european central bank -lrb- ecb -rrb- has said it would also seek to rework .
" our forecast of 1.2 percent growth in 2009 will be revised down , " ecb board member lorenzo bini smaghi told the italian financial daily il sole 24 ore without citing the new figure .
the central bank had already down-scaled its previous eurozone growth forecast of 1.5 percent last month .
" the second quarter -lrb- 2008 -rrb- was negative , and the third may be as well .
there 's a risk of more or less zero growth for several quarters , " bini smaghi said .
" it will depend a lot on the positive impact that will come from lowering interest rates , from a more competitive euro and especially from a sharp drop in prices of raw materials . "
wednesday saw a coordinated effort by central banks around the world to cut interest rates as a joint response to the global financial crisis .
the ecb dropped its interest rate to 3.75 percent . the decision was taken in coordination with central banks in britain , canada , sweden , switzerland and the united states , the ecb said in a statement .
deposit protection slammed bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : czech pm mirek topolanek has criticized the eu , which he will preside over next term but czech prime minister mirek topolanek , who is scheduled to be the next european union president , has condemned the eu 's steps to fight the global financial crisis as too interventionist .
topolanek specifically slammed several eu members for providing unlimited bank deposit protection , calling it " a shameless step " that boosts liquidity in those countries at the expense of others .

the federal ministry of the interior said the raids were carried out without any arrests .
authorities sought to obtain evidence against the homeland-loyal german youth , which goes by the german abbreviation hdj and is loosely linked to the far-right national democratic party , in preparation for a possible ban on the group .
the domestic spokesperson for the left party , ulla jelpke , said that she hopes the searches are the first step toward a ban on the group that first came to the public 's attention over the summer when a raid on a youth camp in mecklenburg west pomerania was carried out .
following the most recent raids , secretary of state august hanning said that the information would hopefully provide clarity on the organization. which some have said that hdj publications are " anti-semitic and racist . "
the group , founded in 1990 , is accused of being a right-wing extremist organization .
hdj publications were said by the ministry to be " anti-semitic and racist " and that " the hdj 's self-image is near in spirit to the ideology historically of the nazis . "
according to the federal ministry of the interior , the group maintains connections to the far-right national democratic party -lrb- npd -rrb- as well as other neo-nazi groups , including the kameradschafsszene . dw staff -lrb- cat -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

uefa head criticizes foreign ownership bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : uefa president michel platini says foreign ownership should be regulated the decision by german soccer officials to spread the good word about the bundesliga comes amid criticism by european soccer chief michel platini of the high rates of foreign ownership of some of europe 's largest clubs .
he said a soccer club 's identity was firmly connected not only to its location and fans , but also to its owners and players , and that if neither of the latter exhibited any resemblance to either of the former , then that was a recipe for the loss of soccer individuality and uniqueness .
" do you want in liverpool an arab sheikh as president with one brazilian coach and nine or 11 african players ?
" where is liverpool in that ?
we have to make some rules .
" what is football ?
football is a game and this game has become popular because of the identity .
you have to have identity .
that is where football 's popularity lies . "
platini , a former french national team midfield magician , said he would investigate the possibility of regulating foreign ownership of clubs across europe , but admitted that varying european national constitutions would be a substantial hurdle to overcome in that quest .

several clubs , notably from england , dominate european competitions , believed possible because of the exorbitant debts they all shoulder .
" we can not let things stay as they are , " taylor said .
" in some countries like germany and switzerland , stronger requirements are put on clubs in terms of bank guarantees and having no negative equity .
these are the models we have to look at . "
on tuesday , the chairman of england 's football association , lord david triesman , put the combined debt of english clubs at around 3 billion pounds .

customers who are not told about extra charges when they place their order will not have to pay those charges , says the proposal , which was issued wednesday , oct .
8 .
the retailer will also have to guarantee delivery anywhere within the eu within 30 days .
they will also have to compensate the purchaser within a week if the product is damaged or fails to arrive .
user friendly additionally , customers will have the right to a 14-day " cooling-off period , " during which they can change their minds and send the product back .
and retailers will no longer be allowed to insert clauses such as " the trader is not responsible for mistakes made by his agents " into contracts .
nor will they be allowed to pre-check boxes on online order forms that commit customers to buying extra services unless the customer unchecks the boxes .
according to figures from the commission , approximately 150 million eu citizens shop online , but only 30 million look for products in other eu member states - spending on average 800 euros -lrb- $ 1,090 -rrb- per year in the process .
fear of fraud at the same time , identical products in different member states can vary enormously in price .
an eight-gigabyte ipod nano , for example , can range in price from 169.44 euros in britain to 268.96 euros in hungary , a commission study said .
eu officials are keen to boost the volume of cross-border e-shopping in the bloc .
however , european consumers are still reluctant to buy from web sites in other countries , largely for fear of fraud .
according to the commission , the proportion of europeans shopping online rose from 23 to 30 percent between 2005 and 2008 , but the proportion of those doing so abroad rose only from 6 to 7 percent . dpa news agency -lrb- kjb -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the federal ministry of the interior said the raids were carried out without any arrests .
authorities sought to obtain evidence against the homeland-loyal german youth , which goes by the german abbreviation hdj and is loosely linked to the far-right national democratic party , in preparation for a possible ban on the group .
the domestic spokesperson for the left party , ulla jelpke , said that she hopes the searches are the first step toward a ban on the group that first came to the public 's attention over the summer when a raid on a youth camp in mecklenburg west pomerania was carried out .
following the most recent raids , secretary of state august hanning said that the information would hopefully provide clarity on the organization. which some have said that hdj publications are " anti-semitic and racist . "
the group , founded in 1990 , is accused of being a right-wing extremist organization .
hdj publications were said by the ministry to be " anti-semitic and racist " and that " the hdj 's self-image is near in spirit to the ideology historically of the nazis . "
according to the federal ministry of the interior , the group maintains connections to the far-right national democratic party -lrb- npd -rrb- as well as other neo-nazi groups , including the kameradschafsszene . dw staff -lrb- cat -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the federal ministry of the interior said the raids were carried out without any arrests .
authorities sought to obtain evidence against the homeland-loyal german youth , which goes by the german abbreviation hdj and is loosely linked to the far-right national democratic party , in preparation for a possible ban on the group .
the domestic spokesperson for the left party , ulla jelpke , said that she hopes the searches are the first step toward a ban on the group that first came to the public 's attention over the summer when a raid on a youth camp in mecklenburg west pomerania was carried out .
following the most recent raids , secretary of state august hanning said that the information would hopefully provide clarity on the organization. which some have said that hdj publications are " anti-semitic and racist . "
the group , founded in 1990 , is accused of being a right-wing extremist organization .
hdj publications were said by the ministry to be " anti-semitic and racist " and that " the hdj 's self-image is near in spirit to the ideology historically of the nazis . "
according to the federal ministry of the interior , the group maintains connections to the far-right national democratic party -lrb- npd -rrb- as well as other neo-nazi groups , including the kameradschafsszene . dw staff -lrb- cat -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

officially , there have been no secret talks . the afghan government is not shy to acknowledge that it tries to win over members of the armed opposition .
insurgents who accept the government ’ s proposals to cooperate politically are granted amnesty and integrated into civilian life .
one example of such a won-over insurgent is wakil ahmad muttawakil - a former taliban foreign minister who , in 2005 , even ran for parliament - albeit without success .
so when rumours started circulating that a government delegation had met members of the taliban in saudi arabia , nobody was surprised .
but the government quickly denied the rumours .
“ there were no talks and no talks have been arranged , ” said government spokesman homayoun hamidzadeh .
“ but president karzai has always said that he is involved in talks with the saudi king to clarify whether he could play a mediating role in the peace process in afghanistan .
the afghan side would warmly welcome any progress in this matter and then take part in talks . ”
informal meeting of enormous import however , independent observers tell a different story .
it would seem that , at a recent festive supper held by saudi king abdullah in mecca , a group of afghan mps and government officials met a taliban representative and also envoys of gulbuddin hekmatyar , the head of the afghanistan islamic party .
although the afghan delegation did not have an official mandate , the informal meeting still has enormous political import .
it means that if talks were to become possible in the future thanks to saudi mediation , a taliban spokesman , who has claimed responsibility for a series of terrorist attacks , would become an acceptable political partner in kabul .
citha maass , from the german institute for international and security affairs , was not surprised to hear about the talks : “ there have been suggestions of secret negotiations for some time now .
it is increasingly clear that the insurgency can not be fought only with military means . ”
pre-election strategy maass also thought that president karzai was thinking strategically , ahead of next year ’ s elections .
he needs to secure votes in the volatile eastern and southern provinces of afghanistan .
although he was elected with about 55 percent of the votes four years ago , his popularity ratings have sunk to 17 percent .
“ if there are secret negotiations and the taliban agree not to disrupt the election process , then a political price will have to be paid .
this would likely entail that afghanistan ’ s political process stray even further away from democracy , ” said maass .
democratic freedoms within sharia law although the country ’ s constitution enshrines democratic freedoms , these are practised within the framework of islamic sharia law .
critics fear that if the taliban become once again part of the political sphere in kabul , they will misuse the constitution in favour of their own interpretation of islam .
officially , the taliban spokesmen have refused to take part in talks with what they call the puppet government in kabul until foreign forces leave the country .

officially , there have been no secret talks . the afghan government is not shy to acknowledge that it tries to win over members of the armed opposition .
insurgents who accept the government ’ s proposals to cooperate politically are granted amnesty and integrated into civilian life .
one example of such a won-over insurgent is wakil ahmad muttawakil - a former taliban foreign minister who , in 2005 , even ran for parliament - albeit without success .
so when rumours started circulating that a government delegation had met members of the taliban in saudi arabia , nobody was surprised .
but the government quickly denied the rumours .
“ there were no talks and no talks have been arranged , ” said government spokesman homayoun hamidzadeh .
“ but president karzai has always said that he is involved in talks with the saudi king to clarify whether he could play a mediating role in the peace process in afghanistan .
the afghan side would warmly welcome any progress in this matter and then take part in talks . ”
informal meeting of enormous import however , independent observers tell a different story .
it would seem that , at a recent festive supper held by saudi king abdullah in mecca , a group of afghan mps and government officials met a taliban representative and also envoys of gulbuddin hekmatyar , the head of the afghanistan islamic party .
although the afghan delegation did not have an official mandate , the informal meeting still has enormous political import .
it means that if talks were to become possible in the future thanks to saudi mediation , a taliban spokesman , who has claimed responsibility for a series of terrorist attacks , would become an acceptable political partner in kabul .
citha maass , from the german institute for international and security affairs , was not surprised to hear about the talks : “ there have been suggestions of secret negotiations for some time now .
it is increasingly clear that the insurgency can not be fought only with military means . ”
pre-election strategy maass also thought that president karzai was thinking strategically , ahead of next year ’ s elections .
he needs to secure votes in the volatile eastern and southern provinces of afghanistan .
although he was elected with about 55 percent of the votes four years ago , his popularity ratings have sunk to 17 percent .
“ if there are secret negotiations and the taliban agree not to disrupt the election process , then a political price will have to be paid .
this would likely entail that afghanistan ’ s political process stray even further away from democracy , ” said maass .
democratic freedoms within sharia law although the country ’ s constitution enshrines democratic freedoms , these are practised within the framework of islamic sharia law .
critics fear that if the taliban become once again part of the political sphere in kabul , they will misuse the constitution in favour of their own interpretation of islam .
officially , the taliban spokesmen have refused to take part in talks with what they call the puppet government in kabul until foreign forces leave the country .
however , some observers think that , with time , the older cadres - mullah mohammed omar and his supporters - might , as the taliban ’ s radical young cadres start questioning their authority more and more , seek their own salvation in a political compromise with the government . dw staff -lrb- act -rrb- 09/10/08 send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic 9801 environment the next round of global climate change talks kicks off in cancun at the end of the month .

customers who are not told about extra charges when they place their order will not have to pay those charges , says the proposal , which was issued wednesday , oct .
8 .
the retailer will also have to guarantee delivery anywhere within the eu within 30 days .
they will also have to compensate the purchaser within a week if the product is damaged or fails to arrive .
user friendly additionally , customers will have the right to a 14-day " cooling-off period , " during which they can change their minds and send the product back .
and retailers will no longer be allowed to insert clauses such as " the trader is not responsible for mistakes made by his agents " into contracts .
nor will they be allowed to pre-check boxes on online order forms that commit customers to buying extra services unless the customer unchecks the boxes .
according to figures from the commission , approximately 150 million eu citizens shop online , but only 30 million look for products in other eu member states - spending on average 800 euros -lrb- $ 1,090 -rrb- per year in the process .
fear of fraud at the same time , identical products in different member states can vary enormously in price .
an eight-gigabyte ipod nano , for example , can range in price from 169.44 euros in britain to 268.96 euros in hungary , a commission study said .
eu officials are keen to boost the volume of cross-border e-shopping in the bloc .
however , european consumers are still reluctant to buy from web sites in other countries , largely for fear of fraud .
according to the commission , the proportion of europeans shopping online rose from 23 to 30 percent between 2005 and 2008 , but the proportion of those doing so abroad rose only from 6 to 7 percent . dpa news agency -lrb- kjb -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

8 .
imf analysts also predicted that germany , europe 's largest economy , will stall in 2009 and france 's will grow by a marginal 0.2 percent .
italy and spain will see their economies shrink by 0.2 percent , according to the semi-annual world economic outlook .
with european nations " moving close to or into recession , " the imf urged forceful action by policymakers to combat the crisis with measures such as lower interest rates .
ecb chief : " collect yourselves " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : wall street dropped even after the fed announced interest rate cuts hours before the report 's release , the european central bank and the us federal reserve led key central banks in a coordinated emergency cut in benchmark rates by 0.5 percentage points .
european central bank chief jean-claude trichet called the move " a significant signal of confidence to the markets . "
speaking on france 3 television , he told viewers , " we can say to the markets we have regained control over price stability in the medium term . "
markets continued to fall nevertheless , with wall street down more than two percent , london and frankfurt more than five percent , and paris more than six percent .
" we all together call upon the market participants who are in this state of intense turbulence , we tell them to collect themselves , there are elements of confidence out there , " said the ecb chief , ahead of the annual meetings of the imf and world bank to be held this weekend in washington .
" excessive pessimism is ill advised . "
on a brighter note , the imf said falling real estate prices in europe are less likely to set off a major housing-related credit crunch than in the us .
higher savings rates , lower debt , more prudent mortgage lending and much more limited opportunities for equity withdrawal on real estate work in europe 's favor , the report said .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : prudent lending practices in europe have kept the housing market from turning upside down the downturn in residential real estate will , however , have " an appreciable short-term impact " in countries like ireland , spain and britain .
austria , germany and switzerland appear the least at risk in that respect , the imf said .
appeal to european policymakers still , the imf appealed to eu governments to move " toward more joint responsibility and accountability for financial stability " and urged european policymakers to make prudent choices .
" restoring confidence now requires a decisive commitment to concerted and coordinated action to alleviate financial stresses and avoid the serious risk of backtracking on european financial integration , " imf analysts said .
euro zone governments , whose deficit spending is limited by rules meant to protect the euro 's value , should focus emergency injections " on measures to stabilize the financial sector , as needed , " the report said .
eu finance ministers , scrambling to react to the spill-over , agreed tuesday to more than double the public guarantee for private bank deposits to at least 50,000 euros -lrb- $ 68,000 -rrb- .
dexia gets relief from benelux meanwhile , the governments of belgium , france and luxembourg have agreed to a plan to help the struggling bank dexia , belgium 's le soir newspaper reported thursday .
the plan would create a special vehicle to absorb the bank 's toxic assets and provide fresh liquidity .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : shares in dexia have fallen more than 70 percent in the last year " there will be a public guarantee from the french , belgian and luxembourg states on a maximum 4.5 billion euros that dexia is going to borrow on the market , " a source close to the luxembourg government told afp news agency .
the move comes despite a 6.4 billion euro bailout package that the three governments put together for dexia last week .

with part of the baltics already believed to be in recession , the imf noted that southern europe 's continuing boom is based on much the same mix of consumer spending , loans and capital investment driven by western banks and companies .
inflation , while likely to ease in 2009 , is eating into people 's spending power . overall , the region from the baltics to bulgaria is headed for a third year of slowing growth , down to 3.5 percent in 2009 from a predicted 5.0 percent in 2008 , the imf said in a report released in washington .

" the policy challenge is how to engineer a soft landing " while keeping the region on track toward western european living standards , imf analysts said . they foresee a clear three-way split for the european union 's emerging economies in 2009 : the three baltic nations ailing after a long spending and investment boom , with latvia 's economy shrinking by 2.2 percent ; central europe growing an average 3.6 percent ; and romania and bulgaria still going strong .
" like the baltics several years ago , these countries are still enjoying ' good times , " ' the imf said of the two south-eastern eu members . but romania , expected to lead the region this year with 8.6-percent growth , and bulgaria need to recognize the " more volatile external financing conditions " and rein in public spending , the report said .
underscoring the jitters , plunging share prices forced romania 's stock exchange in bucharest to halt trading for the day shortly after opening wednesday .
in the baltics , recovery is expected to begin during the second half of 2009 , but authorities should " resist the temptation to significantly ease fiscal policy in the downturn " and work toward balanced budgets , the imf added . dpa news agency -lrb- mrm -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

1 , was tipped to lead growth next year - 5.6 percent - followed by european union newcomers romania , 4.8 percent , and bulgaria , 4.2 percent .
with part of the baltics already believed to be in recession , the imf noted that southern europe 's continuing boom is based on much the same mix of consumer spending , loans and capital investment driven by western banks and companies .
inflation , while likely to ease in 2009 , is eating into people 's spending power . overall , the region from the baltics to bulgaria is headed for a third year of slowing growth , down to 3.5 percent in 2009 from a predicted 5.0 percent in 2008 , the imf said in a report released in washington .
and the risk that the region 's financial imbalances will spook investors is rising at a time of tighter credit , the semi-annual world economic outlook said . " growth is expected to continue to decelerate markedly , including on account of diminishing capital inflows and tighter financial constraints , " the survey said . indirect effect soaring food and energy prices are slowing consumer spending , while the global credit crunch and sickly growth in western europe - eastern europe 's main market - is weighing on investment and exports , the imf said .
it added that while banks operating in emerging europe have little direct exposure to the us subprime mortgage market , they and their foreign parents are affected by the widening turmoil in western europe . " the policy challenge is how to engineer a soft landing " while keeping the region on track toward western european living standards , imf analysts said . they foresee a clear three-way split for the european union 's emerging economies in 2009 : the three baltic nations ailing after a long spending and investment boom , with latvia 's economy shrinking by 2.2 percent ; central europe growing an average 3.6 percent ; and romania and bulgaria still going strong .
" like the baltics several years ago , these countries are still enjoying ' good times , " ' the imf said of the two south-eastern eu members . but romania , expected to lead the region this year with 8.6-percent growth , and bulgaria need to recognize the " more volatile external financing conditions " and rein in public spending , the report said .
underscoring the jitters , plunging share prices forced romania 's stock exchange in bucharest to halt trading for the day shortly after opening wednesday .
in the baltics , recovery is expected to begin during the second half of 2009 , but authorities should " resist the temptation to significantly ease fiscal policy in the downturn " and work toward balanced budgets , the imf added . dpa news agency -lrb- mrm -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

authorities sought to obtain evidence against the homeland-loyal german youth , which goes by the german abbreviation hdj and is loosely linked to the far-right national democratic party , in preparation for a possible ban on the group .

following the most recent raids , secretary of state august hanning said that the information would hopefully provide clarity on the organization. which some have said that hdj publications are " anti-semitic and racist . "
the group , founded in 1990 , is accused of being a right-wing extremist organization .
hdj publications were said by the ministry to be " anti-semitic and racist " and that " the hdj 's self-image is near in spirit to the ideology historically of the nazis . "

customers who are not told about extra charges when they place their order will not have to pay those charges , says the proposal , which was issued wednesday , oct .

the retailer will also have to guarantee delivery anywhere within the eu within 30 days .
they will also have to compensate the purchaser within a week if the product is damaged or fails to arrive .
user friendly additionally , customers will have the right to a 14-day " cooling-off period , " during which they can change their minds and send the product back .
and retailers will no longer be allowed to insert clauses such as " the trader is not responsible for mistakes made by his agents " into contracts .
nor will they be allowed to pre-check boxes on online order forms that commit customers to buying extra services unless the customer unchecks the boxes .
according to figures from the commission , approximately 150 million eu citizens shop online , but only 30 million look for products in other eu member states - spending on average 800 euros -lrb- $ 1,090 -rrb- per year in the process .

imf head dominique strauss-kahn said thursday that all non-coordinated action in the european union against the financial crisis " should be avoided , if not condemned . " " restoring confidence now requires a decisive commitment to concerted and coordinated action to alleviate financial stresses and avoid the serious risk of backtracking on european financial integration , " imf analysts added . until wednesday , when central banks around the world cut main interest rates in a coordinated effort , european nations had largely been left to their own designs in terms of solving the credit crunch after a french proposal for an eu-wide fund was shot down . dw reviews recent steps european financial leaders have recently taken to stabilize markets and shore up the international banking system . germany bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hypo real estate needed to be bailed out twice before it was rescued as europe 's largest economy , germany has n't been able to avoid the global credit crunch , despite early statements from finance minister peer steinbrueck that it was an american problem . the government bailed out commercial property lender hypo real estate to the tune 35 billion euros -lrb- $ 47.9 billion -rrb- .

but experts in some european capitals were irritated that ireland acted without consulting other nations .
the irish government , however , calmed nerves somewhat by extending blanket guarantees offered to irish banks to five foreign institutions operating on the emerald isle . britain british prime minister gordon brown announced his country 's 50 billion pound bank rescue plan on wednesday .
the plan included the partial nationalization of britain 's eight main banks , 200 billion pounds in short-term loans and 250 billion pounds in inter-bank loan guarantees . " extraordinary times call for ... bold and far-reaching solutions , " brown said while introducing the package .

" our forecast of 1.2 percent growth in 2009 will be revised down , " ecb board member lorenzo bini smaghi told the italian financial daily il sole 24 ore without citing the new figure .
the central bank had already down-scaled its previous eurozone growth forecast of 1.5 percent last month .
" the second quarter -lrb- 2008 -rrb- was negative , and the third may be as well .
there 's a risk of more or less zero growth for several quarters , " bini smaghi said .
" it will depend a lot on the positive impact that will come from lowering interest rates , from a more competitive euro and especially from a sharp drop in prices of raw materials . "
wednesday saw a coordinated effort by central banks around the world to cut interest rates as a joint response to the global financial crisis .
the ecb dropped its interest rate to 3.75 percent . the decision was taken in coordination with central banks in britain , canada , sweden , switzerland and the united states , the ecb said in a statement .

topolanek specifically slammed several eu members for providing unlimited bank deposit protection , calling it " a shameless step " that boosts liquidity in those countries at the expense of others .
" all these measures are absolutely artificial .
they contradict the eu 's substance , " news agency ctk quoted him as saying late wednesday during a visit to turkey .

9 , said the deutsche fussball liga -lrb- dfl -rrb- aims to raise its income from television rights sold abroad from 20 million euros per year to 35 million euros over the next three years .
the dfl 's goal was to claw back lost ground and rake in a foreign income comparable to the spanish and the italian leagues , which earn around 60 million euros per year , dfl official christian seifert was quoted as saying .
the english premier league is by far the most profitable competition in europe with around 300 million euros generated each year outside england .
key foreign markets include asia , where bundesliga champions bayern munich played after finishing the season 2007-2008 , and the middle east , which is a growing destination for winter-break training camps of clubs .
die welt said the dfl had set aside 2 million euros for bonus payments and that clubs playing or training abroad would work closely with the dfl .
uefa head criticizes foreign ownership bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : uefa president michel platini says foreign ownership should be regulated the decision by german soccer officials to spread the good word about the bundesliga comes amid criticism by european soccer chief michel platini of the high rates of foreign ownership of some of europe 's largest clubs .
he said a soccer club 's identity was firmly connected not only to its location and fans , but also to its owners and players , and that if neither of the latter exhibited any resemblance to either of the former , then that was a recipe for the loss of soccer individuality and uniqueness .
" do you want in liverpool an arab sheikh as president with one brazilian coach and nine or 11 african players ?
" where is liverpool in that ?
we have to make some rules .
" what is football ?
football is a game and this game has become popular because of the identity .
you have to have identity .
that is where football 's popularity lies . "
platini , a former french national team midfield magician , said he would investigate the possibility of regulating foreign ownership of clubs across europe , but admitted that varying european national constitutions would be a substantial hurdle to overcome in that quest .
football debt to be examined bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : playing rosters are pushing english clubs into record levels of debt a top uefa official said wednesday that the financial requirements model used for teams in the german and swiss national leagues was viable for use as the basis for a europe-wide system to regulate club debt .
david taylor , uefa general secretary , told a conference in london that the european soccer body would launch talks next week on potential changes to the way clubs are licensed with the aim of reviewing how they run their finances .
several clubs , notably from england , dominate european competitions , believed possible because of the exorbitant debts they all shoulder .
" we can not let things stay as they are , " taylor said .
" in some countries like germany and switzerland , stronger requirements are put on clubs in terms of bank guarantees and having no negative equity .
these are the models we have to look at . "
on tuesday , the chairman of england 's football association , lord david triesman , put the combined debt of english clubs at around 3 billion pounds .
he warned of " very tangible dangers " to large clubs such as liverpool , manchester united and chelsea in the current uncertain financial times . dw staff -lrb- dfm -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

9 , said the deutsche fussball liga -lrb- dfl -rrb- aims to raise its income from television rights sold abroad from 20 million euros per year to 35 million euros over the next three years .
the dfl 's goal was to claw back lost ground and rake in a foreign income comparable to the spanish and the italian leagues , which earn around 60 million euros per year , dfl official christian seifert was quoted as saying .
the english premier league is by far the most profitable competition in europe with around 300 million euros generated each year outside england .
key foreign markets include asia , where bundesliga champions bayern munich played after finishing the season 2007-2008 , and the middle east , which is a growing destination for winter-break training camps of clubs .

uefa head criticizes foreign ownership bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : uefa president michel platini says foreign ownership should be regulated the decision by german soccer officials to spread the good word about the bundesliga comes amid criticism by european soccer chief michel platini of the high rates of foreign ownership of some of europe 's largest clubs .
he said a soccer club 's identity was firmly connected not only to its location and fans , but also to its owners and players , and that if neither of the latter exhibited any resemblance to either of the former , then that was a recipe for the loss of soccer individuality and uniqueness .
" do you want in liverpool an arab sheikh as president with one brazilian coach and nine or 11 african players ?
" where is liverpool in that ?
we have to make some rules .
" what is football ?
football is a game and this game has become popular because of the identity .
you have to have identity .
that is where football 's popularity lies . "
platini , a former french national team midfield magician , said he would investigate the possibility of regulating foreign ownership of clubs across europe , but admitted that varying european national constitutions would be a substantial hurdle to overcome in that quest .

david taylor , uefa general secretary , told a conference in london that the european soccer body would launch talks next week on potential changes to the way clubs are licensed with the aim of reviewing how they run their finances .
several clubs , notably from england , dominate european competitions , believed possible because of the exorbitant debts they all shoulder .
" we can not let things stay as they are , " taylor said .
" in some countries like germany and switzerland , stronger requirements are put on clubs in terms of bank guarantees and having no negative equity .
these are the models we have to look at . "
on tuesday , the chairman of england 's football association , lord david triesman , put the combined debt of english clubs at around 3 billion pounds .
he warned of " very tangible dangers " to large clubs such as liverpool , manchester united and chelsea in the current uncertain financial times . dw staff -lrb- dfm -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" we can not let things stay as they are , " taylor said .
" in some countries like germany and switzerland , stronger requirements are put on clubs in terms of bank guarantees and having no negative equity .
these are the models we have to look at . "
on tuesday , the chairman of england 's football association , lord david triesman , put the combined debt of english clubs at around 3 billion pounds .
he warned of " very tangible dangers " to large clubs such as liverpool , manchester united and chelsea in the current uncertain financial times . dw staff -lrb- dfm -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

despite his confidence in germany 's current soundness , the minister said that financial markets the world over , germany 's included , were still operating under a dense cloud of uncertainty and that he could not guarantee against any future nationalization plans for the nation 's banks .
" so far i do n't see the need for state takeovers in germany .
the german banking sector has been hit badly by the financial crisis but less hard " than in other countries , steinbrueck told the handelsblatt daily .
" but this might change as uncertainties about future developments are currently much too high , " he said as quoted by the paper .
the german government , together with banks and insurance companies , agreed late sunday , sept .
5 on a 50-billion-euro -lrb- $ 68 billion -rrb- deal to bail out the country 's stricken commercial property lender , hypo real estate .
steinbrueck said the german economy had been hit harder than previously expected , an impact which will leave its mark on the nation 's growth rate , slated to hover at between zero and 0.5 percent next year , down from the current forecast of 1.2 percent for 2009 .
european slow down bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the european central bank was among several banking bodies to drop interest rates germany 's growth predicament parallels that of the eurozone , which the european central bank -lrb- ecb -rrb- has said it would also seek to rework .
" our forecast of 1.2 percent growth in 2009 will be revised down , " ecb board member lorenzo bini smaghi told the italian financial daily il sole 24 ore without citing the new figure .
the central bank had already down-scaled its previous eurozone growth forecast of 1.5 percent last month .
" the second quarter -lrb- 2008 -rrb- was negative , and the third may be as well .
there 's a risk of more or less zero growth for several quarters , " bini smaghi said .
" it will depend a lot on the positive impact that will come from lowering interest rates , from a more competitive euro and especially from a sharp drop in prices of raw materials . "
wednesday saw a coordinated effort by central banks around the world to cut interest rates as a joint response to the global financial crisis .
the ecb dropped its interest rate to 3.75 percent . the decision was taken in coordination with central banks in britain , canada , sweden , switzerland and the united states , the ecb said in a statement .
deposit protection slammed bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : czech pm mirek topolanek has criticized the eu , which he will preside over next term but czech prime minister mirek topolanek , who is scheduled to be the next european union president , has condemned the eu 's steps to fight the global financial crisis as too interventionist .
topolanek specifically slammed several eu members for providing unlimited bank deposit protection , calling it " a shameless step " that boosts liquidity in those countries at the expense of others .
" all these measures are absolutely artificial .
they contradict the eu 's substance , " news agency ctk quoted him as saying late wednesday during a visit to turkey .

officially , there have been no secret talks . the afghan government is not shy to acknowledge that it tries to win over members of the armed opposition .
insurgents who accept the government ’ s proposals to cooperate politically are granted amnesty and integrated into civilian life .
one example of such a won-over insurgent is wakil ahmad muttawakil - a former taliban foreign minister who , in 2005 , even ran for parliament - albeit without success .
so when rumours started circulating that a government delegation had met members of the taliban in saudi arabia , nobody was surprised .
but the government quickly denied the rumours .
“ there were no talks and no talks have been arranged , ” said government spokesman homayoun hamidzadeh .
“ but president karzai has always said that he is involved in talks with the saudi king to clarify whether he could play a mediating role in the peace process in afghanistan .
the afghan side would warmly welcome any progress in this matter and then take part in talks . ”
informal meeting of enormous import however , independent observers tell a different story .
it would seem that , at a recent festive supper held by saudi king abdullah in mecca , a group of afghan mps and government officials met a taliban representative and also envoys of gulbuddin hekmatyar , the head of the afghanistan islamic party .
although the afghan delegation did not have an official mandate , the informal meeting still has enormous political import .
it means that if talks were to become possible in the future thanks to saudi mediation , a taliban spokesman , who has claimed responsibility for a series of terrorist attacks , would become an acceptable political partner in kabul .
citha maass , from the german institute for international and security affairs , was not surprised to hear about the talks : “ there have been suggestions of secret negotiations for some time now .
it is increasingly clear that the insurgency can not be fought only with military means . ”
pre-election strategy maass also thought that president karzai was thinking strategically , ahead of next year ’ s elections .
he needs to secure votes in the volatile eastern and southern provinces of afghanistan .
although he was elected with about 55 percent of the votes four years ago , his popularity ratings have sunk to 17 percent .
“ if there are secret negotiations and the taliban agree not to disrupt the election process , then a political price will have to be paid .
this would likely entail that afghanistan ’ s political process stray even further away from democracy , ” said maass .
democratic freedoms within sharia law although the country ’ s constitution enshrines democratic freedoms , these are practised within the framework of islamic sharia law .
critics fear that if the taliban become once again part of the political sphere in kabul , they will misuse the constitution in favour of their own interpretation of islam .
officially , the taliban spokesmen have refused to take part in talks with what they call the puppet government in kabul until foreign forces leave the country .
however , some observers think that , with time , the older cadres - mullah mohammed omar and his supporters - might , as the taliban ’ s radical young cadres start questioning their authority more and more , seek their own salvation in a political compromise with the government . dw staff -lrb- act -rrb- 09/10/08 send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic 9798 global media forum human rights in a globalized world - challenges for the media japanese economy japan 's earthquake and tsunami are likely to affect the japanese economy in the coming weeks .

officially , there have been no secret talks . the afghan government is not shy to acknowledge that it tries to win over members of the armed opposition .
insurgents who accept the government ’ s proposals to cooperate politically are granted amnesty and integrated into civilian life .
one example of such a won-over insurgent is wakil ahmad muttawakil - a former taliban foreign minister who , in 2005 , even ran for parliament - albeit without success .
so when rumours started circulating that a government delegation had met members of the taliban in saudi arabia , nobody was surprised .
but the government quickly denied the rumours .
“ there were no talks and no talks have been arranged , ” said government spokesman homayoun hamidzadeh .
“ but president karzai has always said that he is involved in talks with the saudi king to clarify whether he could play a mediating role in the peace process in afghanistan .
the afghan side would warmly welcome any progress in this matter and then take part in talks . ”
informal meeting of enormous import however , independent observers tell a different story .
it would seem that , at a recent festive supper held by saudi king abdullah in mecca , a group of afghan mps and government officials met a taliban representative and also envoys of gulbuddin hekmatyar , the head of the afghanistan islamic party .
although the afghan delegation did not have an official mandate , the informal meeting still has enormous political import .
it means that if talks were to become possible in the future thanks to saudi mediation , a taliban spokesman , who has claimed responsibility for a series of terrorist attacks , would become an acceptable political partner in kabul .
citha maass , from the german institute for international and security affairs , was not surprised to hear about the talks : “ there have been suggestions of secret negotiations for some time now .
it is increasingly clear that the insurgency can not be fought only with military means . ”
pre-election strategy maass also thought that president karzai was thinking strategically , ahead of next year ’ s elections .
he needs to secure votes in the volatile eastern and southern provinces of afghanistan .
although he was elected with about 55 percent of the votes four years ago , his popularity ratings have sunk to 17 percent .
“ if there are secret negotiations and the taliban agree not to disrupt the election process , then a political price will have to be paid .
this would likely entail that afghanistan ’ s political process stray even further away from democracy , ” said maass .
democratic freedoms within sharia law although the country ’ s constitution enshrines democratic freedoms , these are practised within the framework of islamic sharia law .
critics fear that if the taliban become once again part of the political sphere in kabul , they will misuse the constitution in favour of their own interpretation of islam .
officially , the taliban spokesmen have refused to take part in talks with what they call the puppet government in kabul until foreign forces leave the country .
however , some observers think that , with time , the older cadres - mullah mohammed omar and his supporters - might , as the taliban ’ s radical young cadres start questioning their authority more and more , seek their own salvation in a political compromise with the government . dw staff -lrb- act -rrb- 09/10/08 send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic 9798 media center watch and listen explore new content daily in dw 's multimedia archive .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de asia -pipe- 09.10.2008 negotiating with the taliban großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : former taliban foreign minister wakil ahmad muttawakil was " won over " by the kabul government as western military officials question the chances of winning the war in afghanistan , kabul is informally seeking political compromise with taliban insurgents .
officially , there have been no secret talks . the afghan government is not shy to acknowledge that it tries to win over members of the armed opposition .
insurgents who accept the government ’ s proposals to cooperate politically are granted amnesty and integrated into civilian life .
one example of such a won-over insurgent is wakil ahmad muttawakil - a former taliban foreign minister who , in 2005 , even ran for parliament - albeit without success .
so when rumours started circulating that a government delegation had met members of the taliban in saudi arabia , nobody was surprised .
but the government quickly denied the rumours .
“ there were no talks and no talks have been arranged , ” said government spokesman homayoun hamidzadeh .
“ but president karzai has always said that he is involved in talks with the saudi king to clarify whether he could play a mediating role in the peace process in afghanistan .
the afghan side would warmly welcome any progress in this matter and then take part in talks . ”
informal meeting of enormous import however , independent observers tell a different story .
it would seem that , at a recent festive supper held by saudi king abdullah in mecca , a group of afghan mps and government officials met a taliban representative and also envoys of gulbuddin hekmatyar , the head of the afghanistan islamic party .
although the afghan delegation did not have an official mandate , the informal meeting still has enormous political import .
it means that if talks were to become possible in the future thanks to saudi mediation , a taliban spokesman , who has claimed responsibility for a series of terrorist attacks , would become an acceptable political partner in kabul .
citha maass , from the german institute for international and security affairs , was not surprised to hear about the talks : “ there have been suggestions of secret negotiations for some time now .
it is increasingly clear that the insurgency can not be fought only with military means . ”
pre-election strategy maass also thought that president karzai was thinking strategically , ahead of next year ’ s elections .
he needs to secure votes in the volatile eastern and southern provinces of afghanistan .
although he was elected with about 55 percent of the votes four years ago , his popularity ratings have sunk to 17 percent .
“ if there are secret negotiations and the taliban agree not to disrupt the election process , then a political price will have to be paid .
this would likely entail that afghanistan ’ s political process stray even further away from democracy , ” said maass .
democratic freedoms within sharia law although the country ’ s constitution enshrines democratic freedoms , these are practised within the framework of islamic sharia law .
critics fear that if the taliban become once again part of the political sphere in kabul , they will misuse the constitution in favour of their own interpretation of islam .
officially , the taliban spokesmen have refused to take part in talks with what they call the puppet government in kabul until foreign forces leave the country .
however , some observers think that , with time , the older cadres - mullah mohammed omar and his supporters - might , as the taliban ’ s radical young cadres start questioning their authority more and more , seek their own salvation in a political compromise with the government . dw staff -lrb- act -rrb- 09/10/08 send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic 9798 kashmir earthquake five years ago , an earthquake struck pakistan-administered kashmir , killing some 80,000 people .

christian ehler , a member of the european parliament , talks to deutsche welle about what the eu nations can do about it . deutsche welle : some eu countries have created unlimited guarantees for savings accounts .
how much sense do these unilateral actions make ?
christian ehler : i think that it certainly makes sense , in the current crisis , to regain the trust of customers by undertaking these sorts of national guarantees for bank accounts .
in the long term , of course , it is n't a solution , because you have to keep in mind that small countries , like iceland , would be completely overwhelmed if their banking sectors were to hand out such guarantees . one potential consequence has been discussed .
namely that customers would transfer their money to other countries which have wide reaching guarantees , to what extent might that result in unfair competition on the housing market ?
i believe that the current situation makes it even more important that we regain people 's trust .
out of all the parties involved , consumers are reacting the more reasonably .
nevertheless , it has to be said that consumers want to know that their money is safe in these sorts of situations .
so far it has been really important to send this signal .
in the long run that is n't a solution because it could perpetuate unfair competition .
i think that for now it 's just a temporary solution and it 's a step in the right direction wo n't the eu countries have to work together if they want a widespread rescue packet like the one in the us ?
they ca n't , plain and simple .
there are two reasons for this .
the one is money market policy .
there we have the european central bank .
that 's the biggest hero of the international finance crisis .
it was different in america , where on the one side there was the markets with liquidity , which had to ensure that the on the other side interests would n't sink too low , which brought put us in danger of inflation .
that 's what we do in money market policy because there we have a contractual basis .
when it comes to financial policy , every eu country has its own sovereignty .
they each have responsibility over their national own banking supervision .
because of that they have to take on risks nationally .
that can change when some member countries are no longer able to do that .
but just look at the reactions on sunday to the quick decisions , which were necessary in the case of hypo real estate .
the idea that 27 member countries could all agree and the idea that it would come with a high risk that some countries would be forced to come up with billions of euros to bail out a bank in greece or the netherlands does n't seem to me to be really feasible at the moment . after the mini summit over the weekend the french president , nicolas sarkozy , announced that the eu stability and growth pact will be softened .
so countries can still contract more debts .
is that a good sign ?
i not only believe that it is n't a good sign , but that it 's wrong , plain and simple .
the instuments that we have there , namely the stability and growth pact , have proven themselves reliable .
and it is clearly defined in the stability pact how much national debt a nation must have and still be able to respond in a flexible way to special situations – and the collapse of large european banks is a special situation .
but that has nothing to do with the fact that we can not and will not tolerate the relatively lax french deal with their finance policies in the stability pact .
keep this in mind : the things that are necessary for a state to intervene in order to stabilize the financial market is made possible by the stability and growth pact .
everything else is just decoration and does n't make much sense . christain ehler is an economist and member of the european parliament and sits on the finance committee . interview : guenther birkenstock -lrb- mrm -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

according to a press report released earlier in the day , turbulence on equity markets caused by the international financial crisis prompted the delay of the sale of a 24.9 percent stake , in what is set to be the last major privatisation in europe 's biggest economy .
deutsche bahn was to list a 24.9 percent stake in its freight and passenger unit on the stock market on october 27 .
but unnamed financial sources quoted by the financial times deutschland 's online edition said the initial public offering -lrb- ipo -rrb- will now not take place until november at the earliest .
the government was hoping to generate some five or six billion euros -lrb- seven or eight billion dollars -rrb- from the sale and chief executive hartmut mehdorn had already begun talking to potential investors in london and moscow , the ftd said .
however , there have been sharp falls in stock markets in recent days due to the international financial crisis .
the government is now worried that it would not get as much money as it hoped and that it would be better to wait for markets to recover .
german finance minister peer steinbrueck conceded on monday that the turbulence might force the listing to be postponed .
" we have to ask ourselves if the timing is right , " steinbrueck told reporters , noting " very unfavourable conditions in the market . " dw staff -lrb- mrm -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de nato -pipe- 09.10.2008 us calls for more troops in afghanistan großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : us secretary of defense robert gates has called for more troops and effort in afghanistan the us has called on fellow nato members to allow the alliance to attack the flourishing opium trade in afghanistan in an effort to weaken the taliban . us defense secretary robert gates said the drugs trade brought windfalls of up to $ 80 million a year for the taliban insurgency in afghanistan .
" we need to have the opportunity to go after drug lords and drug laboratories and try and interrupt this flow of cash , " he told reporters at a two-day meeting of nato defense ministers which began thursday in budapest , hungary .
general john craddock , nato operations commander , likewise appealed to the members of the 26-nation alliance for the authority to attack laboratories , trafficking networks and drug lords in afghanistan to knock the wind out of the resurgent insurgency .
several member states remain sceptical of such a plan , however , with nations such as germany fearing any extension of nato 's role in afghanistan may lead to more violence , and , as a result , a turn of the tide of public support among afghans away from the western alliance .
gates also pushed his counterparts to increase their troop contributions in afghanistan , despite european reluctance to do so .
nato currently has a force of 50,700 soldiers in afghanistan , up from about 45,000 six months ago .
the german parliament agreed tuesday , oct .
7 to increase its contribution by 1,000 soldiers , raising its total to 4,500 .

" we need to have the opportunity to go after drug lords and drug laboratories and try and interrupt this flow of cash , " he told reporters at a two-day meeting of nato defense ministers which began thursday in budapest , hungary .
general john craddock , nato operations commander , likewise appealed to the members of the 26-nation alliance for the authority to attack laboratories , trafficking networks and drug lords in afghanistan to knock the wind out of the resurgent insurgency .
several member states remain sceptical of such a plan , however , with nations such as germany fearing any extension of nato 's role in afghanistan may lead to more violence , and , as a result , a turn of the tide of public support among afghans away from the western alliance .
gates also pushed his counterparts to increase their troop contributions in afghanistan , despite european reluctance to do so .
nato currently has a force of 50,700 soldiers in afghanistan , up from about 45,000 six months ago .
the german parliament agreed tuesday , oct .

nato leaders meeting in bucharest in april promised georgia it would be able to join the alliance at an unspecified future date .
but they postponed any decision on a possible membership action plan -lrb- map -rrb- until a foreign ministers ' meeting planned for december .
german chancellor angela merkel effectively blocked the map offer to georgia and ukraine in bucharest , arguing that it was too early for them to join the alliance .
“ heads of government of the alliance declared unanimously in april in bucharest that georgia should be a member of the alliance , " gates said in budapest .

" we need to have the opportunity to go after drug lords and drug laboratories and try and interrupt this flow of cash , " he told reporters at a two-day meeting of nato defense ministers which began thursday in budapest , hungary .
general john craddock , nato operations commander , likewise appealed to the members of the 26-nation alliance for the authority to attack laboratories , trafficking networks and drug lords in afghanistan to knock the wind out of the resurgent insurgency .
several member states remain sceptical of such a plan , however , with nations such as germany fearing any extension of nato 's role in afghanistan may lead to more violence , and , as a result , a turn of the tide of public support among afghans away from the western alliance .
gates also pushed his counterparts to increase their troop contributions in afghanistan , despite european reluctance to do so .
nato currently has a force of 50,700 soldiers in afghanistan , up from about 45,000 six months ago .
the german parliament agreed tuesday , oct .

" i urge our allies to support -lrb- the membership action plan -rrb- for georgia in december and to support georgia 's efforts to accomplish needed reform , " gates said alongside his georgian counterpart , davit kezerashvili , after the meeting .
nato leaders meeting in bucharest in april promised georgia it would be able to join the alliance at an unspecified future date .
but they postponed any decision on a possible membership action plan -lrb- map -rrb- until a foreign ministers ' meeting planned for december .
german chancellor angela merkel effectively blocked the map offer to georgia and ukraine in bucharest , arguing that it was too early for them to join the alliance .
“ heads of government of the alliance declared unanimously in april in bucharest that georgia should be a member of the alliance , " gates said in budapest .

officials said they had sealed off the farm and planned to slaughter the whole flock of ducks at goerlitz , near the polish border .
the property contains more than 1,000 birds , mainly turkeys and geese .
germany 's national animal health laboratory on the baltic island of riems said the find was " somewhat surprising " as the infection alert had been reduced to moderate after an outbreak was beaten last december .
then , officials launched the largest-ever bird cull in germany , exterminating a massive 160,000 geese over a weekend in wachenroth , bavaria .
it remained unknown what proportion of wild birds in germany were infected , a spokeswoman said .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de finance -pipe- 09.10.2008 why the eu needs to unite to fight credit crunch großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : eu member states refused a french proposed eu-wide rescue fund so far every eu nation has reacted in its own way to the international financial crisis .
christian ehler , a member of the european parliament , talks to deutsche welle about what the eu nations can do about it . deutsche welle : some eu countries have created unlimited guarantees for savings accounts .
how much sense do these unilateral actions make ?
christian ehler : i think that it certainly makes sense , in the current crisis , to regain the trust of customers by undertaking these sorts of national guarantees for bank accounts .
in the long term , of course , it is n't a solution , because you have to keep in mind that small countries , like iceland , would be completely overwhelmed if their banking sectors were to hand out such guarantees . one potential consequence has been discussed .
namely that customers would transfer their money to other countries which have wide reaching guarantees , to what extent might that result in unfair competition on the housing market ?
i believe that the current situation makes it even more important that we regain people 's trust .
out of all the parties involved , consumers are reacting the more reasonably .
nevertheless , it has to be said that consumers want to know that their money is safe in these sorts of situations .
so far it has been really important to send this signal .
in the long run that is n't a solution because it could perpetuate unfair competition .
i think that for now it 's just a temporary solution and it 's a step in the right direction wo n't the eu countries have to work together if they want a widespread rescue packet like the one in the us ?
they ca n't , plain and simple .
there are two reasons for this .
the one is money market policy .
there we have the european central bank .
that 's the biggest hero of the international finance crisis .
it was different in america , where on the one side there was the markets with liquidity , which had to ensure that the on the other side interests would n't sink too low , which brought put us in danger of inflation .
that 's what we do in money market policy because there we have a contractual basis .
when it comes to financial policy , every eu country has its own sovereignty .
they each have responsibility over their national own banking supervision .
because of that they have to take on risks nationally .
that can change when some member countries are no longer able to do that .
but just look at the reactions on sunday to the quick decisions , which were necessary in the case of hypo real estate .
the idea that 27 member countries could all agree and the idea that it would come with a high risk that some countries would be forced to come up with billions of euros to bail out a bank in greece or the netherlands does n't seem to me to be really feasible at the moment . after the mini summit over the weekend the french president , nicolas sarkozy , announced that the eu stability and growth pact will be softened .
so countries can still contract more debts .
is that a good sign ?
i not only believe that it is n't a good sign , but that it 's wrong , plain and simple .
the instuments that we have there , namely the stability and growth pact , have proven themselves reliable .
and it is clearly defined in the stability pact how much national debt a nation must have and still be able to respond in a flexible way to special situations – and the collapse of large european banks is a special situation .
but that has nothing to do with the fact that we can not and will not tolerate the relatively lax french deal with their finance policies in the stability pact .
keep this in mind : the things that are necessary for a state to intervene in order to stabilize the financial market is made possible by the stability and growth pact .
everything else is just decoration and does n't make much sense . christain ehler is an economist and member of the european parliament and sits on the finance committee . interview : guenther birkenstock -lrb- mrm -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the instuments that we have there , namely the stability and growth pact , have proven themselves reliable .
and it is clearly defined in the stability pact how much national debt a nation must have and still be able to respond in a flexible way to special situations – and the collapse of large european banks is a special situation .
but that has nothing to do with the fact that we can not and will not tolerate the relatively lax french deal with their finance policies in the stability pact .

christian ehler , a member of the european parliament , talks to deutsche welle about what the eu nations can do about it . deutsche welle : some eu countries have created unlimited guarantees for savings accounts .
how much sense do these unilateral actions make ?
christian ehler : i think that it certainly makes sense , in the current crisis , to regain the trust of customers by undertaking these sorts of national guarantees for bank accounts .
in the long term , of course , it is n't a solution , because you have to keep in mind that small countries , like iceland , would be completely overwhelmed if their banking sectors were to hand out such guarantees . one potential consequence has been discussed .
namely that customers would transfer their money to other countries which have wide reaching guarantees , to what extent might that result in unfair competition on the housing market ?
i believe that the current situation makes it even more important that we regain people 's trust .
out of all the parties involved , consumers are reacting the more reasonably .
nevertheless , it has to be said that consumers want to know that their money is safe in these sorts of situations .
so far it has been really important to send this signal .
in the long run that is n't a solution because it could perpetuate unfair competition .
i think that for now it 's just a temporary solution and it 's a step in the right direction wo n't the eu countries have to work together if they want a widespread rescue packet like the one in the us ?
they ca n't , plain and simple .
there are two reasons for this .
the one is money market policy .
there we have the european central bank .
that 's the biggest hero of the international finance crisis .
it was different in america , where on the one side there was the markets with liquidity , which had to ensure that the on the other side interests would n't sink too low , which brought put us in danger of inflation .
that 's what we do in money market policy because there we have a contractual basis .
when it comes to financial policy , every eu country has its own sovereignty .
they each have responsibility over their national own banking supervision .
because of that they have to take on risks nationally .
that can change when some member countries are no longer able to do that .
but just look at the reactions on sunday to the quick decisions , which were necessary in the case of hypo real estate .
the idea that 27 member countries could all agree and the idea that it would come with a high risk that some countries would be forced to come up with billions of euros to bail out a bank in greece or the netherlands does n't seem to me to be really feasible at the moment . after the mini summit over the weekend the french president , nicolas sarkozy , announced that the eu stability and growth pact will be softened .
so countries can still contract more debts .
is that a good sign ?
i not only believe that it is n't a good sign , but that it 's wrong , plain and simple .
the instuments that we have there , namely the stability and growth pact , have proven themselves reliable .
and it is clearly defined in the stability pact how much national debt a nation must have and still be able to respond in a flexible way to special situations – and the collapse of large european banks is a special situation .
but that has nothing to do with the fact that we can not and will not tolerate the relatively lax french deal with their finance policies in the stability pact .

despite his confidence in germany 's current soundness , the minister said that financial markets the world over , germany 's included , were still operating under a dense cloud of uncertainty and that he could not guarantee against any future nationalization plans for the nation 's banks .
" so far i do n't see the need for state takeovers in germany .
the german banking sector has been hit badly by the financial crisis but less hard " than in other countries , steinbrueck told the handelsblatt daily .

" our forecast of 1.2 percent growth in 2009 will be revised down , " ecb board member lorenzo bini smaghi told the italian financial daily il sole 24 ore without citing the new figure .
the central bank had already down-scaled its previous eurozone growth forecast of 1.5 percent last month .
" the second quarter -lrb- 2008 -rrb- was negative , and the third may be as well .
there 's a risk of more or less zero growth for several quarters , " bini smaghi said .
" it will depend a lot on the positive impact that will come from lowering interest rates , from a more competitive euro and especially from a sharp drop in prices of raw materials . "
wednesday saw a coordinated effort by central banks around the world to cut interest rates as a joint response to the global financial crisis .

topolanek specifically slammed several eu members for providing unlimited bank deposit protection , calling it " a shameless step " that boosts liquidity in those countries at the expense of others .

christian ehler , a member of the european parliament , talks to deutsche welle about what the eu nations can do about it . deutsche welle : some eu countries have created unlimited guarantees for savings accounts .
how much sense do these unilateral actions make ?
christian ehler : i think that it certainly makes sense , in the current crisis , to regain the trust of customers by undertaking these sorts of national guarantees for bank accounts .
in the long term , of course , it is n't a solution , because you have to keep in mind that small countries , like iceland , would be completely overwhelmed if their banking sectors were to hand out such guarantees . one potential consequence has been discussed .
namely that customers would transfer their money to other countries which have wide reaching guarantees , to what extent might that result in unfair competition on the housing market ?
i believe that the current situation makes it even more important that we regain people 's trust .
out of all the parties involved , consumers are reacting the more reasonably .
nevertheless , it has to be said that consumers want to know that their money is safe in these sorts of situations .
so far it has been really important to send this signal .
in the long run that is n't a solution because it could perpetuate unfair competition .
i think that for now it 's just a temporary solution and it 's a step in the right direction wo n't the eu countries have to work together if they want a widespread rescue packet like the one in the us ?
they ca n't , plain and simple .
there are two reasons for this .
the one is money market policy .
there we have the european central bank .
that 's the biggest hero of the international finance crisis .
it was different in america , where on the one side there was the markets with liquidity , which had to ensure that the on the other side interests would n't sink too low , which brought put us in danger of inflation .
that 's what we do in money market policy because there we have a contractual basis .
when it comes to financial policy , every eu country has its own sovereignty .
they each have responsibility over their national own banking supervision .
because of that they have to take on risks nationally .
that can change when some member countries are no longer able to do that .
but just look at the reactions on sunday to the quick decisions , which were necessary in the case of hypo real estate .
the idea that 27 member countries could all agree and the idea that it would come with a high risk that some countries would be forced to come up with billions of euros to bail out a bank in greece or the netherlands does n't seem to me to be really feasible at the moment . after the mini summit over the weekend the french president , nicolas sarkozy , announced that the eu stability and growth pact will be softened .
so countries can still contract more debts .
is that a good sign ?
i not only believe that it is n't a good sign , but that it 's wrong , plain and simple .
the instuments that we have there , namely the stability and growth pact , have proven themselves reliable .
and it is clearly defined in the stability pact how much national debt a nation must have and still be able to respond in a flexible way to special situations – and the collapse of large european banks is a special situation .
but that has nothing to do with the fact that we can not and will not tolerate the relatively lax french deal with their finance policies in the stability pact .
keep this in mind : the things that are necessary for a state to intervene in order to stabilize the financial market is made possible by the stability and growth pact .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de ukraine -pipe- 09.10.2008 ukraine dissolves parliament ahead of new elections großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ukrainian lawmakers will be headed back to their constituencies for campaigning ukrainian president viktor yushchenko has ordered parliament dissolved and called for new elections .
the poll has been set for early december . yushchenko cited months of political infighting , parliament 's inability to pass critical legislation , and failure of a ruling coalition in early september as grounds for calling new elections . in an announcement on his web site on thursday , oct .
9 , he said fresh elections would take place on dec .

christian ehler , a member of the european parliament , talks to deutsche welle about what the eu nations can do about it . deutsche welle : some eu countries have created unlimited guarantees for savings accounts .
how much sense do these unilateral actions make ?
christian ehler : i think that it certainly makes sense , in the current crisis , to regain the trust of customers by undertaking these sorts of national guarantees for bank accounts .
in the long term , of course , it is n't a solution , because you have to keep in mind that small countries , like iceland , would be completely overwhelmed if their banking sectors were to hand out such guarantees . one potential consequence has been discussed .
namely that customers would transfer their money to other countries which have wide reaching guarantees , to what extent might that result in unfair competition on the housing market ?
i believe that the current situation makes it even more important that we regain people 's trust .
out of all the parties involved , consumers are reacting the more reasonably .
nevertheless , it has to be said that consumers want to know that their money is safe in these sorts of situations .
so far it has been really important to send this signal .
in the long run that is n't a solution because it could perpetuate unfair competition .
i think that for now it 's just a temporary solution and it 's a step in the right direction wo n't the eu countries have to work together if they want a widespread rescue packet like the one in the us ?
they ca n't , plain and simple .
there are two reasons for this .
the one is money market policy .
there we have the european central bank .
that 's the biggest hero of the international finance crisis .
it was different in america , where on the one side there was the markets with liquidity , which had to ensure that the on the other side interests would n't sink too low , which brought put us in danger of inflation .
that 's what we do in money market policy because there we have a contractual basis .
when it comes to financial policy , every eu country has its own sovereignty .
they each have responsibility over their national own banking supervision .
because of that they have to take on risks nationally .
that can change when some member countries are no longer able to do that .
but just look at the reactions on sunday to the quick decisions , which were necessary in the case of hypo real estate .
the idea that 27 member countries could all agree and the idea that it would come with a high risk that some countries would be forced to come up with billions of euros to bail out a bank in greece or the netherlands does n't seem to me to be really feasible at the moment . after the mini summit over the weekend the french president , nicolas sarkozy , announced that the eu stability and growth pact will be softened .
so countries can still contract more debts .
is that a good sign ?
i not only believe that it is n't a good sign , but that it 's wrong , plain and simple .
the instuments that we have there , namely the stability and growth pact , have proven themselves reliable .
and it is clearly defined in the stability pact how much national debt a nation must have and still be able to respond in a flexible way to special situations – and the collapse of large european banks is a special situation .
but that has nothing to do with the fact that we can not and will not tolerate the relatively lax french deal with their finance policies in the stability pact .
keep this in mind : the things that are necessary for a state to intervene in order to stabilize the financial market is made possible by the stability and growth pact .

christian ehler : i think that it certainly makes sense , in the current crisis , to regain the trust of customers by undertaking these sorts of national guarantees for bank accounts .
in the long term , of course , it is n't a solution , because you have to keep in mind that small countries , like iceland , would be completely overwhelmed if their banking sectors were to hand out such guarantees . one potential consequence has been discussed .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de finance -pipe- 09.10.2008 why the eu needs to unite to fight credit crunch großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : eu member states refused a french proposed eu-wide rescue fund so far every eu nation has reacted in its own way to the international financial crisis .
christian ehler , a member of the european parliament , talks to deutsche welle about what the eu nations can do about it . deutsche welle : some eu countries have created unlimited guarantees for savings accounts .
how much sense do these unilateral actions make ?
christian ehler : i think that it certainly makes sense , in the current crisis , to regain the trust of customers by undertaking these sorts of national guarantees for bank accounts .
in the long term , of course , it is n't a solution , because you have to keep in mind that small countries , like iceland , would be completely overwhelmed if their banking sectors were to hand out such guarantees . one potential consequence has been discussed .
namely that customers would transfer their money to other countries which have wide reaching guarantees , to what extent might that result in unfair competition on the housing market ?
i believe that the current situation makes it even more important that we regain people 's trust .
out of all the parties involved , consumers are reacting the more reasonably .
nevertheless , it has to be said that consumers want to know that their money is safe in these sorts of situations .
so far it has been really important to send this signal .
in the long run that is n't a solution because it could perpetuate unfair competition .
i think that for now it 's just a temporary solution and it 's a step in the right direction wo n't the eu countries have to work together if they want a widespread rescue packet like the one in the us ?
they ca n't , plain and simple .
there are two reasons for this .
the one is money market policy .
there we have the european central bank .
that 's the biggest hero of the international finance crisis .
it was different in america , where on the one side there was the markets with liquidity , which had to ensure that the on the other side interests would n't sink too low , which brought put us in danger of inflation .
that 's what we do in money market policy because there we have a contractual basis .
when it comes to financial policy , every eu country has its own sovereignty .
they each have responsibility over their national own banking supervision .
because of that they have to take on risks nationally .
that can change when some member countries are no longer able to do that .
but just look at the reactions on sunday to the quick decisions , which were necessary in the case of hypo real estate .
the idea that 27 member countries could all agree and the idea that it would come with a high risk that some countries would be forced to come up with billions of euros to bail out a bank in greece or the netherlands does n't seem to me to be really feasible at the moment . after the mini summit over the weekend the french president , nicolas sarkozy , announced that the eu stability and growth pact will be softened .
so countries can still contract more debts .
is that a good sign ?
i not only believe that it is n't a good sign , but that it 's wrong , plain and simple .
the instuments that we have there , namely the stability and growth pact , have proven themselves reliable .
and it is clearly defined in the stability pact how much national debt a nation must have and still be able to respond in a flexible way to special situations – and the collapse of large european banks is a special situation .
but that has nothing to do with the fact that we can not and will not tolerate the relatively lax french deal with their finance policies in the stability pact .
keep this in mind : the things that are necessary for a state to intervene in order to stabilize the financial market is made possible by the stability and growth pact .
everything else is just decoration and does n't make much sense . christain ehler is an economist and member of the european parliament and sits on the finance committee . interview : guenther birkenstock -lrb- mrm -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

dw summarizes europe 's recent reactions to the financial crisis . fallout from the us real-estate slump has western europe facing " extraordinary financial stress , " and unwinding european banks ' exposure " will likely be long and arduous , " the international monetary fund said on wednesday , oct .
8 . it recommended eu governments coordinate their efforts to push for responsibility and accountability in the financial sector .
imf head dominique strauss-kahn said thursday that all non-coordinated action in the european union against the financial crisis " should be avoided , if not condemned . " " restoring confidence now requires a decisive commitment to concerted and coordinated action to alleviate financial stresses and avoid the serious risk of backtracking on european financial integration , " imf analysts added . until wednesday , when central banks around the world cut main interest rates in a coordinated effort , european nations had largely been left to their own designs in terms of solving the credit crunch after a french proposal for an eu-wide fund was shot down . dw reviews recent steps european financial leaders have recently taken to stabilize markets and shore up the international banking system . germany bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hypo real estate needed to be bailed out twice before it was rescued as europe 's largest economy , germany has n't been able to avoid the global credit crunch , despite early statements from finance minister peer steinbrueck that it was an american problem . the government bailed out commercial property lender hypo real estate to the tune 35 billion euros -lrb- $ 47.9 billion -rrb- .
to keep the bank customers from running to atm machines to withdrawal their money , the federal government has also guaranteed the security of all savings . iceland the european country most dramatically affected by the financial crisis , the entire nation of iceland is threatened with bankruptcy after the extent of its involvement in the financial sector .
by oct .
10 , the reykjavik government nationalized banks the country 's three biggest banks in a moved it said was intended to guarantee a functioning banking system . suffering from a lack of funds as foreign countries stop providing iceland with loans has lead the atlantic nation to schedule negotiations with russia next week .

since the beginning of the year , iceland 's currency , the krona , has lost half its value against the euro . ireland bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : look at how far that one dropped !
dublin drew ire from the european union for its decision in late september to guarantee all deposits at its biggest banks .
several eu nations then followed ireland 's lead and took similar measures .
but experts in some european capitals were irritated that ireland acted without consulting other nations .
the irish government , however , calmed nerves somewhat by extending blanket guarantees offered to irish banks to five foreign institutions operating on the emerald isle . britain british prime minister gordon brown announced his country 's 50 billion pound bank rescue plan on wednesday .
the plan included the partial nationalization of britain 's eight main banks , 200 billion pounds in short-term loans and 250 billion pounds in inter-bank loan guarantees . " extraordinary times call for ... bold and far-reaching solutions , " brown said while introducing the package .
" the global financial market has ceased to function , putting in danger the necessary flow of money to businesses and families on which all of us depend in our daily lives . " british bank stocks , in the days before the partial nationalization , had lost nearly half their value , italy bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : tremonti said a bare-bones banking system has served italy well italian officials have said their country 's somewhat less sophosociated financial system has left it in a better position to deal with international economic turmoil . in addition to vouching for italians ' savings , economy minister giulio tremonti said rome would consider whether to come to banks ' aid on a case-by-case basis .
italian media reported that the government was setting up a 50 billion euro rescue package that would save banks if necessary . france as two of french banks engaged in merger discussions that would result in the country 's largest banking group , paris issued plans wednesday to take stakes in troubled banks to keep them from bankruptcy . prime minister francois fillon said the government would create new structures allowing it to take over at failing banks and ensure the " continuity and stability of the french banking and finance system . "
he also said paris would have no qualms about replacing managers at nationalized banks with officials who enjoyed the finance ministry 's trust . belgium bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : much of the private sector turned its back on dexia belgium turned to former prime minister jean-luc dehaene is to head the board of the struggling franco-belgian financial service group dexia .
bnp paribas exec pierre mariani is slated to serve as chief executive . the group was saved thursday when the belgian , french and luxembourg came to its rescue for the second time in two weeks by guaranteeing loans after having already partially nationalized the local credit institute .
dexia shares had lost nearly two-thirds of their value before the announcement . but dexia is n't the only benelux bank to be affected .
the netherland nationalized their portion of the former belgian-dutch insurance and banking giant fortis while france 's bnp paribas and the belgium and luxembourg governments took over the remainder of fortis ' activities . dw staff -lrb- sms -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

customers who are not told about extra charges when they place their order will not have to pay those charges , says the proposal , which was issued wednesday , oct .
8 .
the retailer will also have to guarantee delivery anywhere within the eu within 30 days .
they will also have to compensate the purchaser within a week if the product is damaged or fails to arrive .
user friendly additionally , customers will have the right to a 14-day " cooling-off period , " during which they can change their minds and send the product back .
and retailers will no longer be allowed to insert clauses such as " the trader is not responsible for mistakes made by his agents " into contracts .
nor will they be allowed to pre-check boxes on online order forms that commit customers to buying extra services unless the customer unchecks the boxes .
according to figures from the commission , approximately 150 million eu citizens shop online , but only 30 million look for products in other eu member states - spending on average 800 euros -lrb- $ 1,090 -rrb- per year in the process .
fear of fraud at the same time , identical products in different member states can vary enormously in price .
an eight-gigabyte ipod nano , for example , can range in price from 169.44 euros in britain to 268.96 euros in hungary , a commission study said .
eu officials are keen to boost the volume of cross-border e-shopping in the bloc .
however , european consumers are still reluctant to buy from web sites in other countries , largely for fear of fraud .
according to the commission , the proportion of europeans shopping online rose from 23 to 30 percent between 2005 and 2008 , but the proportion of those doing so abroad rose only from 6 to 7 percent . dpa news agency -lrb- kjb -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de finance -pipe- 09.10.2008 europe is heading toward recession , says imf großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : despite appeals to optimism , recession could hit europe europe is nearing recession and its banking system faces " extraordinary financial stress " that will not ease quickly , the imf said as the benelux countries agreed thursday to absorb flailing bank dexia 's toxic assets . economic growth in the 15 countries using the euro is facing a slump , decreasing from an average 1.3 percent this year to 0.2 percent in 2009 ; unemployment will increase from 7.6 percent to 8.3 percent , an imf report said wednesday , oct .
8 .
imf analysts also predicted that germany , europe 's largest economy , will stall in 2009 and france 's will grow by a marginal 0.2 percent .
italy and spain will see their economies shrink by 0.2 percent , according to the semi-annual world economic outlook .
with european nations " moving close to or into recession , " the imf urged forceful action by policymakers to combat the crisis with measures such as lower interest rates .
ecb chief : " collect yourselves " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : wall street dropped even after the fed announced interest rate cuts hours before the report 's release , the european central bank and the us federal reserve led key central banks in a coordinated emergency cut in benchmark rates by 0.5 percentage points .
european central bank chief jean-claude trichet called the move " a significant signal of confidence to the markets . "
speaking on france 3 television , he told viewers , " we can say to the markets we have regained control over price stability in the medium term . "
markets continued to fall nevertheless , with wall street down more than two percent , london and frankfurt more than five percent , and paris more than six percent .
" we all together call upon the market participants who are in this state of intense turbulence , we tell them to collect themselves , there are elements of confidence out there , " said the ecb chief , ahead of the annual meetings of the imf and world bank to be held this weekend in washington .
" excessive pessimism is ill advised . "
on a brighter note , the imf said falling real estate prices in europe are less likely to set off a major housing-related credit crunch than in the us .
higher savings rates , lower debt , more prudent mortgage lending and much more limited opportunities for equity withdrawal on real estate work in europe 's favor , the report said .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : prudent lending practices in europe have kept the housing market from turning upside down the downturn in residential real estate will , however , have " an appreciable short-term impact " in countries like ireland , spain and britain .
austria , germany and switzerland appear the least at risk in that respect , the imf said .
appeal to european policymakers still , the imf appealed to eu governments to move " toward more joint responsibility and accountability for financial stability " and urged european policymakers to make prudent choices .
" restoring confidence now requires a decisive commitment to concerted and coordinated action to alleviate financial stresses and avoid the serious risk of backtracking on european financial integration , " imf analysts said .
euro zone governments , whose deficit spending is limited by rules meant to protect the euro 's value , should focus emergency injections " on measures to stabilize the financial sector , as needed , " the report said .

8 .
imf analysts also predicted that germany , europe 's largest economy , will stall in 2009 and france 's will grow by a marginal 0.2 percent .
italy and spain will see their economies shrink by 0.2 percent , according to the semi-annual world economic outlook .
with european nations " moving close to or into recession , " the imf urged forceful action by policymakers to combat the crisis with measures such as lower interest rates .
ecb chief : " collect yourselves " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : wall street dropped even after the fed announced interest rate cuts hours before the report 's release , the european central bank and the us federal reserve led key central banks in a coordinated emergency cut in benchmark rates by 0.5 percentage points .
european central bank chief jean-claude trichet called the move " a significant signal of confidence to the markets . "
speaking on france 3 television , he told viewers , " we can say to the markets we have regained control over price stability in the medium term . "
markets continued to fall nevertheless , with wall street down more than two percent , london and frankfurt more than five percent , and paris more than six percent .
" we all together call upon the market participants who are in this state of intense turbulence , we tell them to collect themselves , there are elements of confidence out there , " said the ecb chief , ahead of the annual meetings of the imf and world bank to be held this weekend in washington .
" excessive pessimism is ill advised . "
on a brighter note , the imf said falling real estate prices in europe are less likely to set off a major housing-related credit crunch than in the us .
higher savings rates , lower debt , more prudent mortgage lending and much more limited opportunities for equity withdrawal on real estate work in europe 's favor , the report said .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : prudent lending practices in europe have kept the housing market from turning upside down the downturn in residential real estate will , however , have " an appreciable short-term impact " in countries like ireland , spain and britain .
austria , germany and switzerland appear the least at risk in that respect , the imf said .
appeal to european policymakers still , the imf appealed to eu governments to move " toward more joint responsibility and accountability for financial stability " and urged european policymakers to make prudent choices .
" restoring confidence now requires a decisive commitment to concerted and coordinated action to alleviate financial stresses and avoid the serious risk of backtracking on european financial integration , " imf analysts said .
euro zone governments , whose deficit spending is limited by rules meant to protect the euro 's value , should focus emergency injections " on measures to stabilize the financial sector , as needed , " the report said .
eu finance ministers , scrambling to react to the spill-over , agreed tuesday to more than double the public guarantee for private bank deposits to at least 50,000 euros -lrb- $ 68,000 -rrb- .

the irish government , however , calmed nerves somewhat by extending blanket guarantees offered to irish banks to five foreign institutions operating on the emerald isle . britain british prime minister gordon brown announced his country 's 50 billion pound bank rescue plan on wednesday .
the plan included the partial nationalization of britain 's eight main banks , 200 billion pounds in short-term loans and 250 billion pounds in inter-bank loan guarantees . " extraordinary times call for ... bold and far-reaching solutions , " brown said while introducing the package .

dexia shares had lost nearly two-thirds of their value before the announcement . but dexia is n't the only benelux bank to be affected .

general john craddock , nato operations commander , likewise appealed to the members of the 26-nation alliance for the authority to attack laboratories , trafficking networks and drug lords in afghanistan to knock the wind out of the resurgent insurgency .
several member states remain sceptical of such a plan , however , with nations such as germany fearing any extension of nato 's role in afghanistan may lead to more violence , and , as a result , a turn of the tide of public support among afghans away from the western alliance .

" we need to have the opportunity to go after drug lords and drug laboratories and try and interrupt this flow of cash , " he told reporters at a two-day meeting of nato defense ministers which began thursday in budapest , hungary .
general john craddock , nato operations commander , likewise appealed to the members of the 26-nation alliance for the authority to attack laboratories , trafficking networks and drug lords in afghanistan to knock the wind out of the resurgent insurgency .
several member states remain sceptical of such a plan , however , with nations such as germany fearing any extension of nato 's role in afghanistan may lead to more violence , and , as a result , a turn of the tide of public support among afghans away from the western alliance .
gates also pushed his counterparts to increase their troop contributions in afghanistan , despite european reluctance to do so .
nato currently has a force of 50,700 soldiers in afghanistan , up from about 45,000 six months ago .
the german parliament agreed tuesday , oct .

nato leaders meeting in bucharest in april promised georgia it would be able to join the alliance at an unspecified future date .
but they postponed any decision on a possible membership action plan -lrb- map -rrb- until a foreign ministers ' meeting planned for december .
german chancellor angela merkel effectively blocked the map offer to georgia and ukraine in bucharest , arguing that it was too early for them to join the alliance .

with part of the baltics already believed to be in recession , the imf noted that southern europe 's continuing boom is based on much the same mix of consumer spending , loans and capital investment driven by western banks and companies .
inflation , while likely to ease in 2009 , is eating into people 's spending power . overall , the region from the baltics to bulgaria is headed for a third year of slowing growth , down to 3.5 percent in 2009 from a predicted 5.0 percent in 2008 , the imf said in a report released in washington .
and the risk that the region 's financial imbalances will spook investors is rising at a time of tighter credit , the semi-annual world economic outlook said . " growth is expected to continue to decelerate markedly , including on account of diminishing capital inflows and tighter financial constraints , " the survey said . indirect effect soaring food and energy prices are slowing consumer spending , while the global credit crunch and sickly growth in western europe - eastern europe 's main market - is weighing on investment and exports , the imf said .
it added that while banks operating in emerging europe have little direct exposure to the us subprime mortgage market , they and their foreign parents are affected by the widening turmoil in western europe . " the policy challenge is how to engineer a soft landing " while keeping the region on track toward western european living standards , imf analysts said . they foresee a clear three-way split for the european union 's emerging economies in 2009 : the three baltic nations ailing after a long spending and investment boom , with latvia 's economy shrinking by 2.2 percent ; central europe growing an average 3.6 percent ; and romania and bulgaria still going strong .
" like the baltics several years ago , these countries are still enjoying ' good times , " ' the imf said of the two south-eastern eu members . but romania , expected to lead the region this year with 8.6-percent growth , and bulgaria need to recognize the " more volatile external financing conditions " and rein in public spending , the report said .
underscoring the jitters , plunging share prices forced romania 's stock exchange in bucharest to halt trading for the day shortly after opening wednesday .
in the baltics , recovery is expected to begin during the second half of 2009 , but authorities should " resist the temptation to significantly ease fiscal policy in the downturn " and work toward balanced budgets , the imf added . dpa news agency -lrb- mrm -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

officials said they had sealed off the farm and planned to slaughter the whole flock of ducks at goerlitz , near the polish border .
the property contains more than 1,000 birds , mainly turkeys and geese .
germany 's national animal health laboratory on the baltic island of riems said the find was " somewhat surprising " as the infection alert had been reduced to moderate after an outbreak was beaten last december .
then , officials launched the largest-ever bird cull in germany , exterminating a massive 160,000 geese over a weekend in wachenroth , bavaria .
it remained unknown what proportion of wild birds in germany were infected , a spokeswoman said .
none of germany 's neighbours are currently reporting any h5n1 detections , with the virus having recently shown up in asia , from which scientists believe it had earlier spread to both europe and africa with migratory wild birds .
the virus can be deadly for humans if hygienic precautions are not followed .
human-to-human transmission of the virus has only occurred in very isolated cases and chiefly in asia .
scientists fear the virus could mutate into an easily transmittable human disease causing a pandemic .

1 , was tipped to lead growth next year - 5.6 percent - followed by european union newcomers romania , 4.8 percent , and bulgaria , 4.2 percent .
with part of the baltics already believed to be in recession , the imf noted that southern europe 's continuing boom is based on much the same mix of consumer spending , loans and capital investment driven by western banks and companies .
inflation , while likely to ease in 2009 , is eating into people 's spending power . overall , the region from the baltics to bulgaria is headed for a third year of slowing growth , down to 3.5 percent in 2009 from a predicted 5.0 percent in 2008 , the imf said in a report released in washington .
and the risk that the region 's financial imbalances will spook investors is rising at a time of tighter credit , the semi-annual world economic outlook said . " growth is expected to continue to decelerate markedly , including on account of diminishing capital inflows and tighter financial constraints , " the survey said . indirect effect soaring food and energy prices are slowing consumer spending , while the global credit crunch and sickly growth in western europe - eastern europe 's main market - is weighing on investment and exports , the imf said .
it added that while banks operating in emerging europe have little direct exposure to the us subprime mortgage market , they and their foreign parents are affected by the widening turmoil in western europe . " the policy challenge is how to engineer a soft landing " while keeping the region on track toward western european living standards , imf analysts said . they foresee a clear three-way split for the european union 's emerging economies in 2009 : the three baltic nations ailing after a long spending and investment boom , with latvia 's economy shrinking by 2.2 percent ; central europe growing an average 3.6 percent ; and romania and bulgaria still going strong .
" like the baltics several years ago , these countries are still enjoying ' good times , " ' the imf said of the two south-eastern eu members . but romania , expected to lead the region this year with 8.6-percent growth , and bulgaria need to recognize the " more volatile external financing conditions " and rein in public spending , the report said .
underscoring the jitters , plunging share prices forced romania 's stock exchange in bucharest to halt trading for the day shortly after opening wednesday .
in the baltics , recovery is expected to begin during the second half of 2009 , but authorities should " resist the temptation to significantly ease fiscal policy in the downturn " and work toward balanced budgets , the imf added . dpa news agency -lrb- mrm -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

so when rumours started circulating that a government delegation had met members of the taliban in saudi arabia , nobody was surprised .
but the government quickly denied the rumours .
“ there were no talks and no talks have been arranged , ” said government spokesman homayoun hamidzadeh .
“ but president karzai has always said that he is involved in talks with the saudi king to clarify whether he could play a mediating role in the peace process in afghanistan .
the afghan side would warmly welcome any progress in this matter and then take part in talks . ”

although the afghan delegation did not have an official mandate , the informal meeting still has enormous political import .
it means that if talks were to become possible in the future thanks to saudi mediation , a taliban spokesman , who has claimed responsibility for a series of terrorist attacks , would become an acceptable political partner in kabul .

it is increasingly clear that the insurgency can not be fought only with military means . ”

he needs to secure votes in the volatile eastern and southern provinces of afghanistan .
although he was elected with about 55 percent of the votes four years ago , his popularity ratings have sunk to 17 percent .
“ if there are secret negotiations and the taliban agree not to disrupt the election process , then a political price will have to be paid .

officially , there have been no secret talks . the afghan government is not shy to acknowledge that it tries to win over members of the armed opposition .
insurgents who accept the government ’ s proposals to cooperate politically are granted amnesty and integrated into civilian life .
one example of such a won-over insurgent is wakil ahmad muttawakil - a former taliban foreign minister who , in 2005 , even ran for parliament - albeit without success .
so when rumours started circulating that a government delegation had met members of the taliban in saudi arabia , nobody was surprised .
but the government quickly denied the rumours .
“ there were no talks and no talks have been arranged , ” said government spokesman homayoun hamidzadeh .
“ but president karzai has always said that he is involved in talks with the saudi king to clarify whether he could play a mediating role in the peace process in afghanistan .
the afghan side would warmly welcome any progress in this matter and then take part in talks . ”
informal meeting of enormous import however , independent observers tell a different story .
it would seem that , at a recent festive supper held by saudi king abdullah in mecca , a group of afghan mps and government officials met a taliban representative and also envoys of gulbuddin hekmatyar , the head of the afghanistan islamic party .
although the afghan delegation did not have an official mandate , the informal meeting still has enormous political import .
it means that if talks were to become possible in the future thanks to saudi mediation , a taliban spokesman , who has claimed responsibility for a series of terrorist attacks , would become an acceptable political partner in kabul .
citha maass , from the german institute for international and security affairs , was not surprised to hear about the talks : “ there have been suggestions of secret negotiations for some time now .
it is increasingly clear that the insurgency can not be fought only with military means . ”
pre-election strategy maass also thought that president karzai was thinking strategically , ahead of next year ’ s elections .
he needs to secure votes in the volatile eastern and southern provinces of afghanistan .
although he was elected with about 55 percent of the votes four years ago , his popularity ratings have sunk to 17 percent .
“ if there are secret negotiations and the taliban agree not to disrupt the election process , then a political price will have to be paid .
this would likely entail that afghanistan ’ s political process stray even further away from democracy , ” said maass .

according to a press report released earlier in the day , turbulence on equity markets caused by the international financial crisis prompted the delay of the sale of a 24.9 percent stake , in what is set to be the last major privatisation in europe 's biggest economy .
deutsche bahn was to list a 24.9 percent stake in its freight and passenger unit on the stock market on october 27 .
but unnamed financial sources quoted by the financial times deutschland 's online edition said the initial public offering -lrb- ipo -rrb- will now not take place until november at the earliest .
the government was hoping to generate some five or six billion euros -lrb- seven or eight billion dollars -rrb- from the sale and chief executive hartmut mehdorn had already begun talking to potential investors in london and moscow , the ftd said .
however , there have been sharp falls in stock markets in recent days due to the international financial crisis .
the government is now worried that it would not get as much money as it hoped and that it would be better to wait for markets to recover .
german finance minister peer steinbrueck conceded on monday that the turbulence might force the listing to be postponed .
" we have to ask ourselves if the timing is right , " steinbrueck told reporters , noting " very unfavourable conditions in the market . " dw staff -lrb- mrm -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

according to a press report released earlier in the day , turbulence on equity markets caused by the international financial crisis prompted the delay of the sale of a 24.9 percent stake , in what is set to be the last major privatisation in europe 's biggest economy .
deutsche bahn was to list a 24.9 percent stake in its freight and passenger unit on the stock market on october 27 .
but unnamed financial sources quoted by the financial times deutschland 's online edition said the initial public offering -lrb- ipo -rrb- will now not take place until november at the earliest .
the government was hoping to generate some five or six billion euros -lrb- seven or eight billion dollars -rrb- from the sale and chief executive hartmut mehdorn had already begun talking to potential investors in london and moscow , the ftd said .
however , there have been sharp falls in stock markets in recent days due to the international financial crisis .
the government is now worried that it would not get as much money as it hoped and that it would be better to wait for markets to recover .
german finance minister peer steinbrueck conceded on monday that the turbulence might force the listing to be postponed .
" we have to ask ourselves if the timing is right , " steinbrueck told reporters , noting " very unfavourable conditions in the market . " dw staff -lrb- mrm -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de finance -pipe- 09.10.2008 why the eu needs to unite to fight credit crunch großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : eu member states refused a french proposed eu-wide rescue fund so far every eu nation has reacted in its own way to the international financial crisis .
christian ehler , a member of the european parliament , talks to deutsche welle about what the eu nations can do about it . deutsche welle : some eu countries have created unlimited guarantees for savings accounts .
how much sense do these unilateral actions make ?
christian ehler : i think that it certainly makes sense , in the current crisis , to regain the trust of customers by undertaking these sorts of national guarantees for bank accounts .
in the long term , of course , it is n't a solution , because you have to keep in mind that small countries , like iceland , would be completely overwhelmed if their banking sectors were to hand out such guarantees . one potential consequence has been discussed .
namely that customers would transfer their money to other countries which have wide reaching guarantees , to what extent might that result in unfair competition on the housing market ?
i believe that the current situation makes it even more important that we regain people 's trust .
out of all the parties involved , consumers are reacting the more reasonably .
nevertheless , it has to be said that consumers want to know that their money is safe in these sorts of situations .
so far it has been really important to send this signal .
in the long run that is n't a solution because it could perpetuate unfair competition .
i think that for now it 's just a temporary solution and it 's a step in the right direction wo n't the eu countries have to work together if they want a widespread rescue packet like the one in the us ?
they ca n't , plain and simple .
there are two reasons for this .
the one is money market policy .
there we have the european central bank .
that 's the biggest hero of the international finance crisis .
it was different in america , where on the one side there was the markets with liquidity , which had to ensure that the on the other side interests would n't sink too low , which brought put us in danger of inflation .
that 's what we do in money market policy because there we have a contractual basis .
when it comes to financial policy , every eu country has its own sovereignty .
they each have responsibility over their national own banking supervision .
because of that they have to take on risks nationally .
that can change when some member countries are no longer able to do that .
but just look at the reactions on sunday to the quick decisions , which were necessary in the case of hypo real estate .
the idea that 27 member countries could all agree and the idea that it would come with a high risk that some countries would be forced to come up with billions of euros to bail out a bank in greece or the netherlands does n't seem to me to be really feasible at the moment . after the mini summit over the weekend the french president , nicolas sarkozy , announced that the eu stability and growth pact will be softened .
so countries can still contract more debts .
is that a good sign ?
i not only believe that it is n't a good sign , but that it 's wrong , plain and simple .
the instuments that we have there , namely the stability and growth pact , have proven themselves reliable .
and it is clearly defined in the stability pact how much national debt a nation must have and still be able to respond in a flexible way to special situations – and the collapse of large european banks is a special situation .
but that has nothing to do with the fact that we can not and will not tolerate the relatively lax french deal with their finance policies in the stability pact .
keep this in mind : the things that are necessary for a state to intervene in order to stabilize the financial market is made possible by the stability and growth pact .
everything else is just decoration and does n't make much sense . christain ehler is an economist and member of the european parliament and sits on the finance committee . interview : guenther birkenstock -lrb- mrm -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" we need to have the opportunity to go after drug lords and drug laboratories and try and interrupt this flow of cash , " he told reporters at a two-day meeting of nato defense ministers which began thursday in budapest , hungary .
general john craddock , nato operations commander , likewise appealed to the members of the 26-nation alliance for the authority to attack laboratories , trafficking networks and drug lords in afghanistan to knock the wind out of the resurgent insurgency .
several member states remain sceptical of such a plan , however , with nations such as germany fearing any extension of nato 's role in afghanistan may lead to more violence , and , as a result , a turn of the tide of public support among afghans away from the western alliance .
gates also pushed his counterparts to increase their troop contributions in afghanistan , despite european reluctance to do so .
nato currently has a force of 50,700 soldiers in afghanistan , up from about 45,000 six months ago .
the german parliament agreed tuesday , oct .

officials said they had sealed off the farm and planned to slaughter the whole flock of ducks at goerlitz , near the polish border .
the property contains more than 1,000 birds , mainly turkeys and geese .
germany 's national animal health laboratory on the baltic island of riems said the find was " somewhat surprising " as the infection alert had been reduced to moderate after an outbreak was beaten last december .
then , officials launched the largest-ever bird cull in germany , exterminating a massive 160,000 geese over a weekend in wachenroth , bavaria .
it remained unknown what proportion of wild birds in germany were infected , a spokeswoman said .

the virus can be deadly for humans if hygienic precautions are not followed .
human-to-human transmission of the virus has only occurred in very isolated cases and chiefly in asia .
scientists fear the virus could mutate into an easily transmittable human disease causing a pandemic .
the h5n1 strain of the bird flu virus has killed more than 200 people worldwide since 2003 .
bird flu variations in august , us scientists raised the prospect that a bird flu strain other than h5n1 could mutate to infect humans .
" since their introduction into land-based birds in 1988 , h9n2 avian influenza a viruses have caused multiple human infections and become endemic in domestic poultry in eurasia , " a study published in the journal of the public library of science had said .
" this particular influenza subtype has been evolving and acquiring characteristics that raise concerns that it may become more transmissible among humans .

officials said they had sealed off the farm and planned to slaughter the whole flock of ducks at goerlitz , near the polish border .
the property contains more than 1,000 birds , mainly turkeys and geese .
germany 's national animal health laboratory on the baltic island of riems said the find was " somewhat surprising " as the infection alert had been reduced to moderate after an outbreak was beaten last december .
then , officials launched the largest-ever bird cull in germany , exterminating a massive 160,000 geese over a weekend in wachenroth , bavaria .
it remained unknown what proportion of wild birds in germany were infected , a spokeswoman said .
none of germany 's neighbours are currently reporting any h5n1 detections , with the virus having recently shown up in asia , from which scientists believe it had earlier spread to both europe and africa with migratory wild birds .
the virus can be deadly for humans if hygienic precautions are not followed .
human-to-human transmission of the virus has only occurred in very isolated cases and chiefly in asia .
scientists fear the virus could mutate into an easily transmittable human disease causing a pandemic .
the h5n1 strain of the bird flu virus has killed more than 200 people worldwide since 2003 .
bird flu variations in august , us scientists raised the prospect that a bird flu strain other than h5n1 could mutate to infect humans .
" since their introduction into land-based birds in 1988 , h9n2 avian influenza a viruses have caused multiple human infections and become endemic in domestic poultry in eurasia , " a study published in the journal of the public library of science had said .
" this particular influenza subtype has been evolving and acquiring characteristics that raise concerns that it may become more transmissible among humans .
" our results suggest that the establishment and prevalence of h9n2 viruses in poultry pose a significant threat for humans . " dw staff -lrb- dfm -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

christian ehler , a member of the european parliament , talks to deutsche welle about what the eu nations can do about it . deutsche welle : some eu countries have created unlimited guarantees for savings accounts .
how much sense do these unilateral actions make ?
christian ehler : i think that it certainly makes sense , in the current crisis , to regain the trust of customers by undertaking these sorts of national guarantees for bank accounts .
in the long term , of course , it is n't a solution , because you have to keep in mind that small countries , like iceland , would be completely overwhelmed if their banking sectors were to hand out such guarantees . one potential consequence has been discussed .
namely that customers would transfer their money to other countries which have wide reaching guarantees , to what extent might that result in unfair competition on the housing market ?
i believe that the current situation makes it even more important that we regain people 's trust .
out of all the parties involved , consumers are reacting the more reasonably .
nevertheless , it has to be said that consumers want to know that their money is safe in these sorts of situations .
so far it has been really important to send this signal .
in the long run that is n't a solution because it could perpetuate unfair competition .
i think that for now it 's just a temporary solution and it 's a step in the right direction wo n't the eu countries have to work together if they want a widespread rescue packet like the one in the us ?
they ca n't , plain and simple .
there are two reasons for this .
the one is money market policy .
there we have the european central bank .
that 's the biggest hero of the international finance crisis .
it was different in america , where on the one side there was the markets with liquidity , which had to ensure that the on the other side interests would n't sink too low , which brought put us in danger of inflation .
that 's what we do in money market policy because there we have a contractual basis .
when it comes to financial policy , every eu country has its own sovereignty .
they each have responsibility over their national own banking supervision .
because of that they have to take on risks nationally .
that can change when some member countries are no longer able to do that .
but just look at the reactions on sunday to the quick decisions , which were necessary in the case of hypo real estate .
the idea that 27 member countries could all agree and the idea that it would come with a high risk that some countries would be forced to come up with billions of euros to bail out a bank in greece or the netherlands does n't seem to me to be really feasible at the moment . after the mini summit over the weekend the french president , nicolas sarkozy , announced that the eu stability and growth pact will be softened .
so countries can still contract more debts .
is that a good sign ?
i not only believe that it is n't a good sign , but that it 's wrong , plain and simple .
the instuments that we have there , namely the stability and growth pact , have proven themselves reliable .
and it is clearly defined in the stability pact how much national debt a nation must have and still be able to respond in a flexible way to special situations – and the collapse of large european banks is a special situation .
but that has nothing to do with the fact that we can not and will not tolerate the relatively lax french deal with their finance policies in the stability pact .
keep this in mind : the things that are necessary for a state to intervene in order to stabilize the financial market is made possible by the stability and growth pact .

christian ehler , a member of the european parliament , talks to deutsche welle about what the eu nations can do about it . deutsche welle : some eu countries have created unlimited guarantees for savings accounts .
how much sense do these unilateral actions make ?
christian ehler : i think that it certainly makes sense , in the current crisis , to regain the trust of customers by undertaking these sorts of national guarantees for bank accounts .
in the long term , of course , it is n't a solution , because you have to keep in mind that small countries , like iceland , would be completely overwhelmed if their banking sectors were to hand out such guarantees . one potential consequence has been discussed .
namely that customers would transfer their money to other countries which have wide reaching guarantees , to what extent might that result in unfair competition on the housing market ?
i believe that the current situation makes it even more important that we regain people 's trust .
out of all the parties involved , consumers are reacting the more reasonably .
nevertheless , it has to be said that consumers want to know that their money is safe in these sorts of situations .
so far it has been really important to send this signal .
in the long run that is n't a solution because it could perpetuate unfair competition .
i think that for now it 's just a temporary solution and it 's a step in the right direction wo n't the eu countries have to work together if they want a widespread rescue packet like the one in the us ?
they ca n't , plain and simple .
there are two reasons for this .
the one is money market policy .
there we have the european central bank .
that 's the biggest hero of the international finance crisis .
it was different in america , where on the one side there was the markets with liquidity , which had to ensure that the on the other side interests would n't sink too low , which brought put us in danger of inflation .
that 's what we do in money market policy because there we have a contractual basis .
when it comes to financial policy , every eu country has its own sovereignty .
they each have responsibility over their national own banking supervision .
because of that they have to take on risks nationally .
that can change when some member countries are no longer able to do that .
but just look at the reactions on sunday to the quick decisions , which were necessary in the case of hypo real estate .
the idea that 27 member countries could all agree and the idea that it would come with a high risk that some countries would be forced to come up with billions of euros to bail out a bank in greece or the netherlands does n't seem to me to be really feasible at the moment . after the mini summit over the weekend the french president , nicolas sarkozy , announced that the eu stability and growth pact will be softened .
so countries can still contract more debts .
is that a good sign ?
i not only believe that it is n't a good sign , but that it 's wrong , plain and simple .
the instuments that we have there , namely the stability and growth pact , have proven themselves reliable .
and it is clearly defined in the stability pact how much national debt a nation must have and still be able to respond in a flexible way to special situations – and the collapse of large european banks is a special situation .
but that has nothing to do with the fact that we can not and will not tolerate the relatively lax french deal with their finance policies in the stability pact .
keep this in mind : the things that are necessary for a state to intervene in order to stabilize the financial market is made possible by the stability and growth pact .

the money will be used " exclusively " to fund the research and development of " carbon-free cars , that is vehicles with the least possible emission of carbon dioxide , whether electric cars or hybrids , " sarkozy said .
in his speech , the french president also said he would ask the european commission to loosen regulations on state subsidies to enable eu governments to better support policies that benefit the environment .

according to a press report released earlier in the day , turbulence on equity markets caused by the international financial crisis prompted the delay of the sale of a 24.9 percent stake , in what is set to be the last major privatisation in europe 's biggest economy .
deutsche bahn was to list a 24.9 percent stake in its freight and passenger unit on the stock market on october 27 .
but unnamed financial sources quoted by the financial times deutschland 's online edition said the initial public offering -lrb- ipo -rrb- will now not take place until november at the earliest .
the government was hoping to generate some five or six billion euros -lrb- seven or eight billion dollars -rrb- from the sale and chief executive hartmut mehdorn had already begun talking to potential investors in london and moscow , the ftd said .
however , there have been sharp falls in stock markets in recent days due to the international financial crisis .
the government is now worried that it would not get as much money as it hoped and that it would be better to wait for markets to recover .
german finance minister peer steinbrueck conceded on monday that the turbulence might force the listing to be postponed .
" we have to ask ourselves if the timing is right , " steinbrueck told reporters , noting " very unfavourable conditions in the market . " dw staff -lrb- mrm -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de nato -pipe- 09.10.2008 us calls for more troops in afghanistan großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : us secretary of defense robert gates has called for more troops and effort in afghanistan the us has called on fellow nato members to allow the alliance to attack the flourishing opium trade in afghanistan in an effort to weaken the taliban . us defense secretary robert gates said the drugs trade brought windfalls of up to $ 80 million a year for the taliban insurgency in afghanistan .
" we need to have the opportunity to go after drug lords and drug laboratories and try and interrupt this flow of cash , " he told reporters at a two-day meeting of nato defense ministers which began thursday in budapest , hungary .
general john craddock , nato operations commander , likewise appealed to the members of the 26-nation alliance for the authority to attack laboratories , trafficking networks and drug lords in afghanistan to knock the wind out of the resurgent insurgency .
several member states remain sceptical of such a plan , however , with nations such as germany fearing any extension of nato 's role in afghanistan may lead to more violence , and , as a result , a turn of the tide of public support among afghans away from the western alliance .
gates also pushed his counterparts to increase their troop contributions in afghanistan , despite european reluctance to do so .
nato currently has a force of 50,700 soldiers in afghanistan , up from about 45,000 six months ago .
the german parliament agreed tuesday , oct .
7 to increase its contribution by 1,000 soldiers , raising its total to 4,500 .
the us contingent in afghanistan currently stands at 33,000 , including 13,000 under nato command .
georgian membership bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : saakashvili has called on nato to fulfil its pledges gates also used the first day of the budapest talks to further pitch georgian membership of nato , in spite of fierce opposition from russia and scepticism within the alliance .
" i urge our allies to support -lrb- the membership action plan -rrb- for georgia in december and to support georgia 's efforts to accomplish needed reform , " gates said alongside his georgian counterpart , davit kezerashvili , after the meeting .
nato leaders meeting in bucharest in april promised georgia it would be able to join the alliance at an unspecified future date .
but they postponed any decision on a possible membership action plan -lrb- map -rrb- until a foreign ministers ' meeting planned for december .
german chancellor angela merkel effectively blocked the map offer to georgia and ukraine in bucharest , arguing that it was too early for them to join the alliance .
“ heads of government of the alliance declared unanimously in april in bucharest that georgia should be a member of the alliance , " gates said in budapest .
" the question is whether we can get this accomplished at the foreign ministers ' meeting in december . "
kezerashvili said thursday that nato membership remained his country 's " top security priority . "

" allies agreed to have nato ships address piracy off of the coast of somalia soon , and escort world food program ships , in complementarity with other parties , for instance the eu , " a nato diplomat said during the talks .

christian ehler , a member of the european parliament , talks to deutsche welle about what the eu nations can do about it . deutsche welle : some eu countries have created unlimited guarantees for savings accounts .
how much sense do these unilateral actions make ?
christian ehler : i think that it certainly makes sense , in the current crisis , to regain the trust of customers by undertaking these sorts of national guarantees for bank accounts .
in the long term , of course , it is n't a solution , because you have to keep in mind that small countries , like iceland , would be completely overwhelmed if their banking sectors were to hand out such guarantees . one potential consequence has been discussed .
namely that customers would transfer their money to other countries which have wide reaching guarantees , to what extent might that result in unfair competition on the housing market ?
i believe that the current situation makes it even more important that we regain people 's trust .
out of all the parties involved , consumers are reacting the more reasonably .
nevertheless , it has to be said that consumers want to know that their money is safe in these sorts of situations .
so far it has been really important to send this signal .
in the long run that is n't a solution because it could perpetuate unfair competition .
i think that for now it 's just a temporary solution and it 's a step in the right direction wo n't the eu countries have to work together if they want a widespread rescue packet like the one in the us ?
they ca n't , plain and simple .
there are two reasons for this .
the one is money market policy .
there we have the european central bank .
that 's the biggest hero of the international finance crisis .
it was different in america , where on the one side there was the markets with liquidity , which had to ensure that the on the other side interests would n't sink too low , which brought put us in danger of inflation .
that 's what we do in money market policy because there we have a contractual basis .
when it comes to financial policy , every eu country has its own sovereignty .
they each have responsibility over their national own banking supervision .
because of that they have to take on risks nationally .
that can change when some member countries are no longer able to do that .
but just look at the reactions on sunday to the quick decisions , which were necessary in the case of hypo real estate .
the idea that 27 member countries could all agree and the idea that it would come with a high risk that some countries would be forced to come up with billions of euros to bail out a bank in greece or the netherlands does n't seem to me to be really feasible at the moment . after the mini summit over the weekend the french president , nicolas sarkozy , announced that the eu stability and growth pact will be softened .
so countries can still contract more debts .
is that a good sign ?
i not only believe that it is n't a good sign , but that it 's wrong , plain and simple .
the instuments that we have there , namely the stability and growth pact , have proven themselves reliable .
and it is clearly defined in the stability pact how much national debt a nation must have and still be able to respond in a flexible way to special situations – and the collapse of large european banks is a special situation .
but that has nothing to do with the fact that we can not and will not tolerate the relatively lax french deal with their finance policies in the stability pact .
keep this in mind : the things that are necessary for a state to intervene in order to stabilize the financial market is made possible by the stability and growth pact .
everything else is just decoration and does n't make much sense . christain ehler is an economist and member of the european parliament and sits on the finance committee . interview : guenther birkenstock -lrb- mrm -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

8 .
imf analysts also predicted that germany , europe 's largest economy , will stall in 2009 and france 's will grow by a marginal 0.2 percent .
italy and spain will see their economies shrink by 0.2 percent , according to the semi-annual world economic outlook .
with european nations " moving close to or into recession , " the imf urged forceful action by policymakers to combat the crisis with measures such as lower interest rates .
ecb chief : " collect yourselves " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : wall street dropped even after the fed announced interest rate cuts hours before the report 's release , the european central bank and the us federal reserve led key central banks in a coordinated emergency cut in benchmark rates by 0.5 percentage points .
european central bank chief jean-claude trichet called the move " a significant signal of confidence to the markets . "
speaking on france 3 television , he told viewers , " we can say to the markets we have regained control over price stability in the medium term . "
markets continued to fall nevertheless , with wall street down more than two percent , london and frankfurt more than five percent , and paris more than six percent .
" we all together call upon the market participants who are in this state of intense turbulence , we tell them to collect themselves , there are elements of confidence out there , " said the ecb chief , ahead of the annual meetings of the imf and world bank to be held this weekend in washington .
" excessive pessimism is ill advised . "
on a brighter note , the imf said falling real estate prices in europe are less likely to set off a major housing-related credit crunch than in the us .
higher savings rates , lower debt , more prudent mortgage lending and much more limited opportunities for equity withdrawal on real estate work in europe 's favor , the report said .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : prudent lending practices in europe have kept the housing market from turning upside down the downturn in residential real estate will , however , have " an appreciable short-term impact " in countries like ireland , spain and britain .
austria , germany and switzerland appear the least at risk in that respect , the imf said .
appeal to european policymakers still , the imf appealed to eu governments to move " toward more joint responsibility and accountability for financial stability " and urged european policymakers to make prudent choices .
" restoring confidence now requires a decisive commitment to concerted and coordinated action to alleviate financial stresses and avoid the serious risk of backtracking on european financial integration , " imf analysts said .
euro zone governments , whose deficit spending is limited by rules meant to protect the euro 's value , should focus emergency injections " on measures to stabilize the financial sector , as needed , " the report said .
eu finance ministers , scrambling to react to the spill-over , agreed tuesday to more than double the public guarantee for private bank deposits to at least 50,000 euros -lrb- $ 68,000 -rrb- .
dexia gets relief from benelux meanwhile , the governments of belgium , france and luxembourg have agreed to a plan to help the struggling bank dexia , belgium 's le soir newspaper reported thursday .
the plan would create a special vehicle to absorb the bank 's toxic assets and provide fresh liquidity .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : shares in dexia have fallen more than 70 percent in the last year " there will be a public guarantee from the french , belgian and luxembourg states on a maximum 4.5 billion euros that dexia is going to borrow on the market , " a source close to the luxembourg government told afp news agency .
the move comes despite a 6.4 billion euro bailout package that the three governments put together for dexia last week .
the idea of splitting the bank into national units was abandoned at talks between high-ranking officials from france , belgium and luxembourg that were being held through the night in brussels , according to le soir .
dexia 's shares rose sharply on the news , climbing 18 percent in the first 15 minutes of trading on thursday .
the franco-belgian bank is one of the top 20 banks in the euro zone , with some 5.5 million clients in belgium , france , luxembourg , slovakia and turkey . dw staff -lrb- cat -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

1 , was tipped to lead growth next year - 5.6 percent - followed by european union newcomers romania , 4.8 percent , and bulgaria , 4.2 percent .
with part of the baltics already believed to be in recession , the imf noted that southern europe 's continuing boom is based on much the same mix of consumer spending , loans and capital investment driven by western banks and companies .
inflation , while likely to ease in 2009 , is eating into people 's spending power . overall , the region from the baltics to bulgaria is headed for a third year of slowing growth , down to 3.5 percent in 2009 from a predicted 5.0 percent in 2008 , the imf said in a report released in washington .
and the risk that the region 's financial imbalances will spook investors is rising at a time of tighter credit , the semi-annual world economic outlook said . " growth is expected to continue to decelerate markedly , including on account of diminishing capital inflows and tighter financial constraints , " the survey said . indirect effect soaring food and energy prices are slowing consumer spending , while the global credit crunch and sickly growth in western europe - eastern europe 's main market - is weighing on investment and exports , the imf said .
it added that while banks operating in emerging europe have little direct exposure to the us subprime mortgage market , they and their foreign parents are affected by the widening turmoil in western europe . " the policy challenge is how to engineer a soft landing " while keeping the region on track toward western european living standards , imf analysts said . they foresee a clear three-way split for the european union 's emerging economies in 2009 : the three baltic nations ailing after a long spending and investment boom , with latvia 's economy shrinking by 2.2 percent ; central europe growing an average 3.6 percent ; and romania and bulgaria still going strong .
" like the baltics several years ago , these countries are still enjoying ' good times , " ' the imf said of the two south-eastern eu members . but romania , expected to lead the region this year with 8.6-percent growth , and bulgaria need to recognize the " more volatile external financing conditions " and rein in public spending , the report said .
underscoring the jitters , plunging share prices forced romania 's stock exchange in bucharest to halt trading for the day shortly after opening wednesday .
in the baltics , recovery is expected to begin during the second half of 2009 , but authorities should " resist the temptation to significantly ease fiscal policy in the downturn " and work toward balanced budgets , the imf added . dpa news agency -lrb- mrm -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

uefa head criticizes foreign ownership bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : uefa president michel platini says foreign ownership should be regulated the decision by german soccer officials to spread the good word about the bundesliga comes amid criticism by european soccer chief michel platini of the high rates of foreign ownership of some of europe 's largest clubs .
he said a soccer club 's identity was firmly connected not only to its location and fans , but also to its owners and players , and that if neither of the latter exhibited any resemblance to either of the former , then that was a recipe for the loss of soccer individuality and uniqueness .
" do you want in liverpool an arab sheikh as president with one brazilian coach and nine or 11 african players ?
" where is liverpool in that ?
we have to make some rules .
" what is football ?
football is a game and this game has become popular because of the identity .
you have to have identity .
that is where football 's popularity lies . "
platini , a former french national team midfield magician , said he would investigate the possibility of regulating foreign ownership of clubs across europe , but admitted that varying european national constitutions would be a substantial hurdle to overcome in that quest .

david taylor , uefa general secretary , told a conference in london that the european soccer body would launch talks next week on potential changes to the way clubs are licensed with the aim of reviewing how they run their finances .
several clubs , notably from england , dominate european competitions , believed possible because of the exorbitant debts they all shoulder .
" we can not let things stay as they are , " taylor said .
" in some countries like germany and switzerland , stronger requirements are put on clubs in terms of bank guarantees and having no negative equity .
these are the models we have to look at . "
on tuesday , the chairman of england 's football association , lord david triesman , put the combined debt of english clubs at around 3 billion pounds .
he warned of " very tangible dangers " to large clubs such as liverpool , manchester united and chelsea in the current uncertain financial times . dw staff -lrb- dfm -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de economy -pipe- 09.10.2008 eastern europe heads for slowdown großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : so far eastern european economies have n't been directly affected by the financial crisis while eastern european economies have yet to be hit hard by the international financial crisis , the happenings in the west are causing a slowdown in many of the former soviet bloc nations . eastern europe 's slowing economies face growing risks from the global credit crunch , but most of the ex-communist regions will post faster growth than western europe in 2009 , the international monetary fund -lrb- imf -rrb- said wednesday . slovakia , which is slated to switch to the euro on jan .
1 , was tipped to lead growth next year - 5.6 percent - followed by european union newcomers romania , 4.8 percent , and bulgaria , 4.2 percent .
with part of the baltics already believed to be in recession , the imf noted that southern europe 's continuing boom is based on much the same mix of consumer spending , loans and capital investment driven by western banks and companies .
inflation , while likely to ease in 2009 , is eating into people 's spending power . overall , the region from the baltics to bulgaria is headed for a third year of slowing growth , down to 3.5 percent in 2009 from a predicted 5.0 percent in 2008 , the imf said in a report released in washington .
and the risk that the region 's financial imbalances will spook investors is rising at a time of tighter credit , the semi-annual world economic outlook said . " growth is expected to continue to decelerate markedly , including on account of diminishing capital inflows and tighter financial constraints , " the survey said . indirect effect soaring food and energy prices are slowing consumer spending , while the global credit crunch and sickly growth in western europe - eastern europe 's main market - is weighing on investment and exports , the imf said .
it added that while banks operating in emerging europe have little direct exposure to the us subprime mortgage market , they and their foreign parents are affected by the widening turmoil in western europe . " the policy challenge is how to engineer a soft landing " while keeping the region on track toward western european living standards , imf analysts said . they foresee a clear three-way split for the european union 's emerging economies in 2009 : the three baltic nations ailing after a long spending and investment boom , with latvia 's economy shrinking by 2.2 percent ; central europe growing an average 3.6 percent ; and romania and bulgaria still going strong .
" like the baltics several years ago , these countries are still enjoying ' good times , " ' the imf said of the two south-eastern eu members . but romania , expected to lead the region this year with 8.6-percent growth , and bulgaria need to recognize the " more volatile external financing conditions " and rein in public spending , the report said .
underscoring the jitters , plunging share prices forced romania 's stock exchange in bucharest to halt trading for the day shortly after opening wednesday .
in the baltics , recovery is expected to begin during the second half of 2009 , but authorities should " resist the temptation to significantly ease fiscal policy in the downturn " and work toward balanced budgets , the imf added . dpa news agency -lrb- mrm -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

officials say the ban will help people vote without being influenced by the projections after one phase of voting is over but others are yet to be held .
political parties have been calling for such a ban for some time .
a number of state elections are due in india this year while general elections are scheduled for next year .
a government spokesman said it would introduce a bill in parliament soon to ban the exit polls .
two years ago , the indian election commission banned exit polls until all phases of voting were complete .
but the supreme court later overturned the ruling .
most elections in india are long drawn-out processes and voting generally takes place over several phases - sometimes spread out over a month or more .
some analysts say exit polls are fundamentally flawed with some exit pollsters trying to outdo competitors and impress their clients , viewers and readers .

it is a historic breakthrough for india , which struggled against sanctions and denials of high technology as a nuclear pariah for more than three decades because it refused to sign the nuclear non-proliferation treaty -lrb- npt -rrb- and developed a weapons programme .
india won the recognition largely on its own terms and against strong opposition from the advocates of non-proliferation who saw the agreement as a blow to the npt .
under the deal , delhi can keep its nuclear weapons and also buy nuclear fuel and technology for its civilian energy needs .
india got to have its cake and eat it too because the world recognised its huge energy needs , its growing strategic eminence in asia and its clean non-proliferation record .
crucial the fact that nuclear energy is increasingly seen as a cleaner alternative also helped convince some countries whose approval was needed to get the deal past the 45 nation nuclear suppliers group -lrb- nsg -rrb- which regulates nuclear commerce .
but in the end the personal commitment of the us president george bush , who pushed critics both at home and abroad to accept the agreement , was crucial .
the passage of the deal represents a rare foreign policy victory for president bush whose other adventures abroad have been less than successful .
in india he will be remembered for daring to go against 34 years of established us policy and for transforming india-us relations as a result .
the deal gives india access to us civilian nuclear technology the us president spent major political capital convincing recalcitrant senators on capitol hill and other sceptical government of the importance of the nuclear deal with india .
prime minister manmohan singh too went against the ingrained anti-americanism of the indian intelligentsia to push the nuclear agreement , putting the survival of his coalition government on the line .
while american non-proliferation hardliners condemn the deal , saying president bush gave away the store and set a bad example , indian critics claim india gained little for embracing the united states .
clearly , both can not be right .
what is clear is that the old rules have been changed for the sake of one country and that in itself is pregnant with enormous geopolitical importance .
the fact that both china and pakistan - india 's traditional rivals - opposed the deal means there is something india is getting that they are not .
the nuclear agreement will bring india and the united states even closer as the once estranged democracies become more engaged on common interests in asia and the world .
the deal represents a major paradigm shift for both countries and fits neatly into their respective strategic visions .
countering china by helping india gain more strategic space , washington is trying to ensure an asia not dominated by any single country , mainly china .
india , by coming closer to washington , increases its options in an increasingly inter-dependent world .
not surprisingly , china was unhappy about the indo-us nuclear deal and commentaries in official media questioned the wisdom of breaking international rules for a single country as the agreement was negotiated and cleared various hoops over the past three years .
pm manmohan singh has campaigned strongly for the deal china 's unhappiness came to the fore when the us won a waiver for india from the strict rules of the nuclear suppliers group .
it took a very strong letter from president bush to the chinese president hu jintao to end the delaying tactics of chinese diplomats at the nsg last month , officials said .
the nsg waiver on 6 september was the most important international breakthrough because it opened many doors to india .
ironically , the nsg was created in response to india 's first nuclear test in 1974 and strengthened over the years to curb technology from spreading .
india can now buy nuclear technology from all major suppliers such as france , britain and russia , not just the us .
last week , the first fruits were already visible when prime minister singh signed an agreement with france during a visit to paris .
an agreement for more reactors from russia is expected later this year .
' maginificent bequest ' india plans to build 18 to 20 nuclear reactors at an estimated cost of $ 30bn .
ashley j tellis , one of the architects of the deal , described the opening of the entire international nuclear market to delhi as president bush 's most magnificent bequest to india .
this is important in light of what indian critics and officials maintain are areas of concern in the nuclear deal as approved by the us congress .
some say the deal with encourage proliferation senators and congressmen inserted riders and conditions limiting the scope of the deal as envisaged by president bush and prime minister singh .
the bill calls for termination of the agreement in case india conducts a nuclear test in the future .
it also says the us should prevail upon other countries to do the same .
guaranteed fuel supplies for reactors the us builds for india are also in question .
us officials stress that congressional demands are a statement of preference and that they are not binding .
the only document that india should worry about is the bilateral 123 agreement , which spells out the terms of nuclear cooperation between the two countries .

it is a historic breakthrough for india , which struggled against sanctions and denials of high technology as a nuclear pariah for more than three decades because it refused to sign the nuclear non-proliferation treaty -lrb- npt -rrb- and developed a weapons programme .
india won the recognition largely on its own terms and against strong opposition from the advocates of non-proliferation who saw the agreement as a blow to the npt .
under the deal , delhi can keep its nuclear weapons and also buy nuclear fuel and technology for its civilian energy needs .
india got to have its cake and eat it too because the world recognised its huge energy needs , its growing strategic eminence in asia and its clean non-proliferation record .
crucial the fact that nuclear energy is increasingly seen as a cleaner alternative also helped convince some countries whose approval was needed to get the deal past the 45 nation nuclear suppliers group -lrb- nsg -rrb- which regulates nuclear commerce .
but in the end the personal commitment of the us president george bush , who pushed critics both at home and abroad to accept the agreement , was crucial .
the passage of the deal represents a rare foreign policy victory for president bush whose other adventures abroad have been less than successful .
in india he will be remembered for daring to go against 34 years of established us policy and for transforming india-us relations as a result .
the deal gives india access to us civilian nuclear technology the us president spent major political capital convincing recalcitrant senators on capitol hill and other sceptical government of the importance of the nuclear deal with india .
prime minister manmohan singh too went against the ingrained anti-americanism of the indian intelligentsia to push the nuclear agreement , putting the survival of his coalition government on the line .
while american non-proliferation hardliners condemn the deal , saying president bush gave away the store and set a bad example , indian critics claim india gained little for embracing the united states .
clearly , both can not be right .
what is clear is that the old rules have been changed for the sake of one country and that in itself is pregnant with enormous geopolitical importance .
the fact that both china and pakistan - india 's traditional rivals - opposed the deal means there is something india is getting that they are not .

india , by coming closer to washington , increases its options in an increasingly inter-dependent world .
not surprisingly , china was unhappy about the indo-us nuclear deal and commentaries in official media questioned the wisdom of breaking international rules for a single country as the agreement was negotiated and cleared various hoops over the past three years .
pm manmohan singh has campaigned strongly for the deal china 's unhappiness came to the fore when the us won a waiver for india from the strict rules of the nuclear suppliers group .
it took a very strong letter from president bush to the chinese president hu jintao to end the delaying tactics of chinese diplomats at the nsg last month , officials said .
the nsg waiver on 6 september was the most important international breakthrough because it opened many doors to india .
ironically , the nsg was created in response to india 's first nuclear test in 1974 and strengthened over the years to curb technology from spreading .
india can now buy nuclear technology from all major suppliers such as france , britain and russia , not just the us .

ashley j tellis , one of the architects of the deal , described the opening of the entire international nuclear market to delhi as president bush 's most magnificent bequest to india .
this is important in light of what indian critics and officials maintain are areas of concern in the nuclear deal as approved by the us congress .
