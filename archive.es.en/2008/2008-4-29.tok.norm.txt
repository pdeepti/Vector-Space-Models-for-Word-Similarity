berlusconi , a 71-year-old media tycoon , won the recent national elections in italy by a surprisingly wide margin , claiming the prime minister 's office for the third time .

" tiefensee said the government hoped the bahn 's initial public offering could take place before the end of 2008 , but he added that " one could perhaps wait two or three months " if market conditions proved unfavorable . details of the plan are to be worked out next month , in time for parliamentary approval before the summer recess . deutsche bahn head hartmut mehdorn has for years insisted that a public listing was the only way the company could generate the capital it needs to remain internationally competitive . constitutional duty bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some fear unprofitable local routes will be cut when the bahn leaves state hands with its initial public offering , deutsche bahn is expected to raise about 6 billion euros -lrb- $ 9.5 billion -rrb- , about two thirds of which will flow back into the train company 's coffers , said social democratic party head kurt beck . deutsche bahn reported a 4.2-percent rise in sales for 2007 and has forecast a 5 percent increase for 2008 . ahead of monday 's meeting , deutsche bahn had reached an agreement with trade unions that rules out lay-offs as a result of the privatization for the next 15 months . while merkel 's conservative bloc had pushed for an original plan to sell off 49.9 percent of deutsche bahn 's shares , senior party members indicated they viewed monday 's agreement as the first step toward a further reaching privatization . germany 's constitution stipulates that the state retain a majority holding as part of its duty to provide germany with rail services . dw staff -lrb- kjb -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

but the balkan country will have to convince its eu partners and its own countrymen that it 's ready to join the bloc . the stabilization and association agreement -lrb- saa -rrb- , a precursor to full eu membership talks , was signed on tuesday , april 29 , by the eu foreign ministers and serbia 's deputy prime minister bozidar djelic in the presence of the serbian president , boris tadic . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : djelic -lrb- left -rrb- , tadic , solana and rupel were happy that the job was done europe hopes that the deal will boost serbia 's pro-european parties ahead of an upcoming parliamentary vote . but first , the ex-yugoslav country will have to show it is fully cooperating with the international war crimes tribunal in the hague .
eu states will not ratify the pact , nor will serbia get any trade or other benefits until this condition is met . the saa sent " a strong signal to serbia to join us , to come to the eu , " said slovenian foreign minister dimitrij rupel , who chaired the council meeting of eu foreign ministers in luxembourg where the decision was made . serbian foreign minister vuk jeremic , a pro-european member of the government , called the saa agreement historic and said the decision signaled " an important political statement " which will open the doors to serbia 's eu membership . " we believe we are irreversibly on the road to eu membership , " he told reporters . serbia must hand over war criminals bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : opinions about the eu are divided in serbia the saa helps aspiring eu candidates to meet the strict standards necessary for eventual membership in the bloc .
serbia will be asked to carry out various political , judicial and economic reforms . in return , the eu will offer a series of benefits , including financial assistance , free trade deals and the relaxation of visa rules . tuesday 's diplomatic breakthrough came after the netherlands and belgium said they would no longer oppose the serbian saa .
both countries had blocked the agreement because they felt belgrade was not fully cooperating with the hague tribunal . the netherlands and belgium agreed to sign the saa on the condition that serbia handed over all remaining war-crime suspects .
the most notorious criminal is ratko mladic , the bosnian-serb general indicted for genocide and crimes against humanity .
he is accused of orchestrating the 1995 srebrenica massacre of 8,000 bosniaks . mladic is believed to be hiding in serbia . " the netherlands and belgium have been very flexible and put forward several proposals , because we want to give the serb people a signal that we care about them and that their future is in europe , " dutch foreign minister maxime verhagen had said ahead of the luxembourg meeting . elections unlikely to produce clear mandate bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : serbians rioted after kosovo independence eu officials hope that the prompt signing of the saa might give other pro-european parties an edge over ultra-nationalist rivals in the may 11 parliamentary elections . less than three months ago serbians re-elected pro-european president boris tadic .
yet tadic 's democratic party has been unable to hold together a coalition in parliament , leading to snap elections . while the ultra-nationalist serbian radical party -lrb- srs -rrb- was leading tadic 's democratic party slightly in the polls , neither party was expected to win a clear majority .
it 's thought that current prime minister vojislav kostunica will be the king maker in the upcoming elections . kostunica formed an uneasy coalition with tadic 's party , which collapsed in march .
kostunica 's increasingly nationalistic democratic party of serbia was enraged by what it sees as tadic 's acceptance of kosovo 's recent declaration of independence .
kosovo , a predominantly ethnic-albanian province , split from belgrade on feb .
17 . kostunica is nominally in favor of serbia joining the eu , but only on the condition that the 27-member block recognizes kosovo as part of serbia . serbian parties could nix agreement bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : kostunica has opposed the agreement the saa would become binding for belgrade only once it is ratified by the new parliament . kostunica has condemned the agreement , saying that it recognizes kosovo 's independence and calling it " an act against the state and against the constitution . " tadic disagreed , calling the saa an " economic agreement which can not in any way endanger the sovereignty and territorial integrity of serbia . " eu ministers also indicated they will offer an saa to bosnia-herzegovina , which has been less controversial than the serbia agreement . dw staff -lrb- th -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

merkel calls on brazil to make biofuel production sustainable german minister calls for reversal of eu agricultural policy germany defends biofuels , hedges bets on energy goals illegal logging gives eu massive eco-headache environment -pipe- 29.04.2008 as biofuels fall from grace , a new generation grabs spotlight großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a second-generation biofuel production facility - the new climate savior ?
biofuels made from food crops were once seen as an environmental savior .
but not anymore .
now politicians and experts hope a new generation of green fuels will be a powerful weapon against climate change . there is an old saying : if it sounds too good to be true , it probably is .
when it comes to biofuels made from crops such as wheat , corn or rapeseed , many are saying that adage fits like a glove . biofuels were once seen as a near perfect tool to reduce emissions from cars and trucks .
while cars would still spew out greenhouse gases , if they ran on biofuel , at least the plants that made their fuel would have soaked up co2 while they were growing .
" in the beginning , it sounded very good , " said dietmar oeliger , a traffic policy expert at the german environmental group nabu .
" you did n't have to change your cars or your life system .
instead of using fossil fuels , you take something different and everything can stay the same . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : people worry that farmers are growing crops for fuel instead of food problem is , he added , it did n't work out the way it was planned .
despite huge government subsidies from eu countries to push biofuels - around 2.6 billion euros in tax subsidies in the eu in 2006 - their green credentials turned out to be questionable at best .
according to a report entitled " biofuels : is the cure worse than the disease ? " by the organization for economic cooperation and development -lrb- oecd -rrb- , conventional biofuel technology provides greenhouse gas reductions of less than 40 percent , which when other factors are taken into account , means that biofuels ' disadvantages can often outweigh the benefits .
" if you take the whole production process into account with some of them , the use of land , water , fertilizer , etc . , they do n't perform very well in mitigating co2 emissions , " said michael zirpel of the international transport forum , part of the oecd .
" some are even worse than fossil fuels . "
a serious rethink european countries are beginning to rethink their biofuels enthusiasm and are rolling back some of their generous subsidies .
the eu is also starting to reconsider its commitment to these so-called first-generation biofuels .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : pump with biodiesel from rapeseed recent reports have linked rising food prices and rainforest production to biofuels , as farmers grow crops for fuel instead for human consumption .
the un special rapporteur for the right to food jean ziegler even called large-scale production of biofuels " a crime against humanity . "
the eu 's once highly touted goal of having 10 percent of transportation powered by biofuels by 2020 is no longer set in stone , since brussels did not foresee the problems that could arise .
" biofuels were at the center of praise at the beginning , and now they 're in the center of criticism , " said barbara helfferich , spokeswoman for eu environment commissioner stavros dimas .
" now it 's not biofuels in and of themselves , it 's what kind of biofuels and how we produce them . "
hopes for the second-generation as politicians and policy makers begin toning down their tributes to first-generation biofuels , they 're not giving up on the concept altogether .
what did n't work the first time around , the thinking seems to be , might succeed on a second try .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : car manufacturers are especially eager to see second-generation biofuels a reality in a small town about a half-hour 's drive from dresden , some leading political and industry leaders gathered recently .
german chancellor angela merkel was there , along with daimler ceo dieter zetsche , volkswagen boss martin winterkorn and rob routs , a high-ranking executive at shell .
they 've gathered at what choren industries claims is the “ the world 's first commercial production plant to convert biomass into synthetic diesel fuel . ”
instead of using rapeseed , wheat or corn , chroen will use forest residue and waste wood to produce its sun diesel , which it claims is head and shoulders above anything on the market today .
" we would be triple a if judged by moody 's , " said tom blades , head of choren .
" compared to fossil fuels , we actually lower the co2 emissions in the product lifecycle by over 90 percent . " it is an enticing claim and one which industry leaders , particular from the german car industry , are eager to support .
they are already under pressure to reduce their emissions to abide by european union guidelines and merkel 's government is reported to be waging a rearguard campaign to delay implementation , reduce penalties and ease the burden on the country 's luxury automotive industry .
second-generation fuels could help the car industry meet climate-protection goals without it having to make too many sacrifices .
could work , maybe " synthetic fuels from biomass have the potential - and we 're still talking about potential - to become a central pillar in climate-friendly energy supply , " said angela merkel . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : biodiesel manufactuer choren but the word " potential " is key here , since second-generation biofuels are not yet proven , nor market ready .
according to the oecd , it remains to be seen whether these new fuels will become economically viable over the next decade , if ever .
they will need large-scale subsidies for the foreseeable future .
high costs are still a major factor .
there are logistical challenges of transporting biomass material to large production facilities , which could impose a floor on costs that would be difficult to lower .
and there is the land issue .
for large-scale production , there are fears that farmers would be tempted to turn fields over to tree plantations for second-generation biofuels instead of wheat or rice fields - a scenario which , again , could affect food availability .
dieter oelig of the environmental group nabu worries that there is too much focus on this new generation of fuel , and not enough on energy or automobile efficiency and other strategies that could be put in place now .
" maybe in 20 or 30 years or 40 years , we have a big potential -lrb- for second-generation biofuels -rrb- , if they work , " he said .
" but in 40 years , we need to have a lot of answers that are clear .
otherwise , we 'll have a very big problem . " kyle james send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

merkel calls on brazil to make biofuel production sustainable german minister calls for reversal of eu agricultural policy germany defends biofuels , hedges bets on energy goals illegal logging gives eu massive eco-headache environment -pipe- 29.04.2008 as biofuels fall from grace , a new generation grabs spotlight großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a second-generation biofuel production facility - the new climate savior ?
biofuels made from food crops were once seen as an environmental savior .
but not anymore .
now politicians and experts hope a new generation of green fuels will be a powerful weapon against climate change . there is an old saying : if it sounds too good to be true , it probably is .
when it comes to biofuels made from crops such as wheat , corn or rapeseed , many are saying that adage fits like a glove . biofuels were once seen as a near perfect tool to reduce emissions from cars and trucks .
while cars would still spew out greenhouse gases , if they ran on biofuel , at least the plants that made their fuel would have soaked up co2 while they were growing .
" in the beginning , it sounded very good , " said dietmar oeliger , a traffic policy expert at the german environmental group nabu .
" you did n't have to change your cars or your life system .
instead of using fossil fuels , you take something different and everything can stay the same . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : people worry that farmers are growing crops for fuel instead of food problem is , he added , it did n't work out the way it was planned .
despite huge government subsidies from eu countries to push biofuels - around 2.6 billion euros in tax subsidies in the eu in 2006 - their green credentials turned out to be questionable at best .
according to a report entitled " biofuels : is the cure worse than the disease ? " by the organization for economic cooperation and development -lrb- oecd -rrb- , conventional biofuel technology provides greenhouse gas reductions of less than 40 percent , which when other factors are taken into account , means that biofuels ' disadvantages can often outweigh the benefits .
" if you take the whole production process into account with some of them , the use of land , water , fertilizer , etc . , they do n't perform very well in mitigating co2 emissions , " said michael zirpel of the international transport forum , part of the oecd .
" some are even worse than fossil fuels . "
a serious rethink european countries are beginning to rethink their biofuels enthusiasm and are rolling back some of their generous subsidies .
the eu is also starting to reconsider its commitment to these so-called first-generation biofuels .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : pump with biodiesel from rapeseed recent reports have linked rising food prices and rainforest production to biofuels , as farmers grow crops for fuel instead for human consumption .
the un special rapporteur for the right to food jean ziegler even called large-scale production of biofuels " a crime against humanity . "
the eu 's once highly touted goal of having 10 percent of transportation powered by biofuels by 2020 is no longer set in stone , since brussels did not foresee the problems that could arise .
" biofuels were at the center of praise at the beginning , and now they 're in the center of criticism , " said barbara helfferich , spokeswoman for eu environment commissioner stavros dimas .
" now it 's not biofuels in and of themselves , it 's what kind of biofuels and how we produce them . "
hopes for the second-generation as politicians and policy makers begin toning down their tributes to first-generation biofuels , they 're not giving up on the concept altogether .
what did n't work the first time around , the thinking seems to be , might succeed on a second try .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : car manufacturers are especially eager to see second-generation biofuels a reality in a small town about a half-hour 's drive from dresden , some leading political and industry leaders gathered recently .
german chancellor angela merkel was there , along with daimler ceo dieter zetsche , volkswagen boss martin winterkorn and rob routs , a high-ranking executive at shell .
they 've gathered at what choren industries claims is the “ the world 's first commercial production plant to convert biomass into synthetic diesel fuel . ”
instead of using rapeseed , wheat or corn , chroen will use forest residue and waste wood to produce its sun diesel , which it claims is head and shoulders above anything on the market today .
" we would be triple a if judged by moody 's , " said tom blades , head of choren .
" compared to fossil fuels , we actually lower the co2 emissions in the product lifecycle by over 90 percent . " it is an enticing claim and one which industry leaders , particular from the german car industry , are eager to support .
they are already under pressure to reduce their emissions to abide by european union guidelines and merkel 's government is reported to be waging a rearguard campaign to delay implementation , reduce penalties and ease the burden on the country 's luxury automotive industry .
second-generation fuels could help the car industry meet climate-protection goals without it having to make too many sacrifices .
could work , maybe " synthetic fuels from biomass have the potential - and we 're still talking about potential - to become a central pillar in climate-friendly energy supply , " said angela merkel . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : biodiesel manufactuer choren but the word " potential " is key here , since second-generation biofuels are not yet proven , nor market ready .
according to the oecd , it remains to be seen whether these new fuels will become economically viable over the next decade , if ever .
they will need large-scale subsidies for the foreseeable future .
high costs are still a major factor .
there are logistical challenges of transporting biomass material to large production facilities , which could impose a floor on costs that would be difficult to lower .
and there is the land issue .
for large-scale production , there are fears that farmers would be tempted to turn fields over to tree plantations for second-generation biofuels instead of wheat or rice fields - a scenario which , again , could affect food availability .
dieter oelig of the environmental group nabu worries that there is too much focus on this new generation of fuel , and not enough on energy or automobile efficiency and other strategies that could be put in place now .
" maybe in 20 or 30 years or 40 years , we have a big potential -lrb- for second-generation biofuels -rrb- , if they work , " he said .
" but in 40 years , we need to have a lot of answers that are clear .

biofuels made from food crops were once seen as an environmental savior .
but not anymore .
now politicians and experts hope a new generation of green fuels will be a powerful weapon against climate change . there is an old saying : if it sounds too good to be true , it probably is .
when it comes to biofuels made from crops such as wheat , corn or rapeseed , many are saying that adage fits like a glove . biofuels were once seen as a near perfect tool to reduce emissions from cars and trucks .
while cars would still spew out greenhouse gases , if they ran on biofuel , at least the plants that made their fuel would have soaked up co2 while they were growing .
" in the beginning , it sounded very good , " said dietmar oeliger , a traffic policy expert at the german environmental group nabu .
" you did n't have to change your cars or your life system .
instead of using fossil fuels , you take something different and everything can stay the same . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : people worry that farmers are growing crops for fuel instead of food problem is , he added , it did n't work out the way it was planned .
despite huge government subsidies from eu countries to push biofuels - around 2.6 billion euros in tax subsidies in the eu in 2006 - their green credentials turned out to be questionable at best .
according to a report entitled " biofuels : is the cure worse than the disease ? " by the organization for economic cooperation and development -lrb- oecd -rrb- , conventional biofuel technology provides greenhouse gas reductions of less than 40 percent , which when other factors are taken into account , means that biofuels ' disadvantages can often outweigh the benefits .
" if you take the whole production process into account with some of them , the use of land , water , fertilizer , etc . , they do n't perform very well in mitigating co2 emissions , " said michael zirpel of the international transport forum , part of the oecd .
" some are even worse than fossil fuels . "
a serious rethink european countries are beginning to rethink their biofuels enthusiasm and are rolling back some of their generous subsidies .

here was the richest club in german soccer splashing the cash in a bid to regain control of a league they usually dominated but had recently lost their power over .
rivals scoffed at the gifts the bayern hierarchy had lavished on themselves .
despite accomplished performances for marseille and the french national team , ribery was seen as not much more than a player trading on the promise of greatness unfulfilled .
toni , while a world cup winner with italy and a prolific club marksman , had made his impact in mid-table serie a sides .
but he had been overlooked by the likes of domestic powerhouses like the milan clubs and juventus , when it came to snapping up a reliable scorer .
if anything , the transfer of klose , somewhat overshadowed by munich 's expensive european shopping spree , was seen as the most serious statement of intent for the season ahead .
and yet , looking back over a season which has seen bayern reemerge as the bundesliga 's top dog , klose has joined lukas podolski as one of the club 's more disappointing acquisitions .
franck and luca justify the summer spending bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : toni and ribery embodied bayern 's intent to conquer so , far from being a vulgar display of extravagance with little business acumen behind it , the purchase of ribery and toni in particular has proved to be the coup of the season , as the italian 's 35 goals in 41 games has shown alongside the frenchman 's utter dominance and guile .
the french midfielder only underlined his role as the top attraction of the bundesliga last sunday , when he came off the bench to score twice in a 4-1 demolition of vfb stuttgart with which munich effectively clinched another league title .
italian team-mate toni may almost be more valuable for munich with his 21 goals in the league , but it is ribery who has electrified the fans with a skill not seen in the german top flight for years .
" there was something like a circus atmosphere when ribery came on , " said munich chairman karl-heinz rummenigge .
" the fans really get a treat here . "
the frenchman , the most expensive player in munich history at 25 million euros , has been an instant hit and has even managed to get opposing fans on their feet - something rarely achieved as munich are either loved or hated .
ribery adds french flair to german efficiency bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ribery has brought excitement to bayern munich and while the summer spending was intended to bring the title back to the allianz arena , it was also money spent in a bid to bring entertainment to the fans .
for all bayern 's success , they have rarely been the most exciting and aesthetic of teams , preferring to grind opponents into defeat with a ruthless efficiency rather than to play their opposition off the park .
for all the excitement ribery brings to the team , it would all be for nothing if there was n't a striker at the end of the beautiful moves to put the ball in the net and luca toni has proved to be that man .
lauded by none other than bayern striking legend gerd mueller , who believes toni is the player to beat his long-standing 40-goals-in-a-season record , the italian is seen by many in munich as the type of target man the club has been missing for years .
the former fiorentina forward has fired bayern to the cusp of a 21st title , combined with the livewire ribery to win the dfb cup for munich , and has scored 10 goals so far in a uefa cup campaign , which has seen the german side reach the semi-finals .
after a journeyman career which has taken him through ten teams , toni now looks at home .
munich lucky to have luca bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the italian job : toni has had a smash-and-grab season " he 's a world-class striker .
he 's got an amazing instinct for goals , " said bayern coach ottmar hitzfeld , barely containing his enthusiasm for toni .
" he always believes he can score two or three goals in each match .
he 's never satisfied and always hungry for more goals .
he 's a real winner , a leader on our team . "
however , the combination of the frenchman and the italian , the plaudits that follow them and the silverware they look destined to win together , disguise the fact that munich 's german stars have failed to set the league alight this season .
klose has been dogged by injury as the season entered its critical phase .
even when he played , he failed to maintain the form he displayed in the campaign 's opening salvos after moving from werder bremen in the summer .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : podolski and klose enjoy a happier moment together podolski has proved to be an asset from the bench , scoring important goals in substitute cameos , but has also failed to establish himself as a first team regular since his arrival from cologne in 2006 .
he remains behind toni and klose in the battle to start up front for bayern despite maintaining his clinical streak for the national team .
another german acquisition , jan schlaudraff , failed to even make it to the end of the season before being offloaded .
schlaudraff , who moved to bayern from alemannia aachen last summer for 1.2 million euros , completed a move to fellow bundesliga club hanover in april after a frustrating campaign in the lower reaches of the club 's pecking order .
the disappointment of their german stars and the 70-odd million euros they handed out almost a year ago will all be forgotten by the fans and the management alike , if bayern munich can complete their resurrection with a league , cup and european treble .
ribery and toni will then look like the bargains of the season . nick amies send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

here was the richest club in german soccer splashing the cash in a bid to regain control of a league they usually dominated but had recently lost their power over .
rivals scoffed at the gifts the bayern hierarchy had lavished on themselves .
despite accomplished performances for marseille and the french national team , ribery was seen as not much more than a player trading on the promise of greatness unfulfilled .
toni , while a world cup winner with italy and a prolific club marksman , had made his impact in mid-table serie a sides .
but he had been overlooked by the likes of domestic powerhouses like the milan clubs and juventus , when it came to snapping up a reliable scorer .
if anything , the transfer of klose , somewhat overshadowed by munich 's expensive european shopping spree , was seen as the most serious statement of intent for the season ahead .
and yet , looking back over a season which has seen bayern reemerge as the bundesliga 's top dog , klose has joined lukas podolski as one of the club 's more disappointing acquisitions .
franck and luca justify the summer spending bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : toni and ribery embodied bayern 's intent to conquer so , far from being a vulgar display of extravagance with little business acumen behind it , the purchase of ribery and toni in particular has proved to be the coup of the season , as the italian 's 35 goals in 41 games has shown alongside the frenchman 's utter dominance and guile .
the french midfielder only underlined his role as the top attraction of the bundesliga last sunday , when he came off the bench to score twice in a 4-1 demolition of vfb stuttgart with which munich effectively clinched another league title .
italian team-mate toni may almost be more valuable for munich with his 21 goals in the league , but it is ribery who has electrified the fans with a skill not seen in the german top flight for years .
" there was something like a circus atmosphere when ribery came on , " said munich chairman karl-heinz rummenigge .
" the fans really get a treat here . "
the frenchman , the most expensive player in munich history at 25 million euros , has been an instant hit and has even managed to get opposing fans on their feet - something rarely achieved as munich are either loved or hated .
ribery adds french flair to german efficiency bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ribery has brought excitement to bayern munich and while the summer spending was intended to bring the title back to the allianz arena , it was also money spent in a bid to bring entertainment to the fans .
for all bayern 's success , they have rarely been the most exciting and aesthetic of teams , preferring to grind opponents into defeat with a ruthless efficiency rather than to play their opposition off the park .
for all the excitement ribery brings to the team , it would all be for nothing if there was n't a striker at the end of the beautiful moves to put the ball in the net and luca toni has proved to be that man .
lauded by none other than bayern striking legend gerd mueller , who believes toni is the player to beat his long-standing 40-goals-in-a-season record , the italian is seen by many in munich as the type of target man the club has been missing for years .
the former fiorentina forward has fired bayern to the cusp of a 21st title , combined with the livewire ribery to win the dfb cup for munich , and has scored 10 goals so far in a uefa cup campaign , which has seen the german side reach the semi-finals .
after a journeyman career which has taken him through ten teams , toni now looks at home .
munich lucky to have luca bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the italian job : toni has had a smash-and-grab season " he 's a world-class striker .
he 's got an amazing instinct for goals , " said bayern coach ottmar hitzfeld , barely containing his enthusiasm for toni .
" he always believes he can score two or three goals in each match .
he 's never satisfied and always hungry for more goals .
he 's a real winner , a leader on our team . "
however , the combination of the frenchman and the italian , the plaudits that follow them and the silverware they look destined to win together , disguise the fact that munich 's german stars have failed to set the league alight this season .
klose has been dogged by injury as the season entered its critical phase .
even when he played , he failed to maintain the form he displayed in the campaign 's opening salvos after moving from werder bremen in the summer .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : podolski and klose enjoy a happier moment together podolski has proved to be an asset from the bench , scoring important goals in substitute cameos , but has also failed to establish himself as a first team regular since his arrival from cologne in 2006 .
he remains behind toni and klose in the battle to start up front for bayern despite maintaining his clinical streak for the national team .
another german acquisition , jan schlaudraff , failed to even make it to the end of the season before being offloaded .
schlaudraff , who moved to bayern from alemannia aachen last summer for 1.2 million euros , completed a move to fellow bundesliga club hanover in april after a frustrating campaign in the lower reaches of the club 's pecking order .
the disappointment of their german stars and the 70-odd million euros they handed out almost a year ago will all be forgotten by the fans and the management alike , if bayern munich can complete their resurrection with a league , cup and european treble .

here was the richest club in german soccer splashing the cash in a bid to regain control of a league they usually dominated but had recently lost their power over .
rivals scoffed at the gifts the bayern hierarchy had lavished on themselves .
despite accomplished performances for marseille and the french national team , ribery was seen as not much more than a player trading on the promise of greatness unfulfilled .
toni , while a world cup winner with italy and a prolific club marksman , had made his impact in mid-table serie a sides .
but he had been overlooked by the likes of domestic powerhouses like the milan clubs and juventus , when it came to snapping up a reliable scorer .
if anything , the transfer of klose , somewhat overshadowed by munich 's expensive european shopping spree , was seen as the most serious statement of intent for the season ahead .
and yet , looking back over a season which has seen bayern reemerge as the bundesliga 's top dog , klose has joined lukas podolski as one of the club 's more disappointing acquisitions .
franck and luca justify the summer spending bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : toni and ribery embodied bayern 's intent to conquer so , far from being a vulgar display of extravagance with little business acumen behind it , the purchase of ribery and toni in particular has proved to be the coup of the season , as the italian 's 35 goals in 41 games has shown alongside the frenchman 's utter dominance and guile .
the french midfielder only underlined his role as the top attraction of the bundesliga last sunday , when he came off the bench to score twice in a 4-1 demolition of vfb stuttgart with which munich effectively clinched another league title .
italian team-mate toni may almost be more valuable for munich with his 21 goals in the league , but it is ribery who has electrified the fans with a skill not seen in the german top flight for years .
" there was something like a circus atmosphere when ribery came on , " said munich chairman karl-heinz rummenigge .
" the fans really get a treat here . "
the frenchman , the most expensive player in munich history at 25 million euros , has been an instant hit and has even managed to get opposing fans on their feet - something rarely achieved as munich are either loved or hated .
ribery adds french flair to german efficiency bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ribery has brought excitement to bayern munich and while the summer spending was intended to bring the title back to the allianz arena , it was also money spent in a bid to bring entertainment to the fans .
for all bayern 's success , they have rarely been the most exciting and aesthetic of teams , preferring to grind opponents into defeat with a ruthless efficiency rather than to play their opposition off the park .
for all the excitement ribery brings to the team , it would all be for nothing if there was n't a striker at the end of the beautiful moves to put the ball in the net and luca toni has proved to be that man .
lauded by none other than bayern striking legend gerd mueller , who believes toni is the player to beat his long-standing 40-goals-in-a-season record , the italian is seen by many in munich as the type of target man the club has been missing for years .
the former fiorentina forward has fired bayern to the cusp of a 21st title , combined with the livewire ribery to win the dfb cup for munich , and has scored 10 goals so far in a uefa cup campaign , which has seen the german side reach the semi-finals .
after a journeyman career which has taken him through ten teams , toni now looks at home .
munich lucky to have luca bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the italian job : toni has had a smash-and-grab season " he 's a world-class striker .
he 's got an amazing instinct for goals , " said bayern coach ottmar hitzfeld , barely containing his enthusiasm for toni .
" he always believes he can score two or three goals in each match .
he 's never satisfied and always hungry for more goals .
he 's a real winner , a leader on our team . "
however , the combination of the frenchman and the italian , the plaudits that follow them and the silverware they look destined to win together , disguise the fact that munich 's german stars have failed to set the league alight this season .
klose has been dogged by injury as the season entered its critical phase .
even when he played , he failed to maintain the form he displayed in the campaign 's opening salvos after moving from werder bremen in the summer .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : podolski and klose enjoy a happier moment together podolski has proved to be an asset from the bench , scoring important goals in substitute cameos , but has also failed to establish himself as a first team regular since his arrival from cologne in 2006 .
he remains behind toni and klose in the battle to start up front for bayern despite maintaining his clinical streak for the national team .
another german acquisition , jan schlaudraff , failed to even make it to the end of the season before being offloaded .
schlaudraff , who moved to bayern from alemannia aachen last summer for 1.2 million euros , completed a move to fellow bundesliga club hanover in april after a frustrating campaign in the lower reaches of the club 's pecking order .
the disappointment of their german stars and the 70-odd million euros they handed out almost a year ago will all be forgotten by the fans and the management alike , if bayern munich can complete their resurrection with a league , cup and european treble .
ribery and toni will then look like the bargains of the season . nick amies send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

replacement candidates will face some steep competition from wagner 's two daughters , said to be favorites . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : wolfgang wagner has been in charge of bayreuth since 1951 wagner is resigning as director of the bayreuth festival , officials said on tuesday , april 29 .
the prestigious annual event celebrates the music of his grandfather richard wagner .
wagner has headed the renowned festival since 1951 .
yet with wagner turning 89 on august 30 , he decided it was time to retire .
no replacement for wagner has been announced .
bayreuth officials said that interested candidates have four months to apply .
the festival has been at the center of a decades-long family feud over who will succeed the increasingly frail elder wagner .
sisterly duet bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the festival has become a major celebrity event wagner recently hinted that he could imagine his estranged daughter eva wagner-pasquier , 63 , teaming up with her half-sister katharina wagner , 29 , to run the festival jointly .
the half-sisters were called on by the festival board to devise a joint proposal for the future of the festival as soon as possible .
yet the two half sisters are known to have a strained relationship .
the festival board ordered wagner to hand over the reigns to eva in 2001 .
but the two have not been on speaking terms since wolfgang divorced eva 's mother ellen drexel in 1976 to marry gudrun wagner .
founded in 1876 by richard wagner , the festival has become an opera spectacle of legendary proportions .
performances are sold out years in advance with top german socialites and politicians attending .
wolfgang wagner has been praised for his financial management of the festival and for drawing top musical directors . dw staff -lrb- th -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

here was the richest club in german soccer splashing the cash in a bid to regain control of a league they usually dominated but had recently lost their power over .
rivals scoffed at the gifts the bayern hierarchy had lavished on themselves .
despite accomplished performances for marseille and the french national team , ribery was seen as not much more than a player trading on the promise of greatness unfulfilled .
toni , while a world cup winner with italy and a prolific club marksman , had made his impact in mid-table serie a sides .
but he had been overlooked by the likes of domestic powerhouses like the milan clubs and juventus , when it came to snapping up a reliable scorer .
if anything , the transfer of klose , somewhat overshadowed by munich 's expensive european shopping spree , was seen as the most serious statement of intent for the season ahead .
and yet , looking back over a season which has seen bayern reemerge as the bundesliga 's top dog , klose has joined lukas podolski as one of the club 's more disappointing acquisitions .
franck and luca justify the summer spending bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : toni and ribery embodied bayern 's intent to conquer so , far from being a vulgar display of extravagance with little business acumen behind it , the purchase of ribery and toni in particular has proved to be the coup of the season , as the italian 's 35 goals in 41 games has shown alongside the frenchman 's utter dominance and guile .
the french midfielder only underlined his role as the top attraction of the bundesliga last sunday , when he came off the bench to score twice in a 4-1 demolition of vfb stuttgart with which munich effectively clinched another league title .
italian team-mate toni may almost be more valuable for munich with his 21 goals in the league , but it is ribery who has electrified the fans with a skill not seen in the german top flight for years .
" there was something like a circus atmosphere when ribery came on , " said munich chairman karl-heinz rummenigge .
" the fans really get a treat here . "
the frenchman , the most expensive player in munich history at 25 million euros , has been an instant hit and has even managed to get opposing fans on their feet - something rarely achieved as munich are either loved or hated .
ribery adds french flair to german efficiency bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ribery has brought excitement to bayern munich and while the summer spending was intended to bring the title back to the allianz arena , it was also money spent in a bid to bring entertainment to the fans .
for all bayern 's success , they have rarely been the most exciting and aesthetic of teams , preferring to grind opponents into defeat with a ruthless efficiency rather than to play their opposition off the park .
for all the excitement ribery brings to the team , it would all be for nothing if there was n't a striker at the end of the beautiful moves to put the ball in the net and luca toni has proved to be that man .
lauded by none other than bayern striking legend gerd mueller , who believes toni is the player to beat his long-standing 40-goals-in-a-season record , the italian is seen by many in munich as the type of target man the club has been missing for years .
the former fiorentina forward has fired bayern to the cusp of a 21st title , combined with the livewire ribery to win the dfb cup for munich , and has scored 10 goals so far in a uefa cup campaign , which has seen the german side reach the semi-finals .
after a journeyman career which has taken him through ten teams , toni now looks at home .
munich lucky to have luca bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the italian job : toni has had a smash-and-grab season " he 's a world-class striker .
he 's got an amazing instinct for goals , " said bayern coach ottmar hitzfeld , barely containing his enthusiasm for toni .
" he always believes he can score two or three goals in each match .
he 's never satisfied and always hungry for more goals .
he 's a real winner , a leader on our team . "
however , the combination of the frenchman and the italian , the plaudits that follow them and the silverware they look destined to win together , disguise the fact that munich 's german stars have failed to set the league alight this season .
klose has been dogged by injury as the season entered its critical phase .
even when he played , he failed to maintain the form he displayed in the campaign 's opening salvos after moving from werder bremen in the summer .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : podolski and klose enjoy a happier moment together podolski has proved to be an asset from the bench , scoring important goals in substitute cameos , but has also failed to establish himself as a first team regular since his arrival from cologne in 2006 .
he remains behind toni and klose in the battle to start up front for bayern despite maintaining his clinical streak for the national team .
another german acquisition , jan schlaudraff , failed to even make it to the end of the season before being offloaded .
schlaudraff , who moved to bayern from alemannia aachen last summer for 1.2 million euros , completed a move to fellow bundesliga club hanover in april after a frustrating campaign in the lower reaches of the club 's pecking order .
the disappointment of their german stars and the 70-odd million euros they handed out almost a year ago will all be forgotten by the fans and the management alike , if bayern munich can complete their resurrection with a league , cup and european treble .
ribery and toni will then look like the bargains of the season . nick amies send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

franck and luca justify the summer spending bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : toni and ribery embodied bayern 's intent to conquer so , far from being a vulgar display of extravagance with little business acumen behind it , the purchase of ribery and toni in particular has proved to be the coup of the season , as the italian 's 35 goals in 41 games has shown alongside the frenchman 's utter dominance and guile .
the french midfielder only underlined his role as the top attraction of the bundesliga last sunday , when he came off the bench to score twice in a 4-1 demolition of vfb stuttgart with which munich effectively clinched another league title .
italian team-mate toni may almost be more valuable for munich with his 21 goals in the league , but it is ribery who has electrified the fans with a skill not seen in the german top flight for years .
" there was something like a circus atmosphere when ribery came on , " said munich chairman karl-heinz rummenigge .
" the fans really get a treat here . "
the frenchman , the most expensive player in munich history at 25 million euros , has been an instant hit and has even managed to get opposing fans on their feet - something rarely achieved as munich are either loved or hated .
ribery adds french flair to german efficiency bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ribery has brought excitement to bayern munich and while the summer spending was intended to bring the title back to the allianz arena , it was also money spent in a bid to bring entertainment to the fans .
for all bayern 's success , they have rarely been the most exciting and aesthetic of teams , preferring to grind opponents into defeat with a ruthless efficiency rather than to play their opposition off the park .
for all the excitement ribery brings to the team , it would all be for nothing if there was n't a striker at the end of the beautiful moves to put the ball in the net and luca toni has proved to be that man .
lauded by none other than bayern striking legend gerd mueller , who believes toni is the player to beat his long-standing 40-goals-in-a-season record , the italian is seen by many in munich as the type of target man the club has been missing for years .
the former fiorentina forward has fired bayern to the cusp of a 21st title , combined with the livewire ribery to win the dfb cup for munich , and has scored 10 goals so far in a uefa cup campaign , which has seen the german side reach the semi-finals .
after a journeyman career which has taken him through ten teams , toni now looks at home .
munich lucky to have luca bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the italian job : toni has had a smash-and-grab season " he 's a world-class striker .
he 's got an amazing instinct for goals , " said bayern coach ottmar hitzfeld , barely containing his enthusiasm for toni .
" he always believes he can score two or three goals in each match .
he 's never satisfied and always hungry for more goals .
he 's a real winner , a leader on our team . "
however , the combination of the frenchman and the italian , the plaudits that follow them and the silverware they look destined to win together , disguise the fact that munich 's german stars have failed to set the league alight this season .
klose has been dogged by injury as the season entered its critical phase .
even when he played , he failed to maintain the form he displayed in the campaign 's opening salvos after moving from werder bremen in the summer .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : podolski and klose enjoy a happier moment together podolski has proved to be an asset from the bench , scoring important goals in substitute cameos , but has also failed to establish himself as a first team regular since his arrival from cologne in 2006 .
he remains behind toni and klose in the battle to start up front for bayern despite maintaining his clinical streak for the national team .
another german acquisition , jan schlaudraff , failed to even make it to the end of the season before being offloaded .
schlaudraff , who moved to bayern from alemannia aachen last summer for 1.2 million euros , completed a move to fellow bundesliga club hanover in april after a frustrating campaign in the lower reaches of the club 's pecking order .
the disappointment of their german stars and the 70-odd million euros they handed out almost a year ago will all be forgotten by the fans and the management alike , if bayern munich can complete their resurrection with a league , cup and european treble .

here was the richest club in german soccer splashing the cash in a bid to regain control of a league they usually dominated but had recently lost their power over .
rivals scoffed at the gifts the bayern hierarchy had lavished on themselves .
despite accomplished performances for marseille and the french national team , ribery was seen as not much more than a player trading on the promise of greatness unfulfilled .
toni , while a world cup winner with italy and a prolific club marksman , had made his impact in mid-table serie a sides .
but he had been overlooked by the likes of domestic powerhouses like the milan clubs and juventus , when it came to snapping up a reliable scorer .
if anything , the transfer of klose , somewhat overshadowed by munich 's expensive european shopping spree , was seen as the most serious statement of intent for the season ahead .
and yet , looking back over a season which has seen bayern reemerge as the bundesliga 's top dog , klose has joined lukas podolski as one of the club 's more disappointing acquisitions .

serbia will be asked to carry out various political , judicial and economic reforms . in return , the eu will offer a series of benefits , including financial assistance , free trade deals and the relaxation of visa rules . tuesday 's diplomatic breakthrough came after the netherlands and belgium said they would no longer oppose the serbian saa .
both countries had blocked the agreement because they felt belgrade was not fully cooperating with the hague tribunal . the netherlands and belgium agreed to sign the saa on the condition that serbia handed over all remaining war-crime suspects .

but the balkan country will have to convince its eu partners and its own countrymen that it 's ready to join the bloc . the stabilization and association agreement -lrb- saa -rrb- , a precursor to full eu membership talks , was signed on tuesday , april 29 , by the eu foreign ministers and serbia 's deputy prime minister bozidar djelic in the presence of the serbian president , boris tadic . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : djelic -lrb- left -rrb- , tadic , solana and rupel were happy that the job was done europe hopes that the deal will boost serbia 's pro-european parties ahead of an upcoming parliamentary vote . but first , the ex-yugoslav country will have to show it is fully cooperating with the international war crimes tribunal in the hague .
eu states will not ratify the pact , nor will serbia get any trade or other benefits until this condition is met . the saa sent " a strong signal to serbia to join us , to come to the eu , " said slovenian foreign minister dimitrij rupel , who chaired the council meeting of eu foreign ministers in luxembourg where the decision was made . serbian foreign minister vuk jeremic , a pro-european member of the government , called the saa agreement historic and said the decision signaled " an important political statement " which will open the doors to serbia 's eu membership .

serbia will be asked to carry out various political , judicial and economic reforms . in return , the eu will offer a series of benefits , including financial assistance , free trade deals and the relaxation of visa rules . tuesday 's diplomatic breakthrough came after the netherlands and belgium said they would no longer oppose the serbian saa .
both countries had blocked the agreement because they felt belgrade was not fully cooperating with the hague tribunal . the netherlands and belgium agreed to sign the saa on the condition that serbia handed over all remaining war-crime suspects .
the most notorious criminal is ratko mladic , the bosnian-serb general indicted for genocide and crimes against humanity .

it 's thought that current prime minister vojislav kostunica will be the king maker in the upcoming elections . kostunica formed an uneasy coalition with tadic 's party , which collapsed in march .
kostunica 's increasingly nationalistic democratic party of serbia was enraged by what it sees as tadic 's acceptance of kosovo 's recent declaration of independence .
kosovo , a predominantly ethnic-albanian province , split from belgrade on feb .

merkel calls on brazil to make biofuel production sustainable german minister calls for reversal of eu agricultural policy germany defends biofuels , hedges bets on energy goals illegal logging gives eu massive eco-headache environment -pipe- 29.04.2008 as biofuels fall from grace , a new generation grabs spotlight großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a second-generation biofuel production facility - the new climate savior ?
biofuels made from food crops were once seen as an environmental savior .
but not anymore .
now politicians and experts hope a new generation of green fuels will be a powerful weapon against climate change . there is an old saying : if it sounds too good to be true , it probably is .
when it comes to biofuels made from crops such as wheat , corn or rapeseed , many are saying that adage fits like a glove . biofuels were once seen as a near perfect tool to reduce emissions from cars and trucks .
while cars would still spew out greenhouse gases , if they ran on biofuel , at least the plants that made their fuel would have soaked up co2 while they were growing .
" in the beginning , it sounded very good , " said dietmar oeliger , a traffic policy expert at the german environmental group nabu .
" you did n't have to change your cars or your life system .
instead of using fossil fuels , you take something different and everything can stay the same . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : people worry that farmers are growing crops for fuel instead of food problem is , he added , it did n't work out the way it was planned .
despite huge government subsidies from eu countries to push biofuels - around 2.6 billion euros in tax subsidies in the eu in 2006 - their green credentials turned out to be questionable at best .
according to a report entitled " biofuels : is the cure worse than the disease ? " by the organization for economic cooperation and development -lrb- oecd -rrb- , conventional biofuel technology provides greenhouse gas reductions of less than 40 percent , which when other factors are taken into account , means that biofuels ' disadvantages can often outweigh the benefits .
" if you take the whole production process into account with some of them , the use of land , water , fertilizer , etc . , they do n't perform very well in mitigating co2 emissions , " said michael zirpel of the international transport forum , part of the oecd .
" some are even worse than fossil fuels . "
a serious rethink european countries are beginning to rethink their biofuels enthusiasm and are rolling back some of their generous subsidies .
the eu is also starting to reconsider its commitment to these so-called first-generation biofuels .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : pump with biodiesel from rapeseed recent reports have linked rising food prices and rainforest production to biofuels , as farmers grow crops for fuel instead for human consumption .
the un special rapporteur for the right to food jean ziegler even called large-scale production of biofuels " a crime against humanity . "
the eu 's once highly touted goal of having 10 percent of transportation powered by biofuels by 2020 is no longer set in stone , since brussels did not foresee the problems that could arise .
" biofuels were at the center of praise at the beginning , and now they 're in the center of criticism , " said barbara helfferich , spokeswoman for eu environment commissioner stavros dimas .
" now it 's not biofuels in and of themselves , it 's what kind of biofuels and how we produce them . "
hopes for the second-generation as politicians and policy makers begin toning down their tributes to first-generation biofuels , they 're not giving up on the concept altogether .
what did n't work the first time around , the thinking seems to be , might succeed on a second try .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : car manufacturers are especially eager to see second-generation biofuels a reality in a small town about a half-hour 's drive from dresden , some leading political and industry leaders gathered recently .
german chancellor angela merkel was there , along with daimler ceo dieter zetsche , volkswagen boss martin winterkorn and rob routs , a high-ranking executive at shell .
they 've gathered at what choren industries claims is the “ the world 's first commercial production plant to convert biomass into synthetic diesel fuel . ”
instead of using rapeseed , wheat or corn , chroen will use forest residue and waste wood to produce its sun diesel , which it claims is head and shoulders above anything on the market today .
" we would be triple a if judged by moody 's , " said tom blades , head of choren .
" compared to fossil fuels , we actually lower the co2 emissions in the product lifecycle by over 90 percent . " it is an enticing claim and one which industry leaders , particular from the german car industry , are eager to support .
they are already under pressure to reduce their emissions to abide by european union guidelines and merkel 's government is reported to be waging a rearguard campaign to delay implementation , reduce penalties and ease the burden on the country 's luxury automotive industry .
second-generation fuels could help the car industry meet climate-protection goals without it having to make too many sacrifices .
could work , maybe " synthetic fuels from biomass have the potential - and we 're still talking about potential - to become a central pillar in climate-friendly energy supply , " said angela merkel . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : biodiesel manufactuer choren but the word " potential " is key here , since second-generation biofuels are not yet proven , nor market ready .
according to the oecd , it remains to be seen whether these new fuels will become economically viable over the next decade , if ever .
they will need large-scale subsidies for the foreseeable future .
high costs are still a major factor .
there are logistical challenges of transporting biomass material to large production facilities , which could impose a floor on costs that would be difficult to lower .
and there is the land issue .
for large-scale production , there are fears that farmers would be tempted to turn fields over to tree plantations for second-generation biofuels instead of wheat or rice fields - a scenario which , again , could affect food availability .
dieter oelig of the environmental group nabu worries that there is too much focus on this new generation of fuel , and not enough on energy or automobile efficiency and other strategies that could be put in place now .
" maybe in 20 or 30 years or 40 years , we have a big potential -lrb- for second-generation biofuels -rrb- , if they work , " he said .
" but in 40 years , we need to have a lot of answers that are clear .

merkel calls on brazil to make biofuel production sustainable german minister calls for reversal of eu agricultural policy germany defends biofuels , hedges bets on energy goals illegal logging gives eu massive eco-headache environment -pipe- 29.04.2008 as biofuels fall from grace , a new generation grabs spotlight großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a second-generation biofuel production facility - the new climate savior ?
biofuels made from food crops were once seen as an environmental savior .
but not anymore .
now politicians and experts hope a new generation of green fuels will be a powerful weapon against climate change . there is an old saying : if it sounds too good to be true , it probably is .
when it comes to biofuels made from crops such as wheat , corn or rapeseed , many are saying that adage fits like a glove . biofuels were once seen as a near perfect tool to reduce emissions from cars and trucks .
while cars would still spew out greenhouse gases , if they ran on biofuel , at least the plants that made their fuel would have soaked up co2 while they were growing .
" in the beginning , it sounded very good , " said dietmar oeliger , a traffic policy expert at the german environmental group nabu .
" you did n't have to change your cars or your life system .
instead of using fossil fuels , you take something different and everything can stay the same . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : people worry that farmers are growing crops for fuel instead of food problem is , he added , it did n't work out the way it was planned .
despite huge government subsidies from eu countries to push biofuels - around 2.6 billion euros in tax subsidies in the eu in 2006 - their green credentials turned out to be questionable at best .
according to a report entitled " biofuels : is the cure worse than the disease ? " by the organization for economic cooperation and development -lrb- oecd -rrb- , conventional biofuel technology provides greenhouse gas reductions of less than 40 percent , which when other factors are taken into account , means that biofuels ' disadvantages can often outweigh the benefits .
" if you take the whole production process into account with some of them , the use of land , water , fertilizer , etc . , they do n't perform very well in mitigating co2 emissions , " said michael zirpel of the international transport forum , part of the oecd .
" some are even worse than fossil fuels . "
a serious rethink european countries are beginning to rethink their biofuels enthusiasm and are rolling back some of their generous subsidies .
the eu is also starting to reconsider its commitment to these so-called first-generation biofuels .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : pump with biodiesel from rapeseed recent reports have linked rising food prices and rainforest production to biofuels , as farmers grow crops for fuel instead for human consumption .
the un special rapporteur for the right to food jean ziegler even called large-scale production of biofuels " a crime against humanity . "
the eu 's once highly touted goal of having 10 percent of transportation powered by biofuels by 2020 is no longer set in stone , since brussels did not foresee the problems that could arise .
" biofuels were at the center of praise at the beginning , and now they 're in the center of criticism , " said barbara helfferich , spokeswoman for eu environment commissioner stavros dimas .
" now it 's not biofuels in and of themselves , it 's what kind of biofuels and how we produce them . "
hopes for the second-generation as politicians and policy makers begin toning down their tributes to first-generation biofuels , they 're not giving up on the concept altogether .
what did n't work the first time around , the thinking seems to be , might succeed on a second try .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : car manufacturers are especially eager to see second-generation biofuels a reality in a small town about a half-hour 's drive from dresden , some leading political and industry leaders gathered recently .
german chancellor angela merkel was there , along with daimler ceo dieter zetsche , volkswagen boss martin winterkorn and rob routs , a high-ranking executive at shell .
they 've gathered at what choren industries claims is the “ the world 's first commercial production plant to convert biomass into synthetic diesel fuel . ”
instead of using rapeseed , wheat or corn , chroen will use forest residue and waste wood to produce its sun diesel , which it claims is head and shoulders above anything on the market today .
" we would be triple a if judged by moody 's , " said tom blades , head of choren .
" compared to fossil fuels , we actually lower the co2 emissions in the product lifecycle by over 90 percent . " it is an enticing claim and one which industry leaders , particular from the german car industry , are eager to support .
they are already under pressure to reduce their emissions to abide by european union guidelines and merkel 's government is reported to be waging a rearguard campaign to delay implementation , reduce penalties and ease the burden on the country 's luxury automotive industry .
second-generation fuels could help the car industry meet climate-protection goals without it having to make too many sacrifices .
could work , maybe " synthetic fuels from biomass have the potential - and we 're still talking about potential - to become a central pillar in climate-friendly energy supply , " said angela merkel . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : biodiesel manufactuer choren but the word " potential " is key here , since second-generation biofuels are not yet proven , nor market ready .
according to the oecd , it remains to be seen whether these new fuels will become economically viable over the next decade , if ever .
they will need large-scale subsidies for the foreseeable future .
high costs are still a major factor .
there are logistical challenges of transporting biomass material to large production facilities , which could impose a floor on costs that would be difficult to lower .
and there is the land issue .
for large-scale production , there are fears that farmers would be tempted to turn fields over to tree plantations for second-generation biofuels instead of wheat or rice fields - a scenario which , again , could affect food availability .
dieter oelig of the environmental group nabu worries that there is too much focus on this new generation of fuel , and not enough on energy or automobile efficiency and other strategies that could be put in place now .
" maybe in 20 or 30 years or 40 years , we have a big potential -lrb- for second-generation biofuels -rrb- , if they work , " he said .

here was the richest club in german soccer splashing the cash in a bid to regain control of a league they usually dominated but had recently lost their power over .
rivals scoffed at the gifts the bayern hierarchy had lavished on themselves .
despite accomplished performances for marseille and the french national team , ribery was seen as not much more than a player trading on the promise of greatness unfulfilled .
toni , while a world cup winner with italy and a prolific club marksman , had made his impact in mid-table serie a sides .
but he had been overlooked by the likes of domestic powerhouses like the milan clubs and juventus , when it came to snapping up a reliable scorer .
if anything , the transfer of klose , somewhat overshadowed by munich 's expensive european shopping spree , was seen as the most serious statement of intent for the season ahead .
and yet , looking back over a season which has seen bayern reemerge as the bundesliga 's top dog , klose has joined lukas podolski as one of the club 's more disappointing acquisitions .
franck and luca justify the summer spending bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : toni and ribery embodied bayern 's intent to conquer so , far from being a vulgar display of extravagance with little business acumen behind it , the purchase of ribery and toni in particular has proved to be the coup of the season , as the italian 's 35 goals in 41 games has shown alongside the frenchman 's utter dominance and guile .
the french midfielder only underlined his role as the top attraction of the bundesliga last sunday , when he came off the bench to score twice in a 4-1 demolition of vfb stuttgart with which munich effectively clinched another league title .
italian team-mate toni may almost be more valuable for munich with his 21 goals in the league , but it is ribery who has electrified the fans with a skill not seen in the german top flight for years .
" there was something like a circus atmosphere when ribery came on , " said munich chairman karl-heinz rummenigge .
" the fans really get a treat here . "
the frenchman , the most expensive player in munich history at 25 million euros , has been an instant hit and has even managed to get opposing fans on their feet - something rarely achieved as munich are either loved or hated .
ribery adds french flair to german efficiency bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ribery has brought excitement to bayern munich and while the summer spending was intended to bring the title back to the allianz arena , it was also money spent in a bid to bring entertainment to the fans .
for all bayern 's success , they have rarely been the most exciting and aesthetic of teams , preferring to grind opponents into defeat with a ruthless efficiency rather than to play their opposition off the park .
for all the excitement ribery brings to the team , it would all be for nothing if there was n't a striker at the end of the beautiful moves to put the ball in the net and luca toni has proved to be that man .
lauded by none other than bayern striking legend gerd mueller , who believes toni is the player to beat his long-standing 40-goals-in-a-season record , the italian is seen by many in munich as the type of target man the club has been missing for years .
the former fiorentina forward has fired bayern to the cusp of a 21st title , combined with the livewire ribery to win the dfb cup for munich , and has scored 10 goals so far in a uefa cup campaign , which has seen the german side reach the semi-finals .
after a journeyman career which has taken him through ten teams , toni now looks at home .
munich lucky to have luca bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the italian job : toni has had a smash-and-grab season " he 's a world-class striker .
he 's got an amazing instinct for goals , " said bayern coach ottmar hitzfeld , barely containing his enthusiasm for toni .
" he always believes he can score two or three goals in each match .
he 's never satisfied and always hungry for more goals .
he 's a real winner , a leader on our team . "
however , the combination of the frenchman and the italian , the plaudits that follow them and the silverware they look destined to win together , disguise the fact that munich 's german stars have failed to set the league alight this season .
klose has been dogged by injury as the season entered its critical phase .
even when he played , he failed to maintain the form he displayed in the campaign 's opening salvos after moving from werder bremen in the summer .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : podolski and klose enjoy a happier moment together podolski has proved to be an asset from the bench , scoring important goals in substitute cameos , but has also failed to establish himself as a first team regular since his arrival from cologne in 2006 .
he remains behind toni and klose in the battle to start up front for bayern despite maintaining his clinical streak for the national team .
another german acquisition , jan schlaudraff , failed to even make it to the end of the season before being offloaded .
schlaudraff , who moved to bayern from alemannia aachen last summer for 1.2 million euros , completed a move to fellow bundesliga club hanover in april after a frustrating campaign in the lower reaches of the club 's pecking order .
the disappointment of their german stars and the 70-odd million euros they handed out almost a year ago will all be forgotten by the fans and the management alike , if bayern munich can complete their resurrection with a league , cup and european treble .
ribery and toni will then look like the bargains of the season . nick amies send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

here was the richest club in german soccer splashing the cash in a bid to regain control of a league they usually dominated but had recently lost their power over .
rivals scoffed at the gifts the bayern hierarchy had lavished on themselves .
despite accomplished performances for marseille and the french national team , ribery was seen as not much more than a player trading on the promise of greatness unfulfilled .
toni , while a world cup winner with italy and a prolific club marksman , had made his impact in mid-table serie a sides .
but he had been overlooked by the likes of domestic powerhouses like the milan clubs and juventus , when it came to snapping up a reliable scorer .
if anything , the transfer of klose , somewhat overshadowed by munich 's expensive european shopping spree , was seen as the most serious statement of intent for the season ahead .
and yet , looking back over a season which has seen bayern reemerge as the bundesliga 's top dog , klose has joined lukas podolski as one of the club 's more disappointing acquisitions .
franck and luca justify the summer spending bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : toni and ribery embodied bayern 's intent to conquer so , far from being a vulgar display of extravagance with little business acumen behind it , the purchase of ribery and toni in particular has proved to be the coup of the season , as the italian 's 35 goals in 41 games has shown alongside the frenchman 's utter dominance and guile .
the french midfielder only underlined his role as the top attraction of the bundesliga last sunday , when he came off the bench to score twice in a 4-1 demolition of vfb stuttgart with which munich effectively clinched another league title .
italian team-mate toni may almost be more valuable for munich with his 21 goals in the league , but it is ribery who has electrified the fans with a skill not seen in the german top flight for years .
" there was something like a circus atmosphere when ribery came on , " said munich chairman karl-heinz rummenigge .
" the fans really get a treat here . "
the frenchman , the most expensive player in munich history at 25 million euros , has been an instant hit and has even managed to get opposing fans on their feet - something rarely achieved as munich are either loved or hated .
ribery adds french flair to german efficiency bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ribery has brought excitement to bayern munich and while the summer spending was intended to bring the title back to the allianz arena , it was also money spent in a bid to bring entertainment to the fans .
for all bayern 's success , they have rarely been the most exciting and aesthetic of teams , preferring to grind opponents into defeat with a ruthless efficiency rather than to play their opposition off the park .
for all the excitement ribery brings to the team , it would all be for nothing if there was n't a striker at the end of the beautiful moves to put the ball in the net and luca toni has proved to be that man .
lauded by none other than bayern striking legend gerd mueller , who believes toni is the player to beat his long-standing 40-goals-in-a-season record , the italian is seen by many in munich as the type of target man the club has been missing for years .
the former fiorentina forward has fired bayern to the cusp of a 21st title , combined with the livewire ribery to win the dfb cup for munich , and has scored 10 goals so far in a uefa cup campaign , which has seen the german side reach the semi-finals .
after a journeyman career which has taken him through ten teams , toni now looks at home .
munich lucky to have luca bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the italian job : toni has had a smash-and-grab season " he 's a world-class striker .
he 's got an amazing instinct for goals , " said bayern coach ottmar hitzfeld , barely containing his enthusiasm for toni .
" he always believes he can score two or three goals in each match .
he 's never satisfied and always hungry for more goals .
he 's a real winner , a leader on our team . "
however , the combination of the frenchman and the italian , the plaudits that follow them and the silverware they look destined to win together , disguise the fact that munich 's german stars have failed to set the league alight this season .
klose has been dogged by injury as the season entered its critical phase .
even when he played , he failed to maintain the form he displayed in the campaign 's opening salvos after moving from werder bremen in the summer .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : podolski and klose enjoy a happier moment together podolski has proved to be an asset from the bench , scoring important goals in substitute cameos , but has also failed to establish himself as a first team regular since his arrival from cologne in 2006 .
he remains behind toni and klose in the battle to start up front for bayern despite maintaining his clinical streak for the national team .
another german acquisition , jan schlaudraff , failed to even make it to the end of the season before being offloaded .
schlaudraff , who moved to bayern from alemannia aachen last summer for 1.2 million euros , completed a move to fellow bundesliga club hanover in april after a frustrating campaign in the lower reaches of the club 's pecking order .
the disappointment of their german stars and the 70-odd million euros they handed out almost a year ago will all be forgotten by the fans and the management alike , if bayern munich can complete their resurrection with a league , cup and european treble .
ribery and toni will then look like the bargains of the season . nick amies send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

franck and luca justify the summer spending bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : toni and ribery embodied bayern 's intent to conquer so , far from being a vulgar display of extravagance with little business acumen behind it , the purchase of ribery and toni in particular has proved to be the coup of the season , as the italian 's 35 goals in 41 games has shown alongside the frenchman 's utter dominance and guile .
the french midfielder only underlined his role as the top attraction of the bundesliga last sunday , when he came off the bench to score twice in a 4-1 demolition of vfb stuttgart with which munich effectively clinched another league title .
italian team-mate toni may almost be more valuable for munich with his 21 goals in the league , but it is ribery who has electrified the fans with a skill not seen in the german top flight for years .
" there was something like a circus atmosphere when ribery came on , " said munich chairman karl-heinz rummenigge .
" the fans really get a treat here . "
the frenchman , the most expensive player in munich history at 25 million euros , has been an instant hit and has even managed to get opposing fans on their feet - something rarely achieved as munich are either loved or hated .
ribery adds french flair to german efficiency bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ribery has brought excitement to bayern munich and while the summer spending was intended to bring the title back to the allianz arena , it was also money spent in a bid to bring entertainment to the fans .
for all bayern 's success , they have rarely been the most exciting and aesthetic of teams , preferring to grind opponents into defeat with a ruthless efficiency rather than to play their opposition off the park .
for all the excitement ribery brings to the team , it would all be for nothing if there was n't a striker at the end of the beautiful moves to put the ball in the net and luca toni has proved to be that man .
lauded by none other than bayern striking legend gerd mueller , who believes toni is the player to beat his long-standing 40-goals-in-a-season record , the italian is seen by many in munich as the type of target man the club has been missing for years .
the former fiorentina forward has fired bayern to the cusp of a 21st title , combined with the livewire ribery to win the dfb cup for munich , and has scored 10 goals so far in a uefa cup campaign , which has seen the german side reach the semi-finals .
after a journeyman career which has taken him through ten teams , toni now looks at home .
munich lucky to have luca bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the italian job : toni has had a smash-and-grab season " he 's a world-class striker .
he 's got an amazing instinct for goals , " said bayern coach ottmar hitzfeld , barely containing his enthusiasm for toni .
" he always believes he can score two or three goals in each match .
he 's never satisfied and always hungry for more goals .
he 's a real winner , a leader on our team . "
however , the combination of the frenchman and the italian , the plaudits that follow them and the silverware they look destined to win together , disguise the fact that munich 's german stars have failed to set the league alight this season .
klose has been dogged by injury as the season entered its critical phase .
even when he played , he failed to maintain the form he displayed in the campaign 's opening salvos after moving from werder bremen in the summer .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : podolski and klose enjoy a happier moment together podolski has proved to be an asset from the bench , scoring important goals in substitute cameos , but has also failed to establish himself as a first team regular since his arrival from cologne in 2006 .
he remains behind toni and klose in the battle to start up front for bayern despite maintaining his clinical streak for the national team .
another german acquisition , jan schlaudraff , failed to even make it to the end of the season before being offloaded .
schlaudraff , who moved to bayern from alemannia aachen last summer for 1.2 million euros , completed a move to fellow bundesliga club hanover in april after a frustrating campaign in the lower reaches of the club 's pecking order .
the disappointment of their german stars and the 70-odd million euros they handed out almost a year ago will all be forgotten by the fans and the management alike , if bayern munich can complete their resurrection with a league , cup and european treble .

here was the richest club in german soccer splashing the cash in a bid to regain control of a league they usually dominated but had recently lost their power over .
rivals scoffed at the gifts the bayern hierarchy had lavished on themselves .
despite accomplished performances for marseille and the french national team , ribery was seen as not much more than a player trading on the promise of greatness unfulfilled .
toni , while a world cup winner with italy and a prolific club marksman , had made his impact in mid-table serie a sides .
but he had been overlooked by the likes of domestic powerhouses like the milan clubs and juventus , when it came to snapping up a reliable scorer .
if anything , the transfer of klose , somewhat overshadowed by munich 's expensive european shopping spree , was seen as the most serious statement of intent for the season ahead .
and yet , looking back over a season which has seen bayern reemerge as the bundesliga 's top dog , klose has joined lukas podolski as one of the club 's more disappointing acquisitions .

replacement candidates will face some steep competition from wagner 's two daughters , said to be favorites . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : wolfgang wagner has been in charge of bayreuth since 1951 wagner is resigning as director of the bayreuth festival , officials said on tuesday , april 29 .
the prestigious annual event celebrates the music of his grandfather richard wagner .
wagner has headed the renowned festival since 1951 .
yet with wagner turning 89 on august 30 , he decided it was time to retire .
no replacement for wagner has been announced .
bayreuth officials said that interested candidates have four months to apply .
the festival has been at the center of a decades-long family feud over who will succeed the increasingly frail elder wagner .
sisterly duet bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the festival has become a major celebrity event wagner recently hinted that he could imagine his estranged daughter eva wagner-pasquier , 63 , teaming up with her half-sister katharina wagner , 29 , to run the festival jointly .
the half-sisters were called on by the festival board to devise a joint proposal for the future of the festival as soon as possible .

replacement candidates will face some steep competition from wagner 's two daughters , said to be favorites . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : wolfgang wagner has been in charge of bayreuth since 1951 wagner is resigning as director of the bayreuth festival , officials said on tuesday , april 29 .
the prestigious annual event celebrates the music of his grandfather richard wagner .
wagner has headed the renowned festival since 1951 .
yet with wagner turning 89 on august 30 , he decided it was time to retire .
no replacement for wagner has been announced .
bayreuth officials said that interested candidates have four months to apply .
the festival has been at the center of a decades-long family feud over who will succeed the increasingly frail elder wagner .
sisterly duet bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the festival has become a major celebrity event wagner recently hinted that he could imagine his estranged daughter eva wagner-pasquier , 63 , teaming up with her half-sister katharina wagner , 29 , to run the festival jointly .
the half-sisters were called on by the festival board to devise a joint proposal for the future of the festival as soon as possible .
yet the two half sisters are known to have a strained relationship .
the festival board ordered wagner to hand over the reigns to eva in 2001 .
but the two have not been on speaking terms since wolfgang divorced eva 's mother ellen drexel in 1976 to marry gudrun wagner .
founded in 1876 by richard wagner , the festival has become an opera spectacle of legendary proportions .
performances are sold out years in advance with top german socialites and politicians attending .

merkel calls on brazil to make biofuel production sustainable german minister calls for reversal of eu agricultural policy germany defends biofuels , hedges bets on energy goals illegal logging gives eu massive eco-headache environment -pipe- 29.04.2008 as biofuels fall from grace , a new generation grabs spotlight großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a second-generation biofuel production facility - the new climate savior ?
biofuels made from food crops were once seen as an environmental savior .
but not anymore .
now politicians and experts hope a new generation of green fuels will be a powerful weapon against climate change . there is an old saying : if it sounds too good to be true , it probably is .
when it comes to biofuels made from crops such as wheat , corn or rapeseed , many are saying that adage fits like a glove . biofuels were once seen as a near perfect tool to reduce emissions from cars and trucks .
while cars would still spew out greenhouse gases , if they ran on biofuel , at least the plants that made their fuel would have soaked up co2 while they were growing .
" in the beginning , it sounded very good , " said dietmar oeliger , a traffic policy expert at the german environmental group nabu .
" you did n't have to change your cars or your life system .
instead of using fossil fuels , you take something different and everything can stay the same . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : people worry that farmers are growing crops for fuel instead of food problem is , he added , it did n't work out the way it was planned .
despite huge government subsidies from eu countries to push biofuels - around 2.6 billion euros in tax subsidies in the eu in 2006 - their green credentials turned out to be questionable at best .
according to a report entitled " biofuels : is the cure worse than the disease ? " by the organization for economic cooperation and development -lrb- oecd -rrb- , conventional biofuel technology provides greenhouse gas reductions of less than 40 percent , which when other factors are taken into account , means that biofuels ' disadvantages can often outweigh the benefits .
" if you take the whole production process into account with some of them , the use of land , water , fertilizer , etc . , they do n't perform very well in mitigating co2 emissions , " said michael zirpel of the international transport forum , part of the oecd .
" some are even worse than fossil fuels . "
a serious rethink european countries are beginning to rethink their biofuels enthusiasm and are rolling back some of their generous subsidies .
the eu is also starting to reconsider its commitment to these so-called first-generation biofuels .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : pump with biodiesel from rapeseed recent reports have linked rising food prices and rainforest production to biofuels , as farmers grow crops for fuel instead for human consumption .
the un special rapporteur for the right to food jean ziegler even called large-scale production of biofuels " a crime against humanity . "
the eu 's once highly touted goal of having 10 percent of transportation powered by biofuels by 2020 is no longer set in stone , since brussels did not foresee the problems that could arise .
" biofuels were at the center of praise at the beginning , and now they 're in the center of criticism , " said barbara helfferich , spokeswoman for eu environment commissioner stavros dimas .
" now it 's not biofuels in and of themselves , it 's what kind of biofuels and how we produce them . "
hopes for the second-generation as politicians and policy makers begin toning down their tributes to first-generation biofuels , they 're not giving up on the concept altogether .
what did n't work the first time around , the thinking seems to be , might succeed on a second try .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : car manufacturers are especially eager to see second-generation biofuels a reality in a small town about a half-hour 's drive from dresden , some leading political and industry leaders gathered recently .
german chancellor angela merkel was there , along with daimler ceo dieter zetsche , volkswagen boss martin winterkorn and rob routs , a high-ranking executive at shell .
they 've gathered at what choren industries claims is the “ the world 's first commercial production plant to convert biomass into synthetic diesel fuel . ”
instead of using rapeseed , wheat or corn , chroen will use forest residue and waste wood to produce its sun diesel , which it claims is head and shoulders above anything on the market today .
" we would be triple a if judged by moody 's , " said tom blades , head of choren .
" compared to fossil fuels , we actually lower the co2 emissions in the product lifecycle by over 90 percent . " it is an enticing claim and one which industry leaders , particular from the german car industry , are eager to support .
they are already under pressure to reduce their emissions to abide by european union guidelines and merkel 's government is reported to be waging a rearguard campaign to delay implementation , reduce penalties and ease the burden on the country 's luxury automotive industry .
second-generation fuels could help the car industry meet climate-protection goals without it having to make too many sacrifices .
could work , maybe " synthetic fuels from biomass have the potential - and we 're still talking about potential - to become a central pillar in climate-friendly energy supply , " said angela merkel . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : biodiesel manufactuer choren but the word " potential " is key here , since second-generation biofuels are not yet proven , nor market ready .
according to the oecd , it remains to be seen whether these new fuels will become economically viable over the next decade , if ever .
they will need large-scale subsidies for the foreseeable future .
high costs are still a major factor .
there are logistical challenges of transporting biomass material to large production facilities , which could impose a floor on costs that would be difficult to lower .
and there is the land issue .
for large-scale production , there are fears that farmers would be tempted to turn fields over to tree plantations for second-generation biofuels instead of wheat or rice fields - a scenario which , again , could affect food availability .
dieter oelig of the environmental group nabu worries that there is too much focus on this new generation of fuel , and not enough on energy or automobile efficiency and other strategies that could be put in place now .
" maybe in 20 or 30 years or 40 years , we have a big potential -lrb- for second-generation biofuels -rrb- , if they work , " he said .
" but in 40 years , we need to have a lot of answers that are clear .
otherwise , we 'll have a very big problem . " kyle james send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de bundesliga -pipe- 29.04.2008 bayern 's extravagant spending reaps its reward großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ribery and toni have silenced those who believed their transfer fees were exhorbitant anyone who says money ca n't buy happiness should take a look at the ecstatic faces of bayern munich 's supporters in the coming weeks before making a thorough reappraisal of that statement . when the bavarian giants shelled out 70 million euros -lrb- $ 109.4 million -rrb- for french midfielder franck ribery and italian striker luca toni , plus german international striker miroslav klose , in the summer , everyone who was n't a munich fan turned their noses up at the ostentatious frivolity of it all .
here was the richest club in german soccer splashing the cash in a bid to regain control of a league they usually dominated but had recently lost their power over .
rivals scoffed at the gifts the bayern hierarchy had lavished on themselves .
despite accomplished performances for marseille and the french national team , ribery was seen as not much more than a player trading on the promise of greatness unfulfilled .
toni , while a world cup winner with italy and a prolific club marksman , had made his impact in mid-table serie a sides .
but he had been overlooked by the likes of domestic powerhouses like the milan clubs and juventus , when it came to snapping up a reliable scorer .
if anything , the transfer of klose , somewhat overshadowed by munich 's expensive european shopping spree , was seen as the most serious statement of intent for the season ahead .
and yet , looking back over a season which has seen bayern reemerge as the bundesliga 's top dog , klose has joined lukas podolski as one of the club 's more disappointing acquisitions .
franck and luca justify the summer spending bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : toni and ribery embodied bayern 's intent to conquer so , far from being a vulgar display of extravagance with little business acumen behind it , the purchase of ribery and toni in particular has proved to be the coup of the season , as the italian 's 35 goals in 41 games has shown alongside the frenchman 's utter dominance and guile .
the french midfielder only underlined his role as the top attraction of the bundesliga last sunday , when he came off the bench to score twice in a 4-1 demolition of vfb stuttgart with which munich effectively clinched another league title .
italian team-mate toni may almost be more valuable for munich with his 21 goals in the league , but it is ribery who has electrified the fans with a skill not seen in the german top flight for years .
" there was something like a circus atmosphere when ribery came on , " said munich chairman karl-heinz rummenigge .
" the fans really get a treat here . "
the frenchman , the most expensive player in munich history at 25 million euros , has been an instant hit and has even managed to get opposing fans on their feet - something rarely achieved as munich are either loved or hated .
ribery adds french flair to german efficiency bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ribery has brought excitement to bayern munich and while the summer spending was intended to bring the title back to the allianz arena , it was also money spent in a bid to bring entertainment to the fans .
for all bayern 's success , they have rarely been the most exciting and aesthetic of teams , preferring to grind opponents into defeat with a ruthless efficiency rather than to play their opposition off the park .
for all the excitement ribery brings to the team , it would all be for nothing if there was n't a striker at the end of the beautiful moves to put the ball in the net and luca toni has proved to be that man .
lauded by none other than bayern striking legend gerd mueller , who believes toni is the player to beat his long-standing 40-goals-in-a-season record , the italian is seen by many in munich as the type of target man the club has been missing for years .
the former fiorentina forward has fired bayern to the cusp of a 21st title , combined with the livewire ribery to win the dfb cup for munich , and has scored 10 goals so far in a uefa cup campaign , which has seen the german side reach the semi-finals .
after a journeyman career which has taken him through ten teams , toni now looks at home .
munich lucky to have luca bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the italian job : toni has had a smash-and-grab season " he 's a world-class striker .
he 's got an amazing instinct for goals , " said bayern coach ottmar hitzfeld , barely containing his enthusiasm for toni .
" he always believes he can score two or three goals in each match .
he 's never satisfied and always hungry for more goals .
he 's a real winner , a leader on our team . "
however , the combination of the frenchman and the italian , the plaudits that follow them and the silverware they look destined to win together , disguise the fact that munich 's german stars have failed to set the league alight this season .
klose has been dogged by injury as the season entered its critical phase .
even when he played , he failed to maintain the form he displayed in the campaign 's opening salvos after moving from werder bremen in the summer .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : podolski and klose enjoy a happier moment together podolski has proved to be an asset from the bench , scoring important goals in substitute cameos , but has also failed to establish himself as a first team regular since his arrival from cologne in 2006 .
he remains behind toni and klose in the battle to start up front for bayern despite maintaining his clinical streak for the national team .
another german acquisition , jan schlaudraff , failed to even make it to the end of the season before being offloaded .
schlaudraff , who moved to bayern from alemannia aachen last summer for 1.2 million euros , completed a move to fellow bundesliga club hanover in april after a frustrating campaign in the lower reaches of the club 's pecking order .
the disappointment of their german stars and the 70-odd million euros they handed out almost a year ago will all be forgotten by the fans and the management alike , if bayern munich can complete their resurrection with a league , cup and european treble .
ribery and toni will then look like the bargains of the season . nick amies send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

germany 's largest bank reported a net loss of 131 million euros . germany 's biggest bank reported a net loss of 131 million euros -lrb- $ 205 million -rrb- during the first three months of the year , dramatically reversing a 2.12-billion-euro-profit for the same period of 2007 , according to data released tuesday , april 29 . pretax earnings fell to a loss of 254 million euros from a profit of 3.16 billion euros , it added . the bank 's results were weighed down by 1.77 billion euros in mark-downs on leveraged loans and loan commitments and 885 million euros in mark-downs on commercial real estate loans and residential mortgage-backed securities . overall , the charges came to 2.7 billion euros , slightly higher than previously forecast .
deutsche had announced on april 1 that it anticipated first-quarter mark-downs of about 2.5 billion euros . deutsche has already warned that its 8.4-billion-euro profit target could be at risk as a result of additional write-downs and volatile financial markets . pressure makes its mark on deutsche bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : reason to be cheerful ? deutsche 's josef ackermann " in the first quarter of this year , the financial market conditions were the most difficult in recent memory , " said deutsche bank head josef ackermann announcing the results .
" in the month of march , pressure on the banking sector was more intense than at any time since the current credit downturn began . " the international banking sector has been in turmoil since the united states market for high risk , or subprime , mortgages collapsed in mid 2007 .

ban also cited as another urgent priority support for farmers so as to " ensure food for tomorrow . " " in order to take this forward we have agreed to establish a un task force on global food crisis that i will chair and will bring together heads of specialized agencies and ... institutions into effective and coordinated mechanisms , " he said . escalation in prices drives crisis a un statement regarding the food crisis stated that the dramatic escalation in worldwide food prices has evolved into an unprecedented challenge of global proportions and added that crisis was having a large effect on " the world 's most vulnerable , including the urban poor . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ban ki-moon said underlying factors must be addressed after meeting with 27 key international agencies in berne , switzerland to hammer out a battle plan of emergency measures , while exploring other longer-term measures to solve the global food crisis , ban said an extra $ 755 million -lrb- 485 million euros -rrb- would be needed by the program due to the sharp jump in prices . but in the long-term , he acknowledged that there is an " urgent necessity to address structural and policy issues that have contributed to this crisis as well as the challenge posed by climate change . " world food program head josette sheeran told reporters : " we have pledges of 471 million , but only 18 million is cash in hand .
we ca n't procure food until we have cash in hand .
so we 're in a really urgent timeframe to getting a commitment as soon as possible . " world bank chief urges against export bans bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : zoellick expects wheat , rice and corn prices to remain high the world bank issued a statement tuesday saying it would double its lending for agriculture in africa over the next year to $ 800 million . " though we have seen wheat prices fall over the last few days , rice and corn prices are likely to remain high , and wheat relatively so , " world bank president robert zoellick told journalists . both zoellick and ban urged leaders not to ban food exports , since this would make the problem worse .

merkel calls on brazil to make biofuel production sustainable german minister calls for reversal of eu agricultural policy germany defends biofuels , hedges bets on energy goals illegal logging gives eu massive eco-headache environment -pipe- 29.04.2008 as biofuels fall from grace , a new generation grabs spotlight großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a second-generation biofuel production facility - the new climate savior ?
biofuels made from food crops were once seen as an environmental savior .
but not anymore .
now politicians and experts hope a new generation of green fuels will be a powerful weapon against climate change . there is an old saying : if it sounds too good to be true , it probably is .
when it comes to biofuels made from crops such as wheat , corn or rapeseed , many are saying that adage fits like a glove . biofuels were once seen as a near perfect tool to reduce emissions from cars and trucks .
while cars would still spew out greenhouse gases , if they ran on biofuel , at least the plants that made their fuel would have soaked up co2 while they were growing .
" in the beginning , it sounded very good , " said dietmar oeliger , a traffic policy expert at the german environmental group nabu .
" you did n't have to change your cars or your life system .
instead of using fossil fuels , you take something different and everything can stay the same . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : people worry that farmers are growing crops for fuel instead of food problem is , he added , it did n't work out the way it was planned .
despite huge government subsidies from eu countries to push biofuels - around 2.6 billion euros in tax subsidies in the eu in 2006 - their green credentials turned out to be questionable at best .
according to a report entitled " biofuels : is the cure worse than the disease ? " by the organization for economic cooperation and development -lrb- oecd -rrb- , conventional biofuel technology provides greenhouse gas reductions of less than 40 percent , which when other factors are taken into account , means that biofuels ' disadvantages can often outweigh the benefits .
" if you take the whole production process into account with some of them , the use of land , water , fertilizer , etc . , they do n't perform very well in mitigating co2 emissions , " said michael zirpel of the international transport forum , part of the oecd .
" some are even worse than fossil fuels . "
a serious rethink european countries are beginning to rethink their biofuels enthusiasm and are rolling back some of their generous subsidies .
the eu is also starting to reconsider its commitment to these so-called first-generation biofuels .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : pump with biodiesel from rapeseed recent reports have linked rising food prices and rainforest production to biofuels , as farmers grow crops for fuel instead for human consumption .
the un special rapporteur for the right to food jean ziegler even called large-scale production of biofuels " a crime against humanity . "
the eu 's once highly touted goal of having 10 percent of transportation powered by biofuels by 2020 is no longer set in stone , since brussels did not foresee the problems that could arise .
" biofuels were at the center of praise at the beginning , and now they 're in the center of criticism , " said barbara helfferich , spokeswoman for eu environment commissioner stavros dimas .
" now it 's not biofuels in and of themselves , it 's what kind of biofuels and how we produce them . "
hopes for the second-generation as politicians and policy makers begin toning down their tributes to first-generation biofuels , they 're not giving up on the concept altogether .
what did n't work the first time around , the thinking seems to be , might succeed on a second try .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : car manufacturers are especially eager to see second-generation biofuels a reality in a small town about a half-hour 's drive from dresden , some leading political and industry leaders gathered recently .
german chancellor angela merkel was there , along with daimler ceo dieter zetsche , volkswagen boss martin winterkorn and rob routs , a high-ranking executive at shell .
they 've gathered at what choren industries claims is the “ the world 's first commercial production plant to convert biomass into synthetic diesel fuel . ”
instead of using rapeseed , wheat or corn , chroen will use forest residue and waste wood to produce its sun diesel , which it claims is head and shoulders above anything on the market today .
" we would be triple a if judged by moody 's , " said tom blades , head of choren .
" compared to fossil fuels , we actually lower the co2 emissions in the product lifecycle by over 90 percent . " it is an enticing claim and one which industry leaders , particular from the german car industry , are eager to support .
they are already under pressure to reduce their emissions to abide by european union guidelines and merkel 's government is reported to be waging a rearguard campaign to delay implementation , reduce penalties and ease the burden on the country 's luxury automotive industry .
second-generation fuels could help the car industry meet climate-protection goals without it having to make too many sacrifices .
could work , maybe " synthetic fuels from biomass have the potential - and we 're still talking about potential - to become a central pillar in climate-friendly energy supply , " said angela merkel . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : biodiesel manufactuer choren but the word " potential " is key here , since second-generation biofuels are not yet proven , nor market ready .
according to the oecd , it remains to be seen whether these new fuels will become economically viable over the next decade , if ever .
they will need large-scale subsidies for the foreseeable future .
high costs are still a major factor .
there are logistical challenges of transporting biomass material to large production facilities , which could impose a floor on costs that would be difficult to lower .
and there is the land issue .
for large-scale production , there are fears that farmers would be tempted to turn fields over to tree plantations for second-generation biofuels instead of wheat or rice fields - a scenario which , again , could affect food availability .
dieter oelig of the environmental group nabu worries that there is too much focus on this new generation of fuel , and not enough on energy or automobile efficiency and other strategies that could be put in place now .
" maybe in 20 or 30 years or 40 years , we have a big potential -lrb- for second-generation biofuels -rrb- , if they work , " he said .

merkel calls on brazil to make biofuel production sustainable german minister calls for reversal of eu agricultural policy germany defends biofuels , hedges bets on energy goals illegal logging gives eu massive eco-headache environment -pipe- 29.04.2008 as biofuels fall from grace , a new generation grabs spotlight großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a second-generation biofuel production facility - the new climate savior ?
biofuels made from food crops were once seen as an environmental savior .
but not anymore .
now politicians and experts hope a new generation of green fuels will be a powerful weapon against climate change . there is an old saying : if it sounds too good to be true , it probably is .
when it comes to biofuels made from crops such as wheat , corn or rapeseed , many are saying that adage fits like a glove . biofuels were once seen as a near perfect tool to reduce emissions from cars and trucks .
while cars would still spew out greenhouse gases , if they ran on biofuel , at least the plants that made their fuel would have soaked up co2 while they were growing .
" in the beginning , it sounded very good , " said dietmar oeliger , a traffic policy expert at the german environmental group nabu .
" you did n't have to change your cars or your life system .
instead of using fossil fuels , you take something different and everything can stay the same . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : people worry that farmers are growing crops for fuel instead of food problem is , he added , it did n't work out the way it was planned .
despite huge government subsidies from eu countries to push biofuels - around 2.6 billion euros in tax subsidies in the eu in 2006 - their green credentials turned out to be questionable at best .
according to a report entitled " biofuels : is the cure worse than the disease ? " by the organization for economic cooperation and development -lrb- oecd -rrb- , conventional biofuel technology provides greenhouse gas reductions of less than 40 percent , which when other factors are taken into account , means that biofuels ' disadvantages can often outweigh the benefits .
" if you take the whole production process into account with some of them , the use of land , water , fertilizer , etc . , they do n't perform very well in mitigating co2 emissions , " said michael zirpel of the international transport forum , part of the oecd .
" some are even worse than fossil fuels . "
a serious rethink european countries are beginning to rethink their biofuels enthusiasm and are rolling back some of their generous subsidies .
the eu is also starting to reconsider its commitment to these so-called first-generation biofuels .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : pump with biodiesel from rapeseed recent reports have linked rising food prices and rainforest production to biofuels , as farmers grow crops for fuel instead for human consumption .
the un special rapporteur for the right to food jean ziegler even called large-scale production of biofuels " a crime against humanity . "
the eu 's once highly touted goal of having 10 percent of transportation powered by biofuels by 2020 is no longer set in stone , since brussels did not foresee the problems that could arise .
" biofuels were at the center of praise at the beginning , and now they 're in the center of criticism , " said barbara helfferich , spokeswoman for eu environment commissioner stavros dimas .
" now it 's not biofuels in and of themselves , it 's what kind of biofuels and how we produce them . "
hopes for the second-generation as politicians and policy makers begin toning down their tributes to first-generation biofuels , they 're not giving up on the concept altogether .
what did n't work the first time around , the thinking seems to be , might succeed on a second try .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : car manufacturers are especially eager to see second-generation biofuels a reality in a small town about a half-hour 's drive from dresden , some leading political and industry leaders gathered recently .
german chancellor angela merkel was there , along with daimler ceo dieter zetsche , volkswagen boss martin winterkorn and rob routs , a high-ranking executive at shell .
they 've gathered at what choren industries claims is the “ the world 's first commercial production plant to convert biomass into synthetic diesel fuel . ”
instead of using rapeseed , wheat or corn , chroen will use forest residue and waste wood to produce its sun diesel , which it claims is head and shoulders above anything on the market today .
" we would be triple a if judged by moody 's , " said tom blades , head of choren .
" compared to fossil fuels , we actually lower the co2 emissions in the product lifecycle by over 90 percent . " it is an enticing claim and one which industry leaders , particular from the german car industry , are eager to support .
they are already under pressure to reduce their emissions to abide by european union guidelines and merkel 's government is reported to be waging a rearguard campaign to delay implementation , reduce penalties and ease the burden on the country 's luxury automotive industry .
second-generation fuels could help the car industry meet climate-protection goals without it having to make too many sacrifices .
could work , maybe " synthetic fuels from biomass have the potential - and we 're still talking about potential - to become a central pillar in climate-friendly energy supply , " said angela merkel . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : biodiesel manufactuer choren but the word " potential " is key here , since second-generation biofuels are not yet proven , nor market ready .
according to the oecd , it remains to be seen whether these new fuels will become economically viable over the next decade , if ever .
they will need large-scale subsidies for the foreseeable future .
high costs are still a major factor .
there are logistical challenges of transporting biomass material to large production facilities , which could impose a floor on costs that would be difficult to lower .
and there is the land issue .
for large-scale production , there are fears that farmers would be tempted to turn fields over to tree plantations for second-generation biofuels instead of wheat or rice fields - a scenario which , again , could affect food availability .
dieter oelig of the environmental group nabu worries that there is too much focus on this new generation of fuel , and not enough on energy or automobile efficiency and other strategies that could be put in place now .
" maybe in 20 or 30 years or 40 years , we have a big potential -lrb- for second-generation biofuels -rrb- , if they work , " he said .
" but in 40 years , we need to have a lot of answers that are clear .

hopes for the second-generation as politicians and policy makers begin toning down their tributes to first-generation biofuels , they 're not giving up on the concept altogether .
what did n't work the first time around , the thinking seems to be , might succeed on a second try .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : car manufacturers are especially eager to see second-generation biofuels a reality in a small town about a half-hour 's drive from dresden , some leading political and industry leaders gathered recently .
german chancellor angela merkel was there , along with daimler ceo dieter zetsche , volkswagen boss martin winterkorn and rob routs , a high-ranking executive at shell .
they 've gathered at what choren industries claims is the “ the world 's first commercial production plant to convert biomass into synthetic diesel fuel . ”
instead of using rapeseed , wheat or corn , chroen will use forest residue and waste wood to produce its sun diesel , which it claims is head and shoulders above anything on the market today .
" we would be triple a if judged by moody 's , " said tom blades , head of choren .
" compared to fossil fuels , we actually lower the co2 emissions in the product lifecycle by over 90 percent . " it is an enticing claim and one which industry leaders , particular from the german car industry , are eager to support .
they are already under pressure to reduce their emissions to abide by european union guidelines and merkel 's government is reported to be waging a rearguard campaign to delay implementation , reduce penalties and ease the burden on the country 's luxury automotive industry .
second-generation fuels could help the car industry meet climate-protection goals without it having to make too many sacrifices .
could work , maybe " synthetic fuels from biomass have the potential - and we 're still talking about potential - to become a central pillar in climate-friendly energy supply , " said angela merkel . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : biodiesel manufactuer choren but the word " potential " is key here , since second-generation biofuels are not yet proven , nor market ready .
according to the oecd , it remains to be seen whether these new fuels will become economically viable over the next decade , if ever .
they will need large-scale subsidies for the foreseeable future .
high costs are still a major factor .
there are logistical challenges of transporting biomass material to large production facilities , which could impose a floor on costs that would be difficult to lower .
and there is the land issue .
for large-scale production , there are fears that farmers would be tempted to turn fields over to tree plantations for second-generation biofuels instead of wheat or rice fields - a scenario which , again , could affect food availability .
dieter oelig of the environmental group nabu worries that there is too much focus on this new generation of fuel , and not enough on energy or automobile efficiency and other strategies that could be put in place now .
" maybe in 20 or 30 years or 40 years , we have a big potential -lrb- for second-generation biofuels -rrb- , if they work , " he said .
" but in 40 years , we need to have a lot of answers that are clear .
otherwise , we 'll have a very big problem . " kyle james send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de in focus : biofuels : are they doing more harm than good ?
merkel calls on brazil to make biofuel production sustainable german minister calls for reversal of eu agricultural policy germany defends biofuels , hedges bets on energy goals illegal logging gives eu massive eco-headache environment -pipe- 29.04.2008 as biofuels fall from grace , a new generation grabs spotlight großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a second-generation biofuel production facility - the new climate savior ?
biofuels made from food crops were once seen as an environmental savior .
but not anymore .
now politicians and experts hope a new generation of green fuels will be a powerful weapon against climate change . there is an old saying : if it sounds too good to be true , it probably is .
when it comes to biofuels made from crops such as wheat , corn or rapeseed , many are saying that adage fits like a glove . biofuels were once seen as a near perfect tool to reduce emissions from cars and trucks .
while cars would still spew out greenhouse gases , if they ran on biofuel , at least the plants that made their fuel would have soaked up co2 while they were growing .
" in the beginning , it sounded very good , " said dietmar oeliger , a traffic policy expert at the german environmental group nabu .
" you did n't have to change your cars or your life system .
instead of using fossil fuels , you take something different and everything can stay the same . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : people worry that farmers are growing crops for fuel instead of food problem is , he added , it did n't work out the way it was planned .
despite huge government subsidies from eu countries to push biofuels - around 2.6 billion euros in tax subsidies in the eu in 2006 - their green credentials turned out to be questionable at best .
according to a report entitled " biofuels : is the cure worse than the disease ? " by the organization for economic cooperation and development -lrb- oecd -rrb- , conventional biofuel technology provides greenhouse gas reductions of less than 40 percent , which when other factors are taken into account , means that biofuels ' disadvantages can often outweigh the benefits .
" if you take the whole production process into account with some of them , the use of land , water , fertilizer , etc . , they do n't perform very well in mitigating co2 emissions , " said michael zirpel of the international transport forum , part of the oecd .
" some are even worse than fossil fuels . "
a serious rethink european countries are beginning to rethink their biofuels enthusiasm and are rolling back some of their generous subsidies .
the eu is also starting to reconsider its commitment to these so-called first-generation biofuels .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : pump with biodiesel from rapeseed recent reports have linked rising food prices and rainforest production to biofuels , as farmers grow crops for fuel instead for human consumption .
the un special rapporteur for the right to food jean ziegler even called large-scale production of biofuels " a crime against humanity . "
the eu 's once highly touted goal of having 10 percent of transportation powered by biofuels by 2020 is no longer set in stone , since brussels did not foresee the problems that could arise .
" biofuels were at the center of praise at the beginning , and now they 're in the center of criticism , " said barbara helfferich , spokeswoman for eu environment commissioner stavros dimas .
" now it 's not biofuels in and of themselves , it 's what kind of biofuels and how we produce them . "
hopes for the second-generation as politicians and policy makers begin toning down their tributes to first-generation biofuels , they 're not giving up on the concept altogether .
what did n't work the first time around , the thinking seems to be , might succeed on a second try .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : car manufacturers are especially eager to see second-generation biofuels a reality in a small town about a half-hour 's drive from dresden , some leading political and industry leaders gathered recently .
german chancellor angela merkel was there , along with daimler ceo dieter zetsche , volkswagen boss martin winterkorn and rob routs , a high-ranking executive at shell .
they 've gathered at what choren industries claims is the “ the world 's first commercial production plant to convert biomass into synthetic diesel fuel . ”
instead of using rapeseed , wheat or corn , chroen will use forest residue and waste wood to produce its sun diesel , which it claims is head and shoulders above anything on the market today .
" we would be triple a if judged by moody 's , " said tom blades , head of choren .
" compared to fossil fuels , we actually lower the co2 emissions in the product lifecycle by over 90 percent . " it is an enticing claim and one which industry leaders , particular from the german car industry , are eager to support .

merkel calls on brazil to make biofuel production sustainable german minister calls for reversal of eu agricultural policy germany defends biofuels , hedges bets on energy goals illegal logging gives eu massive eco-headache environment -pipe- 29.04.2008 as biofuels fall from grace , a new generation grabs spotlight großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a second-generation biofuel production facility - the new climate savior ?
biofuels made from food crops were once seen as an environmental savior .
but not anymore .
now politicians and experts hope a new generation of green fuels will be a powerful weapon against climate change . there is an old saying : if it sounds too good to be true , it probably is .
when it comes to biofuels made from crops such as wheat , corn or rapeseed , many are saying that adage fits like a glove . biofuels were once seen as a near perfect tool to reduce emissions from cars and trucks .
while cars would still spew out greenhouse gases , if they ran on biofuel , at least the plants that made their fuel would have soaked up co2 while they were growing .
" in the beginning , it sounded very good , " said dietmar oeliger , a traffic policy expert at the german environmental group nabu .
" you did n't have to change your cars or your life system .
instead of using fossil fuels , you take something different and everything can stay the same . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : people worry that farmers are growing crops for fuel instead of food problem is , he added , it did n't work out the way it was planned .
despite huge government subsidies from eu countries to push biofuels - around 2.6 billion euros in tax subsidies in the eu in 2006 - their green credentials turned out to be questionable at best .
according to a report entitled " biofuels : is the cure worse than the disease ? " by the organization for economic cooperation and development -lrb- oecd -rrb- , conventional biofuel technology provides greenhouse gas reductions of less than 40 percent , which when other factors are taken into account , means that biofuels ' disadvantages can often outweigh the benefits .
" if you take the whole production process into account with some of them , the use of land , water , fertilizer , etc . , they do n't perform very well in mitigating co2 emissions , " said michael zirpel of the international transport forum , part of the oecd .
" some are even worse than fossil fuels . "
a serious rethink european countries are beginning to rethink their biofuels enthusiasm and are rolling back some of their generous subsidies .
the eu is also starting to reconsider its commitment to these so-called first-generation biofuels .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : pump with biodiesel from rapeseed recent reports have linked rising food prices and rainforest production to biofuels , as farmers grow crops for fuel instead for human consumption .
the un special rapporteur for the right to food jean ziegler even called large-scale production of biofuels " a crime against humanity . "
the eu 's once highly touted goal of having 10 percent of transportation powered by biofuels by 2020 is no longer set in stone , since brussels did not foresee the problems that could arise .
" biofuels were at the center of praise at the beginning , and now they 're in the center of criticism , " said barbara helfferich , spokeswoman for eu environment commissioner stavros dimas .
" now it 's not biofuels in and of themselves , it 's what kind of biofuels and how we produce them . "
hopes for the second-generation as politicians and policy makers begin toning down their tributes to first-generation biofuels , they 're not giving up on the concept altogether .
what did n't work the first time around , the thinking seems to be , might succeed on a second try .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : car manufacturers are especially eager to see second-generation biofuels a reality in a small town about a half-hour 's drive from dresden , some leading political and industry leaders gathered recently .
german chancellor angela merkel was there , along with daimler ceo dieter zetsche , volkswagen boss martin winterkorn and rob routs , a high-ranking executive at shell .
they 've gathered at what choren industries claims is the “ the world 's first commercial production plant to convert biomass into synthetic diesel fuel . ”
instead of using rapeseed , wheat or corn , chroen will use forest residue and waste wood to produce its sun diesel , which it claims is head and shoulders above anything on the market today .
" we would be triple a if judged by moody 's , " said tom blades , head of choren .
" compared to fossil fuels , we actually lower the co2 emissions in the product lifecycle by over 90 percent . " it is an enticing claim and one which industry leaders , particular from the german car industry , are eager to support .
they are already under pressure to reduce their emissions to abide by european union guidelines and merkel 's government is reported to be waging a rearguard campaign to delay implementation , reduce penalties and ease the burden on the country 's luxury automotive industry .
second-generation fuels could help the car industry meet climate-protection goals without it having to make too many sacrifices .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de bundesliga -pipe- 29.04.2008 bayern 's extravagant spending reaps its reward großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ribery and toni have silenced those who believed their transfer fees were exhorbitant anyone who says money ca n't buy happiness should take a look at the ecstatic faces of bayern munich 's supporters in the coming weeks before making a thorough reappraisal of that statement . when the bavarian giants shelled out 70 million euros -lrb- $ 109.4 million -rrb- for french midfielder franck ribery and italian striker luca toni , plus german international striker miroslav klose , in the summer , everyone who was n't a munich fan turned their noses up at the ostentatious frivolity of it all .
here was the richest club in german soccer splashing the cash in a bid to regain control of a league they usually dominated but had recently lost their power over .
rivals scoffed at the gifts the bayern hierarchy had lavished on themselves .
despite accomplished performances for marseille and the french national team , ribery was seen as not much more than a player trading on the promise of greatness unfulfilled .
toni , while a world cup winner with italy and a prolific club marksman , had made his impact in mid-table serie a sides .
but he had been overlooked by the likes of domestic powerhouses like the milan clubs and juventus , when it came to snapping up a reliable scorer .
if anything , the transfer of klose , somewhat overshadowed by munich 's expensive european shopping spree , was seen as the most serious statement of intent for the season ahead .
and yet , looking back over a season which has seen bayern reemerge as the bundesliga 's top dog , klose has joined lukas podolski as one of the club 's more disappointing acquisitions .
franck and luca justify the summer spending bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : toni and ribery embodied bayern 's intent to conquer so , far from being a vulgar display of extravagance with little business acumen behind it , the purchase of ribery and toni in particular has proved to be the coup of the season , as the italian 's 35 goals in 41 games has shown alongside the frenchman 's utter dominance and guile .
the french midfielder only underlined his role as the top attraction of the bundesliga last sunday , when he came off the bench to score twice in a 4-1 demolition of vfb stuttgart with which munich effectively clinched another league title .
italian team-mate toni may almost be more valuable for munich with his 21 goals in the league , but it is ribery who has electrified the fans with a skill not seen in the german top flight for years .
" there was something like a circus atmosphere when ribery came on , " said munich chairman karl-heinz rummenigge .
" the fans really get a treat here . "
the frenchman , the most expensive player in munich history at 25 million euros , has been an instant hit and has even managed to get opposing fans on their feet - something rarely achieved as munich are either loved or hated .
ribery adds french flair to german efficiency bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ribery has brought excitement to bayern munich and while the summer spending was intended to bring the title back to the allianz arena , it was also money spent in a bid to bring entertainment to the fans .
for all bayern 's success , they have rarely been the most exciting and aesthetic of teams , preferring to grind opponents into defeat with a ruthless efficiency rather than to play their opposition off the park .
for all the excitement ribery brings to the team , it would all be for nothing if there was n't a striker at the end of the beautiful moves to put the ball in the net and luca toni has proved to be that man .
lauded by none other than bayern striking legend gerd mueller , who believes toni is the player to beat his long-standing 40-goals-in-a-season record , the italian is seen by many in munich as the type of target man the club has been missing for years .
the former fiorentina forward has fired bayern to the cusp of a 21st title , combined with the livewire ribery to win the dfb cup for munich , and has scored 10 goals so far in a uefa cup campaign , which has seen the german side reach the semi-finals .
after a journeyman career which has taken him through ten teams , toni now looks at home .
munich lucky to have luca bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the italian job : toni has had a smash-and-grab season " he 's a world-class striker .
he 's got an amazing instinct for goals , " said bayern coach ottmar hitzfeld , barely containing his enthusiasm for toni .
" he always believes he can score two or three goals in each match .
he 's never satisfied and always hungry for more goals .
he 's a real winner , a leader on our team . "
however , the combination of the frenchman and the italian , the plaudits that follow them and the silverware they look destined to win together , disguise the fact that munich 's german stars have failed to set the league alight this season .
klose has been dogged by injury as the season entered its critical phase .
even when he played , he failed to maintain the form he displayed in the campaign 's opening salvos after moving from werder bremen in the summer .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : podolski and klose enjoy a happier moment together podolski has proved to be an asset from the bench , scoring important goals in substitute cameos , but has also failed to establish himself as a first team regular since his arrival from cologne in 2006 .
he remains behind toni and klose in the battle to start up front for bayern despite maintaining his clinical streak for the national team .
another german acquisition , jan schlaudraff , failed to even make it to the end of the season before being offloaded .
schlaudraff , who moved to bayern from alemannia aachen last summer for 1.2 million euros , completed a move to fellow bundesliga club hanover in april after a frustrating campaign in the lower reaches of the club 's pecking order .
the disappointment of their german stars and the 70-odd million euros they handed out almost a year ago will all be forgotten by the fans and the management alike , if bayern munich can complete their resurrection with a league , cup and european treble .

here was the richest club in german soccer splashing the cash in a bid to regain control of a league they usually dominated but had recently lost their power over .
rivals scoffed at the gifts the bayern hierarchy had lavished on themselves .
despite accomplished performances for marseille and the french national team , ribery was seen as not much more than a player trading on the promise of greatness unfulfilled .
toni , while a world cup winner with italy and a prolific club marksman , had made his impact in mid-table serie a sides .
but he had been overlooked by the likes of domestic powerhouses like the milan clubs and juventus , when it came to snapping up a reliable scorer .
if anything , the transfer of klose , somewhat overshadowed by munich 's expensive european shopping spree , was seen as the most serious statement of intent for the season ahead .
and yet , looking back over a season which has seen bayern reemerge as the bundesliga 's top dog , klose has joined lukas podolski as one of the club 's more disappointing acquisitions .
franck and luca justify the summer spending bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : toni and ribery embodied bayern 's intent to conquer so , far from being a vulgar display of extravagance with little business acumen behind it , the purchase of ribery and toni in particular has proved to be the coup of the season , as the italian 's 35 goals in 41 games has shown alongside the frenchman 's utter dominance and guile .
the french midfielder only underlined his role as the top attraction of the bundesliga last sunday , when he came off the bench to score twice in a 4-1 demolition of vfb stuttgart with which munich effectively clinched another league title .
italian team-mate toni may almost be more valuable for munich with his 21 goals in the league , but it is ribery who has electrified the fans with a skill not seen in the german top flight for years .
" there was something like a circus atmosphere when ribery came on , " said munich chairman karl-heinz rummenigge .
" the fans really get a treat here . "
the frenchman , the most expensive player in munich history at 25 million euros , has been an instant hit and has even managed to get opposing fans on their feet - something rarely achieved as munich are either loved or hated .
ribery adds french flair to german efficiency bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ribery has brought excitement to bayern munich and while the summer spending was intended to bring the title back to the allianz arena , it was also money spent in a bid to bring entertainment to the fans .
for all bayern 's success , they have rarely been the most exciting and aesthetic of teams , preferring to grind opponents into defeat with a ruthless efficiency rather than to play their opposition off the park .
for all the excitement ribery brings to the team , it would all be for nothing if there was n't a striker at the end of the beautiful moves to put the ball in the net and luca toni has proved to be that man .
lauded by none other than bayern striking legend gerd mueller , who believes toni is the player to beat his long-standing 40-goals-in-a-season record , the italian is seen by many in munich as the type of target man the club has been missing for years .
the former fiorentina forward has fired bayern to the cusp of a 21st title , combined with the livewire ribery to win the dfb cup for munich , and has scored 10 goals so far in a uefa cup campaign , which has seen the german side reach the semi-finals .
after a journeyman career which has taken him through ten teams , toni now looks at home .
munich lucky to have luca bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the italian job : toni has had a smash-and-grab season " he 's a world-class striker .
he 's got an amazing instinct for goals , " said bayern coach ottmar hitzfeld , barely containing his enthusiasm for toni .
" he always believes he can score two or three goals in each match .
he 's never satisfied and always hungry for more goals .
he 's a real winner , a leader on our team . "
however , the combination of the frenchman and the italian , the plaudits that follow them and the silverware they look destined to win together , disguise the fact that munich 's german stars have failed to set the league alight this season .
klose has been dogged by injury as the season entered its critical phase .
even when he played , he failed to maintain the form he displayed in the campaign 's opening salvos after moving from werder bremen in the summer .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : podolski and klose enjoy a happier moment together podolski has proved to be an asset from the bench , scoring important goals in substitute cameos , but has also failed to establish himself as a first team regular since his arrival from cologne in 2006 .
he remains behind toni and klose in the battle to start up front for bayern despite maintaining his clinical streak for the national team .

here was the richest club in german soccer splashing the cash in a bid to regain control of a league they usually dominated but had recently lost their power over .
rivals scoffed at the gifts the bayern hierarchy had lavished on themselves .
despite accomplished performances for marseille and the french national team , ribery was seen as not much more than a player trading on the promise of greatness unfulfilled .
toni , while a world cup winner with italy and a prolific club marksman , had made his impact in mid-table serie a sides .
but he had been overlooked by the likes of domestic powerhouses like the milan clubs and juventus , when it came to snapping up a reliable scorer .
if anything , the transfer of klose , somewhat overshadowed by munich 's expensive european shopping spree , was seen as the most serious statement of intent for the season ahead .
and yet , looking back over a season which has seen bayern reemerge as the bundesliga 's top dog , klose has joined lukas podolski as one of the club 's more disappointing acquisitions .
franck and luca justify the summer spending bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : toni and ribery embodied bayern 's intent to conquer so , far from being a vulgar display of extravagance with little business acumen behind it , the purchase of ribery and toni in particular has proved to be the coup of the season , as the italian 's 35 goals in 41 games has shown alongside the frenchman 's utter dominance and guile .
the french midfielder only underlined his role as the top attraction of the bundesliga last sunday , when he came off the bench to score twice in a 4-1 demolition of vfb stuttgart with which munich effectively clinched another league title .
italian team-mate toni may almost be more valuable for munich with his 21 goals in the league , but it is ribery who has electrified the fans with a skill not seen in the german top flight for years .
" there was something like a circus atmosphere when ribery came on , " said munich chairman karl-heinz rummenigge .
" the fans really get a treat here . "
the frenchman , the most expensive player in munich history at 25 million euros , has been an instant hit and has even managed to get opposing fans on their feet - something rarely achieved as munich are either loved or hated .
ribery adds french flair to german efficiency bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ribery has brought excitement to bayern munich and while the summer spending was intended to bring the title back to the allianz arena , it was also money spent in a bid to bring entertainment to the fans .
for all bayern 's success , they have rarely been the most exciting and aesthetic of teams , preferring to grind opponents into defeat with a ruthless efficiency rather than to play their opposition off the park .
for all the excitement ribery brings to the team , it would all be for nothing if there was n't a striker at the end of the beautiful moves to put the ball in the net and luca toni has proved to be that man .
lauded by none other than bayern striking legend gerd mueller , who believes toni is the player to beat his long-standing 40-goals-in-a-season record , the italian is seen by many in munich as the type of target man the club has been missing for years .
the former fiorentina forward has fired bayern to the cusp of a 21st title , combined with the livewire ribery to win the dfb cup for munich , and has scored 10 goals so far in a uefa cup campaign , which has seen the german side reach the semi-finals .
after a journeyman career which has taken him through ten teams , toni now looks at home .
munich lucky to have luca bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the italian job : toni has had a smash-and-grab season " he 's a world-class striker .
he 's got an amazing instinct for goals , " said bayern coach ottmar hitzfeld , barely containing his enthusiasm for toni .
" he always believes he can score two or three goals in each match .
he 's never satisfied and always hungry for more goals .
he 's a real winner , a leader on our team . "
however , the combination of the frenchman and the italian , the plaudits that follow them and the silverware they look destined to win together , disguise the fact that munich 's german stars have failed to set the league alight this season .
klose has been dogged by injury as the season entered its critical phase .
even when he played , he failed to maintain the form he displayed in the campaign 's opening salvos after moving from werder bremen in the summer .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : podolski and klose enjoy a happier moment together podolski has proved to be an asset from the bench , scoring important goals in substitute cameos , but has also failed to establish himself as a first team regular since his arrival from cologne in 2006 .
he remains behind toni and klose in the battle to start up front for bayern despite maintaining his clinical streak for the national team .
another german acquisition , jan schlaudraff , failed to even make it to the end of the season before being offloaded .
schlaudraff , who moved to bayern from alemannia aachen last summer for 1.2 million euros , completed a move to fellow bundesliga club hanover in april after a frustrating campaign in the lower reaches of the club 's pecking order .
the disappointment of their german stars and the 70-odd million euros they handed out almost a year ago will all be forgotten by the fans and the management alike , if bayern munich can complete their resurrection with a league , cup and european treble .
ribery and toni will then look like the bargains of the season . nick amies send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?
dw-world.de breitner : bayern will become one of world 's top three teams former german national team player and world cup winner paul breitner , now a consultant for bayern munich , told dw-world.de about the future prospects of the team that has won more titles than any other in germany .

merkel calls on brazil to make biofuel production sustainable german minister calls for reversal of eu agricultural policy germany defends biofuels , hedges bets on energy goals illegal logging gives eu massive eco-headache environment -pipe- 29.04.2008 as biofuels fall from grace , a new generation grabs spotlight großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a second-generation biofuel production facility - the new climate savior ?
biofuels made from food crops were once seen as an environmental savior .
but not anymore .
now politicians and experts hope a new generation of green fuels will be a powerful weapon against climate change . there is an old saying : if it sounds too good to be true , it probably is .
when it comes to biofuels made from crops such as wheat , corn or rapeseed , many are saying that adage fits like a glove . biofuels were once seen as a near perfect tool to reduce emissions from cars and trucks .
while cars would still spew out greenhouse gases , if they ran on biofuel , at least the plants that made their fuel would have soaked up co2 while they were growing .
" in the beginning , it sounded very good , " said dietmar oeliger , a traffic policy expert at the german environmental group nabu .
" you did n't have to change your cars or your life system .
instead of using fossil fuels , you take something different and everything can stay the same . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : people worry that farmers are growing crops for fuel instead of food problem is , he added , it did n't work out the way it was planned .
despite huge government subsidies from eu countries to push biofuels - around 2.6 billion euros in tax subsidies in the eu in 2006 - their green credentials turned out to be questionable at best .
according to a report entitled " biofuels : is the cure worse than the disease ? " by the organization for economic cooperation and development -lrb- oecd -rrb- , conventional biofuel technology provides greenhouse gas reductions of less than 40 percent , which when other factors are taken into account , means that biofuels ' disadvantages can often outweigh the benefits .
" if you take the whole production process into account with some of them , the use of land , water , fertilizer , etc . , they do n't perform very well in mitigating co2 emissions , " said michael zirpel of the international transport forum , part of the oecd .
" some are even worse than fossil fuels . "
a serious rethink european countries are beginning to rethink their biofuels enthusiasm and are rolling back some of their generous subsidies .
the eu is also starting to reconsider its commitment to these so-called first-generation biofuels .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : pump with biodiesel from rapeseed recent reports have linked rising food prices and rainforest production to biofuels , as farmers grow crops for fuel instead for human consumption .
the un special rapporteur for the right to food jean ziegler even called large-scale production of biofuels " a crime against humanity . "
the eu 's once highly touted goal of having 10 percent of transportation powered by biofuels by 2020 is no longer set in stone , since brussels did not foresee the problems that could arise .
" biofuels were at the center of praise at the beginning , and now they 're in the center of criticism , " said barbara helfferich , spokeswoman for eu environment commissioner stavros dimas .
" now it 's not biofuels in and of themselves , it 's what kind of biofuels and how we produce them . "
hopes for the second-generation as politicians and policy makers begin toning down their tributes to first-generation biofuels , they 're not giving up on the concept altogether .
what did n't work the first time around , the thinking seems to be , might succeed on a second try .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : car manufacturers are especially eager to see second-generation biofuels a reality in a small town about a half-hour 's drive from dresden , some leading political and industry leaders gathered recently .
german chancellor angela merkel was there , along with daimler ceo dieter zetsche , volkswagen boss martin winterkorn and rob routs , a high-ranking executive at shell .
they 've gathered at what choren industries claims is the “ the world 's first commercial production plant to convert biomass into synthetic diesel fuel . ”
instead of using rapeseed , wheat or corn , chroen will use forest residue and waste wood to produce its sun diesel , which it claims is head and shoulders above anything on the market today .
" we would be triple a if judged by moody 's , " said tom blades , head of choren .
" compared to fossil fuels , we actually lower the co2 emissions in the product lifecycle by over 90 percent . " it is an enticing claim and one which industry leaders , particular from the german car industry , are eager to support .
they are already under pressure to reduce their emissions to abide by european union guidelines and merkel 's government is reported to be waging a rearguard campaign to delay implementation , reduce penalties and ease the burden on the country 's luxury automotive industry .
second-generation fuels could help the car industry meet climate-protection goals without it having to make too many sacrifices .
could work , maybe " synthetic fuels from biomass have the potential - and we 're still talking about potential - to become a central pillar in climate-friendly energy supply , " said angela merkel . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : biodiesel manufactuer choren but the word " potential " is key here , since second-generation biofuels are not yet proven , nor market ready .
according to the oecd , it remains to be seen whether these new fuels will become economically viable over the next decade , if ever .
they will need large-scale subsidies for the foreseeable future .
high costs are still a major factor .
there are logistical challenges of transporting biomass material to large production facilities , which could impose a floor on costs that would be difficult to lower .
and there is the land issue .
for large-scale production , there are fears that farmers would be tempted to turn fields over to tree plantations for second-generation biofuels instead of wheat or rice fields - a scenario which , again , could affect food availability .
dieter oelig of the environmental group nabu worries that there is too much focus on this new generation of fuel , and not enough on energy or automobile efficiency and other strategies that could be put in place now .
" maybe in 20 or 30 years or 40 years , we have a big potential -lrb- for second-generation biofuels -rrb- , if they work , " he said .

merkel calls on brazil to make biofuel production sustainable german minister calls for reversal of eu agricultural policy germany defends biofuels , hedges bets on energy goals illegal logging gives eu massive eco-headache environment -pipe- 29.04.2008 as biofuels fall from grace , a new generation grabs spotlight großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a second-generation biofuel production facility - the new climate savior ?
biofuels made from food crops were once seen as an environmental savior .
but not anymore .
now politicians and experts hope a new generation of green fuels will be a powerful weapon against climate change . there is an old saying : if it sounds too good to be true , it probably is .
when it comes to biofuels made from crops such as wheat , corn or rapeseed , many are saying that adage fits like a glove . biofuels were once seen as a near perfect tool to reduce emissions from cars and trucks .
while cars would still spew out greenhouse gases , if they ran on biofuel , at least the plants that made their fuel would have soaked up co2 while they were growing .
" in the beginning , it sounded very good , " said dietmar oeliger , a traffic policy expert at the german environmental group nabu .
" you did n't have to change your cars or your life system .
instead of using fossil fuels , you take something different and everything can stay the same . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : people worry that farmers are growing crops for fuel instead of food problem is , he added , it did n't work out the way it was planned .
despite huge government subsidies from eu countries to push biofuels - around 2.6 billion euros in tax subsidies in the eu in 2006 - their green credentials turned out to be questionable at best .
according to a report entitled " biofuels : is the cure worse than the disease ? " by the organization for economic cooperation and development -lrb- oecd -rrb- , conventional biofuel technology provides greenhouse gas reductions of less than 40 percent , which when other factors are taken into account , means that biofuels ' disadvantages can often outweigh the benefits .
" if you take the whole production process into account with some of them , the use of land , water , fertilizer , etc . , they do n't perform very well in mitigating co2 emissions , " said michael zirpel of the international transport forum , part of the oecd .
" some are even worse than fossil fuels . "
a serious rethink european countries are beginning to rethink their biofuels enthusiasm and are rolling back some of their generous subsidies .
the eu is also starting to reconsider its commitment to these so-called first-generation biofuels .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : pump with biodiesel from rapeseed recent reports have linked rising food prices and rainforest production to biofuels , as farmers grow crops for fuel instead for human consumption .
the un special rapporteur for the right to food jean ziegler even called large-scale production of biofuels " a crime against humanity . "
the eu 's once highly touted goal of having 10 percent of transportation powered by biofuels by 2020 is no longer set in stone , since brussels did not foresee the problems that could arise .
" biofuels were at the center of praise at the beginning , and now they 're in the center of criticism , " said barbara helfferich , spokeswoman for eu environment commissioner stavros dimas .
" now it 's not biofuels in and of themselves , it 's what kind of biofuels and how we produce them . "
hopes for the second-generation as politicians and policy makers begin toning down their tributes to first-generation biofuels , they 're not giving up on the concept altogether .
what did n't work the first time around , the thinking seems to be , might succeed on a second try .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : car manufacturers are especially eager to see second-generation biofuels a reality in a small town about a half-hour 's drive from dresden , some leading political and industry leaders gathered recently .
german chancellor angela merkel was there , along with daimler ceo dieter zetsche , volkswagen boss martin winterkorn and rob routs , a high-ranking executive at shell .
they 've gathered at what choren industries claims is the “ the world 's first commercial production plant to convert biomass into synthetic diesel fuel . ”
instead of using rapeseed , wheat or corn , chroen will use forest residue and waste wood to produce its sun diesel , which it claims is head and shoulders above anything on the market today .
" we would be triple a if judged by moody 's , " said tom blades , head of choren .
" compared to fossil fuels , we actually lower the co2 emissions in the product lifecycle by over 90 percent . " it is an enticing claim and one which industry leaders , particular from the german car industry , are eager to support .
they are already under pressure to reduce their emissions to abide by european union guidelines and merkel 's government is reported to be waging a rearguard campaign to delay implementation , reduce penalties and ease the burden on the country 's luxury automotive industry .
second-generation fuels could help the car industry meet climate-protection goals without it having to make too many sacrifices .
could work , maybe " synthetic fuels from biomass have the potential - and we 're still talking about potential - to become a central pillar in climate-friendly energy supply , " said angela merkel . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : biodiesel manufactuer choren but the word " potential " is key here , since second-generation biofuels are not yet proven , nor market ready .
according to the oecd , it remains to be seen whether these new fuels will become economically viable over the next decade , if ever .
they will need large-scale subsidies for the foreseeable future .
high costs are still a major factor .
there are logistical challenges of transporting biomass material to large production facilities , which could impose a floor on costs that would be difficult to lower .
and there is the land issue .
for large-scale production , there are fears that farmers would be tempted to turn fields over to tree plantations for second-generation biofuels instead of wheat or rice fields - a scenario which , again , could affect food availability .
dieter oelig of the environmental group nabu worries that there is too much focus on this new generation of fuel , and not enough on energy or automobile efficiency and other strategies that could be put in place now .
" maybe in 20 or 30 years or 40 years , we have a big potential -lrb- for second-generation biofuels -rrb- , if they work , " he said .
" but in 40 years , we need to have a lot of answers that are clear .

merkel calls on brazil to make biofuel production sustainable german minister calls for reversal of eu agricultural policy germany defends biofuels , hedges bets on energy goals illegal logging gives eu massive eco-headache environment -pipe- 29.04.2008 as biofuels fall from grace , a new generation grabs spotlight großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a second-generation biofuel production facility - the new climate savior ?
biofuels made from food crops were once seen as an environmental savior .
but not anymore .
now politicians and experts hope a new generation of green fuels will be a powerful weapon against climate change . there is an old saying : if it sounds too good to be true , it probably is .
when it comes to biofuels made from crops such as wheat , corn or rapeseed , many are saying that adage fits like a glove . biofuels were once seen as a near perfect tool to reduce emissions from cars and trucks .
while cars would still spew out greenhouse gases , if they ran on biofuel , at least the plants that made their fuel would have soaked up co2 while they were growing .
" in the beginning , it sounded very good , " said dietmar oeliger , a traffic policy expert at the german environmental group nabu .
" you did n't have to change your cars or your life system .
instead of using fossil fuels , you take something different and everything can stay the same . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : people worry that farmers are growing crops for fuel instead of food problem is , he added , it did n't work out the way it was planned .
despite huge government subsidies from eu countries to push biofuels - around 2.6 billion euros in tax subsidies in the eu in 2006 - their green credentials turned out to be questionable at best .
according to a report entitled " biofuels : is the cure worse than the disease ? " by the organization for economic cooperation and development -lrb- oecd -rrb- , conventional biofuel technology provides greenhouse gas reductions of less than 40 percent , which when other factors are taken into account , means that biofuels ' disadvantages can often outweigh the benefits .
" if you take the whole production process into account with some of them , the use of land , water , fertilizer , etc . , they do n't perform very well in mitigating co2 emissions , " said michael zirpel of the international transport forum , part of the oecd .
" some are even worse than fossil fuels . "
a serious rethink european countries are beginning to rethink their biofuels enthusiasm and are rolling back some of their generous subsidies .
the eu is also starting to reconsider its commitment to these so-called first-generation biofuels .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : pump with biodiesel from rapeseed recent reports have linked rising food prices and rainforest production to biofuels , as farmers grow crops for fuel instead for human consumption .
the un special rapporteur for the right to food jean ziegler even called large-scale production of biofuels " a crime against humanity . "
the eu 's once highly touted goal of having 10 percent of transportation powered by biofuels by 2020 is no longer set in stone , since brussels did not foresee the problems that could arise .
" biofuels were at the center of praise at the beginning , and now they 're in the center of criticism , " said barbara helfferich , spokeswoman for eu environment commissioner stavros dimas .
" now it 's not biofuels in and of themselves , it 's what kind of biofuels and how we produce them . "
hopes for the second-generation as politicians and policy makers begin toning down their tributes to first-generation biofuels , they 're not giving up on the concept altogether .
what did n't work the first time around , the thinking seems to be , might succeed on a second try .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : car manufacturers are especially eager to see second-generation biofuels a reality in a small town about a half-hour 's drive from dresden , some leading political and industry leaders gathered recently .
german chancellor angela merkel was there , along with daimler ceo dieter zetsche , volkswagen boss martin winterkorn and rob routs , a high-ranking executive at shell .
they 've gathered at what choren industries claims is the “ the world 's first commercial production plant to convert biomass into synthetic diesel fuel . ”
instead of using rapeseed , wheat or corn , chroen will use forest residue and waste wood to produce its sun diesel , which it claims is head and shoulders above anything on the market today .
" we would be triple a if judged by moody 's , " said tom blades , head of choren .
" compared to fossil fuels , we actually lower the co2 emissions in the product lifecycle by over 90 percent . " it is an enticing claim and one which industry leaders , particular from the german car industry , are eager to support .
they are already under pressure to reduce their emissions to abide by european union guidelines and merkel 's government is reported to be waging a rearguard campaign to delay implementation , reduce penalties and ease the burden on the country 's luxury automotive industry .
second-generation fuels could help the car industry meet climate-protection goals without it having to make too many sacrifices .
could work , maybe " synthetic fuels from biomass have the potential - and we 're still talking about potential - to become a central pillar in climate-friendly energy supply , " said angela merkel . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : biodiesel manufactuer choren but the word " potential " is key here , since second-generation biofuels are not yet proven , nor market ready .
according to the oecd , it remains to be seen whether these new fuels will become economically viable over the next decade , if ever .
they will need large-scale subsidies for the foreseeable future .
high costs are still a major factor .
there are logistical challenges of transporting biomass material to large production facilities , which could impose a floor on costs that would be difficult to lower .
and there is the land issue .
for large-scale production , there are fears that farmers would be tempted to turn fields over to tree plantations for second-generation biofuels instead of wheat or rice fields - a scenario which , again , could affect food availability .
dieter oelig of the environmental group nabu worries that there is too much focus on this new generation of fuel , and not enough on energy or automobile efficiency and other strategies that could be put in place now .
" maybe in 20 or 30 years or 40 years , we have a big potential -lrb- for second-generation biofuels -rrb- , if they work , " he said .
" but in 40 years , we need to have a lot of answers that are clear .
otherwise , we 'll have a very big problem . " kyle james send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

merkel calls on brazil to make biofuel production sustainable german minister calls for reversal of eu agricultural policy germany defends biofuels , hedges bets on energy goals illegal logging gives eu massive eco-headache environment -pipe- 29.04.2008 as biofuels fall from grace , a new generation grabs spotlight großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a second-generation biofuel production facility - the new climate savior ?
biofuels made from food crops were once seen as an environmental savior .
but not anymore .
now politicians and experts hope a new generation of green fuels will be a powerful weapon against climate change . there is an old saying : if it sounds too good to be true , it probably is .
when it comes to biofuels made from crops such as wheat , corn or rapeseed , many are saying that adage fits like a glove . biofuels were once seen as a near perfect tool to reduce emissions from cars and trucks .
while cars would still spew out greenhouse gases , if they ran on biofuel , at least the plants that made their fuel would have soaked up co2 while they were growing .
" in the beginning , it sounded very good , " said dietmar oeliger , a traffic policy expert at the german environmental group nabu .
" you did n't have to change your cars or your life system .
instead of using fossil fuels , you take something different and everything can stay the same . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : people worry that farmers are growing crops for fuel instead of food problem is , he added , it did n't work out the way it was planned .
despite huge government subsidies from eu countries to push biofuels - around 2.6 billion euros in tax subsidies in the eu in 2006 - their green credentials turned out to be questionable at best .
according to a report entitled " biofuels : is the cure worse than the disease ? " by the organization for economic cooperation and development -lrb- oecd -rrb- , conventional biofuel technology provides greenhouse gas reductions of less than 40 percent , which when other factors are taken into account , means that biofuels ' disadvantages can often outweigh the benefits .
" if you take the whole production process into account with some of them , the use of land , water , fertilizer , etc . , they do n't perform very well in mitigating co2 emissions , " said michael zirpel of the international transport forum , part of the oecd .
" some are even worse than fossil fuels . "
a serious rethink european countries are beginning to rethink their biofuels enthusiasm and are rolling back some of their generous subsidies .
the eu is also starting to reconsider its commitment to these so-called first-generation biofuels .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : pump with biodiesel from rapeseed recent reports have linked rising food prices and rainforest production to biofuels , as farmers grow crops for fuel instead for human consumption .
the un special rapporteur for the right to food jean ziegler even called large-scale production of biofuels " a crime against humanity . "
the eu 's once highly touted goal of having 10 percent of transportation powered by biofuels by 2020 is no longer set in stone , since brussels did not foresee the problems that could arise .
" biofuels were at the center of praise at the beginning , and now they 're in the center of criticism , " said barbara helfferich , spokeswoman for eu environment commissioner stavros dimas .
" now it 's not biofuels in and of themselves , it 's what kind of biofuels and how we produce them . "
hopes for the second-generation as politicians and policy makers begin toning down their tributes to first-generation biofuels , they 're not giving up on the concept altogether .
what did n't work the first time around , the thinking seems to be , might succeed on a second try .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : car manufacturers are especially eager to see second-generation biofuels a reality in a small town about a half-hour 's drive from dresden , some leading political and industry leaders gathered recently .
german chancellor angela merkel was there , along with daimler ceo dieter zetsche , volkswagen boss martin winterkorn and rob routs , a high-ranking executive at shell .
they 've gathered at what choren industries claims is the “ the world 's first commercial production plant to convert biomass into synthetic diesel fuel . ”
instead of using rapeseed , wheat or corn , chroen will use forest residue and waste wood to produce its sun diesel , which it claims is head and shoulders above anything on the market today .
" we would be triple a if judged by moody 's , " said tom blades , head of choren .
" compared to fossil fuels , we actually lower the co2 emissions in the product lifecycle by over 90 percent . " it is an enticing claim and one which industry leaders , particular from the german car industry , are eager to support .
they are already under pressure to reduce their emissions to abide by european union guidelines and merkel 's government is reported to be waging a rearguard campaign to delay implementation , reduce penalties and ease the burden on the country 's luxury automotive industry .
second-generation fuels could help the car industry meet climate-protection goals without it having to make too many sacrifices .
could work , maybe " synthetic fuels from biomass have the potential - and we 're still talking about potential - to become a central pillar in climate-friendly energy supply , " said angela merkel . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : biodiesel manufactuer choren but the word " potential " is key here , since second-generation biofuels are not yet proven , nor market ready .
according to the oecd , it remains to be seen whether these new fuels will become economically viable over the next decade , if ever .
they will need large-scale subsidies for the foreseeable future .
high costs are still a major factor .
there are logistical challenges of transporting biomass material to large production facilities , which could impose a floor on costs that would be difficult to lower .
and there is the land issue .
for large-scale production , there are fears that farmers would be tempted to turn fields over to tree plantations for second-generation biofuels instead of wheat or rice fields - a scenario which , again , could affect food availability .
dieter oelig of the environmental group nabu worries that there is too much focus on this new generation of fuel , and not enough on energy or automobile efficiency and other strategies that could be put in place now .
" maybe in 20 or 30 years or 40 years , we have a big potential -lrb- for second-generation biofuels -rrb- , if they work , " he said .
" but in 40 years , we need to have a lot of answers that are clear .
otherwise , we 'll have a very big problem . " kyle james send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

here was the richest club in german soccer splashing the cash in a bid to regain control of a league they usually dominated but had recently lost their power over .
rivals scoffed at the gifts the bayern hierarchy had lavished on themselves .
despite accomplished performances for marseille and the french national team , ribery was seen as not much more than a player trading on the promise of greatness unfulfilled .
toni , while a world cup winner with italy and a prolific club marksman , had made his impact in mid-table serie a sides .
but he had been overlooked by the likes of domestic powerhouses like the milan clubs and juventus , when it came to snapping up a reliable scorer .
if anything , the transfer of klose , somewhat overshadowed by munich 's expensive european shopping spree , was seen as the most serious statement of intent for the season ahead .
and yet , looking back over a season which has seen bayern reemerge as the bundesliga 's top dog , klose has joined lukas podolski as one of the club 's more disappointing acquisitions .
franck and luca justify the summer spending bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : toni and ribery embodied bayern 's intent to conquer so , far from being a vulgar display of extravagance with little business acumen behind it , the purchase of ribery and toni in particular has proved to be the coup of the season , as the italian 's 35 goals in 41 games has shown alongside the frenchman 's utter dominance and guile .
the french midfielder only underlined his role as the top attraction of the bundesliga last sunday , when he came off the bench to score twice in a 4-1 demolition of vfb stuttgart with which munich effectively clinched another league title .
italian team-mate toni may almost be more valuable for munich with his 21 goals in the league , but it is ribery who has electrified the fans with a skill not seen in the german top flight for years .
" there was something like a circus atmosphere when ribery came on , " said munich chairman karl-heinz rummenigge .
" the fans really get a treat here . "
the frenchman , the most expensive player in munich history at 25 million euros , has been an instant hit and has even managed to get opposing fans on their feet - something rarely achieved as munich are either loved or hated .
ribery adds french flair to german efficiency bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ribery has brought excitement to bayern munich and while the summer spending was intended to bring the title back to the allianz arena , it was also money spent in a bid to bring entertainment to the fans .
for all bayern 's success , they have rarely been the most exciting and aesthetic of teams , preferring to grind opponents into defeat with a ruthless efficiency rather than to play their opposition off the park .
for all the excitement ribery brings to the team , it would all be for nothing if there was n't a striker at the end of the beautiful moves to put the ball in the net and luca toni has proved to be that man .
lauded by none other than bayern striking legend gerd mueller , who believes toni is the player to beat his long-standing 40-goals-in-a-season record , the italian is seen by many in munich as the type of target man the club has been missing for years .
the former fiorentina forward has fired bayern to the cusp of a 21st title , combined with the livewire ribery to win the dfb cup for munich , and has scored 10 goals so far in a uefa cup campaign , which has seen the german side reach the semi-finals .
after a journeyman career which has taken him through ten teams , toni now looks at home .
munich lucky to have luca bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the italian job : toni has had a smash-and-grab season " he 's a world-class striker .
he 's got an amazing instinct for goals , " said bayern coach ottmar hitzfeld , barely containing his enthusiasm for toni .
" he always believes he can score two or three goals in each match .
he 's never satisfied and always hungry for more goals .
he 's a real winner , a leader on our team . "
however , the combination of the frenchman and the italian , the plaudits that follow them and the silverware they look destined to win together , disguise the fact that munich 's german stars have failed to set the league alight this season .
klose has been dogged by injury as the season entered its critical phase .
even when he played , he failed to maintain the form he displayed in the campaign 's opening salvos after moving from werder bremen in the summer .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : podolski and klose enjoy a happier moment together podolski has proved to be an asset from the bench , scoring important goals in substitute cameos , but has also failed to establish himself as a first team regular since his arrival from cologne in 2006 .
he remains behind toni and klose in the battle to start up front for bayern despite maintaining his clinical streak for the national team .
another german acquisition , jan schlaudraff , failed to even make it to the end of the season before being offloaded .
schlaudraff , who moved to bayern from alemannia aachen last summer for 1.2 million euros , completed a move to fellow bundesliga club hanover in april after a frustrating campaign in the lower reaches of the club 's pecking order .
the disappointment of their german stars and the 70-odd million euros they handed out almost a year ago will all be forgotten by the fans and the management alike , if bayern munich can complete their resurrection with a league , cup and european treble .
ribery and toni will then look like the bargains of the season . nick amies send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

merkel calls on brazil to make biofuel production sustainable german minister calls for reversal of eu agricultural policy germany defends biofuels , hedges bets on energy goals illegal logging gives eu massive eco-headache environment -pipe- 29.04.2008 as biofuels fall from grace , a new generation grabs spotlight großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a second-generation biofuel production facility - the new climate savior ?
biofuels made from food crops were once seen as an environmental savior .
but not anymore .
now politicians and experts hope a new generation of green fuels will be a powerful weapon against climate change . there is an old saying : if it sounds too good to be true , it probably is .
when it comes to biofuels made from crops such as wheat , corn or rapeseed , many are saying that adage fits like a glove . biofuels were once seen as a near perfect tool to reduce emissions from cars and trucks .
while cars would still spew out greenhouse gases , if they ran on biofuel , at least the plants that made their fuel would have soaked up co2 while they were growing .
" in the beginning , it sounded very good , " said dietmar oeliger , a traffic policy expert at the german environmental group nabu .
" you did n't have to change your cars or your life system .
instead of using fossil fuels , you take something different and everything can stay the same . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : people worry that farmers are growing crops for fuel instead of food problem is , he added , it did n't work out the way it was planned .
despite huge government subsidies from eu countries to push biofuels - around 2.6 billion euros in tax subsidies in the eu in 2006 - their green credentials turned out to be questionable at best .
according to a report entitled " biofuels : is the cure worse than the disease ? " by the organization for economic cooperation and development -lrb- oecd -rrb- , conventional biofuel technology provides greenhouse gas reductions of less than 40 percent , which when other factors are taken into account , means that biofuels ' disadvantages can often outweigh the benefits .
" if you take the whole production process into account with some of them , the use of land , water , fertilizer , etc . , they do n't perform very well in mitigating co2 emissions , " said michael zirpel of the international transport forum , part of the oecd .
" some are even worse than fossil fuels . "
a serious rethink european countries are beginning to rethink their biofuels enthusiasm and are rolling back some of their generous subsidies .
the eu is also starting to reconsider its commitment to these so-called first-generation biofuels .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : pump with biodiesel from rapeseed recent reports have linked rising food prices and rainforest production to biofuels , as farmers grow crops for fuel instead for human consumption .
the un special rapporteur for the right to food jean ziegler even called large-scale production of biofuels " a crime against humanity . "
the eu 's once highly touted goal of having 10 percent of transportation powered by biofuels by 2020 is no longer set in stone , since brussels did not foresee the problems that could arise .
" biofuels were at the center of praise at the beginning , and now they 're in the center of criticism , " said barbara helfferich , spokeswoman for eu environment commissioner stavros dimas .
" now it 's not biofuels in and of themselves , it 's what kind of biofuels and how we produce them . "
hopes for the second-generation as politicians and policy makers begin toning down their tributes to first-generation biofuels , they 're not giving up on the concept altogether .
what did n't work the first time around , the thinking seems to be , might succeed on a second try .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : car manufacturers are especially eager to see second-generation biofuels a reality in a small town about a half-hour 's drive from dresden , some leading political and industry leaders gathered recently .
german chancellor angela merkel was there , along with daimler ceo dieter zetsche , volkswagen boss martin winterkorn and rob routs , a high-ranking executive at shell .
they 've gathered at what choren industries claims is the “ the world 's first commercial production plant to convert biomass into synthetic diesel fuel . ”
instead of using rapeseed , wheat or corn , chroen will use forest residue and waste wood to produce its sun diesel , which it claims is head and shoulders above anything on the market today .
" we would be triple a if judged by moody 's , " said tom blades , head of choren .
" compared to fossil fuels , we actually lower the co2 emissions in the product lifecycle by over 90 percent . " it is an enticing claim and one which industry leaders , particular from the german car industry , are eager to support .
they are already under pressure to reduce their emissions to abide by european union guidelines and merkel 's government is reported to be waging a rearguard campaign to delay implementation , reduce penalties and ease the burden on the country 's luxury automotive industry .
second-generation fuels could help the car industry meet climate-protection goals without it having to make too many sacrifices .
could work , maybe " synthetic fuels from biomass have the potential - and we 're still talking about potential - to become a central pillar in climate-friendly energy supply , " said angela merkel . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : biodiesel manufactuer choren but the word " potential " is key here , since second-generation biofuels are not yet proven , nor market ready .
according to the oecd , it remains to be seen whether these new fuels will become economically viable over the next decade , if ever .
they will need large-scale subsidies for the foreseeable future .
high costs are still a major factor .
there are logistical challenges of transporting biomass material to large production facilities , which could impose a floor on costs that would be difficult to lower .
and there is the land issue .
for large-scale production , there are fears that farmers would be tempted to turn fields over to tree plantations for second-generation biofuels instead of wheat or rice fields - a scenario which , again , could affect food availability .
dieter oelig of the environmental group nabu worries that there is too much focus on this new generation of fuel , and not enough on energy or automobile efficiency and other strategies that could be put in place now .
" maybe in 20 or 30 years or 40 years , we have a big potential -lrb- for second-generation biofuels -rrb- , if they work , " he said .
" but in 40 years , we need to have a lot of answers that are clear .
otherwise , we 'll have a very big problem . " kyle james send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

ban also cited as another urgent priority support for farmers so as to " ensure food for tomorrow . " " in order to take this forward we have agreed to establish a un task force on global food crisis that i will chair and will bring together heads of specialized agencies and ... institutions into effective and coordinated mechanisms , " he said . escalation in prices drives crisis a un statement regarding the food crisis stated that the dramatic escalation in worldwide food prices has evolved into an unprecedented challenge of global proportions and added that crisis was having a large effect on " the world 's most vulnerable , including the urban poor .

" world food program head josette sheeran told reporters : " we have pledges of 471 million , but only 18 million is cash in hand .
we ca n't procure food until we have cash in hand .
so we 're in a really urgent timeframe to getting a commitment as soon as possible . " world bank chief urges against export bans bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : zoellick expects wheat , rice and corn prices to remain high the world bank issued a statement tuesday saying it would double its lending for agriculture in africa over the next year to $ 800 million .

" we are urging countries not to use export bans , " zoellick said .
" these controls encourage hoarding , drive up prices and hurt the poorest people around the world who are struggling to feed themselves . " pascal lamy , the director-general of the world trade organization -lrb- wto -rrb- , said the crisis was another urgent reason to conclude the doha round of trade talks to open up world trade , an attempt to liberalize trade in food and other goods and services by cutting tariffs and subsidies . " i believe that today 's call for action under the auspices of the un secretary-general can help wto members gather the necessary political energy in order to help developing countries to increase their food production capacity , " lamy said . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

replacement candidates will face some steep competition from wagner 's two daughters , said to be favorites . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : wolfgang wagner has been in charge of bayreuth since 1951 wagner is resigning as director of the bayreuth festival , officials said on tuesday , april 29 .
the prestigious annual event celebrates the music of his grandfather richard wagner .
wagner has headed the renowned festival since 1951 .
yet with wagner turning 89 on august 30 , he decided it was time to retire .
no replacement for wagner has been announced .
bayreuth officials said that interested candidates have four months to apply .
the festival has been at the center of a decades-long family feud over who will succeed the increasingly frail elder wagner .
sisterly duet bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the festival has become a major celebrity event wagner recently hinted that he could imagine his estranged daughter eva wagner-pasquier , 63 , teaming up with her half-sister katharina wagner , 29 , to run the festival jointly .
the half-sisters were called on by the festival board to devise a joint proposal for the future of the festival as soon as possible .
yet the two half sisters are known to have a strained relationship .
the festival board ordered wagner to hand over the reigns to eva in 2001 .
but the two have not been on speaking terms since wolfgang divorced eva 's mother ellen drexel in 1976 to marry gudrun wagner .
founded in 1876 by richard wagner , the festival has become an opera spectacle of legendary proportions .
performances are sold out years in advance with top german socialites and politicians attending .

here was the richest club in german soccer splashing the cash in a bid to regain control of a league they usually dominated but had recently lost their power over .
rivals scoffed at the gifts the bayern hierarchy had lavished on themselves .
despite accomplished performances for marseille and the french national team , ribery was seen as not much more than a player trading on the promise of greatness unfulfilled .
toni , while a world cup winner with italy and a prolific club marksman , had made his impact in mid-table serie a sides .
but he had been overlooked by the likes of domestic powerhouses like the milan clubs and juventus , when it came to snapping up a reliable scorer .
if anything , the transfer of klose , somewhat overshadowed by munich 's expensive european shopping spree , was seen as the most serious statement of intent for the season ahead .
and yet , looking back over a season which has seen bayern reemerge as the bundesliga 's top dog , klose has joined lukas podolski as one of the club 's more disappointing acquisitions .
franck and luca justify the summer spending bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : toni and ribery embodied bayern 's intent to conquer so , far from being a vulgar display of extravagance with little business acumen behind it , the purchase of ribery and toni in particular has proved to be the coup of the season , as the italian 's 35 goals in 41 games has shown alongside the frenchman 's utter dominance and guile .
the french midfielder only underlined his role as the top attraction of the bundesliga last sunday , when he came off the bench to score twice in a 4-1 demolition of vfb stuttgart with which munich effectively clinched another league title .
italian team-mate toni may almost be more valuable for munich with his 21 goals in the league , but it is ribery who has electrified the fans with a skill not seen in the german top flight for years .
" there was something like a circus atmosphere when ribery came on , " said munich chairman karl-heinz rummenigge .
" the fans really get a treat here . "
the frenchman , the most expensive player in munich history at 25 million euros , has been an instant hit and has even managed to get opposing fans on their feet - something rarely achieved as munich are either loved or hated .
ribery adds french flair to german efficiency bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ribery has brought excitement to bayern munich and while the summer spending was intended to bring the title back to the allianz arena , it was also money spent in a bid to bring entertainment to the fans .
for all bayern 's success , they have rarely been the most exciting and aesthetic of teams , preferring to grind opponents into defeat with a ruthless efficiency rather than to play their opposition off the park .
for all the excitement ribery brings to the team , it would all be for nothing if there was n't a striker at the end of the beautiful moves to put the ball in the net and luca toni has proved to be that man .
lauded by none other than bayern striking legend gerd mueller , who believes toni is the player to beat his long-standing 40-goals-in-a-season record , the italian is seen by many in munich as the type of target man the club has been missing for years .
the former fiorentina forward has fired bayern to the cusp of a 21st title , combined with the livewire ribery to win the dfb cup for munich , and has scored 10 goals so far in a uefa cup campaign , which has seen the german side reach the semi-finals .
after a journeyman career which has taken him through ten teams , toni now looks at home .
munich lucky to have luca bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the italian job : toni has had a smash-and-grab season " he 's a world-class striker .
he 's got an amazing instinct for goals , " said bayern coach ottmar hitzfeld , barely containing his enthusiasm for toni .
" he always believes he can score two or three goals in each match .
he 's never satisfied and always hungry for more goals .
he 's a real winner , a leader on our team . "
however , the combination of the frenchman and the italian , the plaudits that follow them and the silverware they look destined to win together , disguise the fact that munich 's german stars have failed to set the league alight this season .
klose has been dogged by injury as the season entered its critical phase .
even when he played , he failed to maintain the form he displayed in the campaign 's opening salvos after moving from werder bremen in the summer .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : podolski and klose enjoy a happier moment together podolski has proved to be an asset from the bench , scoring important goals in substitute cameos , but has also failed to establish himself as a first team regular since his arrival from cologne in 2006 .
he remains behind toni and klose in the battle to start up front for bayern despite maintaining his clinical streak for the national team .
another german acquisition , jan schlaudraff , failed to even make it to the end of the season before being offloaded .
schlaudraff , who moved to bayern from alemannia aachen last summer for 1.2 million euros , completed a move to fellow bundesliga club hanover in april after a frustrating campaign in the lower reaches of the club 's pecking order .
the disappointment of their german stars and the 70-odd million euros they handed out almost a year ago will all be forgotten by the fans and the management alike , if bayern munich can complete their resurrection with a league , cup and european treble .
ribery and toni will then look like the bargains of the season . nick amies send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

despite accomplished performances for marseille and the french national team , ribery was seen as not much more than a player trading on the promise of greatness unfulfilled .
toni , while a world cup winner with italy and a prolific club marksman , had made his impact in mid-table serie a sides .
but he had been overlooked by the likes of domestic powerhouses like the milan clubs and juventus , when it came to snapping up a reliable scorer .
if anything , the transfer of klose , somewhat overshadowed by munich 's expensive european shopping spree , was seen as the most serious statement of intent for the season ahead .
and yet , looking back over a season which has seen bayern reemerge as the bundesliga 's top dog , klose has joined lukas podolski as one of the club 's more disappointing acquisitions .
franck and luca justify the summer spending bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : toni and ribery embodied bayern 's intent to conquer so , far from being a vulgar display of extravagance with little business acumen behind it , the purchase of ribery and toni in particular has proved to be the coup of the season , as the italian 's 35 goals in 41 games has shown alongside the frenchman 's utter dominance and guile .
the french midfielder only underlined his role as the top attraction of the bundesliga last sunday , when he came off the bench to score twice in a 4-1 demolition of vfb stuttgart with which munich effectively clinched another league title .
italian team-mate toni may almost be more valuable for munich with his 21 goals in the league , but it is ribery who has electrified the fans with a skill not seen in the german top flight for years .
" there was something like a circus atmosphere when ribery came on , " said munich chairman karl-heinz rummenigge .
" the fans really get a treat here . "
the frenchman , the most expensive player in munich history at 25 million euros , has been an instant hit and has even managed to get opposing fans on their feet - something rarely achieved as munich are either loved or hated .
ribery adds french flair to german efficiency bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ribery has brought excitement to bayern munich and while the summer spending was intended to bring the title back to the allianz arena , it was also money spent in a bid to bring entertainment to the fans .
for all bayern 's success , they have rarely been the most exciting and aesthetic of teams , preferring to grind opponents into defeat with a ruthless efficiency rather than to play their opposition off the park .
for all the excitement ribery brings to the team , it would all be for nothing if there was n't a striker at the end of the beautiful moves to put the ball in the net and luca toni has proved to be that man .
lauded by none other than bayern striking legend gerd mueller , who believes toni is the player to beat his long-standing 40-goals-in-a-season record , the italian is seen by many in munich as the type of target man the club has been missing for years .
the former fiorentina forward has fired bayern to the cusp of a 21st title , combined with the livewire ribery to win the dfb cup for munich , and has scored 10 goals so far in a uefa cup campaign , which has seen the german side reach the semi-finals .
after a journeyman career which has taken him through ten teams , toni now looks at home .
munich lucky to have luca bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the italian job : toni has had a smash-and-grab season " he 's a world-class striker .
he 's got an amazing instinct for goals , " said bayern coach ottmar hitzfeld , barely containing his enthusiasm for toni .
" he always believes he can score two or three goals in each match .
he 's never satisfied and always hungry for more goals .
he 's a real winner , a leader on our team . "
however , the combination of the frenchman and the italian , the plaudits that follow them and the silverware they look destined to win together , disguise the fact that munich 's german stars have failed to set the league alight this season .
klose has been dogged by injury as the season entered its critical phase .
even when he played , he failed to maintain the form he displayed in the campaign 's opening salvos after moving from werder bremen in the summer .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : podolski and klose enjoy a happier moment together podolski has proved to be an asset from the bench , scoring important goals in substitute cameos , but has also failed to establish himself as a first team regular since his arrival from cologne in 2006 .
he remains behind toni and klose in the battle to start up front for bayern despite maintaining his clinical streak for the national team .
another german acquisition , jan schlaudraff , failed to even make it to the end of the season before being offloaded .
schlaudraff , who moved to bayern from alemannia aachen last summer for 1.2 million euros , completed a move to fellow bundesliga club hanover in april after a frustrating campaign in the lower reaches of the club 's pecking order .
the disappointment of their german stars and the 70-odd million euros they handed out almost a year ago will all be forgotten by the fans and the management alike , if bayern munich can complete their resurrection with a league , cup and european treble .
ribery and toni will then look like the bargains of the season . nick amies send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the strong showing will make it easier for berlusconi to push through reforms . the first official item on the italian senate agenda was to elect a speaker .
in the rough-and-tumble world of italian politics , this is usually a drawn-out , contentious decision .
yet renato schifani sailed through the approval process on tuesday , april 29 .
the selection of the long-time berlusconi aid was the first indication that conservatives have consolidated their power and will not be stopped by the fragmentation that plagued past italian governments .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : center-right parties have a clear parliamentary majority berlusconi 's center-right won a solid victory in the april 13-14 elections , with small parties and the extreme left and right losing seats .
the result has left the senate divided into fairly clean-cut majority and minority camps .
berlusconi , a 71-year-old media tycoon , won the recent national elections in italy by a surprisingly wide margin , claiming the prime minister 's office for the third time .
and on monday , his ally gianni alemanno was elected mayor of rome - the first conservative to win the post in 15 years .
" i am the happiest man in all of italy , " berlusconi said on monday .
italian-style politics bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : italy 's left could n't defeat berlusconi yet schifani 's easy election did not leave italy without its traditional political grandstanding .
the leader of the federalist and anti-immigration northern league , umberto bossi , brought some color to proceedings , when , ignoring his ally berlusconi 's recent pleas not to use inflammatory language , he issued a warning to the center-left minority .
" i do n't know what the left wants , but if they are looking for a clash , i have 300,000 men " ready to mobilize , bossi said , adding that the northern leagues ' " guns are always warm " to blast through federalist reforms if necessary .
the northern league did even better than expected and bossi is thought to be a possible reforms minister in berlusconi 's future cabinet .
berlusconi in full control bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : voters handed berlusconi a clear victory the lower chamber of deputies is expected to follow the senate 's lead and elect a berlusconi supporter as its speaker on wednesday .
gianfranco fini , leader of the post-fascist national alliance , is expected to win the post .
his party merged with berlusconi 's people of freedom for the elections .
once both speakers have been sworn in , president giorgio napolitano will hold consultations with all parliamentary groups and then formally ask berlusconi to form a government .
the government will then have to be approved with confidence votes in both houses of parliament - a process which is expected to be completed by the end of next week .
berlusconi has said he will use his win to push through electoral reforms and an ambitious economic agenda . dw staff -lrb- th -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

both countries had blocked the agreement because they felt belgrade was not fully cooperating with the hague tribunal . the netherlands and belgium agreed to sign the saa on the condition that serbia handed over all remaining war-crime suspects .

merkel calls on brazil to make biofuel production sustainable german minister calls for reversal of eu agricultural policy germany defends biofuels , hedges bets on energy goals illegal logging gives eu massive eco-headache environment -pipe- 29.04.2008 as biofuels fall from grace , a new generation grabs spotlight großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a second-generation biofuel production facility - the new climate savior ?
biofuels made from food crops were once seen as an environmental savior .
but not anymore .
now politicians and experts hope a new generation of green fuels will be a powerful weapon against climate change . there is an old saying : if it sounds too good to be true , it probably is .
when it comes to biofuels made from crops such as wheat , corn or rapeseed , many are saying that adage fits like a glove . biofuels were once seen as a near perfect tool to reduce emissions from cars and trucks .
while cars would still spew out greenhouse gases , if they ran on biofuel , at least the plants that made their fuel would have soaked up co2 while they were growing .
" in the beginning , it sounded very good , " said dietmar oeliger , a traffic policy expert at the german environmental group nabu .
" you did n't have to change your cars or your life system .
instead of using fossil fuels , you take something different and everything can stay the same . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : people worry that farmers are growing crops for fuel instead of food problem is , he added , it did n't work out the way it was planned .
despite huge government subsidies from eu countries to push biofuels - around 2.6 billion euros in tax subsidies in the eu in 2006 - their green credentials turned out to be questionable at best .
according to a report entitled " biofuels : is the cure worse than the disease ? " by the organization for economic cooperation and development -lrb- oecd -rrb- , conventional biofuel technology provides greenhouse gas reductions of less than 40 percent , which when other factors are taken into account , means that biofuels ' disadvantages can often outweigh the benefits .
" if you take the whole production process into account with some of them , the use of land , water , fertilizer , etc . , they do n't perform very well in mitigating co2 emissions , " said michael zirpel of the international transport forum , part of the oecd .
" some are even worse than fossil fuels . "
a serious rethink european countries are beginning to rethink their biofuels enthusiasm and are rolling back some of their generous subsidies .
the eu is also starting to reconsider its commitment to these so-called first-generation biofuels .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : pump with biodiesel from rapeseed recent reports have linked rising food prices and rainforest production to biofuels , as farmers grow crops for fuel instead for human consumption .
the un special rapporteur for the right to food jean ziegler even called large-scale production of biofuels " a crime against humanity . "
the eu 's once highly touted goal of having 10 percent of transportation powered by biofuels by 2020 is no longer set in stone , since brussels did not foresee the problems that could arise .
" biofuels were at the center of praise at the beginning , and now they 're in the center of criticism , " said barbara helfferich , spokeswoman for eu environment commissioner stavros dimas .
" now it 's not biofuels in and of themselves , it 's what kind of biofuels and how we produce them . "
hopes for the second-generation as politicians and policy makers begin toning down their tributes to first-generation biofuels , they 're not giving up on the concept altogether .
what did n't work the first time around , the thinking seems to be , might succeed on a second try .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : car manufacturers are especially eager to see second-generation biofuels a reality in a small town about a half-hour 's drive from dresden , some leading political and industry leaders gathered recently .
german chancellor angela merkel was there , along with daimler ceo dieter zetsche , volkswagen boss martin winterkorn and rob routs , a high-ranking executive at shell .
they 've gathered at what choren industries claims is the “ the world 's first commercial production plant to convert biomass into synthetic diesel fuel . ”
instead of using rapeseed , wheat or corn , chroen will use forest residue and waste wood to produce its sun diesel , which it claims is head and shoulders above anything on the market today .
" we would be triple a if judged by moody 's , " said tom blades , head of choren .
" compared to fossil fuels , we actually lower the co2 emissions in the product lifecycle by over 90 percent . " it is an enticing claim and one which industry leaders , particular from the german car industry , are eager to support .
they are already under pressure to reduce their emissions to abide by european union guidelines and merkel 's government is reported to be waging a rearguard campaign to delay implementation , reduce penalties and ease the burden on the country 's luxury automotive industry .
second-generation fuels could help the car industry meet climate-protection goals without it having to make too many sacrifices .
could work , maybe " synthetic fuels from biomass have the potential - and we 're still talking about potential - to become a central pillar in climate-friendly energy supply , " said angela merkel . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : biodiesel manufactuer choren but the word " potential " is key here , since second-generation biofuels are not yet proven , nor market ready .
according to the oecd , it remains to be seen whether these new fuels will become economically viable over the next decade , if ever .
they will need large-scale subsidies for the foreseeable future .
high costs are still a major factor .
there are logistical challenges of transporting biomass material to large production facilities , which could impose a floor on costs that would be difficult to lower .
and there is the land issue .
for large-scale production , there are fears that farmers would be tempted to turn fields over to tree plantations for second-generation biofuels instead of wheat or rice fields - a scenario which , again , could affect food availability .
dieter oelig of the environmental group nabu worries that there is too much focus on this new generation of fuel , and not enough on energy or automobile efficiency and other strategies that could be put in place now .
" maybe in 20 or 30 years or 40 years , we have a big potential -lrb- for second-generation biofuels -rrb- , if they work , " he said .
" but in 40 years , we need to have a lot of answers that are clear .

the eu 's once highly touted goal of having 10 percent of transportation powered by biofuels by 2020 is no longer set in stone , since brussels did not foresee the problems that could arise .
" biofuels were at the center of praise at the beginning , and now they 're in the center of criticism , " said barbara helfferich , spokeswoman for eu environment commissioner stavros dimas .
" now it 's not biofuels in and of themselves , it 's what kind of biofuels and how we produce them . "
hopes for the second-generation as politicians and policy makers begin toning down their tributes to first-generation biofuels , they 're not giving up on the concept altogether .
what did n't work the first time around , the thinking seems to be , might succeed on a second try .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : car manufacturers are especially eager to see second-generation biofuels a reality in a small town about a half-hour 's drive from dresden , some leading political and industry leaders gathered recently .
german chancellor angela merkel was there , along with daimler ceo dieter zetsche , volkswagen boss martin winterkorn and rob routs , a high-ranking executive at shell .
they 've gathered at what choren industries claims is the “ the world 's first commercial production plant to convert biomass into synthetic diesel fuel . ”
instead of using rapeseed , wheat or corn , chroen will use forest residue and waste wood to produce its sun diesel , which it claims is head and shoulders above anything on the market today .
" we would be triple a if judged by moody 's , " said tom blades , head of choren .
" compared to fossil fuels , we actually lower the co2 emissions in the product lifecycle by over 90 percent . " it is an enticing claim and one which industry leaders , particular from the german car industry , are eager to support .
they are already under pressure to reduce their emissions to abide by european union guidelines and merkel 's government is reported to be waging a rearguard campaign to delay implementation , reduce penalties and ease the burden on the country 's luxury automotive industry .
second-generation fuels could help the car industry meet climate-protection goals without it having to make too many sacrifices .
could work , maybe " synthetic fuels from biomass have the potential - and we 're still talking about potential - to become a central pillar in climate-friendly energy supply , " said angela merkel . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : biodiesel manufactuer choren but the word " potential " is key here , since second-generation biofuels are not yet proven , nor market ready .
according to the oecd , it remains to be seen whether these new fuels will become economically viable over the next decade , if ever .
they will need large-scale subsidies for the foreseeable future .
high costs are still a major factor .
there are logistical challenges of transporting biomass material to large production facilities , which could impose a floor on costs that would be difficult to lower .
and there is the land issue .
for large-scale production , there are fears that farmers would be tempted to turn fields over to tree plantations for second-generation biofuels instead of wheat or rice fields - a scenario which , again , could affect food availability .
dieter oelig of the environmental group nabu worries that there is too much focus on this new generation of fuel , and not enough on energy or automobile efficiency and other strategies that could be put in place now .
" maybe in 20 or 30 years or 40 years , we have a big potential -lrb- for second-generation biofuels -rrb- , if they work , " he said .

biofuels made from food crops were once seen as an environmental savior .
but not anymore .
now politicians and experts hope a new generation of green fuels will be a powerful weapon against climate change . there is an old saying : if it sounds too good to be true , it probably is .
when it comes to biofuels made from crops such as wheat , corn or rapeseed , many are saying that adage fits like a glove . biofuels were once seen as a near perfect tool to reduce emissions from cars and trucks .
while cars would still spew out greenhouse gases , if they ran on biofuel , at least the plants that made their fuel would have soaked up co2 while they were growing .
" in the beginning , it sounded very good , " said dietmar oeliger , a traffic policy expert at the german environmental group nabu .
" you did n't have to change your cars or your life system .
instead of using fossil fuels , you take something different and everything can stay the same . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : people worry that farmers are growing crops for fuel instead of food problem is , he added , it did n't work out the way it was planned .
despite huge government subsidies from eu countries to push biofuels - around 2.6 billion euros in tax subsidies in the eu in 2006 - their green credentials turned out to be questionable at best .
according to a report entitled " biofuels : is the cure worse than the disease ? " by the organization for economic cooperation and development -lrb- oecd -rrb- , conventional biofuel technology provides greenhouse gas reductions of less than 40 percent , which when other factors are taken into account , means that biofuels ' disadvantages can often outweigh the benefits .
" if you take the whole production process into account with some of them , the use of land , water , fertilizer , etc . , they do n't perform very well in mitigating co2 emissions , " said michael zirpel of the international transport forum , part of the oecd .
" some are even worse than fossil fuels . "
a serious rethink european countries are beginning to rethink their biofuels enthusiasm and are rolling back some of their generous subsidies .
the eu is also starting to reconsider its commitment to these so-called first-generation biofuels .

merkel calls on brazil to make biofuel production sustainable german minister calls for reversal of eu agricultural policy germany defends biofuels , hedges bets on energy goals illegal logging gives eu massive eco-headache environment -pipe- 29.04.2008 as biofuels fall from grace , a new generation grabs spotlight großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a second-generation biofuel production facility - the new climate savior ?
biofuels made from food crops were once seen as an environmental savior .
but not anymore .
now politicians and experts hope a new generation of green fuels will be a powerful weapon against climate change . there is an old saying : if it sounds too good to be true , it probably is .
when it comes to biofuels made from crops such as wheat , corn or rapeseed , many are saying that adage fits like a glove . biofuels were once seen as a near perfect tool to reduce emissions from cars and trucks .
while cars would still spew out greenhouse gases , if they ran on biofuel , at least the plants that made their fuel would have soaked up co2 while they were growing .
" in the beginning , it sounded very good , " said dietmar oeliger , a traffic policy expert at the german environmental group nabu .
" you did n't have to change your cars or your life system .
instead of using fossil fuels , you take something different and everything can stay the same . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : people worry that farmers are growing crops for fuel instead of food problem is , he added , it did n't work out the way it was planned .
despite huge government subsidies from eu countries to push biofuels - around 2.6 billion euros in tax subsidies in the eu in 2006 - their green credentials turned out to be questionable at best .
according to a report entitled " biofuels : is the cure worse than the disease ? " by the organization for economic cooperation and development -lrb- oecd -rrb- , conventional biofuel technology provides greenhouse gas reductions of less than 40 percent , which when other factors are taken into account , means that biofuels ' disadvantages can often outweigh the benefits .
" if you take the whole production process into account with some of them , the use of land , water , fertilizer , etc . , they do n't perform very well in mitigating co2 emissions , " said michael zirpel of the international transport forum , part of the oecd .
" some are even worse than fossil fuels . "
a serious rethink european countries are beginning to rethink their biofuels enthusiasm and are rolling back some of their generous subsidies .
the eu is also starting to reconsider its commitment to these so-called first-generation biofuels .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : pump with biodiesel from rapeseed recent reports have linked rising food prices and rainforest production to biofuels , as farmers grow crops for fuel instead for human consumption .
the un special rapporteur for the right to food jean ziegler even called large-scale production of biofuels " a crime against humanity . "
the eu 's once highly touted goal of having 10 percent of transportation powered by biofuels by 2020 is no longer set in stone , since brussels did not foresee the problems that could arise .
" biofuels were at the center of praise at the beginning , and now they 're in the center of criticism , " said barbara helfferich , spokeswoman for eu environment commissioner stavros dimas .
" now it 's not biofuels in and of themselves , it 's what kind of biofuels and how we produce them . "
hopes for the second-generation as politicians and policy makers begin toning down their tributes to first-generation biofuels , they 're not giving up on the concept altogether .
what did n't work the first time around , the thinking seems to be , might succeed on a second try .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : car manufacturers are especially eager to see second-generation biofuels a reality in a small town about a half-hour 's drive from dresden , some leading political and industry leaders gathered recently .
german chancellor angela merkel was there , along with daimler ceo dieter zetsche , volkswagen boss martin winterkorn and rob routs , a high-ranking executive at shell .
they 've gathered at what choren industries claims is the “ the world 's first commercial production plant to convert biomass into synthetic diesel fuel . ”
instead of using rapeseed , wheat or corn , chroen will use forest residue and waste wood to produce its sun diesel , which it claims is head and shoulders above anything on the market today .
" we would be triple a if judged by moody 's , " said tom blades , head of choren .
" compared to fossil fuels , we actually lower the co2 emissions in the product lifecycle by over 90 percent . " it is an enticing claim and one which industry leaders , particular from the german car industry , are eager to support .
they are already under pressure to reduce their emissions to abide by european union guidelines and merkel 's government is reported to be waging a rearguard campaign to delay implementation , reduce penalties and ease the burden on the country 's luxury automotive industry .
second-generation fuels could help the car industry meet climate-protection goals without it having to make too many sacrifices .
could work , maybe " synthetic fuels from biomass have the potential - and we 're still talking about potential - to become a central pillar in climate-friendly energy supply , " said angela merkel . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : biodiesel manufactuer choren but the word " potential " is key here , since second-generation biofuels are not yet proven , nor market ready .
according to the oecd , it remains to be seen whether these new fuels will become economically viable over the next decade , if ever .
they will need large-scale subsidies for the foreseeable future .
high costs are still a major factor .
there are logistical challenges of transporting biomass material to large production facilities , which could impose a floor on costs that would be difficult to lower .
and there is the land issue .
for large-scale production , there are fears that farmers would be tempted to turn fields over to tree plantations for second-generation biofuels instead of wheat or rice fields - a scenario which , again , could affect food availability .
dieter oelig of the environmental group nabu worries that there is too much focus on this new generation of fuel , and not enough on energy or automobile efficiency and other strategies that could be put in place now .
" maybe in 20 or 30 years or 40 years , we have a big potential -lrb- for second-generation biofuels -rrb- , if they work , " he said .
" but in 40 years , we need to have a lot of answers that are clear .
otherwise , we 'll have a very big problem . " kyle james send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

but the balkan country will have to convince its eu partners and its own countrymen that it 's ready to join the bloc . the stabilization and association agreement -lrb- saa -rrb- , a precursor to full eu membership talks , was signed on tuesday , april 29 , by the eu foreign ministers and serbia 's deputy prime minister bozidar djelic in the presence of the serbian president , boris tadic . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : djelic -lrb- left -rrb- , tadic , solana and rupel were happy that the job was done europe hopes that the deal will boost serbia 's pro-european parties ahead of an upcoming parliamentary vote . but first , the ex-yugoslav country will have to show it is fully cooperating with the international war crimes tribunal in the hague .
eu states will not ratify the pact , nor will serbia get any trade or other benefits until this condition is met . the saa sent " a strong signal to serbia to join us , to come to the eu , " said slovenian foreign minister dimitrij rupel , who chaired the council meeting of eu foreign ministers in luxembourg where the decision was made . serbian foreign minister vuk jeremic , a pro-european member of the government , called the saa agreement historic and said the decision signaled " an important political statement " which will open the doors to serbia 's eu membership . " we believe we are irreversibly on the road to eu membership , " he told reporters . serbia must hand over war criminals bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : opinions about the eu are divided in serbia the saa helps aspiring eu candidates to meet the strict standards necessary for eventual membership in the bloc .
serbia will be asked to carry out various political , judicial and economic reforms . in return , the eu will offer a series of benefits , including financial assistance , free trade deals and the relaxation of visa rules . tuesday 's diplomatic breakthrough came after the netherlands and belgium said they would no longer oppose the serbian saa .
both countries had blocked the agreement because they felt belgrade was not fully cooperating with the hague tribunal . the netherlands and belgium agreed to sign the saa on the condition that serbia handed over all remaining war-crime suspects .
the most notorious criminal is ratko mladic , the bosnian-serb general indicted for genocide and crimes against humanity .
he is accused of orchestrating the 1995 srebrenica massacre of 8,000 bosniaks . mladic is believed to be hiding in serbia . " the netherlands and belgium have been very flexible and put forward several proposals , because we want to give the serb people a signal that we care about them and that their future is in europe , " dutch foreign minister maxime verhagen had said ahead of the luxembourg meeting . elections unlikely to produce clear mandate bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : serbians rioted after kosovo independence eu officials hope that the prompt signing of the saa might give other pro-european parties an edge over ultra-nationalist rivals in the may 11 parliamentary elections . less than three months ago serbians re-elected pro-european president boris tadic .
yet tadic 's democratic party has been unable to hold together a coalition in parliament , leading to snap elections . while the ultra-nationalist serbian radical party -lrb- srs -rrb- was leading tadic 's democratic party slightly in the polls , neither party was expected to win a clear majority .
it 's thought that current prime minister vojislav kostunica will be the king maker in the upcoming elections . kostunica formed an uneasy coalition with tadic 's party , which collapsed in march .
kostunica 's increasingly nationalistic democratic party of serbia was enraged by what it sees as tadic 's acceptance of kosovo 's recent declaration of independence .
kosovo , a predominantly ethnic-albanian province , split from belgrade on feb .
17 . kostunica is nominally in favor of serbia joining the eu , but only on the condition that the 27-member block recognizes kosovo as part of serbia . serbian parties could nix agreement bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : kostunica has opposed the agreement the saa would become binding for belgrade only once it is ratified by the new parliament . kostunica has condemned the agreement , saying that it recognizes kosovo 's independence and calling it " an act against the state and against the constitution . " tadic disagreed , calling the saa an " economic agreement which can not in any way endanger the sovereignty and territorial integrity of serbia . " eu ministers also indicated they will offer an saa to bosnia-herzegovina , which has been less controversial than the serbia agreement . dw staff -lrb- th -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

here was the richest club in german soccer splashing the cash in a bid to regain control of a league they usually dominated but had recently lost their power over .
rivals scoffed at the gifts the bayern hierarchy had lavished on themselves .
despite accomplished performances for marseille and the french national team , ribery was seen as not much more than a player trading on the promise of greatness unfulfilled .
toni , while a world cup winner with italy and a prolific club marksman , had made his impact in mid-table serie a sides .
but he had been overlooked by the likes of domestic powerhouses like the milan clubs and juventus , when it came to snapping up a reliable scorer .
if anything , the transfer of klose , somewhat overshadowed by munich 's expensive european shopping spree , was seen as the most serious statement of intent for the season ahead .
and yet , looking back over a season which has seen bayern reemerge as the bundesliga 's top dog , klose has joined lukas podolski as one of the club 's more disappointing acquisitions .
franck and luca justify the summer spending bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : toni and ribery embodied bayern 's intent to conquer so , far from being a vulgar display of extravagance with little business acumen behind it , the purchase of ribery and toni in particular has proved to be the coup of the season , as the italian 's 35 goals in 41 games has shown alongside the frenchman 's utter dominance and guile .
the french midfielder only underlined his role as the top attraction of the bundesliga last sunday , when he came off the bench to score twice in a 4-1 demolition of vfb stuttgart with which munich effectively clinched another league title .
italian team-mate toni may almost be more valuable for munich with his 21 goals in the league , but it is ribery who has electrified the fans with a skill not seen in the german top flight for years .
" there was something like a circus atmosphere when ribery came on , " said munich chairman karl-heinz rummenigge .
" the fans really get a treat here . "
the frenchman , the most expensive player in munich history at 25 million euros , has been an instant hit and has even managed to get opposing fans on their feet - something rarely achieved as munich are either loved or hated .
ribery adds french flair to german efficiency bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ribery has brought excitement to bayern munich and while the summer spending was intended to bring the title back to the allianz arena , it was also money spent in a bid to bring entertainment to the fans .
for all bayern 's success , they have rarely been the most exciting and aesthetic of teams , preferring to grind opponents into defeat with a ruthless efficiency rather than to play their opposition off the park .
for all the excitement ribery brings to the team , it would all be for nothing if there was n't a striker at the end of the beautiful moves to put the ball in the net and luca toni has proved to be that man .
lauded by none other than bayern striking legend gerd mueller , who believes toni is the player to beat his long-standing 40-goals-in-a-season record , the italian is seen by many in munich as the type of target man the club has been missing for years .
the former fiorentina forward has fired bayern to the cusp of a 21st title , combined with the livewire ribery to win the dfb cup for munich , and has scored 10 goals so far in a uefa cup campaign , which has seen the german side reach the semi-finals .
after a journeyman career which has taken him through ten teams , toni now looks at home .
munich lucky to have luca bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the italian job : toni has had a smash-and-grab season " he 's a world-class striker .
he 's got an amazing instinct for goals , " said bayern coach ottmar hitzfeld , barely containing his enthusiasm for toni .
" he always believes he can score two or three goals in each match .
he 's never satisfied and always hungry for more goals .
he 's a real winner , a leader on our team . "
however , the combination of the frenchman and the italian , the plaudits that follow them and the silverware they look destined to win together , disguise the fact that munich 's german stars have failed to set the league alight this season .
klose has been dogged by injury as the season entered its critical phase .
even when he played , he failed to maintain the form he displayed in the campaign 's opening salvos after moving from werder bremen in the summer .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : podolski and klose enjoy a happier moment together podolski has proved to be an asset from the bench , scoring important goals in substitute cameos , but has also failed to establish himself as a first team regular since his arrival from cologne in 2006 .
he remains behind toni and klose in the battle to start up front for bayern despite maintaining his clinical streak for the national team .
another german acquisition , jan schlaudraff , failed to even make it to the end of the season before being offloaded .
schlaudraff , who moved to bayern from alemannia aachen last summer for 1.2 million euros , completed a move to fellow bundesliga club hanover in april after a frustrating campaign in the lower reaches of the club 's pecking order .
the disappointment of their german stars and the 70-odd million euros they handed out almost a year ago will all be forgotten by the fans and the management alike , if bayern munich can complete their resurrection with a league , cup and european treble .

here was the richest club in german soccer splashing the cash in a bid to regain control of a league they usually dominated but had recently lost their power over .
rivals scoffed at the gifts the bayern hierarchy had lavished on themselves .
despite accomplished performances for marseille and the french national team , ribery was seen as not much more than a player trading on the promise of greatness unfulfilled .
toni , while a world cup winner with italy and a prolific club marksman , had made his impact in mid-table serie a sides .
but he had been overlooked by the likes of domestic powerhouses like the milan clubs and juventus , when it came to snapping up a reliable scorer .
if anything , the transfer of klose , somewhat overshadowed by munich 's expensive european shopping spree , was seen as the most serious statement of intent for the season ahead .
and yet , looking back over a season which has seen bayern reemerge as the bundesliga 's top dog , klose has joined lukas podolski as one of the club 's more disappointing acquisitions .
franck and luca justify the summer spending bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : toni and ribery embodied bayern 's intent to conquer so , far from being a vulgar display of extravagance with little business acumen behind it , the purchase of ribery and toni in particular has proved to be the coup of the season , as the italian 's 35 goals in 41 games has shown alongside the frenchman 's utter dominance and guile .
the french midfielder only underlined his role as the top attraction of the bundesliga last sunday , when he came off the bench to score twice in a 4-1 demolition of vfb stuttgart with which munich effectively clinched another league title .
italian team-mate toni may almost be more valuable for munich with his 21 goals in the league , but it is ribery who has electrified the fans with a skill not seen in the german top flight for years .
" there was something like a circus atmosphere when ribery came on , " said munich chairman karl-heinz rummenigge .
" the fans really get a treat here . "
the frenchman , the most expensive player in munich history at 25 million euros , has been an instant hit and has even managed to get opposing fans on their feet - something rarely achieved as munich are either loved or hated .
ribery adds french flair to german efficiency bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ribery has brought excitement to bayern munich and while the summer spending was intended to bring the title back to the allianz arena , it was also money spent in a bid to bring entertainment to the fans .
for all bayern 's success , they have rarely been the most exciting and aesthetic of teams , preferring to grind opponents into defeat with a ruthless efficiency rather than to play their opposition off the park .
for all the excitement ribery brings to the team , it would all be for nothing if there was n't a striker at the end of the beautiful moves to put the ball in the net and luca toni has proved to be that man .
lauded by none other than bayern striking legend gerd mueller , who believes toni is the player to beat his long-standing 40-goals-in-a-season record , the italian is seen by many in munich as the type of target man the club has been missing for years .
the former fiorentina forward has fired bayern to the cusp of a 21st title , combined with the livewire ribery to win the dfb cup for munich , and has scored 10 goals so far in a uefa cup campaign , which has seen the german side reach the semi-finals .
after a journeyman career which has taken him through ten teams , toni now looks at home .
munich lucky to have luca bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the italian job : toni has had a smash-and-grab season " he 's a world-class striker .
he 's got an amazing instinct for goals , " said bayern coach ottmar hitzfeld , barely containing his enthusiasm for toni .
" he always believes he can score two or three goals in each match .
he 's never satisfied and always hungry for more goals .
he 's a real winner , a leader on our team . "
however , the combination of the frenchman and the italian , the plaudits that follow them and the silverware they look destined to win together , disguise the fact that munich 's german stars have failed to set the league alight this season .
klose has been dogged by injury as the season entered its critical phase .
even when he played , he failed to maintain the form he displayed in the campaign 's opening salvos after moving from werder bremen in the summer .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : podolski and klose enjoy a happier moment together podolski has proved to be an asset from the bench , scoring important goals in substitute cameos , but has also failed to establish himself as a first team regular since his arrival from cologne in 2006 .
he remains behind toni and klose in the battle to start up front for bayern despite maintaining his clinical streak for the national team .
another german acquisition , jan schlaudraff , failed to even make it to the end of the season before being offloaded .
schlaudraff , who moved to bayern from alemannia aachen last summer for 1.2 million euros , completed a move to fellow bundesliga club hanover in april after a frustrating campaign in the lower reaches of the club 's pecking order .
the disappointment of their german stars and the 70-odd million euros they handed out almost a year ago will all be forgotten by the fans and the management alike , if bayern munich can complete their resurrection with a league , cup and european treble .
ribery and toni will then look like the bargains of the season . nick amies send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

despite accomplished performances for marseille and the french national team , ribery was seen as not much more than a player trading on the promise of greatness unfulfilled .
toni , while a world cup winner with italy and a prolific club marksman , had made his impact in mid-table serie a sides .
but he had been overlooked by the likes of domestic powerhouses like the milan clubs and juventus , when it came to snapping up a reliable scorer .
if anything , the transfer of klose , somewhat overshadowed by munich 's expensive european shopping spree , was seen as the most serious statement of intent for the season ahead .
and yet , looking back over a season which has seen bayern reemerge as the bundesliga 's top dog , klose has joined lukas podolski as one of the club 's more disappointing acquisitions .
franck and luca justify the summer spending bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : toni and ribery embodied bayern 's intent to conquer so , far from being a vulgar display of extravagance with little business acumen behind it , the purchase of ribery and toni in particular has proved to be the coup of the season , as the italian 's 35 goals in 41 games has shown alongside the frenchman 's utter dominance and guile .
the french midfielder only underlined his role as the top attraction of the bundesliga last sunday , when he came off the bench to score twice in a 4-1 demolition of vfb stuttgart with which munich effectively clinched another league title .
italian team-mate toni may almost be more valuable for munich with his 21 goals in the league , but it is ribery who has electrified the fans with a skill not seen in the german top flight for years .
" there was something like a circus atmosphere when ribery came on , " said munich chairman karl-heinz rummenigge .
" the fans really get a treat here . "
the frenchman , the most expensive player in munich history at 25 million euros , has been an instant hit and has even managed to get opposing fans on their feet - something rarely achieved as munich are either loved or hated .
ribery adds french flair to german efficiency bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ribery has brought excitement to bayern munich and while the summer spending was intended to bring the title back to the allianz arena , it was also money spent in a bid to bring entertainment to the fans .
for all bayern 's success , they have rarely been the most exciting and aesthetic of teams , preferring to grind opponents into defeat with a ruthless efficiency rather than to play their opposition off the park .
for all the excitement ribery brings to the team , it would all be for nothing if there was n't a striker at the end of the beautiful moves to put the ball in the net and luca toni has proved to be that man .
lauded by none other than bayern striking legend gerd mueller , who believes toni is the player to beat his long-standing 40-goals-in-a-season record , the italian is seen by many in munich as the type of target man the club has been missing for years .
the former fiorentina forward has fired bayern to the cusp of a 21st title , combined with the livewire ribery to win the dfb cup for munich , and has scored 10 goals so far in a uefa cup campaign , which has seen the german side reach the semi-finals .
after a journeyman career which has taken him through ten teams , toni now looks at home .
munich lucky to have luca bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the italian job : toni has had a smash-and-grab season " he 's a world-class striker .
he 's got an amazing instinct for goals , " said bayern coach ottmar hitzfeld , barely containing his enthusiasm for toni .
" he always believes he can score two or three goals in each match .
he 's never satisfied and always hungry for more goals .
he 's a real winner , a leader on our team . "
however , the combination of the frenchman and the italian , the plaudits that follow them and the silverware they look destined to win together , disguise the fact that munich 's german stars have failed to set the league alight this season .
klose has been dogged by injury as the season entered its critical phase .
even when he played , he failed to maintain the form he displayed in the campaign 's opening salvos after moving from werder bremen in the summer .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : podolski and klose enjoy a happier moment together podolski has proved to be an asset from the bench , scoring important goals in substitute cameos , but has also failed to establish himself as a first team regular since his arrival from cologne in 2006 .
he remains behind toni and klose in the battle to start up front for bayern despite maintaining his clinical streak for the national team .
another german acquisition , jan schlaudraff , failed to even make it to the end of the season before being offloaded .
schlaudraff , who moved to bayern from alemannia aachen last summer for 1.2 million euros , completed a move to fellow bundesliga club hanover in april after a frustrating campaign in the lower reaches of the club 's pecking order .
the disappointment of their german stars and the 70-odd million euros they handed out almost a year ago will all be forgotten by the fans and the management alike , if bayern munich can complete their resurrection with a league , cup and european treble .
ribery and toni will then look like the bargains of the season . nick amies send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?
dw-world.de breitner : bayern will become one of world 's top three teams former german national team player and world cup winner paul breitner , now a consultant for bayern munich , told dw-world.de about the future prospects of the team that has won more titles than any other in germany .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de finance -pipe- 29.04.2008 financial market crisis catches up with deutsche bank großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : deutsche bank has , until now , escaped relatively unscathed from the current crisis asset write-downs and the global slump in financial markets have been blamed for deutsche bank 's first quarterly net loss in five years .
germany 's largest bank reported a net loss of 131 million euros . germany 's biggest bank reported a net loss of 131 million euros -lrb- $ 205 million -rrb- during the first three months of the year , dramatically reversing a 2.12-billion-euro-profit for the same period of 2007 , according to data released tuesday , april 29 . pretax earnings fell to a loss of 254 million euros from a profit of 3.16 billion euros , it added . the bank 's results were weighed down by 1.77 billion euros in mark-downs on leveraged loans and loan commitments and 885 million euros in mark-downs on commercial real estate loans and residential mortgage-backed securities . overall , the charges came to 2.7 billion euros , slightly higher than previously forecast .
deutsche had announced on april 1 that it anticipated first-quarter mark-downs of about 2.5 billion euros . deutsche has already warned that its 8.4-billion-euro profit target could be at risk as a result of additional write-downs and volatile financial markets . pressure makes its mark on deutsche bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : reason to be cheerful ? deutsche 's josef ackermann " in the first quarter of this year , the financial market conditions were the most difficult in recent memory , " said deutsche bank head josef ackermann announcing the results .
" in the month of march , pressure on the banking sector was more intense than at any time since the current credit downturn began . " the international banking sector has been in turmoil since the united states market for high risk , or subprime , mortgages collapsed in mid 2007 .
deutsche bank has faired better than many of its rivals in recent months as the fallout from the crisis has engulfed banks around the world notably in switzerland and on wall street . despite enjoying a first-quarter earnings boost driven by the 854 million euros generated by the sale of stakes in companies including german carmaker daimler ag and insurer allianz ag , and by a 113-million-euro tax gain , the financial turmoil resulting from the subprime upheaval has eventually hit deutsche bank 's key investment banking business . announcing its results , the bank said its investment banking operations posted a 1.6 billion-euro pretax loss during the first three months of the year . at the same time , the bank said revenue from market trading and debt dived by 61 percent to 1.3 billion euros . ikb posts massive loss in further blow bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : these are dark times for the board of the ikb in another blow to the german banking sector , the ailing ikb deutsche industriebank announced it had 1 billion euros in the first half of its financial year on the back of numerous write-downs that led to its bailout last year . the german lender , one of those badly hit by the us subprime crisis , did not provide figures for its six-month results a year earlier .
the current result was for the period from april 1 to sept .
30 , 2007 . despite the half-year loss , ikb confirmed tuesday it that it expects to earn 200 million euros in the 2008 financial year . ikb , which lends to small and medium-sized german companies , has been battered by the subprime crisis since last summer , when its chief executive resigned . in march , german stock market operator deutsche boerse suspended trading in ikb shares after the bank revealed that it did not expect to post a significant profit for the foreseeable future . the decision came after an auction of most of ikb 's 3 billion euro portfolio of risky securities had been suspended due to a lack of satisfactory bids . in february , the german government - which owns a 38-percent stake through the kfw , a state-owned bank set up after world war ii to help fund reconstruction - stepped in to prop up ikb , putting up 1 billion euros of a 1.5-billion-euro rescue package to prevent the crisis spreading to the rest of the country 's banking sector . on top of all that , ikb was hit by an investigation into possible insider trading earlier this month . dw staff / dpa -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

ban also cited as another urgent priority support for farmers so as to " ensure food for tomorrow . " " in order to take this forward we have agreed to establish a un task force on global food crisis that i will chair and will bring together heads of specialized agencies and ... institutions into effective and coordinated mechanisms , " he said . escalation in prices drives crisis a un statement regarding the food crisis stated that the dramatic escalation in worldwide food prices has evolved into an unprecedented challenge of global proportions and added that crisis was having a large effect on " the world 's most vulnerable , including the urban poor .

" world food program head josette sheeran told reporters : " we have pledges of 471 million , but only 18 million is cash in hand .
we ca n't procure food until we have cash in hand .

" though we have seen wheat prices fall over the last few days , rice and corn prices are likely to remain high , and wheat relatively so , " world bank president robert zoellick told journalists . both zoellick and ban urged leaders not to ban food exports , since this would make the problem worse . " we are urging countries not to use export bans , " zoellick said .
" these controls encourage hoarding , drive up prices and hurt the poorest people around the world who are struggling to feed themselves . " pascal lamy , the director-general of the world trade organization -lrb- wto -rrb- , said the crisis was another urgent reason to conclude the doha round of trade talks to open up world trade , an attempt to liberalize trade in food and other goods and services by cutting tariffs and subsidies .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de bundesliga -pipe- 29.04.2008 bayern 's extravagant spending reaps its reward großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ribery and toni have silenced those who believed their transfer fees were exhorbitant anyone who says money ca n't buy happiness should take a look at the ecstatic faces of bayern munich 's supporters in the coming weeks before making a thorough reappraisal of that statement . when the bavarian giants shelled out 70 million euros -lrb- $ 109.4 million -rrb- for french midfielder franck ribery and italian striker luca toni , plus german international striker miroslav klose , in the summer , everyone who was n't a munich fan turned their noses up at the ostentatious frivolity of it all .
here was the richest club in german soccer splashing the cash in a bid to regain control of a league they usually dominated but had recently lost their power over .
rivals scoffed at the gifts the bayern hierarchy had lavished on themselves .
despite accomplished performances for marseille and the french national team , ribery was seen as not much more than a player trading on the promise of greatness unfulfilled .
toni , while a world cup winner with italy and a prolific club marksman , had made his impact in mid-table serie a sides .
but he had been overlooked by the likes of domestic powerhouses like the milan clubs and juventus , when it came to snapping up a reliable scorer .
if anything , the transfer of klose , somewhat overshadowed by munich 's expensive european shopping spree , was seen as the most serious statement of intent for the season ahead .
and yet , looking back over a season which has seen bayern reemerge as the bundesliga 's top dog , klose has joined lukas podolski as one of the club 's more disappointing acquisitions .
franck and luca justify the summer spending bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : toni and ribery embodied bayern 's intent to conquer so , far from being a vulgar display of extravagance with little business acumen behind it , the purchase of ribery and toni in particular has proved to be the coup of the season , as the italian 's 35 goals in 41 games has shown alongside the frenchman 's utter dominance and guile .
the french midfielder only underlined his role as the top attraction of the bundesliga last sunday , when he came off the bench to score twice in a 4-1 demolition of vfb stuttgart with which munich effectively clinched another league title .
italian team-mate toni may almost be more valuable for munich with his 21 goals in the league , but it is ribery who has electrified the fans with a skill not seen in the german top flight for years .
" there was something like a circus atmosphere when ribery came on , " said munich chairman karl-heinz rummenigge .
" the fans really get a treat here . "
the frenchman , the most expensive player in munich history at 25 million euros , has been an instant hit and has even managed to get opposing fans on their feet - something rarely achieved as munich are either loved or hated .
ribery adds french flair to german efficiency bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ribery has brought excitement to bayern munich and while the summer spending was intended to bring the title back to the allianz arena , it was also money spent in a bid to bring entertainment to the fans .
for all bayern 's success , they have rarely been the most exciting and aesthetic of teams , preferring to grind opponents into defeat with a ruthless efficiency rather than to play their opposition off the park .
for all the excitement ribery brings to the team , it would all be for nothing if there was n't a striker at the end of the beautiful moves to put the ball in the net and luca toni has proved to be that man .
lauded by none other than bayern striking legend gerd mueller , who believes toni is the player to beat his long-standing 40-goals-in-a-season record , the italian is seen by many in munich as the type of target man the club has been missing for years .
the former fiorentina forward has fired bayern to the cusp of a 21st title , combined with the livewire ribery to win the dfb cup for munich , and has scored 10 goals so far in a uefa cup campaign , which has seen the german side reach the semi-finals .
after a journeyman career which has taken him through ten teams , toni now looks at home .
munich lucky to have luca bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the italian job : toni has had a smash-and-grab season " he 's a world-class striker .
he 's got an amazing instinct for goals , " said bayern coach ottmar hitzfeld , barely containing his enthusiasm for toni .
" he always believes he can score two or three goals in each match .
he 's never satisfied and always hungry for more goals .
he 's a real winner , a leader on our team . "
however , the combination of the frenchman and the italian , the plaudits that follow them and the silverware they look destined to win together , disguise the fact that munich 's german stars have failed to set the league alight this season .
klose has been dogged by injury as the season entered its critical phase .
even when he played , he failed to maintain the form he displayed in the campaign 's opening salvos after moving from werder bremen in the summer .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : podolski and klose enjoy a happier moment together podolski has proved to be an asset from the bench , scoring important goals in substitute cameos , but has also failed to establish himself as a first team regular since his arrival from cologne in 2006 .
he remains behind toni and klose in the battle to start up front for bayern despite maintaining his clinical streak for the national team .
another german acquisition , jan schlaudraff , failed to even make it to the end of the season before being offloaded .
schlaudraff , who moved to bayern from alemannia aachen last summer for 1.2 million euros , completed a move to fellow bundesliga club hanover in april after a frustrating campaign in the lower reaches of the club 's pecking order .
the disappointment of their german stars and the 70-odd million euros they handed out almost a year ago will all be forgotten by the fans and the management alike , if bayern munich can complete their resurrection with a league , cup and european treble .
ribery and toni will then look like the bargains of the season . nick amies send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de southern europe -pipe- 29.04.2008 italy 's parliament ushers in new berlusconi era großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : italy 's " happiest man " italy 's parliament got down to business after the recent victory for silvio berlusconi 's center-right party .
the strong showing will make it easier for berlusconi to push through reforms . the first official item on the italian senate agenda was to elect a speaker .
in the rough-and-tumble world of italian politics , this is usually a drawn-out , contentious decision .
yet renato schifani sailed through the approval process on tuesday , april 29 .
the selection of the long-time berlusconi aid was the first indication that conservatives have consolidated their power and will not be stopped by the fragmentation that plagued past italian governments .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : center-right parties have a clear parliamentary majority berlusconi 's center-right won a solid victory in the april 13-14 elections , with small parties and the extreme left and right losing seats .
the result has left the senate divided into fairly clean-cut majority and minority camps .
berlusconi , a 71-year-old media tycoon , won the recent national elections in italy by a surprisingly wide margin , claiming the prime minister 's office for the third time .
and on monday , his ally gianni alemanno was elected mayor of rome - the first conservative to win the post in 15 years .
" i am the happiest man in all of italy , " berlusconi said on monday .
italian-style politics bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : italy 's left could n't defeat berlusconi yet schifani 's easy election did not leave italy without its traditional political grandstanding .
the leader of the federalist and anti-immigration northern league , umberto bossi , brought some color to proceedings , when , ignoring his ally berlusconi 's recent pleas not to use inflammatory language , he issued a warning to the center-left minority .
" i do n't know what the left wants , but if they are looking for a clash , i have 300,000 men " ready to mobilize , bossi said , adding that the northern leagues ' " guns are always warm " to blast through federalist reforms if necessary .
the northern league did even better than expected and bossi is thought to be a possible reforms minister in berlusconi 's future cabinet .
berlusconi in full control bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : voters handed berlusconi a clear victory the lower chamber of deputies is expected to follow the senate 's lead and elect a berlusconi supporter as its speaker on wednesday .
gianfranco fini , leader of the post-fascist national alliance , is expected to win the post .
his party merged with berlusconi 's people of freedom for the elections .
once both speakers have been sworn in , president giorgio napolitano will hold consultations with all parliamentary groups and then formally ask berlusconi to form a government .
the government will then have to be approved with confidence votes in both houses of parliament - a process which is expected to be completed by the end of next week .
berlusconi has said he will use his win to push through electoral reforms and an ambitious economic agenda . dw staff -lrb- th -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

merkel calls on brazil to make biofuel production sustainable german minister calls for reversal of eu agricultural policy germany defends biofuels , hedges bets on energy goals illegal logging gives eu massive eco-headache environment -pipe- 29.04.2008 as biofuels fall from grace , a new generation grabs spotlight großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a second-generation biofuel production facility - the new climate savior ?
biofuels made from food crops were once seen as an environmental savior .
but not anymore .
now politicians and experts hope a new generation of green fuels will be a powerful weapon against climate change . there is an old saying : if it sounds too good to be true , it probably is .
when it comes to biofuels made from crops such as wheat , corn or rapeseed , many are saying that adage fits like a glove . biofuels were once seen as a near perfect tool to reduce emissions from cars and trucks .
while cars would still spew out greenhouse gases , if they ran on biofuel , at least the plants that made their fuel would have soaked up co2 while they were growing .
" in the beginning , it sounded very good , " said dietmar oeliger , a traffic policy expert at the german environmental group nabu .
" you did n't have to change your cars or your life system .
instead of using fossil fuels , you take something different and everything can stay the same . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : people worry that farmers are growing crops for fuel instead of food problem is , he added , it did n't work out the way it was planned .
despite huge government subsidies from eu countries to push biofuels - around 2.6 billion euros in tax subsidies in the eu in 2006 - their green credentials turned out to be questionable at best .
according to a report entitled " biofuels : is the cure worse than the disease ? " by the organization for economic cooperation and development -lrb- oecd -rrb- , conventional biofuel technology provides greenhouse gas reductions of less than 40 percent , which when other factors are taken into account , means that biofuels ' disadvantages can often outweigh the benefits .
" if you take the whole production process into account with some of them , the use of land , water , fertilizer , etc . , they do n't perform very well in mitigating co2 emissions , " said michael zirpel of the international transport forum , part of the oecd .
" some are even worse than fossil fuels . "
a serious rethink european countries are beginning to rethink their biofuels enthusiasm and are rolling back some of their generous subsidies .
the eu is also starting to reconsider its commitment to these so-called first-generation biofuels .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : pump with biodiesel from rapeseed recent reports have linked rising food prices and rainforest production to biofuels , as farmers grow crops for fuel instead for human consumption .
the un special rapporteur for the right to food jean ziegler even called large-scale production of biofuels " a crime against humanity . "
the eu 's once highly touted goal of having 10 percent of transportation powered by biofuels by 2020 is no longer set in stone , since brussels did not foresee the problems that could arise .
" biofuels were at the center of praise at the beginning , and now they 're in the center of criticism , " said barbara helfferich , spokeswoman for eu environment commissioner stavros dimas .
" now it 's not biofuels in and of themselves , it 's what kind of biofuels and how we produce them . "
hopes for the second-generation as politicians and policy makers begin toning down their tributes to first-generation biofuels , they 're not giving up on the concept altogether .
what did n't work the first time around , the thinking seems to be , might succeed on a second try .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : car manufacturers are especially eager to see second-generation biofuels a reality in a small town about a half-hour 's drive from dresden , some leading political and industry leaders gathered recently .
german chancellor angela merkel was there , along with daimler ceo dieter zetsche , volkswagen boss martin winterkorn and rob routs , a high-ranking executive at shell .
they 've gathered at what choren industries claims is the “ the world 's first commercial production plant to convert biomass into synthetic diesel fuel . ”
instead of using rapeseed , wheat or corn , chroen will use forest residue and waste wood to produce its sun diesel , which it claims is head and shoulders above anything on the market today .
" we would be triple a if judged by moody 's , " said tom blades , head of choren .
" compared to fossil fuels , we actually lower the co2 emissions in the product lifecycle by over 90 percent . " it is an enticing claim and one which industry leaders , particular from the german car industry , are eager to support .
they are already under pressure to reduce their emissions to abide by european union guidelines and merkel 's government is reported to be waging a rearguard campaign to delay implementation , reduce penalties and ease the burden on the country 's luxury automotive industry .
second-generation fuels could help the car industry meet climate-protection goals without it having to make too many sacrifices .
could work , maybe " synthetic fuels from biomass have the potential - and we 're still talking about potential - to become a central pillar in climate-friendly energy supply , " said angela merkel . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : biodiesel manufactuer choren but the word " potential " is key here , since second-generation biofuels are not yet proven , nor market ready .
according to the oecd , it remains to be seen whether these new fuels will become economically viable over the next decade , if ever .
they will need large-scale subsidies for the foreseeable future .
high costs are still a major factor .
there are logistical challenges of transporting biomass material to large production facilities , which could impose a floor on costs that would be difficult to lower .
and there is the land issue .
for large-scale production , there are fears that farmers would be tempted to turn fields over to tree plantations for second-generation biofuels instead of wheat or rice fields - a scenario which , again , could affect food availability .
dieter oelig of the environmental group nabu worries that there is too much focus on this new generation of fuel , and not enough on energy or automobile efficiency and other strategies that could be put in place now .
" maybe in 20 or 30 years or 40 years , we have a big potential -lrb- for second-generation biofuels -rrb- , if they work , " he said .
" but in 40 years , we need to have a lot of answers that are clear .
otherwise , we 'll have a very big problem . " kyle james send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

but the balkan country will have to convince its eu partners and its own countrymen that it 's ready to join the bloc . the stabilization and association agreement -lrb- saa -rrb- , a precursor to full eu membership talks , was signed on tuesday , april 29 , by the eu foreign ministers and serbia 's deputy prime minister bozidar djelic in the presence of the serbian president , boris tadic . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : djelic -lrb- left -rrb- , tadic , solana and rupel were happy that the job was done europe hopes that the deal will boost serbia 's pro-european parties ahead of an upcoming parliamentary vote . but first , the ex-yugoslav country will have to show it is fully cooperating with the international war crimes tribunal in the hague .
eu states will not ratify the pact , nor will serbia get any trade or other benefits until this condition is met . the saa sent " a strong signal to serbia to join us , to come to the eu , " said slovenian foreign minister dimitrij rupel , who chaired the council meeting of eu foreign ministers in luxembourg where the decision was made . serbian foreign minister vuk jeremic , a pro-european member of the government , called the saa agreement historic and said the decision signaled " an important political statement " which will open the doors to serbia 's eu membership . " we believe we are irreversibly on the road to eu membership , " he told reporters . serbia must hand over war criminals bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : opinions about the eu are divided in serbia the saa helps aspiring eu candidates to meet the strict standards necessary for eventual membership in the bloc .
serbia will be asked to carry out various political , judicial and economic reforms . in return , the eu will offer a series of benefits , including financial assistance , free trade deals and the relaxation of visa rules . tuesday 's diplomatic breakthrough came after the netherlands and belgium said they would no longer oppose the serbian saa .
both countries had blocked the agreement because they felt belgrade was not fully cooperating with the hague tribunal . the netherlands and belgium agreed to sign the saa on the condition that serbia handed over all remaining war-crime suspects .
the most notorious criminal is ratko mladic , the bosnian-serb general indicted for genocide and crimes against humanity .
he is accused of orchestrating the 1995 srebrenica massacre of 8,000 bosniaks . mladic is believed to be hiding in serbia . " the netherlands and belgium have been very flexible and put forward several proposals , because we want to give the serb people a signal that we care about them and that their future is in europe , " dutch foreign minister maxime verhagen had said ahead of the luxembourg meeting . elections unlikely to produce clear mandate bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : serbians rioted after kosovo independence eu officials hope that the prompt signing of the saa might give other pro-european parties an edge over ultra-nationalist rivals in the may 11 parliamentary elections . less than three months ago serbians re-elected pro-european president boris tadic .
yet tadic 's democratic party has been unable to hold together a coalition in parliament , leading to snap elections . while the ultra-nationalist serbian radical party -lrb- srs -rrb- was leading tadic 's democratic party slightly in the polls , neither party was expected to win a clear majority .
it 's thought that current prime minister vojislav kostunica will be the king maker in the upcoming elections . kostunica formed an uneasy coalition with tadic 's party , which collapsed in march .
kostunica 's increasingly nationalistic democratic party of serbia was enraged by what it sees as tadic 's acceptance of kosovo 's recent declaration of independence .
kosovo , a predominantly ethnic-albanian province , split from belgrade on feb .
17 . kostunica is nominally in favor of serbia joining the eu , but only on the condition that the 27-member block recognizes kosovo as part of serbia . serbian parties could nix agreement bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : kostunica has opposed the agreement the saa would become binding for belgrade only once it is ratified by the new parliament . kostunica has condemned the agreement , saying that it recognizes kosovo 's independence and calling it " an act against the state and against the constitution . " tadic disagreed , calling the saa an " economic agreement which can not in any way endanger the sovereignty and territorial integrity of serbia . " eu ministers also indicated they will offer an saa to bosnia-herzegovina , which has been less controversial than the serbia agreement . dw staff -lrb- th -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

replacement candidates will face some steep competition from wagner 's two daughters , said to be favorites . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : wolfgang wagner has been in charge of bayreuth since 1951 wagner is resigning as director of the bayreuth festival , officials said on tuesday , april 29 .
the prestigious annual event celebrates the music of his grandfather richard wagner .
wagner has headed the renowned festival since 1951 .
yet with wagner turning 89 on august 30 , he decided it was time to retire .
no replacement for wagner has been announced .
bayreuth officials said that interested candidates have four months to apply .
the festival has been at the center of a decades-long family feud over who will succeed the increasingly frail elder wagner .
sisterly duet bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the festival has become a major celebrity event wagner recently hinted that he could imagine his estranged daughter eva wagner-pasquier , 63 , teaming up with her half-sister katharina wagner , 29 , to run the festival jointly .
the half-sisters were called on by the festival board to devise a joint proposal for the future of the festival as soon as possible .
yet the two half sisters are known to have a strained relationship .
the festival board ordered wagner to hand over the reigns to eva in 2001 .
but the two have not been on speaking terms since wolfgang divorced eva 's mother ellen drexel in 1976 to marry gudrun wagner .
founded in 1876 by richard wagner , the festival has become an opera spectacle of legendary proportions .
performances are sold out years in advance with top german socialites and politicians attending .

now politicians and experts hope a new generation of green fuels will be a powerful weapon against climate change . there is an old saying : if it sounds too good to be true , it probably is .
when it comes to biofuels made from crops such as wheat , corn or rapeseed , many are saying that adage fits like a glove . biofuels were once seen as a near perfect tool to reduce emissions from cars and trucks .
while cars would still spew out greenhouse gases , if they ran on biofuel , at least the plants that made their fuel would have soaked up co2 while they were growing .
" in the beginning , it sounded very good , " said dietmar oeliger , a traffic policy expert at the german environmental group nabu .
" you did n't have to change your cars or your life system .
instead of using fossil fuels , you take something different and everything can stay the same . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : people worry that farmers are growing crops for fuel instead of food problem is , he added , it did n't work out the way it was planned .
despite huge government subsidies from eu countries to push biofuels - around 2.6 billion euros in tax subsidies in the eu in 2006 - their green credentials turned out to be questionable at best .
according to a report entitled " biofuels : is the cure worse than the disease ? " by the organization for economic cooperation and development -lrb- oecd -rrb- , conventional biofuel technology provides greenhouse gas reductions of less than 40 percent , which when other factors are taken into account , means that biofuels ' disadvantages can often outweigh the benefits .
" if you take the whole production process into account with some of them , the use of land , water , fertilizer , etc . , they do n't perform very well in mitigating co2 emissions , " said michael zirpel of the international transport forum , part of the oecd .
" some are even worse than fossil fuels . "
a serious rethink european countries are beginning to rethink their biofuels enthusiasm and are rolling back some of their generous subsidies .
the eu is also starting to reconsider its commitment to these so-called first-generation biofuels .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : pump with biodiesel from rapeseed recent reports have linked rising food prices and rainforest production to biofuels , as farmers grow crops for fuel instead for human consumption .
the un special rapporteur for the right to food jean ziegler even called large-scale production of biofuels " a crime against humanity . "
the eu 's once highly touted goal of having 10 percent of transportation powered by biofuels by 2020 is no longer set in stone , since brussels did not foresee the problems that could arise .
" biofuels were at the center of praise at the beginning , and now they 're in the center of criticism , " said barbara helfferich , spokeswoman for eu environment commissioner stavros dimas .
" now it 's not biofuels in and of themselves , it 's what kind of biofuels and how we produce them . "
hopes for the second-generation as politicians and policy makers begin toning down their tributes to first-generation biofuels , they 're not giving up on the concept altogether .
what did n't work the first time around , the thinking seems to be , might succeed on a second try .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : car manufacturers are especially eager to see second-generation biofuels a reality in a small town about a half-hour 's drive from dresden , some leading political and industry leaders gathered recently .
german chancellor angela merkel was there , along with daimler ceo dieter zetsche , volkswagen boss martin winterkorn and rob routs , a high-ranking executive at shell .
they 've gathered at what choren industries claims is the “ the world 's first commercial production plant to convert biomass into synthetic diesel fuel . ”
instead of using rapeseed , wheat or corn , chroen will use forest residue and waste wood to produce its sun diesel , which it claims is head and shoulders above anything on the market today .
" we would be triple a if judged by moody 's , " said tom blades , head of choren .
" compared to fossil fuels , we actually lower the co2 emissions in the product lifecycle by over 90 percent . " it is an enticing claim and one which industry leaders , particular from the german car industry , are eager to support .
they are already under pressure to reduce their emissions to abide by european union guidelines and merkel 's government is reported to be waging a rearguard campaign to delay implementation , reduce penalties and ease the burden on the country 's luxury automotive industry .
second-generation fuels could help the car industry meet climate-protection goals without it having to make too many sacrifices .
could work , maybe " synthetic fuels from biomass have the potential - and we 're still talking about potential - to become a central pillar in climate-friendly energy supply , " said angela merkel . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : biodiesel manufactuer choren but the word " potential " is key here , since second-generation biofuels are not yet proven , nor market ready .
according to the oecd , it remains to be seen whether these new fuels will become economically viable over the next decade , if ever .
they will need large-scale subsidies for the foreseeable future .
high costs are still a major factor .
there are logistical challenges of transporting biomass material to large production facilities , which could impose a floor on costs that would be difficult to lower .
and there is the land issue .
for large-scale production , there are fears that farmers would be tempted to turn fields over to tree plantations for second-generation biofuels instead of wheat or rice fields - a scenario which , again , could affect food availability .
dieter oelig of the environmental group nabu worries that there is too much focus on this new generation of fuel , and not enough on energy or automobile efficiency and other strategies that could be put in place now .
" maybe in 20 or 30 years or 40 years , we have a big potential -lrb- for second-generation biofuels -rrb- , if they work , " he said .
" but in 40 years , we need to have a lot of answers that are clear .
otherwise , we 'll have a very big problem . " kyle james send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

don langford , head of customer services europe for american airlines , said the site suffered from lack of investment .
the airport - recently criticised for the chaos at the opening of terminal 5 - was " trying to put 10 pounds of sugar in a five-pound bag , " he told the bbc .
but heathrow operator baa said things were improving and it would invest £ 4bn over five years to improve the airport .
dozens of flights in and out of the new terminal 5 were cancelled on its opening day last month when luggage handling problems caused thousands of passengers to lose their bags . "
i would have to say that heathrow is in many ways the worst of all the airports that my company flies to in europe " don langford , american airlines mr langford said in a file on 4 investigation into the first day chaos at terminal 5 , that heathrow airport , " is not just bursting at the seams .
i think the seams have burst " .
american airlines claims to be the fourth largest carrier at heathrow in terms of available seats and flies out of terminal 3 , which mr langford called " a bit of a dump " .
he added : " it has suffered from lack of investment over a period of time .
" if you look at the fabric of the building , if you look at where customers check in - missing light bulbs , duct tape on the floor .
" i would have to say that heathrow is in many ways the worst of all the airports that my company flies to in europe . "
read a transcript of the programme -lrb- 74k -rrb- but baa 's corporate affairs director tom kelly told the bbc , " this is an airport which was designed for something like 45 million passengers - we have now got 65 million .
" we are investing £ 4bn over the next five years . you 've got to realise that if you are going to invest that kind of money it takes time to put things right . "
file on 4 was told that rehearsals for terminal 5 's big day had already revealed signs of problems .
and mick rix of the gmb union claimed the baggage system did not receive realistic enough tests prior to opening .
" i have been told that british airways had severe reservations about the software that is being used on the baggage handling system - they found out later that the software problems were such that if the system had been tested correctly and for long periods of use they would have been spotted , " he said .
one of 250 volunteers taking part in a dry run two weeks before the first working day , teacher sue knight from hillingdon , middlesex , spoke of the problems . "
it is very easy to be wise with hindsight " tom kelly , baa her group was told to pretend they were transferring from a flight arriving from manchester to a flight bound for america .
a bus would take them to another terminal .
the buses were supposed to pick up passengers every five minutes .
" a bus came after an hour and drove us around the terminal but by then we had missed the flight .
" i spoke to one lady who had been on the trial where she had been given luggage but had n't got it back . "
peter morris , chief economist of aviation consultancy ascend said the terminal 5 trials were on too small a scale .
however tom kelly of baa said critics of the dress rehearsals were being wise after the event .
' no mess ups ' " we did 18 months of pre-testing .
we had the services of some 17,000 volunteers and we processed literally thousands of bags .
" on any one day we had hundreds of people so we did test the system - i 'm afraid it is one of those situations where it is very easy to be wise with hindsight . "
both baa and british airways have been told been by the civil aviation authority -lrb- caa -rrb- to produce urgent reports on the terminal 5 problems .
harry bush , the caa 's head of economic regulation said : " we have said very clearly to both baa and ba we want to see the lessons-learned exercise conducted very quickly because the next stage of modernisation at heathrow is going to require a lot of different airline moves between the terminals at the east end of the airport .
he added : " we want to make sure the same mess-up does n't occur there . "

charity mind cymru says it hopes the training will raise awareness about mental health problems .
it aims to recruit and train 75 people across the country to become instructors who will deliver the course in their areas over the next year .
participants will learn about common mental health problems , including drugs , depression and self-harm , but they will not diagnose conditions .
the charity said one in four experienced mental health problems each year in britain .
one of mind cymru 's training managers , carol evans , said the course was a " wonderful concept to educate people " about the issues .

" i used to be a service user for some years as part of my recovery , " she said .
" i wanted to become involved with mind and i did a psychology degree with the open university . "
mentoring system the training is funded by the welsh assembly government and was developed in australia .
it is hoped it will attract workers from a variety of settings , voluntary and community groups , and workplaces .
these groups include the ambulance service , police forces and prison service , health and social care , staff in further and higher education .
ms evans said she hoped organisations would nominate people who would be able to spot symptoms and guide people to relevant organisations .
the training includes two days for the course , three days for development and two days for assessment .
there will be a mentoring system in place once training is completed .
the course runs in conjunction with the applied suicide intervention skills training -lrb- asist -rrb- programme which is also offered by mind .
the assembly government has set a target of a 10 % drop in suicides by 2012 .
the project has trained more than 400 people from more than 60 different organisations in wales during the past year .

for the playstation 3 and xbox 360 , grand theft auto 4 is the latest in the hugely successful crime series .
nintendo 's wii receives another innovative peripheral in the shape of the balance board for use with its new title , wii fit .
" they are targeting very different audiences , gta 4 is targeting adult audiences , probably what you would consider the more traditional gamer , whereas wii fit is aimed at the mass market , a family audience , probably somebody who would hope to do something less sedentary than just sitting down all of the time , " said phil elliott , editor of gamesindustry.biz.
developers rockstar games 's latest third-person crime caper , gta iv , unleashes niko bellic on the streets of liberty city , a barely disguised new york .
niko must steal cars , rob banks , take out rival criminals and generally cause chaos on the streets of this enormous metropolis .
liberty city is roughly the size of the real new york and the level of detail and the sheer scope of the game are breathtaking .
the gta series embodies the so-called sandbox genre , in which players can explore or perform missions in any order they like .
like gta games of old , niko can steal any vehicle the player takes a fancy to , from sports cars and suvs to speedboats and helicopters .
next-gen upgrades include improved visuals a completely new physics engine , online multiplayer and , weirdly , a mobile phone .
niko uses the phone and internet cafes to receive information on upcoming missions or to help maintain his relationships with his criminal cohorts .
the phone can also be used to invite associates out for drink , which leads to the onscreen characters ' drunken stumbling .
but all of this detail is icing on the cake , the real depth in this game is found in its gameplay .
fans of previous titles will be familiar with the formula of car chases , shootouts and general larceny .
while this latest remains true to its roots , the game has been refined and honed to such a degree that it makes most other third-person action titles seem hollow and empty in comparison .
due to the grand theft auto series themes of criminality and violence , these games have always been controversial , attracting the attention of politicians and the media alike .
however industry observers like neil long , editor of mcv magazine , are keen to point out the games ' adults-only 18-age rating .
he said : " there are a million films out there that are a lot more graphic in terms of violence .
like any other kind of adult content , video games are just another form of entertainment .
" the people that make these kind of statements , perhaps they do n't understand videogames and how they as an art form have matured .
it is an entertainment form to rival movies , music and tv and it should be considered in that way . "
despite the controversy surrounding this series , 70 million copies of the gta games have been sold worldwide .
as a result , sales expectations for this latest version are high , and mr long believes there could also be a knock-on effect for sony and microsoft .
" primarily it will push hardware sales up through the roof on the two formats it 's on .
microsoft have been very keen to own this launch in terms of putting a lot of marketing out there and cutting the price of xbox , microsoft 's message is , ' get gta iv for £ 200 ' .
" but at the same time gta is often considered a very playstation friendly series of games and it will be interesting to see which console benefits the most out of the title . "
in stark contrast , nintendo 's wii fit is an entirely different sort of game .
with the help of the balance board , players complete a number of different exercises ranging from yoga to hula-hoop spinning .
most of the exercises simply require the player to replicate instructions , which are provided via the onscreen virtual fitness trainer .
the addition of the balance board with this title pushes its cost up to a uk retail price of £ 70 .
the success of the wii and its motion sensitive controller has seen nintendo 's games appeal to entirely new markets and this fitness peripheral could further add to the wii 's appeal .
mr long said : " nintendo 's strategy is very much to bring non-gamers into the industry .
their ethos for a couple of years now is the gamer market is finite ; there are 10 times more non-gamers than there are existing gamers .
" that 's kind of nintendo 's mission at the moment and wii fit is very much an element of that . "
" wii fit will probably be the most important title for them of 2008 " phil elliot , gamesindustry.biz nintendo 's wii is the biggest selling console of this generation , but supply problems and a lack of compelling third-party titles could see a significant slow-down in the machine 's meteoric rise .
phil elliot , editor for gamesindustry.biz , thinks wii fit could help weather out poor third-party support .
he said : " wii fit for nintendo is the title that will respike and nudge the sales of the console back up again .
" as we have seen with the xbox 360 , microsoft have had a really good way of putting out key tittles throughout the life cycle of this console . "
he added : " wii fit will probably be the most important title for them of 2008 and crucially it is at a higher price point as well so it will be an interesting marker to see if people are prepared to pay the higher price point , and also how many people are interested in a fitness-based video game . "
so the biggest video games showdown of the year looks set to be played out between a game that endorses wholesale mayhem , and a title that encourages wholesome keep fit .

for the playstation 3 and xbox 360 , grand theft auto 4 is the latest in the hugely successful crime series .
nintendo 's wii receives another innovative peripheral in the shape of the balance board for use with its new title , wii fit .
" they are targeting very different audiences , gta 4 is targeting adult audiences , probably what you would consider the more traditional gamer , whereas wii fit is aimed at the mass market , a family audience , probably somebody who would hope to do something less sedentary than just sitting down all of the time , " said phil elliott , editor of gamesindustry.biz.
developers rockstar games 's latest third-person crime caper , gta iv , unleashes niko bellic on the streets of liberty city , a barely disguised new york .
niko must steal cars , rob banks , take out rival criminals and generally cause chaos on the streets of this enormous metropolis .
liberty city is roughly the size of the real new york and the level of detail and the sheer scope of the game are breathtaking .
the gta series embodies the so-called sandbox genre , in which players can explore or perform missions in any order they like .
like gta games of old , niko can steal any vehicle the player takes a fancy to , from sports cars and suvs to speedboats and helicopters .
next-gen upgrades include improved visuals a completely new physics engine , online multiplayer and , weirdly , a mobile phone .
niko uses the phone and internet cafes to receive information on upcoming missions or to help maintain his relationships with his criminal cohorts .
the phone can also be used to invite associates out for drink , which leads to the onscreen characters ' drunken stumbling .
rockstar have re-created new york in great detail but all of this detail is icing on the cake , the real depth in this game is found in its gameplay .
fans of previous titles will be familiar with the formula of car chases , shootouts and general larceny .
while this latest remains true to its roots , the game has been refined and honed to such a degree that it makes most other third-person action titles seem hollow and empty in comparison .
due to the grand theft auto series themes of criminality and violence , these games have always been controversial , attracting the attention of politicians and the media alike .
however industry observers like neil long , editor of mcv magazine , are keen to point out the games ' adults-only 18-age rating .
he said : " there are a million films out there that are a lot more graphic in terms of violence .
like any other kind of adult content , video games are just another form of entertainment .
" the people that make these kind of statements , perhaps they do n't understand videogames and how they as an art form have matured .
it is an entertainment form to rival movies , music and tv and it should be considered in that way . "
despite the controversy surrounding this series , 70 million copies of the gta games have been sold worldwide .
as a result , sales expectations for this latest version are high , and mr long believes there could also be a knock-on effect for sony and microsoft .
" primarily it will push hardware sales up through the roof on the two formats it 's on .
microsoft have been very keen to own this launch in terms of putting a lot of marketing out there and cutting the price of xbox , microsoft 's message is , ' get gta iv for £ 200 ' .
" but at the same time gta is often considered a very playstation friendly series of games and it will be interesting to see which console benefits the most out of the title . "
wii fit is being promoted for its healthy benefits in stark contrast , nintendo 's wii fit is an entirely different sort of game .
with the help of the balance board , players complete a number of different exercises ranging from yoga to hula-hoop spinning .
most of the exercises simply require the player to replicate instructions , which are provided via the onscreen virtual fitness trainer .
the addition of the balance board with this title pushes its cost up to a uk retail price of £ 70 .
the success of the wii and its motion sensitive controller has seen nintendo 's games appeal to entirely new markets and this fitness peripheral could further add to the wii 's appeal .
mr long said : " nintendo 's strategy is very much to bring non-gamers into the industry .
their ethos for a couple of years now is the gamer market is finite ; there are 10 times more non-gamers than there are existing gamers .
" that 's kind of nintendo 's mission at the moment and wii fit is very much an element of that . "
wii fit will probably be the most important title for them of 2008 phil elliot , gamesindustry.biz nintendo 's wii is the biggest selling console of this generation , but supply problems and a lack of compelling third-party titles could see a significant slow-down in the machine 's meteoric rise .
phil elliot , editor for gamesindustry.biz , thinks wii fit could help weather out poor third-party support .
he said : " wii fit for nintendo is the title that will respike and nudge the sales of the console back up again .
" as we have seen with the xbox 360 , microsoft have had a really good way of putting out key tittles throughout the life cycle of this console . "
he added : " wii fit will probably be the most important title for them of 2008 and crucially it is at a higher price point as well so it will be an interesting marker to see if people are prepared to pay the higher price point , and also how many people are interested in a fitness-based video game .

for the playstation 3 and xbox 360 , grand theft auto 4 is the latest in the hugely successful crime series .
nintendo 's wii receives another innovative peripheral in the shape of the balance board for use with its new title , wii fit .
" they are targeting very different audiences , gta 4 is targeting adult audiences , probably what you would consider the more traditional gamer , whereas wii fit is aimed at the mass market , a family audience , probably somebody who would hope to do something less sedentary than just sitting down all of the time , " said phil elliott , editor of gamesindustry.biz.
developers rockstar games 's latest third-person crime caper , gta iv , unleashes niko bellic on the streets of liberty city , a barely disguised new york .
niko must steal cars , rob banks , take out rival criminals and generally cause chaos on the streets of this enormous metropolis .
liberty city is roughly the size of the real new york and the level of detail and the sheer scope of the game are breathtaking .
the gta series embodies the so-called sandbox genre , in which players can explore or perform missions in any order they like .
like gta games of old , niko can steal any vehicle the player takes a fancy to , from sports cars and suvs to speedboats and helicopters .
next-gen upgrades include improved visuals a completely new physics engine , online multiplayer and , weirdly , a mobile phone .
niko uses the phone and internet cafes to receive information on upcoming missions or to help maintain his relationships with his criminal cohorts .
the phone can also be used to invite associates out for drink , which leads to the onscreen characters ' drunken stumbling .
rockstar have re-created new york in great detail but all of this detail is icing on the cake , the real depth in this game is found in its gameplay .
fans of previous titles will be familiar with the formula of car chases , shootouts and general larceny .
while this latest remains true to its roots , the game has been refined and honed to such a degree that it makes most other third-person action titles seem hollow and empty in comparison .
due to the grand theft auto series themes of criminality and violence , these games have always been controversial , attracting the attention of politicians and the media alike .
however industry observers like neil long , editor of mcv magazine , are keen to point out the games ' adults-only 18-age rating .
he said : " there are a million films out there that are a lot more graphic in terms of violence .
like any other kind of adult content , video games are just another form of entertainment .
" the people that make these kind of statements , perhaps they do n't understand videogames and how they as an art form have matured .
it is an entertainment form to rival movies , music and tv and it should be considered in that way . "
despite the controversy surrounding this series , 70 million copies of the gta games have been sold worldwide .
as a result , sales expectations for this latest version are high , and mr long believes there could also be a knock-on effect for sony and microsoft .
" primarily it will push hardware sales up through the roof on the two formats it 's on .
microsoft have been very keen to own this launch in terms of putting a lot of marketing out there and cutting the price of xbox , microsoft 's message is , ' get gta iv for £ 200 ' .
" but at the same time gta is often considered a very playstation friendly series of games and it will be interesting to see which console benefits the most out of the title . "
wii fit is being promoted for its healthy benefits in stark contrast , nintendo 's wii fit is an entirely different sort of game .
with the help of the balance board , players complete a number of different exercises ranging from yoga to hula-hoop spinning .
most of the exercises simply require the player to replicate instructions , which are provided via the onscreen virtual fitness trainer .
the addition of the balance board with this title pushes its cost up to a uk retail price of £ 70 .
the success of the wii and its motion sensitive controller has seen nintendo 's games appeal to entirely new markets and this fitness peripheral could further add to the wii 's appeal .
mr long said : " nintendo 's strategy is very much to bring non-gamers into the industry .
their ethos for a couple of years now is the gamer market is finite ; there are 10 times more non-gamers than there are existing gamers .
" that 's kind of nintendo 's mission at the moment and wii fit is very much an element of that . "
wii fit will probably be the most important title for them of 2008 phil elliot , gamesindustry.biz nintendo 's wii is the biggest selling console of this generation , but supply problems and a lack of compelling third-party titles could see a significant slow-down in the machine 's meteoric rise .
phil elliot , editor for gamesindustry.biz , thinks wii fit could help weather out poor third-party support .
he said : " wii fit for nintendo is the title that will respike and nudge the sales of the console back up again .
" as we have seen with the xbox 360 , microsoft have had a really good way of putting out key tittles throughout the life cycle of this console . "
he added : " wii fit will probably be the most important title for them of 2008 and crucially it is at a higher price point as well so it will be an interesting marker to see if people are prepared to pay the higher price point , and also how many people are interested in a fitness-based video game .

" but at the same time gta is often considered a very playstation friendly series of games and it will be interesting to see which console benefits the most out of the title . "
wii fit is being promoted for its healthy benefits in stark contrast , nintendo 's wii fit is an entirely different sort of game .
with the help of the balance board , players complete a number of different exercises ranging from yoga to hula-hoop spinning .
most of the exercises simply require the player to replicate instructions , which are provided via the onscreen virtual fitness trainer .
the addition of the balance board with this title pushes its cost up to a uk retail price of £ 70 .
the success of the wii and its motion sensitive controller has seen nintendo 's games appeal to entirely new markets and this fitness peripheral could further add to the wii 's appeal .
mr long said : " nintendo 's strategy is very much to bring non-gamers into the industry .
their ethos for a couple of years now is the gamer market is finite ; there are 10 times more non-gamers than there are existing gamers .
" that 's kind of nintendo 's mission at the moment and wii fit is very much an element of that . "
wii fit will probably be the most important title for them of 2008 phil elliot , gamesindustry.biz nintendo 's wii is the biggest selling console of this generation , but supply problems and a lack of compelling third-party titles could see a significant slow-down in the machine 's meteoric rise .
phil elliot , editor for gamesindustry.biz , thinks wii fit could help weather out poor third-party support .
he said : " wii fit for nintendo is the title that will respike and nudge the sales of the console back up again .
" as we have seen with the xbox 360 , microsoft have had a really good way of putting out key tittles throughout the life cycle of this console . "
he added : " wii fit will probably be the most important title for them of 2008 and crucially it is at a higher price point as well so it will be an interesting marker to see if people are prepared to pay the higher price point , and also how many people are interested in a fitness-based video game . "
so the biggest video games showdown of the year looks set to be played out between a game that endorses wholesale mayhem , and a title that encourages wholesome keep fit .

sarabjit singh , lodged in lahore jail , was to be executed on 1 may .
his hanging has been put off by 21 days .
singh says he is a poor farmer and victim of mistaken identity who strayed drunk from his border village into pakistan .
he was convicted in 1991 .
last month , president pervez musharraf rejected singh 's mercy petition and signed his death warrant .
pakistani officials say sarabjit singh is actually manjit singh who was arrested while trying to slip back into india .
he was found guilty of spying and carrying out four bombings which killed 14 people in the pakistani cities of lahore and faisalabad in 1990 .
his hanging was initially set for 1 april .
president pervez musharraf deferred it to 1 may .
singh 's relatives , including his wife , two daughters , sister and her husband , among others , are in pakistan in a last-ditch attempt to save him .
they have met former prime minister nawaz sharif and are hoping to meet president musharraf , prime minister yusuf raza gillani and top politician asif zardari .
' family 's plight ' efforts to save singh brightened on monday as mr sharif asked the government not to hang him on humanitarian grounds .
mr sharif 's muslim league -lrb- n -rrb- party is part of the governing coalition in pakistan .
" after seeing the plight of the members of sarabjit 's family who have come to pakistan , any person can feel the pain they are going through , " mr sharif told pakistan 's aaj news channel .
but , mr sharif said , singh should be released on the condition that india would send him back to pakistan if new evidence is found against him .
singh 's family met him in jail last week and they say they are hopeful that he will be pardoned and released .
the case has received wide publicity in india and the government has come under intense political pressure to intervene .
in 2005 , former indian foreign minister natwar singh asked for mr singh to be pardoned on humanitarian grounds .
india and pakistan have jailed hundreds of each other 's soldiers and civilians during years of hostility .

anne youngman , the bat conservation trust 's scottish officer , said the handful of incidents may be related to last year 's poor summer and autumn .
she said it was too early to tell if the problem was more widespread .
last year , adult bats were reported abandoning their young as they struggled to cope with bad weather .
mrs youngman , who will travel from central scotland to lead a bats workshop in strathpeffer community centre , near dingwall , on thursday , said the first bats of the season were emerging from hibernation .
she said : " down here in the central belt people have found grounded bats which were very weak and very hungry .
" this may be a reflection of last summer and juveniles not getting enough food to build up fat to survive through hibernation . "
mrs youngman said she knew of only a couple of incidents so far , but she added : " someone visiting mull reported seeing a bat flying during daylight and mobbed by birds .
" for bats to be flying in daylight is something strange and you do n't normally see and could mean the bat was really hungry . "
cat food in day time bats run the risk of falling prey to other animals and it has been known for them to be mobbed and eaten by crows .
she advised anyone finding a bat in difficulty to contact the nearest conservation officer , or the scottish society for the prevention of cruelty to animals .
hungry bats are often revived on meal worms , or the jelly from dog or cat food finely chopped up .
during thursday 's workshop , mrs youngman will help people on how to identify common species found in the highlands .
on 17 may , a workshop will be held in contin village hall on red squirrels .
conservationists are concerned for native reds following the first confirmed sighting of a grey squirrel in the highlands .
the non-native species competes with reds for food and carry a virus fatal to the smaller animal .

mrs youngman said she knew of only a couple of incidents so far , but she added : " someone visiting mull reported seeing a bat flying during daylight and mobbed by birds .

there is no doubt that video is big on the net .
but is it getting too big ?
ask at & t and it will answer - yes .
speaking in london in late april , jim cicconi , at & t 's vice president of legal affairs , said the burgeoning amount of video would consume all the net 's bandwidth in two years .
at the moment , said mr cicconi , video makes up 30 % of net traffic now and in two years will hit 80 % .
add in the move to high definition video which is seven to 10 times more bandwidth hungry , he said , and you get a recipe for failure .
mr cicconi is not alone in making startling predictions about an imminent rise in the amount of data whizzing across the internet .
big pipes in the us two key reports have brought to light the potential problem of the " exaflood " .
this is the time when the amount of data passing across the net exceeds an exabyte .
an exabyte is an unimaginably huge amount of data .
it is estimated that in five exabytes you could list all the words ever spoken by human beings .
in its report , the exabyte era , network hardware maker cisco predicted that by 2011 more than 12 exabytes of data will be crossing the net every month .
at that time 30 % of the traffic will be video and a further 43 % will be generated by people swapping video and other files via peer-to-peer networks .
but cisco said this was no reason to panic .
the first line of the report 's summary reads : " the internet is not collapsing under the weight of streaming video . "
professor andrew odlyzko , one of the few academics who studies net traffic growth , said predictions about the collapse of the net have been made with alarming regularity .
" it 's an idea that crops up very frequently , " he said , " but i do not think we need to be worried . "
professor odlyzko 's studies lead him to believe that net traffic will increase at a rate of between 50 % and 60 % over the next few years - a prediction matched by cisco 's exabyte report .
" it 's rapid but it 's manageable , " he said , and within the range covered by the spending backbone net firms were planning to upgrade their infrastructure .
in the us , said professor odlyzko , the debate about traffic is being made more urgent as it goes alongside chatter about net neutrality - the idea that all data should be treated equally .
instead many us net firms would prefer to stratify traffic and charge customers more to ensure that some of it gets through .
video show in the uk the debate about rising traffic on the net has been thrown into stark relief by the success of the bbc 's iplayer catch-up video service .
in the three months since its formal launch on christmas day 2007 users have watched more than 42 million programmes via the service .
uk net service firm plus net published figures which showed it had seen 66 % growth in the volume of streaming traffic on its network since 1 december 2007 .
this translated to an increase in the cost of handling that traffic from £ 17,233 to £ 51,700 per month .
neil armstrong , product director for plusnet , said this was nothing to worry about .
" this is not a surprise to any of the isps , " he said .
" we have all been talking about and looking forward to video over the internet for years . "
performance rankings of uk isps by epitiro suggests that the rise in video has had little or no effect on responsiveness .
there are no signs of collapsing performance in the uk .
plusnet sells net access in a variety of packages each one of which has a specific monthly data cap .
customers pay 75p per gigabyte if they exceed their monthly allowance .
" probably one-third of our customers top up their usage allowance every month , " said mr armstrong .
cash call for tim johnson , managing director of isp analysts point topic , the complaints from isps about their rising costs has one cause .
" their business model does not work anymore , " he said .
" it 's absolutely classic , and not just in telecoms , if your cost structure gets out of line with your charging structure then you are in trouble , " he said .
he said too many net service firms had attracted customers by dangling offers of " unlimited " bandwidth which were made in the vain hope that few customers would suck up lots of data .
" if your customer is not using it very much once you have installed it , the cost of running it can be minimal , " he said .
" streaming the iplayer or any kind of video is at least an order of magnitude increase . "
have your say " online video is n't so much of a problem for countries that have invested properly in their internet services . "
billy , leeds send us your comments rampant competition in the uk broadband market , partly thanks to new entrants such as vodafone and carphone warehouse , has forced prices lower .
this means , said mr johnson , few isps have ready cash for upgrading their networks or buying capacity to keep up with the demands of their customers .
for martin geddes of telecom analysts stl partners the problem is being exacerbated by the uk 's regulatory regime which sees many firms rent their net access from bt wholesale .
with constant pressure on prices those net firms who do not have their own network , such as cable firm virgin and sky , may struggle , he said .
but the bbc might face difficult questions from isps in the near future , he said .
" the bbc is an interesting and difficult case , " he said .
" in most of its other activities the licence fee pays for distribution . "
" the only exception is the iplayer , " he said .
" that breaks the model . "
something was going to have to change , he said .
" it 's a question of who pays for it and how you deliver it . "

it is estimated that in five exabytes you could list all the words ever spoken by human beings .
in its report , the exabyte era , network hardware maker cisco predicted that by 2011 more than 12 exabytes of data will be crossing the net every month .
at that time 30 % of the traffic will be video and a further 43 % will be generated by people swapping video and other files via peer-to-peer networks .
but cisco said this was no reason to panic .
the first line of the report 's summary reads : " the internet is not collapsing under the weight of streaming video . "
professor andrew odlyzko , one of the few academics who studies net traffic growth , said predictions about the collapse of the net have been made with alarming regularity .
" it 's an idea that crops up very frequently , " he said , " but i do not think we need to be worried . "
professor odlyzko 's studies lead him to believe that net traffic will increase at a rate of between 50 % and 60 % over the next few years - a prediction matched by cisco 's exabyte report .
" it 's rapid but it 's manageable , " he said , and within the range covered by the spending backbone net firms were planning to upgrade their infrastructure .
in the us , said professor odlyzko , the debate about traffic is being made more urgent as it goes alongside chatter about net neutrality - the idea that all data should be treated equally .
instead many us net firms would prefer to stratify traffic and charge customers more to ensure that some of it gets through .
video show in the uk the debate about rising traffic on the net has been thrown into stark relief by the success of the bbc 's iplayer catch-up video service .
in the three months since its formal launch on christmas day 2007 users have watched more than 42 million programmes via the service .
booming data growth may mean slower web browsing times uk net service firm plus net published figures which showed it had seen 66 % growth in the volume of streaming traffic on its network since 1 december 2007 .
this translated to an increase in the cost of handling that traffic from £ 17,233 to £ 51,700 per month .
neil armstrong , product director for plusnet , said this was nothing to worry about .
" this is not a surprise to any of the isps , " he said .
" we have all been talking about and looking forward to video over the internet for years . "
performance rankings of uk isps by epitiro suggests that the rise in video has had little or no effect on responsiveness .
there are no signs of collapsing performance in the uk .
plusnet sells net access in a variety of packages each one of which has a specific monthly data cap .
customers pay 75p per gigabyte if they exceed their monthly allowance .
" probably one-third of our customers top up their usage allowance every month , " said mr armstrong .

some predict the flood of video traffic will overwhelm the net there is no doubt that video is big on the net .
but is it getting too big ?
ask at & t and it will answer - yes .
speaking in london in late april , jim cicconi , at & t 's vice president of legal affairs , said the burgeoning amount of video would consume all the net 's bandwidth in two years .
at the moment , said mr cicconi , video makes up 30 % of net traffic now and in two years will hit 80 % .
add in the move to high definition video which is seven to 10 times more bandwidth hungry , he said , and you get a recipe for failure .
mr cicconi is not alone in making startling predictions about an imminent rise in the amount of data whizzing across the internet .
big pipes in the us two key reports have brought to light the potential problem of the " exaflood " .

some predict the flood of video traffic will overwhelm the net there is no doubt that video is big on the net .
but is it getting too big ?
ask at & t and it will answer - yes .
speaking in london in late april , jim cicconi , at & t 's vice president of legal affairs , said the burgeoning amount of video would consume all the net 's bandwidth in two years .
at the moment , said mr cicconi , video makes up 30 % of net traffic now and in two years will hit 80 % .
add in the move to high definition video which is seven to 10 times more bandwidth hungry , he said , and you get a recipe for failure .
mr cicconi is not alone in making startling predictions about an imminent rise in the amount of data whizzing across the internet .
big pipes in the us two key reports have brought to light the potential problem of the " exaflood " .
this is the time when the amount of data passing across the net exceeds an exabyte .
an exabyte is an unimaginably huge amount of data .
it is estimated that in five exabytes you could list all the words ever spoken by human beings .
in its report , the exabyte era , network hardware maker cisco predicted that by 2011 more than 12 exabytes of data will be crossing the net every month .
at that time 30 % of the traffic will be video and a further 43 % will be generated by people swapping video and other files via peer-to-peer networks .
but cisco said this was no reason to panic .
the first line of the report 's summary reads : " the internet is not collapsing under the weight of streaming video . "
professor andrew odlyzko , one of the few academics who studies net traffic growth , said predictions about the collapse of the net have been made with alarming regularity .
" it 's an idea that crops up very frequently , " he said , " but i do not think we need to be worried . "
professor odlyzko 's studies lead him to believe that net traffic will increase at a rate of between 50 % and 60 % over the next few years - a prediction matched by cisco 's exabyte report .
" it 's rapid but it 's manageable , " he said , and within the range covered by the spending backbone net firms were planning to upgrade their infrastructure .
in the us , said professor odlyzko , the debate about traffic is being made more urgent as it goes alongside chatter about net neutrality - the idea that all data should be treated equally .
instead many us net firms would prefer to stratify traffic and charge customers more to ensure that some of it gets through .
video show in the uk the debate about rising traffic on the net has been thrown into stark relief by the success of the bbc 's iplayer catch-up video service .
in the three months since its formal launch on christmas day 2007 users have watched more than 42 million programmes via the service .
booming data growth may mean slower web browsing times uk net service firm plus net published figures which showed it had seen 66 % growth in the volume of streaming traffic on its network since 1 december 2007 .
this translated to an increase in the cost of handling that traffic from £ 17,233 to £ 51,700 per month .
neil armstrong , product director for plusnet , said this was nothing to worry about .
" this is not a surprise to any of the isps , " he said .
" we have all been talking about and looking forward to video over the internet for years . "
performance rankings of uk isps by epitiro suggests that the rise in video has had little or no effect on responsiveness .
there are no signs of collapsing performance in the uk .
plusnet sells net access in a variety of packages each one of which has a specific monthly data cap .
customers pay 75p per gigabyte if they exceed their monthly allowance .
" probably one-third of our customers top up their usage allowance every month , " said mr armstrong .
cash call for tim johnson , managing director of isp analysts point topic , the complaints from isps about their rising costs has one cause .
" their business model does not work anymore , " he said .
" it 's absolutely classic , and not just in telecoms , if your cost structure gets out of line with your charging structure then you are in trouble , " he said .
he said too many net service firms had attracted customers by dangling offers of " unlimited " bandwidth which were made in the vain hope that few customers would suck up lots of data .
" if your customer is not using it very much once you have installed it , the cost of running it can be minimal , " he said .
" streaming the iplayer or any kind of video is at least an order of magnitude increase . "
have your say online video is n't so much of a problem for countries that have invested properly in their internet services .
billy , leeds send us your comments rampant competition in the uk broadband market , partly thanks to new entrants such as vodafone and carphone warehouse , has forced prices lower .
this means , said mr johnson , few isps have ready cash for upgrading their networks or buying capacity to keep up with the demands of their customers .
for martin geddes of telecom analysts stl partners the problem is being exacerbated by the uk 's regulatory regime which sees many firms rent their net access from bt wholesale .
with constant pressure on prices those net firms who do not have their own network , such as cable firm virgin and sky , may struggle , he said .
but the bbc might face difficult questions from isps in the near future , he said .
" the bbc is an interesting and difficult case , " he said .
" in most of its other activities the licence fee pays for distribution . "
" the only exception is the iplayer , " he said .
" that breaks the model . "
something was going to have to change , he said .
" it 's a question of who pays for it and how you deliver it . "

some predict the flood of video traffic will overwhelm the net there is no doubt that video is big on the net .
but is it getting too big ?
ask at & t and it will answer - yes .
speaking in london in late april , jim cicconi , at & t 's vice president of legal affairs , said the burgeoning amount of video would consume all the net 's bandwidth in two years .
at the moment , said mr cicconi , video makes up 30 % of net traffic now and in two years will hit 80 % .

the 54-year-old became a fixture in little britain playing a prime minister plagued by his infatuated aide , sebastian .
and on the other side of the atlantic , his portrayal of rupert giles in cult hit buffy the vampire slayer for six years made him a household name .
his new venture is playing one half of an ageing criminal duo in comedy drama the invisibles .
the performer gives an introduction to his latest character , and reveals the lasting impact buffy has had on his life and career .
tell me about your new character and the story behind the invisibles .
maurice was part of a criminal gang who were never caught .
he has a heart attack in spain and his wife -lsb- played by jenny agutter -rsb- says they should go back to england to a retirement flat .
but he 's still champing at the bit and goes back to his old ways with his friend syd , played by warren clarke .
we 're definitely an odd couple .
it 's wonderfully written , rich and dense , of the kind you do n't get these days and we have big speeches !
have you worked with warren clarke before ?
i had n't .
it was hideous , we had a horrible time together .
no , it was a match made in heaven right from day one .
the chemistry had to be right - if it was n't then the whole thing would have folded inwards .
it was lovely to support him and be supported .
you character is of retirement age .
did you have to undergo any sort of transformation to play the part ?
he 's of young retirement age , in his mid-50s .
i had to add a few years - the most ignominious part of it was having to grey up my chest hairs when they were on display .
the hair on your head is fine , but the chest hair is not nice !
and because i 'd come home from a sunny climate , there was an extra layer around the creases in my face which stood out .
but maurice is still on top of his game .
he has n't let himself go , is a sharp dresser and has a lovely wife .
i was also given a haircut which lends him extra gravitas which i 'm going to keep for a while !
what 's happening with your career on the us front ?
about 18 months ago i did a pilot for abc which was executive produced by elton john in which i played a demanding gay rock star .
it was n't commissioned , but i got to sing some songs with elton which was pretty cool .
i recently did a film called repo : the genetic opera which has the distributors confused because it 's pure rock opera , back to the days of tommy with some great songs and an interesting plot like a greek tragedy .
it 's not coming out for a while but has already had some good reviews .
is there any prospect of working with little britain 's matt lucas and david walliams again ?
they 're writing little america for hbo at the moment with a character like the prime minister i played along the lines of a us senator .
whether or not it 's me - they sweetly talked about it a long time ago - or the network might want some american actor .
it depends on when they film it as well - i 've gone straight from the invisibles to another bbc series merlin , and if the invisibles gets a second series i 'll go straight into that again .
but i 'm a firm believer in what will be will be .
buffy is still hugely popular with the fans .
do you enjoy being remembered for your role as giles ? "
i 'm a firm believer in what will be will be " anthony head on the prospect of appearing in little america it 's always nice to meet people who say they like what you do .
some of them go all quivery and i say that actors are just ordinary people who got a good break - please do n't put us on a pedestal !
the good thing about buffy is that it keeps regenerating its audience .
young kids who are little britain fans are just clocking into buffy .
it 's still out there and no-one has come close to maintaining the integrity it achieved throughout its seven seasons .
what is the latest with potential buffy spin-offs involving giles ?
there 's been vague talk for some time - it was a series and then a one-off film called ripper .
creator joss whedon is busy with another project , i 'm tied up too , so at the moment i 'd just say that it 's still out there .
the invisibles begins on bbc one , thursday 1 may at 2100 bst .

the actor 's numerous credits include hotel babylon the 54-year-old became a fixture in little britain playing a prime minister plagued by his infatuated aide , sebastian .
and on the other side of the atlantic , his portrayal of rupert giles in cult hit buffy the vampire slayer for six years made him a household name .
his new venture is playing one half of an ageing criminal duo in comedy drama the invisibles .
the performer gives an introduction to his latest character , and reveals the lasting impact buffy has had on his life and career .
tell me about your new character and the story behind the invisibles .
maurice was part of a criminal gang who were never caught .
he has a heart attack in spain and his wife -lsb- played by jenny agutter -rsb- says they should go back to england to a retirement flat .
but he 's still champing at the bit and goes back to his old ways with his friend syd , played by warren clarke .
we 're definitely an odd couple .
it 's wonderfully written , rich and dense , of the kind you do n't get these days and we have big speeches !
have you worked with warren clarke before ?
i had n't .
it was hideous , we had a horrible time together .
no , it was a match made in heaven right from day one .
the chemistry had to be right - if it was n't then the whole thing would have folded inwards .
it was lovely to support him and be supported .
head -lrb- r -rrb- teams up with warren clarke in the invisibles you character is of retirement age .
did you have to undergo any sort of transformation to play the part ?
he 's of young retirement age , in his mid-50s .
i had to add a few years - the most ignominious part of it was having to grey up my chest hairs when they were on display .
the hair on your head is fine , but the chest hair is not nice !
and because i 'd come home from a sunny climate , there was an extra layer around the creases in my face which stood out .
but maurice is still on top of his game .
he has n't let himself go , is a sharp dresser and has a lovely wife .
i was also given a haircut which lends him extra gravitas which i 'm going to keep for a while !
what 's happening with your career on the us front ?
about 18 months ago i did a pilot for abc which was executive produced by elton john in which i played a demanding gay rock star .
it was n't commissioned , but i got to sing some songs with elton which was pretty cool .
i recently did a film called repo : the genetic opera which has the distributors confused because it 's pure rock opera , back to the days of tommy with some great songs and an interesting plot like a greek tragedy .
it 's not coming out for a while but has already had some good reviews .
is there any prospect of working with little britain 's matt lucas and david walliams again ?

the performer gives an introduction to his latest character , and reveals the lasting impact buffy has had on his life and career .
tell me about your new character and the story behind the invisibles .
maurice was part of a criminal gang who were never caught .
he has a heart attack in spain and his wife -lsb- played by jenny agutter -rsb- says they should go back to england to a retirement flat .
but he 's still champing at the bit and goes back to his old ways with his friend syd , played by warren clarke .
we 're definitely an odd couple .
it 's wonderfully written , rich and dense , of the kind you do n't get these days and we have big speeches !
have you worked with warren clarke before ?
i had n't .
it was hideous , we had a horrible time together .
no , it was a match made in heaven right from day one .
the chemistry had to be right - if it was n't then the whole thing would have folded inwards .
it was lovely to support him and be supported .
head -lrb- r -rrb- teams up with warren clarke in the invisibles you character is of retirement age .
did you have to undergo any sort of transformation to play the part ?
he 's of young retirement age , in his mid-50s .
i had to add a few years - the most ignominious part of it was having to grey up my chest hairs when they were on display .
the hair on your head is fine , but the chest hair is not nice !
and because i 'd come home from a sunny climate , there was an extra layer around the creases in my face which stood out .
but maurice is still on top of his game .
he has n't let himself go , is a sharp dresser and has a lovely wife .
i was also given a haircut which lends him extra gravitas which i 'm going to keep for a while !
what 's happening with your career on the us front ?
about 18 months ago i did a pilot for abc which was executive produced by elton john in which i played a demanding gay rock star .
it was n't commissioned , but i got to sing some songs with elton which was pretty cool .
i recently did a film called repo : the genetic opera which has the distributors confused because it 's pure rock opera , back to the days of tommy with some great songs and an interesting plot like a greek tragedy .
it 's not coming out for a while but has already had some good reviews .

mr ahmadinejad said boosting ties between tehran and colombo would help peace and stability in the region .
iran is emerging as a major economic donor in sri lanka which is under pressure on human rights issues as war has resumed with the tamil tigers .
mr ahmadinejad held talks in pakistan on monday and is heading on to india .
' fair play ' sri lanka 's government has hailed mr ahmadinejad 's visit as cementing relations with iran .
the capital is festooned with flags , and bill boards proclaiming " traditional asian solidarity " .
during his short visit president ahmadinejad toured development projects which iran is helping to fund .
he held talks with his counterpart , mahinda rajapaksa , and signed a number of economic accords .
" we are seeking justice and fair play in the world and sri lanka and iran have agreed to co-operate in all spheres for the mutual benefit of each other , " the iranian president told reporters .
iran has already agreed soft loans and grants of $ 1.9bn for a hydroelectric and irrigation scheme and to upgrade sri lanka 's main oil refinery , as well as to buy iranian oil .
sri lanka is heavily reliant on iran for its supplies of crude .
china has also come forward with money for a new port and other projects .
policy shift the bbc 's roland buerk in colombo says sri lanka is slowly turning towards asian countries which offer more donor money than traditional western allies as well as less criticism over human rights .
foreign secretary dr palitha kohona told the bbc : " asians do n't hector each other from public pulpits .
they 're more ready with assistance and less ready with gratuitous advice . "
our correspondent says sri lanka has come under pressure from some countries over its human rights record as war has resumed with tamil tiger rebels fighting for independence in the island 's north and east .
in march a us state department report accused government forces and allied militias of unlawful killing , torture , hostage-taking and extortion with impunity .
