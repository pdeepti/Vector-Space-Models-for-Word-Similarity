under a rainbow-colored logo and the motto " better living - we just went ahead and did it , " the project is realizing its plan to build multigenerational , mixed-income living spaces for gay , lesbian and transgender singles , couples and " rainbow " families .
the idea is to live in individual homes " but still have community , " said stefan juengst , a spokesman for the project .
so far , half of the 34 apartments , due to be completed in the autumn of 2009 , have been sold .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : organizers of villa anders want all generations included in the community the project is selective in terms of sexual identity , with living space available for gays , lesbians , transgenders - and a 15 percent quota of straight people who may be part of an otherwise gay or lesbian family constellation .
a rainbow family is " the gay equivalent of the blended family , " juegst said .
" it could be all constellations - people with children who came initially out of a heterosexual relationship , or two lesbians with a gay man together who make a deal to have children - very different models .
there are no given role models . "
but a key goal of the group is to have a mixed range of ages represented , and state funding is tied to its success .
" some people who live here will be students , others will spend their working years here , and still others will spend their golden years with us .
we want all generations , " a flyer for the project reads .
a first for germany should it succeed , villa anders would be germany 's first such center for gay living , a fact that even juengst acknowledges is surprising .
" there have been many attempts but they all failed , " juengst said .
there was the community in hamburg that failed because the neighborhood rejected it , and one in frankfurt that did n't get off the ground because it was too complicated , involving a care center and an old age home .
currently , berlin is working on a project similar to villa anders , but it is also different - aimed only at homosexual men , and leaning more toward the old-age home model .
" to my knowledge , we are the only one for both gays and lesbians , " juengst said .
finding middle-aged people interested in the apartments has been easy , but older gays , especially gay men , " have a lot of fear - they worry about becoming a target for violence , " juengst said .
creating a " gay ghetto " ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : cologne is home to germany 's largest gay and lesbian community indeed , some might question whether creating a multigenerational living project for gays and lesbians is the right direction to move for a city that is already known for being a european gay capital .
do such mono-culture projects help bring about integration - or create a ghetto-like atmosphere that detracts from it ?
projects organizers insist that the villa anders community is not going to be a " gay ghetto " or contribute to anti-gay sentiment in cologne .
rather , it will be a first chance for many of them to be themselves , without fear .
" the alternative for so many gays and lesbians , especially older ones , is to live hidden in plain sight , in the middle of the rest of society , " juengst said .
" maybe people whisper about them , or some even live openly .
but many just feel they can not be themselves . "
the goal , then , is to " let the community know that we are there , and we are visible .
then a dialogue can begin , " juengst added .
still , he said , the older community has been hardest to convince , especially men .
so whether or not the group can meet its state-determined quota of filling 30 percent of its apartments with seniors remains to be seen .
if they do n't fill the quota by the end of the year , then the remaining apartments - some heavily subsidized and highly desirable - could be offered to renters outside the target group . jennifer abramsohn send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

police , who estimate that some 6,000 people attended sunday 's ceremony , said there were no protests . in an inaugural speech , the premier of north rhine westphalia juergen ruettgers , affirmed the right of 3.3 million muslims in germany to build mosques as big as they liked .

in that city , some civic leaders have charged that a planned mosque is " too big . "
the city witnessed violent rioting last month as far rightists vainly attempted to hold an anti-islam rally . officials say ethnic turkish muslims form a major group in gritty , working-class duisburg , an old coal and steel town , as opposed to their affluent , middle-class counterparts in cologne , 55 kilometers away . in the duisburg suburb of marxloh where the mosque was built , muslims make up about one-third of the 18,000 residents . the designers of the 7.5-million-euro -lrb- $ 9.4-million -rrb- complex forestalled german criticisms by including plate-glass windows to make the mosque 's inner workings more visible . there will also be no muezzin calling to prayer by loudspeaker from the duisburg mosque 's 34-metre minaret , a practice that some anti-mosque groups elsewhere have seized on . the state government and the european union pumped in 3 million euros in subsidies for the complex , which includes a community centre , café and the mosque itself capped with several ottoman-style domes . another 4 million euros was contributed by muslim faithful in an international fund raising drive . dpa news agency -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

a working group has agreed to boost building renovation work and infrastructure projects , the weekly der spiegel reported , without citing sources . but according to a german newspaper report on sunday , oct 26 , a rift is emerging in the ruling coalition between the finance and economy ministers about the kind of stimulus measures to take and where to apply them . finance minister rejects tax cuts finance minister peer steinbrueck , a social democrat , rejects proposals by the conservative economy minister for income tax cuts and making health insurance contributions tax-deductible from 2009 , the welt am sonntag paper reported . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : steinbrueck has warned the financial crisis could drag on until late 2009 supported by chancellor merkel , steinbrueck , believes the german economy - the world 's third biggest - is too large to be helped by " 1980s recipes " and that measures stimulating investment would work better , the paper said .

frings , who was one of the german stars in 2006 when they finished third at the world cup , has said that he is not disappointed with having been dropped or not been given enough playing time .
" i am upset about the way in which this was handled , the way in which i was treated .

kuranyi walked out on the team while the match was still going on , bringing his international career to an end .
ballack , who is currently sidelined with a foot injury , said he wanted to support his long-time midfield partner frings and to speak about issues " which are important for me as captain . "

" i will sit down with joachim loew , as soon as my injury permits , and apologize for my behavior to him , " ballack was quoted as saying in a statement released by the german soccer association -lrb- dfb -rrb- on sunday .
ballack said " the success of the team " was the only thing on his mind when he criticized loew this week in a newspaper interview .
but loew signaled that the affair , which has made sports headlines in germany , was far from over .
" i have taken notice of michael ballack 's statement .
but a personal meeting is more important .
i will make my final assessment after that , " loew said on the web site of the german soccer federation dfb .
row over treatment of senior players loew said he talked with ballack on the phone saturday and said the face-to-face meeting will take place in germany in the near future .
dfb president theo zwanziger said that loew alone would decide how to end the issue .
there is speculation that loew could axe ballack as captain .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : frings is miffed for being benched by loew ballack said on saturday that his recent remarks , made in an interview with daily frankfurter allgemeine zeitung paper , were " a mistake . "

werder bremen 's frings also attacked loew over the issue but loew insisted that other players needed to be fielded as well to have a strong team for the 2010 world cup .
loew also said that no one was guaranteed a place in the starting 11 .
frings , who was one of the german stars in 2006 when they finished third at the world cup , has said that he is not disappointed with having been dropped or not been given enough playing time .
" i am upset about the way in which this was handled , the way in which i was treated .
that should not happen , " frings told reporters this week .
the row over the treatment of senior players erupted after loew left kevin kuranyi on the bench for germany 's world cup qualifier against russia this month .
kuranyi walked out on the team while the match was still going on , bringing his international career to an end .
ballack , who is currently sidelined with a foot injury , said he wanted to support his long-time midfield partner frings and to speak about issues " which are important for me as captain . "

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de economy -pipe- 26.10.2008 germany split over measures to boost slowing economy großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the shine 's coming off the sputtering german economy as the financial crisis bites german chancellor merkel 's coalition is divided over measures to boost investment in specific sectors of europe 's biggest economy as it grapples with slowing growth and the specter of recession , a report said sunday . the german government , an uneasy coalition of merkel 's conservatives and the social democrats -lrb- spd -rrb- , is drawing up a series of measures to boost investment in specific sectors of the economy measures as the german central bank warned the financial crisis and a sharp global slowdown had already left their mark . last monday chancellor angela merkel asked ministers to develop a stimulus package for the economy , stressing that any measures would be " targeted . " the government has said the auto and construction industries could get help .
a working group has agreed to boost building renovation work and infrastructure projects , the weekly der spiegel reported , without citing sources . but according to a german newspaper report on sunday , oct 26 , a rift is emerging in the ruling coalition between the finance and economy ministers about the kind of stimulus measures to take and where to apply them . finance minister rejects tax cuts finance minister peer steinbrueck , a social democrat , rejects proposals by the conservative economy minister for income tax cuts and making health insurance contributions tax-deductible from 2009 , the welt am sonntag paper reported . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : steinbrueck has warned the financial crisis could drag on until late 2009 supported by chancellor merkel , steinbrueck , believes the german economy - the world 's third biggest - is too large to be helped by " 1980s recipes " and that measures stimulating investment would work better , the paper said . " ten billion euros -lrb- $ 13 billion -rrb- in tax cuts wo n't change anything in an economy with an output of 2.5 trillion euros , " the paper cites government sources as saying . separately , news magazine der spiegel reported over the weekend that the social democratic party , including steinbreuck prefers measures to protect jobs .
the magazine said the party was pushing for a reduction in unemployment insurance contributions . steinbrueck and economy minister michael glos were due to present their proposals to a cabinet meeting early this week with a view to a package of measures being approved by november 5 , the paper said . gloomy economic news the wrangling over a stimulus program for specific sectors of the economy comes amid a slew of bad economic news . german luxury carmakers daimler and bmw said over the weekend they would temporarily close factories as a result of slumping sales .

" the government has said the auto and construction industries could get help .
a working group has agreed to boost building renovation work and infrastructure projects , the weekly der spiegel reported , without citing sources . but according to a german newspaper report on sunday , oct 26 , a rift is emerging in the ruling coalition between the finance and economy ministers about the kind of stimulus measures to take and where to apply them . finance minister rejects tax cuts finance minister peer steinbrueck , a social democrat , rejects proposals by the conservative economy minister for income tax cuts and making health insurance contributions tax-deductible from 2009 , the welt am sonntag paper reported . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : steinbrueck has warned the financial crisis could drag on until late 2009 supported by chancellor merkel , steinbrueck , believes the german economy - the world 's third biggest - is too large to be helped by " 1980s recipes " and that measures stimulating investment would work better , the paper said . " ten billion euros -lrb- $ 13 billion -rrb- in tax cuts wo n't change anything in an economy with an output of 2.5 trillion euros , " the paper cites government sources as saying . separately , news magazine der spiegel reported over the weekend that the social democratic party , including steinbreuck prefers measures to protect jobs .
the magazine said the party was pushing for a reduction in unemployment insurance contributions . steinbrueck and economy minister michael glos were due to present their proposals to a cabinet meeting early this week with a view to a package of measures being approved by november 5 , the paper said . gloomy economic news the wrangling over a stimulus program for specific sectors of the economy comes amid a slew of bad economic news . german luxury carmakers daimler and bmw said over the weekend they would temporarily close factories as a result of slumping sales .
general motors ' german arm , opel , has also announced output cuts , as have volkswagen 's spanish subsidiary seat and czech subsidiary skoda . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany 's carmakers have been hit hard by the economic crisis earlier this month , glos slashed his forecast for growth in 2009 to just 0.2 percent from his previous projection of 1.2 percent , the slowest rate of growth since the 2003 recession when the german economy contracted by 0.2 percent . finance minister steinbrueck too predicted a gloomy future for germany over the weekend , saying the crisis would last at least until late 2009 and it would take years for germany to guage the real costs of its massive bank bailout . on friday , germany 's deutsche bank predicted a severe recession in germany .

police , who estimate that some 6,000 people attended sunday 's ceremony , said there were no protests . in an inaugural speech , the premier of north rhine westphalia juergen ruettgers , affirmed the right of 3.3 million muslims in germany to build mosques as big as they liked . " we need more mosques in this country , not in inner courtyards , but visible and recognizable ones , " he said . glass windows , no loudspeakers bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german politicians welcomed the new mosque the opening of the mosque could not have been more different from the controversy surrounding a planned one in nearby cologne .
in that city , some civic leaders have charged that a planned mosque is " too big . "
the city witnessed violent rioting last month as far rightists vainly attempted to hold an anti-islam rally . officials say ethnic turkish muslims form a major group in gritty , working-class duisburg , an old coal and steel town , as opposed to their affluent , middle-class counterparts in cologne , 55 kilometers away . in the duisburg suburb of marxloh where the mosque was built , muslims make up about one-third of the 18,000 residents . the designers of the 7.5-million-euro -lrb- $ 9.4-million -rrb- complex forestalled german criticisms by including plate-glass windows to make the mosque 's inner workings more visible . there will also be no muezzin calling to prayer by loudspeaker from the duisburg mosque 's 34-metre minaret , a practice that some anti-mosque groups elsewhere have seized on . the state government and the european union pumped in 3 million euros in subsidies for the complex , which includes a community centre , café and the mosque itself capped with several ottoman-style domes . another 4 million euros was contributed by muslim faithful in an international fund raising drive . dpa news agency -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" the government has said the auto and construction industries could get help .
a working group has agreed to boost building renovation work and infrastructure projects , the weekly der spiegel reported , without citing sources . but according to a german newspaper report on sunday , oct 26 , a rift is emerging in the ruling coalition between the finance and economy ministers about the kind of stimulus measures to take and where to apply them . finance minister rejects tax cuts finance minister peer steinbrueck , a social democrat , rejects proposals by the conservative economy minister for income tax cuts and making health insurance contributions tax-deductible from 2009 , the welt am sonntag paper reported . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : steinbrueck has warned the financial crisis could drag on until late 2009 supported by chancellor merkel , steinbrueck , believes the german economy - the world 's third biggest - is too large to be helped by " 1980s recipes " and that measures stimulating investment would work better , the paper said . " ten billion euros -lrb- $ 13 billion -rrb- in tax cuts wo n't change anything in an economy with an output of 2.5 trillion euros , " the paper cites government sources as saying . separately , news magazine der spiegel reported over the weekend that the social democratic party , including steinbreuck prefers measures to protect jobs .
the magazine said the party was pushing for a reduction in unemployment insurance contributions . steinbrueck and economy minister michael glos were due to present their proposals to a cabinet meeting early this week with a view to a package of measures being approved by november 5 , the paper said . gloomy economic news the wrangling over a stimulus program for specific sectors of the economy comes amid a slew of bad economic news . german luxury carmakers daimler and bmw said over the weekend they would temporarily close factories as a result of slumping sales .
general motors ' german arm , opel , has also announced output cuts , as have volkswagen 's spanish subsidiary seat and czech subsidiary skoda . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany 's carmakers have been hit hard by the economic crisis earlier this month , glos slashed his forecast for growth in 2009 to just 0.2 percent from his previous projection of 1.2 percent , the slowest rate of growth since the 2003 recession when the german economy contracted by 0.2 percent . finance minister steinbrueck too predicted a gloomy future for germany over the weekend , saying the crisis would last at least until late 2009 and it would take years for germany to guage the real costs of its massive bank bailout . on friday , germany 's deutsche bank predicted a severe recession in germany .
the bank 's research arm expects output in germany - which makes up around a third of the eurozone economy - to shrink by 1.5 percent next year , saturday 's berliner zeitung reported . ulrich kater , chief economist of the dekabank told newspaper bild that the german economy had already slipped into a recession in the third quarter of 2008 . over a week ago , the german government rushed through a 500-billion-euro bailout package for its troubled banks .
since then , only the bavarian public bank , bayernlb , has sought state aid , requesting 5.4 billion euros . media reports said two more regional public banks were considering asking for help under the government 's rescue package . dw staff -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?
dw-world.de germany 's finance minister warns crisis far from over germany 's finance minister has grimly predicted the global financial crisis will last at least until late 2009 and said it will take years for germany to assess the real costs of its 480-billion-euro bank rescue package .
-lrb- 25.10.2008 -rrb- more german state banks line up for rescue two more german banks seemed set to line up saturday for a government rescue , as officials reportedly debated whether to force recapitalization on shy commercial banks .
-lrb- 25.10.2008 -rrb- experts : crisis will hit germany 's key exports sector germany 's export sector will suffer particularly under the international financial crisis , and the country is unlikely to emerge from its economic doldrums anytime soon , the finance ministry said .

the car was discovered , battered and rusty , in a small texas town earlier this year . the car was exhibited unrestored at the audi museum in july and august this year with its velvet seats slashed open , battered door trims and rusty exterior .
it is now undergoing a complete restoration .
the car was built by hand for dr. richard bruhn , the last man at the helm of auto union , a forerunner to audi ag , one of germany 's leading luxury car manufacturers .
the chauffeur-driven limousine was based on a 1938 horch 830 bl .
horch was one of four companies that merged under the auto union label in 1932 .
later , a us soldier stationed in germany bought the car and brought it home with him to the united states .
eventually the transmission broke down and he parted company with the car .
al wilson , a car enthusiast from san angelo , texas , saved the horch from the crushers .
although he knew nothing about the horch brand , he sensed that the vehicle was something special .
and so the former manager of a shoe factory paid $ 500 -lrb- 387 euros -rrb- for it , parking it on his property along with other finds .
bringing the horch home bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germans take pride in their car heritage wilson contacted ingolstadt , the german museum in munich and a dresden-based expert .
nobody knew anything about the car .
his sons later resumed the research .
finally ralf hornung , who is responsible for buying and restoring vehicles at audi tradition , recognized the car .
" the photos clearly showed bruhn 's car , the whereabouts of which had been a mystery for decades , " hornung said , flying straight to texas .
al wilson agreed to sell it , saying : " the horch should go home . "
the car brands audi , dkw , horch and wanderer merged under the auto union label in 1932 .
in 1985 , the audi ag was established bringing together the traditional companies auto union gmbh and nsu gmbh . dw staff -lrb- th -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

under a rainbow-colored logo and the motto " better living - we just went ahead and did it , " the project is realizing its plan to build multigenerational , mixed-income living spaces for gay , lesbian and transgender singles , couples and " rainbow " families .
the idea is to live in individual homes " but still have community , " said stefan juengst , a spokesman for the project .
so far , half of the 34 apartments , due to be completed in the autumn of 2009 , have been sold .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : organizers of villa anders want all generations included in the community the project is selective in terms of sexual identity , with living space available for gays , lesbians , transgenders - and a 15 percent quota of straight people who may be part of an otherwise gay or lesbian family constellation .
a rainbow family is " the gay equivalent of the blended family , " juegst said .
" it could be all constellations - people with children who came initially out of a heterosexual relationship , or two lesbians with a gay man together who make a deal to have children - very different models .
there are no given role models . "
but a key goal of the group is to have a mixed range of ages represented , and state funding is tied to its success .
" some people who live here will be students , others will spend their working years here , and still others will spend their golden years with us .
we want all generations , " a flyer for the project reads .
a first for germany should it succeed , villa anders would be germany 's first such center for gay living , a fact that even juengst acknowledges is surprising .
" there have been many attempts but they all failed , " juengst said .
there was the community in hamburg that failed because the neighborhood rejected it , and one in frankfurt that did n't get off the ground because it was too complicated , involving a care center and an old age home .
currently , berlin is working on a project similar to villa anders , but it is also different - aimed only at homosexual men , and leaning more toward the old-age home model .
" to my knowledge , we are the only one for both gays and lesbians , " juengst said .
finding middle-aged people interested in the apartments has been easy , but older gays , especially gay men , " have a lot of fear - they worry about becoming a target for violence , " juengst said .
creating a " gay ghetto " ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : cologne is home to germany 's largest gay and lesbian community indeed , some might question whether creating a multigenerational living project for gays and lesbians is the right direction to move for a city that is already known for being a european gay capital .
do such mono-culture projects help bring about integration - or create a ghetto-like atmosphere that detracts from it ?
projects organizers insist that the villa anders community is not going to be a " gay ghetto " or contribute to anti-gay sentiment in cologne .
rather , it will be a first chance for many of them to be themselves , without fear .
" the alternative for so many gays and lesbians , especially older ones , is to live hidden in plain sight , in the middle of the rest of society , " juengst said .
" maybe people whisper about them , or some even live openly .
but many just feel they can not be themselves . "
the goal , then , is to " let the community know that we are there , and we are visible .
then a dialogue can begin , " juengst added .
still , he said , the older community has been hardest to convince , especially men .
so whether or not the group can meet its state-determined quota of filling 30 percent of its apartments with seniors remains to be seen .
if they do n't fill the quota by the end of the year , then the remaining apartments - some heavily subsidized and highly desirable - could be offered to renters outside the target group . jennifer abramsohn send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

under a rainbow-colored logo and the motto " better living - we just went ahead and did it , " the project is realizing its plan to build multigenerational , mixed-income living spaces for gay , lesbian and transgender singles , couples and " rainbow " families .
the idea is to live in individual homes " but still have community , " said stefan juengst , a spokesman for the project .
so far , half of the 34 apartments , due to be completed in the autumn of 2009 , have been sold .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : organizers of villa anders want all generations included in the community the project is selective in terms of sexual identity , with living space available for gays , lesbians , transgenders - and a 15 percent quota of straight people who may be part of an otherwise gay or lesbian family constellation .
a rainbow family is " the gay equivalent of the blended family , " juegst said .
" it could be all constellations - people with children who came initially out of a heterosexual relationship , or two lesbians with a gay man together who make a deal to have children - very different models .
there are no given role models . "
but a key goal of the group is to have a mixed range of ages represented , and state funding is tied to its success .
" some people who live here will be students , others will spend their working years here , and still others will spend their golden years with us .
we want all generations , " a flyer for the project reads .
a first for germany should it succeed , villa anders would be germany 's first such center for gay living , a fact that even juengst acknowledges is surprising .
" there have been many attempts but they all failed , " juengst said .
there was the community in hamburg that failed because the neighborhood rejected it , and one in frankfurt that did n't get off the ground because it was too complicated , involving a care center and an old age home .
currently , berlin is working on a project similar to villa anders , but it is also different - aimed only at homosexual men , and leaning more toward the old-age home model .
" to my knowledge , we are the only one for both gays and lesbians , " juengst said .
finding middle-aged people interested in the apartments has been easy , but older gays , especially gay men , " have a lot of fear - they worry about becoming a target for violence , " juengst said .
creating a " gay ghetto " ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : cologne is home to germany 's largest gay and lesbian community indeed , some might question whether creating a multigenerational living project for gays and lesbians is the right direction to move for a city that is already known for being a european gay capital .
do such mono-culture projects help bring about integration - or create a ghetto-like atmosphere that detracts from it ?
projects organizers insist that the villa anders community is not going to be a " gay ghetto " or contribute to anti-gay sentiment in cologne .
rather , it will be a first chance for many of them to be themselves , without fear .
" the alternative for so many gays and lesbians , especially older ones , is to live hidden in plain sight , in the middle of the rest of society , " juengst said .
" maybe people whisper about them , or some even live openly .
but many just feel they can not be themselves . "
the goal , then , is to " let the community know that we are there , and we are visible .
then a dialogue can begin , " juengst added .

the car was discovered , battered and rusty , in a small texas town earlier this year . the car was exhibited unrestored at the audi museum in july and august this year with its velvet seats slashed open , battered door trims and rusty exterior .
it is now undergoing a complete restoration .
the car was built by hand for dr. richard bruhn , the last man at the helm of auto union , a forerunner to audi ag , one of germany 's leading luxury car manufacturers .
the chauffeur-driven limousine was based on a 1938 horch 830 bl .
horch was one of four companies that merged under the auto union label in 1932 .
later , a us soldier stationed in germany bought the car and brought it home with him to the united states .
eventually the transmission broke down and he parted company with the car .
al wilson , a car enthusiast from san angelo , texas , saved the horch from the crushers .
although he knew nothing about the horch brand , he sensed that the vehicle was something special .
and so the former manager of a shoe factory paid $ 500 -lrb- 387 euros -rrb- for it , parking it on his property along with other finds .
bringing the horch home bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germans take pride in their car heritage wilson contacted ingolstadt , the german museum in munich and a dresden-based expert .
nobody knew anything about the car .
his sons later resumed the research .
finally ralf hornung , who is responsible for buying and restoring vehicles at audi tradition , recognized the car .
" the photos clearly showed bruhn 's car , the whereabouts of which had been a mystery for decades , " hornung said , flying straight to texas .
al wilson agreed to sell it , saying : " the horch should go home . "
the car brands audi , dkw , horch and wanderer merged under the auto union label in 1932 .
in 1985 , the audi ag was established bringing together the traditional companies auto union gmbh and nsu gmbh . dw staff -lrb- th -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

under a rainbow-colored logo and the motto " better living - we just went ahead and did it , " the project is realizing its plan to build multigenerational , mixed-income living spaces for gay , lesbian and transgender singles , couples and " rainbow " families .
the idea is to live in individual homes " but still have community , " said stefan juengst , a spokesman for the project .
so far , half of the 34 apartments , due to be completed in the autumn of 2009 , have been sold .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : organizers of villa anders want all generations included in the community the project is selective in terms of sexual identity , with living space available for gays , lesbians , transgenders - and a 15 percent quota of straight people who may be part of an otherwise gay or lesbian family constellation .
a rainbow family is " the gay equivalent of the blended family , " juegst said .
" it could be all constellations - people with children who came initially out of a heterosexual relationship , or two lesbians with a gay man together who make a deal to have children - very different models .
there are no given role models . "
but a key goal of the group is to have a mixed range of ages represented , and state funding is tied to its success .
" some people who live here will be students , others will spend their working years here , and still others will spend their golden years with us .
we want all generations , " a flyer for the project reads .
a first for germany should it succeed , villa anders would be germany 's first such center for gay living , a fact that even juengst acknowledges is surprising .
" there have been many attempts but they all failed , " juengst said .
there was the community in hamburg that failed because the neighborhood rejected it , and one in frankfurt that did n't get off the ground because it was too complicated , involving a care center and an old age home .
currently , berlin is working on a project similar to villa anders , but it is also different - aimed only at homosexual men , and leaning more toward the old-age home model .
" to my knowledge , we are the only one for both gays and lesbians , " juengst said .
finding middle-aged people interested in the apartments has been easy , but older gays , especially gay men , " have a lot of fear - they worry about becoming a target for violence , " juengst said .
creating a " gay ghetto " ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : cologne is home to germany 's largest gay and lesbian community indeed , some might question whether creating a multigenerational living project for gays and lesbians is the right direction to move for a city that is already known for being a european gay capital .
do such mono-culture projects help bring about integration - or create a ghetto-like atmosphere that detracts from it ?
projects organizers insist that the villa anders community is not going to be a " gay ghetto " or contribute to anti-gay sentiment in cologne .
rather , it will be a first chance for many of them to be themselves , without fear .
" the alternative for so many gays and lesbians , especially older ones , is to live hidden in plain sight , in the middle of the rest of society , " juengst said .
" maybe people whisper about them , or some even live openly .
but many just feel they can not be themselves . "
the goal , then , is to " let the community know that we are there , and we are visible .
then a dialogue can begin , " juengst added .
still , he said , the older community has been hardest to convince , especially men .
so whether or not the group can meet its state-determined quota of filling 30 percent of its apartments with seniors remains to be seen .
if they do n't fill the quota by the end of the year , then the remaining apartments - some heavily subsidized and highly desirable - could be offered to renters outside the target group . jennifer abramsohn send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the car was discovered , battered and rusty , in a small texas town earlier this year . the car was exhibited unrestored at the audi museum in july and august this year with its velvet seats slashed open , battered door trims and rusty exterior .
it is now undergoing a complete restoration .
the car was built by hand for dr. richard bruhn , the last man at the helm of auto union , a forerunner to audi ag , one of germany 's leading luxury car manufacturers .
the chauffeur-driven limousine was based on a 1938 horch 830 bl .
horch was one of four companies that merged under the auto union label in 1932 .
later , a us soldier stationed in germany bought the car and brought it home with him to the united states .
eventually the transmission broke down and he parted company with the car .
al wilson , a car enthusiast from san angelo , texas , saved the horch from the crushers .
although he knew nothing about the horch brand , he sensed that the vehicle was something special .
and so the former manager of a shoe factory paid $ 500 -lrb- 387 euros -rrb- for it , parking it on his property along with other finds .
bringing the horch home bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germans take pride in their car heritage wilson contacted ingolstadt , the german museum in munich and a dresden-based expert .

" the photos clearly showed bruhn 's car , the whereabouts of which had been a mystery for decades , " hornung said , flying straight to texas .
al wilson agreed to sell it , saying : " the horch should go home . "

al wilson agreed to sell it , saying : " the horch should go home . "

under a rainbow-colored logo and the motto " better living - we just went ahead and did it , " the project is realizing its plan to build multigenerational , mixed-income living spaces for gay , lesbian and transgender singles , couples and " rainbow " families .
the idea is to live in individual homes " but still have community , " said stefan juengst , a spokesman for the project .
so far , half of the 34 apartments , due to be completed in the autumn of 2009 , have been sold .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : organizers of villa anders want all generations included in the community the project is selective in terms of sexual identity , with living space available for gays , lesbians , transgenders - and a 15 percent quota of straight people who may be part of an otherwise gay or lesbian family constellation .
a rainbow family is " the gay equivalent of the blended family , " juegst said .
" it could be all constellations - people with children who came initially out of a heterosexual relationship , or two lesbians with a gay man together who make a deal to have children - very different models .
there are no given role models . "
but a key goal of the group is to have a mixed range of ages represented , and state funding is tied to its success .
" some people who live here will be students , others will spend their working years here , and still others will spend their golden years with us .
we want all generations , " a flyer for the project reads .
a first for germany should it succeed , villa anders would be germany 's first such center for gay living , a fact that even juengst acknowledges is surprising .
" there have been many attempts but they all failed , " juengst said .
there was the community in hamburg that failed because the neighborhood rejected it , and one in frankfurt that did n't get off the ground because it was too complicated , involving a care center and an old age home .
currently , berlin is working on a project similar to villa anders , but it is also different - aimed only at homosexual men , and leaning more toward the old-age home model .
" to my knowledge , we are the only one for both gays and lesbians , " juengst said .
finding middle-aged people interested in the apartments has been easy , but older gays , especially gay men , " have a lot of fear - they worry about becoming a target for violence , " juengst said .
creating a " gay ghetto " ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : cologne is home to germany 's largest gay and lesbian community indeed , some might question whether creating a multigenerational living project for gays and lesbians is the right direction to move for a city that is already known for being a european gay capital .
do such mono-culture projects help bring about integration - or create a ghetto-like atmosphere that detracts from it ?
projects organizers insist that the villa anders community is not going to be a " gay ghetto " or contribute to anti-gay sentiment in cologne .
rather , it will be a first chance for many of them to be themselves , without fear .
" the alternative for so many gays and lesbians , especially older ones , is to live hidden in plain sight , in the middle of the rest of society , " juengst said .
" maybe people whisper about them , or some even live openly .
but many just feel they can not be themselves . "
the goal , then , is to " let the community know that we are there , and we are visible .
then a dialogue can begin , " juengst added .
still , he said , the older community has been hardest to convince , especially men .
so whether or not the group can meet its state-determined quota of filling 30 percent of its apartments with seniors remains to be seen .
if they do n't fill the quota by the end of the year , then the remaining apartments - some heavily subsidized and highly desirable - could be offered to renters outside the target group . jennifer abramsohn send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" it could be all constellations - people with children who came initially out of a heterosexual relationship , or two lesbians with a gay man together who make a deal to have children - very different models .
there are no given role models . "
but a key goal of the group is to have a mixed range of ages represented , and state funding is tied to its success .
" some people who live here will be students , others will spend their working years here , and still others will spend their golden years with us .
we want all generations , " a flyer for the project reads .
a first for germany should it succeed , villa anders would be germany 's first such center for gay living , a fact that even juengst acknowledges is surprising .
" there have been many attempts but they all failed , " juengst said .
there was the community in hamburg that failed because the neighborhood rejected it , and one in frankfurt that did n't get off the ground because it was too complicated , involving a care center and an old age home .
currently , berlin is working on a project similar to villa anders , but it is also different - aimed only at homosexual men , and leaning more toward the old-age home model .
" to my knowledge , we are the only one for both gays and lesbians , " juengst said .
finding middle-aged people interested in the apartments has been easy , but older gays , especially gay men , " have a lot of fear - they worry about becoming a target for violence , " juengst said .
creating a " gay ghetto " ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : cologne is home to germany 's largest gay and lesbian community indeed , some might question whether creating a multigenerational living project for gays and lesbians is the right direction to move for a city that is already known for being a european gay capital .
do such mono-culture projects help bring about integration - or create a ghetto-like atmosphere that detracts from it ?
projects organizers insist that the villa anders community is not going to be a " gay ghetto " or contribute to anti-gay sentiment in cologne .
rather , it will be a first chance for many of them to be themselves , without fear .
" the alternative for so many gays and lesbians , especially older ones , is to live hidden in plain sight , in the middle of the rest of society , " juengst said .
" maybe people whisper about them , or some even live openly .
but many just feel they can not be themselves . "
the goal , then , is to " let the community know that we are there , and we are visible .
then a dialogue can begin , " juengst added .
still , he said , the older community has been hardest to convince , especially men .
so whether or not the group can meet its state-determined quota of filling 30 percent of its apartments with seniors remains to be seen .
if they do n't fill the quota by the end of the year , then the remaining apartments - some heavily subsidized and highly desirable - could be offered to renters outside the target group . jennifer abramsohn send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

under a rainbow-colored logo and the motto " better living - we just went ahead and did it , " the project is realizing its plan to build multigenerational , mixed-income living spaces for gay , lesbian and transgender singles , couples and " rainbow " families .
the idea is to live in individual homes " but still have community , " said stefan juengst , a spokesman for the project .
so far , half of the 34 apartments , due to be completed in the autumn of 2009 , have been sold .

under a rainbow-colored logo and the motto " better living - we just went ahead and did it , " the project is realizing its plan to build multigenerational , mixed-income living spaces for gay , lesbian and transgender singles , couples and " rainbow " families .
the idea is to live in individual homes " but still have community , " said stefan juengst , a spokesman for the project .
so far , half of the 34 apartments , due to be completed in the autumn of 2009 , have been sold .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : organizers of villa anders want all generations included in the community the project is selective in terms of sexual identity , with living space available for gays , lesbians , transgenders - and a 15 percent quota of straight people who may be part of an otherwise gay or lesbian family constellation .
a rainbow family is " the gay equivalent of the blended family , " juegst said .
" it could be all constellations - people with children who came initially out of a heterosexual relationship , or two lesbians with a gay man together who make a deal to have children - very different models .
there are no given role models . "
but a key goal of the group is to have a mixed range of ages represented , and state funding is tied to its success .
" some people who live here will be students , others will spend their working years here , and still others will spend their golden years with us .
we want all generations , " a flyer for the project reads .
a first for germany should it succeed , villa anders would be germany 's first such center for gay living , a fact that even juengst acknowledges is surprising .
" there have been many attempts but they all failed , " juengst said .
there was the community in hamburg that failed because the neighborhood rejected it , and one in frankfurt that did n't get off the ground because it was too complicated , involving a care center and an old age home .
currently , berlin is working on a project similar to villa anders , but it is also different - aimed only at homosexual men , and leaning more toward the old-age home model .
" to my knowledge , we are the only one for both gays and lesbians , " juengst said .
finding middle-aged people interested in the apartments has been easy , but older gays , especially gay men , " have a lot of fear - they worry about becoming a target for violence , " juengst said .
creating a " gay ghetto " ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : cologne is home to germany 's largest gay and lesbian community indeed , some might question whether creating a multigenerational living project for gays and lesbians is the right direction to move for a city that is already known for being a european gay capital .
do such mono-culture projects help bring about integration - or create a ghetto-like atmosphere that detracts from it ?
projects organizers insist that the villa anders community is not going to be a " gay ghetto " or contribute to anti-gay sentiment in cologne .
rather , it will be a first chance for many of them to be themselves , without fear .
" the alternative for so many gays and lesbians , especially older ones , is to live hidden in plain sight , in the middle of the rest of society , " juengst said .
" maybe people whisper about them , or some even live openly .
but many just feel they can not be themselves . "
the goal , then , is to " let the community know that we are there , and we are visible .
then a dialogue can begin , " juengst added .
still , he said , the older community has been hardest to convince , especially men .
so whether or not the group can meet its state-determined quota of filling 30 percent of its apartments with seniors remains to be seen .
if they do n't fill the quota by the end of the year , then the remaining apartments - some heavily subsidized and highly desirable - could be offered to renters outside the target group . jennifer abramsohn send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

i will make my final assessment after that , " loew said on the web site of the german soccer federation dfb .

ballack , who is currently sidelined with a foot injury , said he wanted to support his long-time midfield partner frings and to speak about issues " which are important for me as captain . "

" the government has said the auto and construction industries could get help .
a working group has agreed to boost building renovation work and infrastructure projects , the weekly der spiegel reported , without citing sources . but according to a german newspaper report on sunday , oct 26 , a rift is emerging in the ruling coalition between the finance and economy ministers about the kind of stimulus measures to take and where to apply them . finance minister rejects tax cuts finance minister peer steinbrueck , a social democrat , rejects proposals by the conservative economy minister for income tax cuts and making health insurance contributions tax-deductible from 2009 , the welt am sonntag paper reported . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : steinbrueck has warned the financial crisis could drag on until late 2009 supported by chancellor merkel , steinbrueck , believes the german economy - the world 's third biggest - is too large to be helped by " 1980s recipes " and that measures stimulating investment would work better , the paper said . " ten billion euros -lrb- $ 13 billion -rrb- in tax cuts wo n't change anything in an economy with an output of 2.5 trillion euros , " the paper cites government sources as saying . separately , news magazine der spiegel reported over the weekend that the social democratic party , including steinbreuck prefers measures to protect jobs .
the magazine said the party was pushing for a reduction in unemployment insurance contributions . steinbrueck and economy minister michael glos were due to present their proposals to a cabinet meeting early this week with a view to a package of measures being approved by november 5 , the paper said . gloomy economic news the wrangling over a stimulus program for specific sectors of the economy comes amid a slew of bad economic news . german luxury carmakers daimler and bmw said over the weekend they would temporarily close factories as a result of slumping sales .
general motors ' german arm , opel , has also announced output cuts , as have volkswagen 's spanish subsidiary seat and czech subsidiary skoda . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany 's carmakers have been hit hard by the economic crisis earlier this month , glos slashed his forecast for growth in 2009 to just 0.2 percent from his previous projection of 1.2 percent , the slowest rate of growth since the 2003 recession when the german economy contracted by 0.2 percent . finance minister steinbrueck too predicted a gloomy future for germany over the weekend , saying the crisis would last at least until late 2009 and it would take years for germany to guage the real costs of its massive bank bailout . on friday , germany 's deutsche bank predicted a severe recession in germany .
the bank 's research arm expects output in germany - which makes up around a third of the eurozone economy - to shrink by 1.5 percent next year , saturday 's berliner zeitung reported . ulrich kater , chief economist of the dekabank told newspaper bild that the german economy had already slipped into a recession in the third quarter of 2008 . over a week ago , the german government rushed through a 500-billion-euro bailout package for its troubled banks .
since then , only the bavarian public bank , bayernlb , has sought state aid , requesting 5.4 billion euros . media reports said two more regional public banks were considering asking for help under the government 's rescue package . dw staff -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

but a personal meeting is more important .
i will make my final assessment after that , " loew said on the web site of the german soccer federation dfb .

werder bremen 's frings also attacked loew over the issue but loew insisted that other players needed to be fielded as well to have a strong team for the 2010 world cup .
loew also said that no one was guaranteed a place in the starting 11 .
frings , who was one of the german stars in 2006 when they finished third at the world cup , has said that he is not disappointed with having been dropped or not been given enough playing time .
" i am upset about the way in which this was handled , the way in which i was treated .
that should not happen , " frings told reporters this week .
the row over the treatment of senior players erupted after loew left kevin kuranyi on the bench for germany 's world cup qualifier against russia this month .
kuranyi walked out on the team while the match was still going on , bringing his international career to an end .
ballack , who is currently sidelined with a foot injury , said he wanted to support his long-time midfield partner frings and to speak about issues " which are important for me as captain . "

the car was discovered , battered and rusty , in a small texas town earlier this year . the car was exhibited unrestored at the audi museum in july and august this year with its velvet seats slashed open , battered door trims and rusty exterior .
it is now undergoing a complete restoration .
the car was built by hand for dr. richard bruhn , the last man at the helm of auto union , a forerunner to audi ag , one of germany 's leading luxury car manufacturers .
the chauffeur-driven limousine was based on a 1938 horch 830 bl .
horch was one of four companies that merged under the auto union label in 1932 .
later , a us soldier stationed in germany bought the car and brought it home with him to the united states .
eventually the transmission broke down and he parted company with the car .
al wilson , a car enthusiast from san angelo , texas , saved the horch from the crushers .
although he knew nothing about the horch brand , he sensed that the vehicle was something special .
and so the former manager of a shoe factory paid $ 500 -lrb- 387 euros -rrb- for it , parking it on his property along with other finds .
bringing the horch home bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germans take pride in their car heritage wilson contacted ingolstadt , the german museum in munich and a dresden-based expert .
nobody knew anything about the car .
his sons later resumed the research .
finally ralf hornung , who is responsible for buying and restoring vehicles at audi tradition , recognized the car .
" the photos clearly showed bruhn 's car , the whereabouts of which had been a mystery for decades , " hornung said , flying straight to texas .
al wilson agreed to sell it , saying : " the horch should go home . "
the car brands audi , dkw , horch and wanderer merged under the auto union label in 1932 .
in 1985 , the audi ag was established bringing together the traditional companies auto union gmbh and nsu gmbh . dw staff -lrb- th -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

under a rainbow-colored logo and the motto " better living - we just went ahead and did it , " the project is realizing its plan to build multigenerational , mixed-income living spaces for gay , lesbian and transgender singles , couples and " rainbow " families .
the idea is to live in individual homes " but still have community , " said stefan juengst , a spokesman for the project .
so far , half of the 34 apartments , due to be completed in the autumn of 2009 , have been sold .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : organizers of villa anders want all generations included in the community the project is selective in terms of sexual identity , with living space available for gays , lesbians , transgenders - and a 15 percent quota of straight people who may be part of an otherwise gay or lesbian family constellation .
a rainbow family is " the gay equivalent of the blended family , " juegst said .
" it could be all constellations - people with children who came initially out of a heterosexual relationship , or two lesbians with a gay man together who make a deal to have children - very different models .
there are no given role models . "
but a key goal of the group is to have a mixed range of ages represented , and state funding is tied to its success .
" some people who live here will be students , others will spend their working years here , and still others will spend their golden years with us .
we want all generations , " a flyer for the project reads .
a first for germany should it succeed , villa anders would be germany 's first such center for gay living , a fact that even juengst acknowledges is surprising .
" there have been many attempts but they all failed , " juengst said .
there was the community in hamburg that failed because the neighborhood rejected it , and one in frankfurt that did n't get off the ground because it was too complicated , involving a care center and an old age home .
currently , berlin is working on a project similar to villa anders , but it is also different - aimed only at homosexual men , and leaning more toward the old-age home model .
" to my knowledge , we are the only one for both gays and lesbians , " juengst said .
finding middle-aged people interested in the apartments has been easy , but older gays , especially gay men , " have a lot of fear - they worry about becoming a target for violence , " juengst said .
creating a " gay ghetto " ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : cologne is home to germany 's largest gay and lesbian community indeed , some might question whether creating a multigenerational living project for gays and lesbians is the right direction to move for a city that is already known for being a european gay capital .
do such mono-culture projects help bring about integration - or create a ghetto-like atmosphere that detracts from it ?
projects organizers insist that the villa anders community is not going to be a " gay ghetto " or contribute to anti-gay sentiment in cologne .
rather , it will be a first chance for many of them to be themselves , without fear .
" the alternative for so many gays and lesbians , especially older ones , is to live hidden in plain sight , in the middle of the rest of society , " juengst said .
" maybe people whisper about them , or some even live openly .
but many just feel they can not be themselves . "
the goal , then , is to " let the community know that we are there , and we are visible .
then a dialogue can begin , " juengst added .
still , he said , the older community has been hardest to convince , especially men .
so whether or not the group can meet its state-determined quota of filling 30 percent of its apartments with seniors remains to be seen .
if they do n't fill the quota by the end of the year , then the remaining apartments - some heavily subsidized and highly desirable - could be offered to renters outside the target group . jennifer abramsohn send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

under a rainbow-colored logo and the motto " better living - we just went ahead and did it , " the project is realizing its plan to build multigenerational , mixed-income living spaces for gay , lesbian and transgender singles , couples and " rainbow " families .
the idea is to live in individual homes " but still have community , " said stefan juengst , a spokesman for the project .
so far , half of the 34 apartments , due to be completed in the autumn of 2009 , have been sold .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : organizers of villa anders want all generations included in the community the project is selective in terms of sexual identity , with living space available for gays , lesbians , transgenders - and a 15 percent quota of straight people who may be part of an otherwise gay or lesbian family constellation .
a rainbow family is " the gay equivalent of the blended family , " juegst said .
" it could be all constellations - people with children who came initially out of a heterosexual relationship , or two lesbians with a gay man together who make a deal to have children - very different models .
there are no given role models . "
but a key goal of the group is to have a mixed range of ages represented , and state funding is tied to its success .
" some people who live here will be students , others will spend their working years here , and still others will spend their golden years with us .
we want all generations , " a flyer for the project reads .
a first for germany should it succeed , villa anders would be germany 's first such center for gay living , a fact that even juengst acknowledges is surprising .
" there have been many attempts but they all failed , " juengst said .
there was the community in hamburg that failed because the neighborhood rejected it , and one in frankfurt that did n't get off the ground because it was too complicated , involving a care center and an old age home .
currently , berlin is working on a project similar to villa anders , but it is also different - aimed only at homosexual men , and leaning more toward the old-age home model .
" to my knowledge , we are the only one for both gays and lesbians , " juengst said .
finding middle-aged people interested in the apartments has been easy , but older gays , especially gay men , " have a lot of fear - they worry about becoming a target for violence , " juengst said .
creating a " gay ghetto " ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : cologne is home to germany 's largest gay and lesbian community indeed , some might question whether creating a multigenerational living project for gays and lesbians is the right direction to move for a city that is already known for being a european gay capital .
do such mono-culture projects help bring about integration - or create a ghetto-like atmosphere that detracts from it ?
projects organizers insist that the villa anders community is not going to be a " gay ghetto " or contribute to anti-gay sentiment in cologne .
rather , it will be a first chance for many of them to be themselves , without fear .
" the alternative for so many gays and lesbians , especially older ones , is to live hidden in plain sight , in the middle of the rest of society , " juengst said .
" maybe people whisper about them , or some even live openly .
but many just feel they can not be themselves . "
the goal , then , is to " let the community know that we are there , and we are visible .
then a dialogue can begin , " juengst added .
still , he said , the older community has been hardest to convince , especially men .
so whether or not the group can meet its state-determined quota of filling 30 percent of its apartments with seniors remains to be seen .
if they do n't fill the quota by the end of the year , then the remaining apartments - some heavily subsidized and highly desirable - could be offered to renters outside the target group . jennifer abramsohn send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de museums -pipe- 26.10.2008 lost horch limousine brought from texas to germany großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : once restored , the car will look a lot like this one the last example of a rare 1953 horch is undergoing restoration at the audi museum in ingolstadt , germany .
the car was discovered , battered and rusty , in a small texas town earlier this year . the car was exhibited unrestored at the audi museum in july and august this year with its velvet seats slashed open , battered door trims and rusty exterior .
it is now undergoing a complete restoration .
the car was built by hand for dr. richard bruhn , the last man at the helm of auto union , a forerunner to audi ag , one of germany 's leading luxury car manufacturers .
the chauffeur-driven limousine was based on a 1938 horch 830 bl .
horch was one of four companies that merged under the auto union label in 1932 .
later , a us soldier stationed in germany bought the car and brought it home with him to the united states .
eventually the transmission broke down and he parted company with the car .
al wilson , a car enthusiast from san angelo , texas , saved the horch from the crushers .
although he knew nothing about the horch brand , he sensed that the vehicle was something special .
and so the former manager of a shoe factory paid $ 500 -lrb- 387 euros -rrb- for it , parking it on his property along with other finds .
bringing the horch home bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germans take pride in their car heritage wilson contacted ingolstadt , the german museum in munich and a dresden-based expert .
nobody knew anything about the car .
his sons later resumed the research .
finally ralf hornung , who is responsible for buying and restoring vehicles at audi tradition , recognized the car .
" the photos clearly showed bruhn 's car , the whereabouts of which had been a mystery for decades , " hornung said , flying straight to texas .

under a rainbow-colored logo and the motto " better living - we just went ahead and did it , " the project is realizing its plan to build multigenerational , mixed-income living spaces for gay , lesbian and transgender singles , couples and " rainbow " families .
the idea is to live in individual homes " but still have community , " said stefan juengst , a spokesman for the project .
so far , half of the 34 apartments , due to be completed in the autumn of 2009 , have been sold .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : organizers of villa anders want all generations included in the community the project is selective in terms of sexual identity , with living space available for gays , lesbians , transgenders - and a 15 percent quota of straight people who may be part of an otherwise gay or lesbian family constellation .
a rainbow family is " the gay equivalent of the blended family , " juegst said .
" it could be all constellations - people with children who came initially out of a heterosexual relationship , or two lesbians with a gay man together who make a deal to have children - very different models .
there are no given role models . "
but a key goal of the group is to have a mixed range of ages represented , and state funding is tied to its success .
" some people who live here will be students , others will spend their working years here , and still others will spend their golden years with us .
we want all generations , " a flyer for the project reads .
a first for germany should it succeed , villa anders would be germany 's first such center for gay living , a fact that even juengst acknowledges is surprising .
" there have been many attempts but they all failed , " juengst said .
there was the community in hamburg that failed because the neighborhood rejected it , and one in frankfurt that did n't get off the ground because it was too complicated , involving a care center and an old age home .
currently , berlin is working on a project similar to villa anders , but it is also different - aimed only at homosexual men , and leaning more toward the old-age home model .
" to my knowledge , we are the only one for both gays and lesbians , " juengst said .
finding middle-aged people interested in the apartments has been easy , but older gays , especially gay men , " have a lot of fear - they worry about becoming a target for violence , " juengst said .
creating a " gay ghetto " ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : cologne is home to germany 's largest gay and lesbian community indeed , some might question whether creating a multigenerational living project for gays and lesbians is the right direction to move for a city that is already known for being a european gay capital .
do such mono-culture projects help bring about integration - or create a ghetto-like atmosphere that detracts from it ?
projects organizers insist that the villa anders community is not going to be a " gay ghetto " or contribute to anti-gay sentiment in cologne .
rather , it will be a first chance for many of them to be themselves , without fear .
" the alternative for so many gays and lesbians , especially older ones , is to live hidden in plain sight , in the middle of the rest of society , " juengst said .
" maybe people whisper about them , or some even live openly .
but many just feel they can not be themselves . "
the goal , then , is to " let the community know that we are there , and we are visible .
then a dialogue can begin , " juengst added .
still , he said , the older community has been hardest to convince , especially men .
so whether or not the group can meet its state-determined quota of filling 30 percent of its apartments with seniors remains to be seen .
if they do n't fill the quota by the end of the year , then the remaining apartments - some heavily subsidized and highly desirable - could be offered to renters outside the target group . jennifer abramsohn send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

under a rainbow-colored logo and the motto " better living - we just went ahead and did it , " the project is realizing its plan to build multigenerational , mixed-income living spaces for gay , lesbian and transgender singles , couples and " rainbow " families .
the idea is to live in individual homes " but still have community , " said stefan juengst , a spokesman for the project .
so far , half of the 34 apartments , due to be completed in the autumn of 2009 , have been sold .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : organizers of villa anders want all generations included in the community the project is selective in terms of sexual identity , with living space available for gays , lesbians , transgenders - and a 15 percent quota of straight people who may be part of an otherwise gay or lesbian family constellation .
a rainbow family is " the gay equivalent of the blended family , " juegst said .
" it could be all constellations - people with children who came initially out of a heterosexual relationship , or two lesbians with a gay man together who make a deal to have children - very different models .
there are no given role models . "
but a key goal of the group is to have a mixed range of ages represented , and state funding is tied to its success .
" some people who live here will be students , others will spend their working years here , and still others will spend their golden years with us .
we want all generations , " a flyer for the project reads .
a first for germany should it succeed , villa anders would be germany 's first such center for gay living , a fact that even juengst acknowledges is surprising .
" there have been many attempts but they all failed , " juengst said .
there was the community in hamburg that failed because the neighborhood rejected it , and one in frankfurt that did n't get off the ground because it was too complicated , involving a care center and an old age home .
currently , berlin is working on a project similar to villa anders , but it is also different - aimed only at homosexual men , and leaning more toward the old-age home model .
" to my knowledge , we are the only one for both gays and lesbians , " juengst said .
finding middle-aged people interested in the apartments has been easy , but older gays , especially gay men , " have a lot of fear - they worry about becoming a target for violence , " juengst said .
creating a " gay ghetto " ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : cologne is home to germany 's largest gay and lesbian community indeed , some might question whether creating a multigenerational living project for gays and lesbians is the right direction to move for a city that is already known for being a european gay capital .
do such mono-culture projects help bring about integration - or create a ghetto-like atmosphere that detracts from it ?
projects organizers insist that the villa anders community is not going to be a " gay ghetto " or contribute to anti-gay sentiment in cologne .
rather , it will be a first chance for many of them to be themselves , without fear .
" the alternative for so many gays and lesbians , especially older ones , is to live hidden in plain sight , in the middle of the rest of society , " juengst said .
" maybe people whisper about them , or some even live openly .
but many just feel they can not be themselves . "
the goal , then , is to " let the community know that we are there , and we are visible .
then a dialogue can begin , " juengst added .
still , he said , the older community has been hardest to convince , especially men .
so whether or not the group can meet its state-determined quota of filling 30 percent of its apartments with seniors remains to be seen .
if they do n't fill the quota by the end of the year , then the remaining apartments - some heavily subsidized and highly desirable - could be offered to renters outside the target group . jennifer abramsohn send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

ballack , who is currently sidelined with a foot injury , said he wanted to support his long-time midfield partner frings and to speak about issues " which are important for me as captain . "

a working group has agreed to boost building renovation work and infrastructure projects , the weekly der spiegel reported , without citing sources . but according to a german newspaper report on sunday , oct 26 , a rift is emerging in the ruling coalition between the finance and economy ministers about the kind of stimulus measures to take and where to apply them . finance minister rejects tax cuts finance minister peer steinbrueck , a social democrat , rejects proposals by the conservative economy minister for income tax cuts and making health insurance contributions tax-deductible from 2009 , the welt am sonntag paper reported . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : steinbrueck has warned the financial crisis could drag on until late 2009 supported by chancellor merkel , steinbrueck , believes the german economy - the world 's third biggest - is too large to be helped by " 1980s recipes " and that measures stimulating investment would work better , the paper said .

" the government has said the auto and construction industries could get help .
a working group has agreed to boost building renovation work and infrastructure projects , the weekly der spiegel reported , without citing sources . but according to a german newspaper report on sunday , oct 26 , a rift is emerging in the ruling coalition between the finance and economy ministers about the kind of stimulus measures to take and where to apply them . finance minister rejects tax cuts finance minister peer steinbrueck , a social democrat , rejects proposals by the conservative economy minister for income tax cuts and making health insurance contributions tax-deductible from 2009 , the welt am sonntag paper reported . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : steinbrueck has warned the financial crisis could drag on until late 2009 supported by chancellor merkel , steinbrueck , believes the german economy - the world 's third biggest - is too large to be helped by " 1980s recipes " and that measures stimulating investment would work better , the paper said . " ten billion euros -lrb- $ 13 billion -rrb- in tax cuts wo n't change anything in an economy with an output of 2.5 trillion euros , " the paper cites government sources as saying . separately , news magazine der spiegel reported over the weekend that the social democratic party , including steinbreuck prefers measures to protect jobs .
the magazine said the party was pushing for a reduction in unemployment insurance contributions . steinbrueck and economy minister michael glos were due to present their proposals to a cabinet meeting early this week with a view to a package of measures being approved by november 5 , the paper said . gloomy economic news the wrangling over a stimulus program for specific sectors of the economy comes amid a slew of bad economic news . german luxury carmakers daimler and bmw said over the weekend they would temporarily close factories as a result of slumping sales .
general motors ' german arm , opel , has also announced output cuts , as have volkswagen 's spanish subsidiary seat and czech subsidiary skoda . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany 's carmakers have been hit hard by the economic crisis earlier this month , glos slashed his forecast for growth in 2009 to just 0.2 percent from his previous projection of 1.2 percent , the slowest rate of growth since the 2003 recession when the german economy contracted by 0.2 percent . finance minister steinbrueck too predicted a gloomy future for germany over the weekend , saying the crisis would last at least until late 2009 and it would take years for germany to guage the real costs of its massive bank bailout . on friday , germany 's deutsche bank predicted a severe recession in germany .
the bank 's research arm expects output in germany - which makes up around a third of the eurozone economy - to shrink by 1.5 percent next year , saturday 's berliner zeitung reported . ulrich kater , chief economist of the dekabank told newspaper bild that the german economy had already slipped into a recession in the third quarter of 2008 . over a week ago , the german government rushed through a 500-billion-euro bailout package for its troubled banks .
since then , only the bavarian public bank , bayernlb , has sought state aid , requesting 5.4 billion euros . media reports said two more regional public banks were considering asking for help under the government 's rescue package . dw staff -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

police , who estimate that some 6,000 people attended sunday 's ceremony , said there were no protests . in an inaugural speech , the premier of north rhine westphalia juergen ruettgers , affirmed the right of 3.3 million muslims in germany to build mosques as big as they liked . " we need more mosques in this country , not in inner courtyards , but visible and recognizable ones , " he said . glass windows , no loudspeakers bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german politicians welcomed the new mosque the opening of the mosque could not have been more different from the controversy surrounding a planned one in nearby cologne .
in that city , some civic leaders have charged that a planned mosque is " too big . "
the city witnessed violent rioting last month as far rightists vainly attempted to hold an anti-islam rally . officials say ethnic turkish muslims form a major group in gritty , working-class duisburg , an old coal and steel town , as opposed to their affluent , middle-class counterparts in cologne , 55 kilometers away . in the duisburg suburb of marxloh where the mosque was built , muslims make up about one-third of the 18,000 residents . the designers of the 7.5-million-euro -lrb- $ 9.4-million -rrb- complex forestalled german criticisms by including plate-glass windows to make the mosque 's inner workings more visible . there will also be no muezzin calling to prayer by loudspeaker from the duisburg mosque 's 34-metre minaret , a practice that some anti-mosque groups elsewhere have seized on . the state government and the european union pumped in 3 million euros in subsidies for the complex , which includes a community centre , café and the mosque itself capped with several ottoman-style domes . another 4 million euros was contributed by muslim faithful in an international fund raising drive . dpa news agency -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the recommendation comes in a report on using biomass for heating and fuel while avoiding the use of valuable agricultural land .
scientists want to see pilot farms and research into the most energy-rich types of seaweed .
the report was carried out by the scottish association for marine science for the crown estate .
prof mike cowling , science and research manager at the crown estate , said : " given scotland 's rugged western coastline and island groups , and relatively clean seas , it is sensible to examine the farming of seaweeds and sustainable harvesting of natural supplies as a source of energy , to heat our homes and fuel our vehicles . "
extracting energy from seaweed is a particularly efficient and reliable method of producing green energy " prof mike cowling the crown estate " heating and transport make up around three quarters of our energy use so it 's vital that we find new ways of meeting that demand .
" extracting energy from seaweed is a particularly efficient and reliable method of producing green energy , and the growing of seaweed could have positive impact on local marine biodiversity . "
one key advantage of using seaweed is that it avoids the problems associated with agricultural crop biofuels such as pressure on arable land and fresh water .
dundee university professor of microbiology geoffrey codd has also been promoting the idea of using seaweed and other algae as fuel .
he feels the practice could help revive traditional uk industries such as harvesting seaweed and create viable and sustainable biofuel sources .
the crown estate owns almost all of the seabed out to 12 nautical miles and has rights on energy development out to 200 nautical miles .
it recently opened up the pentland firth seabed for leasing to developers , with interest shown in creating a massive underwater tidal farm .

the kopernikus programme is dedicated to acquiring and collating satellite data on the health of the planet .
although britain says it recognises the project 's high value , especially for monitoring the climate , it has so far declined to take a lead in the venture .
industry and academia have called for a swift change in government policy .
failure to adopt a more positive approach before a critical meeting of europe 's space ministers next month will put expertise and jobs in the uk at risk , they warn .
" we had a chance three years ago to play a major role in this programme and i 'm afraid it looks as though we are about to let slip another opportunity , " said dr mike healy from eads astrium , the largest space company in the uk .
global view kopernikus is a joint endeavour of the european space agency -lrb- esa -rrb- and the european commission .
it is building a coordinated system for earth observation and monitoring . "
we have a few weeks left before the ministerial to try to put this right " colin challen mp it will pull together all the information obtained by environmental satellites , air and ground stations to provide a comprehensive picture of the planet .
its quest is to generate continuous , cross-calibrated , long-term data-sets that can be used to inform european policies to deal with global change .
new satellites are being ordered to fill in data gaps .
but kopernikus will cost in excess of two billion euros and the uk , despite its claim to lead on climate issues , has been reluctant to invest in the project .
it passed up the opportunity to drive the programme when it was initiated in 2005 , and figures in industry and academia have told the bbc that the noises coming from within government indicate the uk will also give the second phase only limited financial support .
it has been suggested there may be as little as 40m euros on the table from britain when the member states of esa meet in the hague at the end of november to declare their positions .
leadership question kopernikus supporters were hoping there might be funds in excess of 100m euros .
" one wonders if europe will get anything from the uk , frankly , " a depressed colin challen mp told bbc news .
" at the present time , we can claim scientific leadership on climate matters , in the hadley centre -lrb- a climate modelling facility -rrb- and at a great many other institutions in the uk that are doing a lot of extremely valuable work .

the kopernikus programme is dedicated to acquiring and collating satellite data on the health of the planet .
although britain says it recognises the project 's high value , especially for monitoring the climate , it has so far declined to take a lead in the venture .
industry and academia have called for a swift change in government policy .
failure to adopt a more positive approach before a critical meeting of europe 's space ministers next month will put expertise and jobs in the uk at risk , they warn .
" we had a chance three years ago to play a major role in this programme and i 'm afraid it looks as though we are about to let slip another opportunity , " said dr mike healy from eads astrium , the largest space company in the uk .
global view kopernikus is a joint endeavour of the european space agency -lrb- esa -rrb- and the european commission .
it is building a coordinated system for earth observation and monitoring .
we have a few weeks left before the ministerial to try to put this right colin challen mp it will pull together all the information obtained by environmental satellites , air and ground stations to provide a comprehensive picture of the planet .
its quest is to generate continuous , cross-calibrated , long-term data-sets that can be used to inform european policies to deal with global change .
new satellites are being ordered to fill in data gaps .
but kopernikus will cost in excess of two billion euros and the uk , despite its claim to lead on climate issues , has been reluctant to invest in the project .
it passed up the opportunity to drive the programme when it was initiated in 2005 , and figures in industry and academia have told the bbc that the noises coming from within government indicate the uk will also give the second phase only limited financial support .
it has been suggested there may be as little as 40m euros on the table from britain when the member states of esa meet in the hague at the end of november to declare their positions .
leadership question kopernikus supporters were hoping there might be funds in excess of 100m euros .
" one wonders if europe will get anything from the uk , frankly , " a depressed colin challen mp told bbc news .
" at the present time , we can claim scientific leadership on climate matters , in the hadley centre -lrb- a climate modelling facility -rrb- and at a great many other institutions in the uk that are doing a lot of extremely valuable work .
what is kopernikus ?
joint venture of european union and european space agency pulls together all earth-monitoring data , from space and ground will use existing and newly commissioned spacecraft crucial to the understanding of how our climate is changing important for disaster monitoring - earthquakes , floods , fires , etc an enforcement tool for eu policies : fishing quotas , etc old name : global monitoring for environment and security -lrb- gmes -rrb- " but this kind of investment is about keeping us at the forefront , " said the chair of the all party parliamentary group on climate change .
" maybe that does n't matter ; maybe it 's ok for the rest of europe to do this job and for us to just freeload .
but then we wo n't be able to claim we are the world leaders on tackling climate change . "
for the uk 's earth observation scientists , the government 's position is baffling .
professor shaun quegan from sheffield university said that britain was losing influence in kopernikus .
satellite instruments that would obtain key climate and pollution data , and which the uk would excel at building , risked being sidelined , he warned .
" dealing with climate change is n't just about running -lsb- computer -rsb- models ; it 's about actually getting the data .
it 's the data which keeps the models honest , if you like , " professor quegan told bbc news .
" if we 're saying climate is a major scientific issue and the uk is a serious player in this , but then we 're choosing not to take part in the observational system that is needed - well , basically , we are talking the talk and not walking the walk . "
" real data " is needed from satellites to keep the computer models " honest " for industry , the unwillingness of the uk to commit to kopernikus has a very direct and negative impact .
because esa programmes operate on a juste retour -lrb- fair return -rrb- basis , those countries which contribute most to programmes can be guaranteed to get the biggest contracts to build satellites and support systems .
sentinel-1 will be built in italy in britain 's case , the flip-side applies : its low subscription means its companies get less work .
astrium uk watched the contract for the first dedicated kopernikus satellite go to an italian company even though the british outfit had done the early research work .
" the last ministerial was disastrous for us , " said dr healy .
" ok , we 've been pretty successful recently - we 've won quite a bit of commercial work - but institutional funding is very important to us ; it accounts for 30 % of what we do .
to have two disastrous ministerials in a row would erode our long-term competitive position . "
last efforts kopernikus is often held up as the classic illustration of what is wrong with british space policy .
whereas germany , france and italy have national space agencies that speak with single voices backed up by single budgets , the uk 's approach is to devolve space policy decisions to a club of " users " .
these users are the government departments and research councils that have interests in space science or space-borne services .
the arrangement is supposed to ensure that limited space funding chases " need " and not " vanity " .
but critics say the inability of this club to adopt coherent positions on complex programmes such as kopernikus means that uk delegations often find themselves marginalised when they go into international negotiations .
colin challen intends to put down an early day motion in the commons on tuesday to bring attention to the kopernikus issue .
" we have a few weeks left before the ministerial to try to put this right , " he explained .
the department for environment , food and rural affairs -lrb- defra -rrb- is the lead user on kopernikus in the uk .
a spokesperson said : " the uk government is committed to supporting this valuable environmental monitoring programme and no final funding decisions have yet been taken . "

labour am joyce watson is " appalled " that key stroke association services are not commissioned in those areas .
the scheme gives practical help and emotional support to stroke surviors and their families .
powys lhb said its service lapsed amid recruitment problems and it is working to develop appropriate services .
among those calling for a better service is ken goodman , who had a stroke three-and-a-half years ago .
he and others at positive action for stroke cardigan told the bbc 's politics show wales there was a great need for rehabilitation services in ceredigion .
mr goodman said : " this area is really really bad when you 've got this stroke .
i 'm really just left on my own .
it 's really hard .
" if i went to my mother 's in kent , there 's hundreds of things .
they are letting the most vulnerable of people down joyce watson am " she said to me , ' come here ! '
i said , ' no , because of my property i have to be there ' .
but there 's nothing .
there is nothing . "
only one of the services is available in pembrokeshire .
mid and west wales am ms watson said : " people have a stroke and unfortunately they lose the power of speech .
" now that can come back and it can be replaced with good therapy at the right time . "
" if you happen to be in powys at the moment and if you happen to be in ceredigion or pembrokeshire you will not have the opportunity to find your speech again . "
' very bad news ' the stroke association 's communication support services help people learn to speak again , and its family and carer support scheme aids survivors and their relatives .
leighton veale of the stroke association said : " in ceredigion and powys in particular we 've got no services at all .
" they are the only counties in wales where we have no services on the ground .
" obviously for local stroke survivors that 's very bad news . "
ms watson claimed that local health boards -lrb- lhbs -rrb- had the money to commission these services but " have n't got their act together " , a situation she described as " appalling " .
she said : " i think there is no excuse and i think it 's really poor management in this case , especially in terms of commissioning .
" they are letting the most vulnerable of people down , people who can not actually , through their illness , even ask for themselves . "
powys lhb said its their service lapsed when it had difficulty recruiting following retirement and long-term sickness of workers .
it said it was working to develop appropriate services .
but while mr veale is aware that local health bodies sometimes face difficult choices with the funds they receive from the welsh assembly government , he said it was not enough simply to blame local commissioners .
mr veale said : " it is decided locally whether they want to commission services or not but obviously there is a financial issue from the welsh assembly government as well . "
ms watson said she had been assured by health minister edwina hart that the lack of these services illustrated the need for central commissioning and a move away from the internal market in healthcare , which is part of the assembly government 's plan to reorganise the welsh nhs .

labour am joyce watson is " appalled " that key stroke association services are not commissioned in those areas .
the scheme gives practical help and emotional support to stroke surviors and their families .
powys lhb said its service lapsed amid recruitment problems and it is working to develop appropriate services .
among those calling for a better service is ken goodman , who had a stroke three-and-a-half years ago .
he and others at positive action for stroke cardigan told the bbc 's politics show wales there was a great need for rehabilitation services in ceredigion .
mr goodman said : " this area is really really bad when you 've got this stroke .
i 'm really just left on my own .
it 's really hard .
" if i went to my mother 's in kent , there 's hundreds of things .
they are letting the most vulnerable of people down joyce watson am " she said to me , ' come here ! '
i said , ' no , because of my property i have to be there ' .
but there 's nothing .
there is nothing . "
only one of the services is available in pembrokeshire .
mid and west wales am ms watson said : " people have a stroke and unfortunately they lose the power of speech .
" now that can come back and it can be replaced with good therapy at the right time . "
" if you happen to be in powys at the moment and if you happen to be in ceredigion or pembrokeshire you will not have the opportunity to find your speech again . "
' very bad news ' the stroke association 's communication support services help people learn to speak again , and its family and carer support scheme aids survivors and their relatives .
leighton veale of the stroke association said : " in ceredigion and powys in particular we 've got no services at all .
" they are the only counties in wales where we have no services on the ground .
" obviously for local stroke survivors that 's very bad news . "
ms watson claimed that local health boards -lrb- lhbs -rrb- had the money to commission these services but " have n't got their act together " , a situation she described as " appalling " .
she said : " i think there is no excuse and i think it 's really poor management in this case , especially in terms of commissioning .
" they are letting the most vulnerable of people down , people who can not actually , through their illness , even ask for themselves . "
powys lhb said its their service lapsed when it had difficulty recruiting following retirement and long-term sickness of workers .
it said it was working to develop appropriate services .
but while mr veale is aware that local health bodies sometimes face difficult choices with the funds they receive from the welsh assembly government , he said it was not enough simply to blame local commissioners .
mr veale said : " it is decided locally whether they want to commission services or not but obviously there is a financial issue from the welsh assembly government as well . "
ms watson said she had been assured by health minister edwina hart that the lack of these services illustrated the need for central commissioning and a move away from the internal market in healthcare , which is part of the assembly government 's plan to reorganise the welsh nhs .
