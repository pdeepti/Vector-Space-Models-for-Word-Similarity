as a child , the democrat party 's candidate , barack obama , lived in indonesia for several years after his mother married an indonesian .
some indonesians think that means he understands them and the world better . indonesians in the united states feel a close bond with democrat presidential candidate barack obama and are watching the election campaign very closely .
abdul nuradnan , an indonesian citizen , says he often discusses the elections with relatives and friends back home : “ they usually ask whether there will be better relations with indonesia , if barack obama becomes president . ”
“ of course , ” he says , chuckling , “ i told them that might be so .
because barack obama lived for some time in indonesia , he has a better understanding . ”
most indonesians favour obama but not everybody in indonesia seems as interested in the us elections as abdul nuradnan ’ s relatives .
a us-based pew research center poll earlier this year indicated that just 15 percent of the indonesian population was following the us elections - those who were interested mostly favoured obama .
there is a widespread hope that an obama win would change the way much of the world perceives the us .
the pew poll also found that fewer than 40 percent of indonesians have a positive view of the us - a 10 percentage point rise over the previous year .
richard wyke of the pew global attitudes project said this reflects worldwide opinion : “ there ’ s a lot of opposition , a lot of negative feelings about key aspects of american foreign policy in much of the world - indonesia included .
things like the war in iraq , the war on terror , a general perception of us unilateralism . ”
more sensitive to international community obama ’ s advisors have said the democrat candidate would be much more sensitive to the needs of the international community if he became president than his republican rival john mccain .
obama himself has said that the time he spent in indonesia has given him a better perspective of how other countries perceive us decisions - he said it was the strongest experience he had had in foreign relations .
however , not all observers believe that things would change considerably under an obama presidency .
faisal mangoenkosono , an assistant to the indonesian ambassador in washington last week cautioned his compatriots against raising their hopes too high .
“ they should always remember , ” he said , “ as indonesians , that he is through and through american .
and he would follow the interests of what is important for america so one should not be disappointed if he , at one time , were to rule against our interests . ”
but first he would have to be elected .
with one month to go before us citizens go to the polls , indonesians worldwide will continue to speculate about the good and bad sides of a possible obama presidency . laura iiyama 03/10/08 send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic 9799 media center watch and listen explore new content daily in dw 's multimedia archive .

3 , on the details of a planned multibillion-euro bail-out for germany 's ailing mortgage lender hypo real estate . the talks at the german bundesbank headquarters lasted 12 hours , and revolved around how much each participant would contribute to the 35 billion-euro -lrb- $ 48 billion -rrb- deal to save the country 's second largest mortgage lender , reported dpa news agency .
bundesbank presidnet axel weber , along with jochen sanio - head of the federal finance industry regulator bafin - as well as representatives of leading banks and insurance companies were involved in nailing down the final rescue deal .
besides commercial banks , germany 's state savings banks as well as cooperative banks were also to be involved in the rescue package , in addition to insurance firms .
sources told dpa that the insurance firms were called in to participate since many of them are strongly involved in bonds , with hre 's troubled subsidiary depfa itself involved in issuing such paper for trading on world markets .
trouble from subsidiary depfa depfa , which hre acquired just last year , has been the chief source of hre 's problems since , with depfa coming under pressure of late , being unable to raise sufficient short-term loans amid the liquidity crunch on international financial markets .
berlin and the finance industry had proposed a plan to save hypo real estate from collapse earlier this week .
the online edition of the die welt newspaper had said that the situation had become urgent and that hre faced the threat of insolvency if no deal had been reached by friday morning .
berlin said it would not be nationalizing munich-based hre , but would post a guarantee for it of 26.6 billion euros , while german commercial banks would protect hre from default with up to 8.5 billion euros .

while several of the member states are in favor of more eu control , others , including germany , are n't so sure . german family minister ursula von der leyen spoke out against the strengthening of current eu regulations in this area during a meeting with her european counterparts in luxembourg on thursday .
supported by italy , denmark , the czech republic and greece , she accused the eu commission of exceeding its authority .
spain , great britain , the benelux nations , austria and sweden , by contrast , all stood behind the commission .
the proposals unveiled by eu social commissioner vladimir spidla are designed to beef up social protection across the bloc .
that includes the protection offered to disabled people , the old , homosexuals and religious and ethnic miniorities .
the draft legislation supplements existing laws that ensure mainly equal treatment in the workplace , seeking to root out discrimination in socially-sensitive areas as social security , health care , education and access to and supply of goods which are commercially available to the public , including housing . the measure proposes setting up " equality bodies " in all member states to which a sufferer of discrimination could complain before pursuing a possible court action .
for example , a lettings agency could be sued in court if it denied an apartment to homosexuals .
the proposal would not cover family law , so it would not try to legalize homosexual marriages .
it would also not try to change national measures that ensure the secular nature of their education system .

" we believe that germany has created a very high level of protection , " she said .
but the eu commission thinks that germany still needs to beef up protections against discrimination in terms of the housing market .
according to the recommendations put forth in july all professional rental agencies should be subject to the anti-discrimination regulations .
under the current rules in germany , they " usually " only apply to renters who have more than 50 properties to rent out .
however , von der leyen refused to discuss the content of the draft legislation .
the real question here is : " should europe meddle in national affairs or not ? " said the minister . not enough bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the eu proposed a european-wide strengthening of regulations protecting people with disabilities the dutch social minister piet hein donner held firm , saying that the european community is a community of shared values .

but even the supporters of the new guidelines are a little critical , specifically saying that the eu commission 's proposed plan is sloppily formulated and is full of obscurities .

while several of the member states are in favor of more eu control , others , including germany , are n't so sure . german family minister ursula von der leyen spoke out against the strengthening of current eu regulations in this area during a meeting with her european counterparts in luxembourg on thursday .
supported by italy , denmark , the czech republic and greece , she accused the eu commission of exceeding its authority .
spain , great britain , the benelux nations , austria and sweden , by contrast , all stood behind the commission .
the proposals unveiled by eu social commissioner vladimir spidla are designed to beef up social protection across the bloc .
that includes the protection offered to disabled people , the old , homosexuals and religious and ethnic miniorities .
the draft legislation supplements existing laws that ensure mainly equal treatment in the workplace , seeking to root out discrimination in socially-sensitive areas as social security , health care , education and access to and supply of goods which are commercially available to the public , including housing . the measure proposes setting up " equality bodies " in all member states to which a sufferer of discrimination could complain before pursuing a possible court action .
for example , a lettings agency could be sued in court if it denied an apartment to homosexuals .
the proposal would not cover family law , so it would not try to legalize homosexual marriages .
it would also not try to change national measures that ensure the secular nature of their education system .
difference of opinion bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german family minister ursula von der leyen does n't think eu regulations should be strengthened von der leyen , however , maintained that no new eu regulations were necessary .
" we believe that germany has created a very high level of protection , " she said .
but the eu commission thinks that germany still needs to beef up protections against discrimination in terms of the housing market .
according to the recommendations put forth in july all professional rental agencies should be subject to the anti-discrimination regulations .
under the current rules in germany , they " usually " only apply to renters who have more than 50 properties to rent out .
however , von der leyen refused to discuss the content of the draft legislation .
the real question here is : " should europe meddle in national affairs or not ? " said the minister . not enough bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the eu proposed a european-wide strengthening of regulations protecting people with disabilities the dutch social minister piet hein donner held firm , saying that the european community is a community of shared values .
" no member country can seriously have something against the recommendations of the commission , which aim to better protect these values , " he added .
donner 's austrian counterpart , erwin buchinger even demanded even tougher regulations than the commission has already proposed .
" we would like a more ambitious approach for people with disabilities , " he said .
" the level of protection needs to be as high as possible . "
but even the supporters of the new guidelines are a little critical , specifically saying that the eu commission 's proposed plan is sloppily formulated and is full of obscurities .
" there are more questions that answers , " said dutch social minister donner .

self-employed women would also get the same maternity leave as salaried employees under the proposal , the commission said .

self-employed women would also get the same maternity leave as salaried employees under the proposal , the commission said .
" only 65.5 percent of women with dependent children are in work , compared with 91.7 percent of men .
our proposals to improve maternity leave will help women to combine work and family life , " eu equal opportunities commissioner vladimir spidla said .
" they should also help increase women 's participation in the labour market and help face up to the challenges of demographic ageing , " he noted .
longer leave will effect business : bushill-matthews but british conservative member of the european parliament philip bushill-matthews labelled the proposal counterproductive for small business and said the matter should be handled at a state level , not a european level .
" flexible working and work-life balance must be encouraged but it is not for brussels to tell british mothers and fathers how much leave they should take , " he said .

3 , on the details of a planned multibillion-euro bail-out for germany 's ailing mortgage lender hypo real estate . the talks at the german bundesbank headquarters lasted 12 hours , and revolved around how much each participant would contribute to the 35 billion-euro -lrb- $ 48 billion -rrb- deal to save the country 's second largest mortgage lender , reported dpa news agency .
bundesbank presidnet axel weber , along with jochen sanio - head of the federal finance industry regulator bafin - as well as representatives of leading banks and insurance companies were involved in nailing down the final rescue deal .
besides commercial banks , germany 's state savings banks as well as cooperative banks were also to be involved in the rescue package , in addition to insurance firms .
sources told dpa that the insurance firms were called in to participate since many of them are strongly involved in bonds , with hre 's troubled subsidiary depfa itself involved in issuing such paper for trading on world markets .
trouble from subsidiary depfa depfa , which hre acquired just last year , has been the chief source of hre 's problems since , with depfa coming under pressure of late , being unable to raise sufficient short-term loans amid the liquidity crunch on international financial markets .
berlin and the finance industry had proposed a plan to save hypo real estate from collapse earlier this week .
the online edition of the die welt newspaper had said that the situation had become urgent and that hre faced the threat of insolvency if no deal had been reached by friday morning .
berlin said it would not be nationalizing munich-based hre , but would post a guarantee for it of 26.6 billion euros , while german commercial banks would protect hre from default with up to 8.5 billion euros .
hours ahead of the german finance sector 's agreement in frankfurt , the european commission in brussels late thursday gave its green light to the german government 's guarantee . dpa news agency -lrb- kjb -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

just how similar are the plans - and will they help ? the banking crisis spread to germany this week when the german government offered a lifeline to commercial mortgage lender hypo real estate as it teetered on the verge of collapse .
the news came on the same day that the united states house of representatives failed to pass the $ 700 billion -lrb- 500 billion-euro -rrb- bailout plan proposed by secretary of the treasury henry paulson .
that plan has since been approved by the senate , with a few alterations , including up to $ 100 billion in tax break extensions for middle class families and businesses .
the german government has come up with a similar plan to bail out hypo real estate , albeit a slightly less expensive one .
on thursday , the european commission gave the go-ahead for the 35 billion-euro deal .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some institutions , like the venerable lehman brothers , did n't get bailouts - with disastrous results the government bailout in germany came just one week after german chancellor angela merkel denounced the us plan as being " too little , too late . "
she had since changed her mind and urged the us congress to pass a rescue package .
the house is tentatively set to revote on the bill on friday .
it all comes down to the taxpayer apart from the price tag , there are other differences between the rescue plans on both sides of the atlantic . in the us , the bill that has been passed by the senate calls for a government office to be set up which will initially take control of $ 250 billion in " troubled assets . "
according to helge berger , professor of economics and monetary theory at the free university in berlin , they will pay above market price for these assets , which basically amounts to a government subsidy .
" the government will assume that it will hold this paper to the very , very end , hoping that it will gain in value , " he added .
the german deal , on the other hand , is a 35 billion-euro private loan from a group of banks which is then guaranteed by the german government - and ultimately by the german tax payer .
but these methods are n't quite as different as they may seem , said berger .
" it may be that private banks are doing the financing right now , but they hold none of the risk , and i think that 's very important in economic terms , " berger said , emphasizing that the loan is guaranteed with public funds .
berger made it clear , however , that , just like in the american plan , the german one provides the government the option of seizing the company in the event of a default .
governments benefit from acquiring bank shares other countries in europe are feeling the crunch too .

just how similar are the plans - and will they help ? the banking crisis spread to germany this week when the german government offered a lifeline to commercial mortgage lender hypo real estate as it teetered on the verge of collapse .
the news came on the same day that the united states house of representatives failed to pass the $ 700 billion -lrb- 500 billion-euro -rrb- bailout plan proposed by secretary of the treasury henry paulson .
that plan has since been approved by the senate , with a few alterations , including up to $ 100 billion in tax break extensions for middle class families and businesses .
the german government has come up with a similar plan to bail out hypo real estate , albeit a slightly less expensive one .
on thursday , the european commission gave the go-ahead for the 35 billion-euro deal .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some institutions , like the venerable lehman brothers , did n't get bailouts - with disastrous results the government bailout in germany came just one week after german chancellor angela merkel denounced the us plan as being " too little , too late . "
she had since changed her mind and urged the us congress to pass a rescue package .
the house is tentatively set to revote on the bill on friday .
it all comes down to the taxpayer apart from the price tag , there are other differences between the rescue plans on both sides of the atlantic . in the us , the bill that has been passed by the senate calls for a government office to be set up which will initially take control of $ 250 billion in " troubled assets . "
according to helge berger , professor of economics and monetary theory at the free university in berlin , they will pay above market price for these assets , which basically amounts to a government subsidy .
" the government will assume that it will hold this paper to the very , very end , hoping that it will gain in value , " he added .
the german deal , on the other hand , is a 35 billion-euro private loan from a group of banks which is then guaranteed by the german government - and ultimately by the german tax payer .
but these methods are n't quite as different as they may seem , said berger .
" it may be that private banks are doing the financing right now , but they hold none of the risk , and i think that 's very important in economic terms , " berger said , emphasizing that the loan is guaranteed with public funds .
berger made it clear , however , that , just like in the american plan , the german one provides the government the option of seizing the company in the event of a default .
governments benefit from acquiring bank shares other countries in europe are feeling the crunch too .

the german government has come up with a similar plan to bail out hypo real estate , albeit a slightly less expensive one .
on thursday , the european commission gave the go-ahead for the 35 billion-euro deal .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some institutions , like the venerable lehman brothers , did n't get bailouts - with disastrous results the government bailout in germany came just one week after german chancellor angela merkel denounced the us plan as being " too little , too late . "
she had since changed her mind and urged the us congress to pass a rescue package .
the house is tentatively set to revote on the bill on friday .
it all comes down to the taxpayer apart from the price tag , there are other differences between the rescue plans on both sides of the atlantic . in the us , the bill that has been passed by the senate calls for a government office to be set up which will initially take control of $ 250 billion in " troubled assets . "
according to helge berger , professor of economics and monetary theory at the free university in berlin , they will pay above market price for these assets , which basically amounts to a government subsidy .
" the government will assume that it will hold this paper to the very , very end , hoping that it will gain in value , " he added .
the german deal , on the other hand , is a 35 billion-euro private loan from a group of banks which is then guaranteed by the german government - and ultimately by the german tax payer .
but these methods are n't quite as different as they may seem , said berger .
" it may be that private banks are doing the financing right now , but they hold none of the risk , and i think that 's very important in economic terms , " berger said , emphasizing that the loan is guaranteed with public funds .
berger made it clear , however , that , just like in the american plan , the german one provides the government the option of seizing the company in the event of a default .
governments benefit from acquiring bank shares other countries in europe are feeling the crunch too .

berger said sees this as a huge advantage , since there are still viable credits owned by these financial institutions , which in turn are then owned by the governments .
though the benelux nations manage to reach an agreement on fortis , the european union as a whole is having trouble deciding on a joint response to the financial crisis .
europe divided on bloc-wide bailout on thursday french finance minister christine legarde suggested in an interview with the german newspaper handelsblatt that the eu should set up a european-wide rescue plan .
france currently holds the rotating eu presidency .
" what happens if a smaller eu state is affected by a looming bank collapse ?
maybe this country does not have the means to save the bank , " she said .
stock market expert ulrich barts , based in frankfurt , is in favor of the plan .
he said that banks need to start trusting one another again .
barts also called for more regulation , saying that a serious look should be taken at how banks sell products and that they have to reveal the risks involved in the products they sell .
" you also have to put in some sort of measure to allow the european union to act as a whole in order to help the financial sector in such a crisis and to detect possible problems earlier and then be able to act as the authorities have in the us , " he added .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : french finance minister christine lagarde proposed an eu wide rescue fund the proposed plan reportedly totaled 300 billion euros , though both the french and dutch governments have denied such a proposal has been made .

newly released archives reveal that the bbc had an answer . archives released friday , oct .
3 , reveal that the bbc planned to transmit reassuring messages in the event of a nuclear attack by the soviet union .
the broadcast would have been repeated every two hours , and told people to " stay calm , " remain indoors , and conserve food and water .
according to archived documents , the message would have been : " this country has been attacked with nuclear weapons .
communications have been severely disrupted , and the number of casualties and the extent of the damage are not yet known . "
it would go on to remind people that there was nothing to be gained by trying to get away , and warned people that by leaving their homes they could be exposing themselves to greater danger , as radioactive fall-out , which follows a nuclear explosion , is many times more dangerous when one is directly exposed to it in the open .
familiar radio voices bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : nuclear attack was a very real threat during the cold war the transcript was part of files declassified by britain 's national archives , which releases official documents after 30 years .
the threat of a possible nuclear war between the united states and the soviet union was very real from the time the second world war ended to when the berlin wall fell in 1989 .
during this time , public service films gave information about how to prepare for a nuclear attack .
in addition to the script , the archive files included recommendations that the bbc continue to give live updates emphasizing that the broadcaster had not been " obliterated . "
there were also letters detailing discussions between the bbc and various government departments on the use of familiar voices , which were deemed necessary to reassure people " the bbc is still there . "
" the reassurance that ' the bbc is still there ' would not be gleaned from a recorded announcement by an unfamiliar voice , " wrote harold greenwood from the ministry of posts and telecommunications in a letter dated june 1974 .
" indeed , if an unfamiliar voice repeats the same announcement hour after hour for 12 hours listeners may begin to suspect that they are listening to a machine set to switch on every hour -lrb- or even that it has got stuck -rrb- and that perhaps after all the bbc has been obliterated , " he added .
conserve resources after attack the carefully-worded draft script included advice on how to conserve resources while inside after a nuclear strike .
" stay in your own homes , and if you live in an area where a fall-out warning has been given , stay in your fall-out room until you are told it is safe to come out , " it read .
" the message that the immediate danger has passed will be given by the sirens and repeated on this wavelength .
make sure that the gas and all fuel supplies are turned off and that all fires are extinguished .
water must be rationed , and used only for essential drinking and cooking purposes .
it must not be used for flushing lavatories .
ration your food supply : it may have to last for 14 days or more . "
the message was meant to end with telling people that the bbc would repeat the broadcast in two hours ' time .
it asked them to stay tuned to that wavelength , but reminded them to switch their radios off in the meantime to save batteries . dw staff -lrb- mrm -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

bundesbank presidnet axel weber , along with jochen sanio - head of the federal finance industry regulator bafin - as well as representatives of leading banks and insurance companies were involved in nailing down the final rescue deal .
besides commercial banks , germany 's state savings banks as well as cooperative banks were also to be involved in the rescue package , in addition to insurance firms .
sources told dpa that the insurance firms were called in to participate since many of them are strongly involved in bonds , with hre 's troubled subsidiary depfa itself involved in issuing such paper for trading on world markets .
trouble from subsidiary depfa depfa , which hre acquired just last year , has been the chief source of hre 's problems since , with depfa coming under pressure of late , being unable to raise sufficient short-term loans amid the liquidity crunch on international financial markets .
berlin and the finance industry had proposed a plan to save hypo real estate from collapse earlier this week .
the online edition of the die welt newspaper had said that the situation had become urgent and that hre faced the threat of insolvency if no deal had been reached by friday morning .
berlin said it would not be nationalizing munich-based hre , but would post a guarantee for it of 26.6 billion euros , while german commercial banks would protect hre from default with up to 8.5 billion euros .
hours ahead of the german finance sector 's agreement in frankfurt , the european commission in brussels late thursday gave its green light to the german government 's guarantee . dpa news agency -lrb- kjb -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

as a child , the democrat party 's candidate , barack obama , lived in indonesia for several years after his mother married an indonesian .
some indonesians think that means he understands them and the world better . indonesians in the united states feel a close bond with democrat presidential candidate barack obama and are watching the election campaign very closely .
abdul nuradnan , an indonesian citizen , says he often discusses the elections with relatives and friends back home : “ they usually ask whether there will be better relations with indonesia , if barack obama becomes president . ”
“ of course , ” he says , chuckling , “ i told them that might be so .
because barack obama lived for some time in indonesia , he has a better understanding . ”
most indonesians favour obama but not everybody in indonesia seems as interested in the us elections as abdul nuradnan ’ s relatives .
a us-based pew research center poll earlier this year indicated that just 15 percent of the indonesian population was following the us elections - those who were interested mostly favoured obama .
there is a widespread hope that an obama win would change the way much of the world perceives the us .
the pew poll also found that fewer than 40 percent of indonesians have a positive view of the us - a 10 percentage point rise over the previous year .
richard wyke of the pew global attitudes project said this reflects worldwide opinion : “ there ’ s a lot of opposition , a lot of negative feelings about key aspects of american foreign policy in much of the world - indonesia included .
things like the war in iraq , the war on terror , a general perception of us unilateralism . ”
more sensitive to international community obama ’ s advisors have said the democrat candidate would be much more sensitive to the needs of the international community if he became president than his republican rival john mccain .
obama himself has said that the time he spent in indonesia has given him a better perspective of how other countries perceive us decisions - he said it was the strongest experience he had had in foreign relations .
however , not all observers believe that things would change considerably under an obama presidency .
faisal mangoenkosono , an assistant to the indonesian ambassador in washington last week cautioned his compatriots against raising their hopes too high .
“ they should always remember , ” he said , “ as indonesians , that he is through and through american .
and he would follow the interests of what is important for america so one should not be disappointed if he , at one time , were to rule against our interests . ”

2 , in the russian city of st petersburg .
another big german company , basf , has already bought a quarter of the same field .
e.on controls a large part of germany 's gas and electricity supplies .
alternatives to russian gas part of the reason russia and germany are building the so-called nord stream pipeline under the baltic sea is to tap the siberian gas field , which has reserves of over 600 billion cubic meters , to feed the energy to german factories and homes .
other european nations have warned that germany may end up being too dependent on gazprom . e.on has tried harder than some of its german rivals to develop non-russian gas sources .
under the transaction , gazprom was able to buy back some of its own shares and reduce e.on 's influence on gazprom .
the owner of the production license and operator of the field will be russian oao severneftegazprom -lrb- sngp -rrb- , a statement by e.on said .
gazprom will hold just over half of sngp .
e.on 's ruhrgas unit and and basf 's wintershall division will each hold a stake of 25 percent minus one share .
energy for millions gas production at the site started last year and will reach around 25 billion cubic meters annually as early as next year , enough to supply a metropolis of approximately 10 million households .
under a complex swap , gazprom is to receive e.on ruhrgas 's 49 percent stake in the russian company zao gerosgaz , which holds just under 3 percent of gazprom shares .
after the transaction , e.on ruhrgas will still hold a 3.5-percent direct stake in gazprom . dpa news agency -lrb- kjb -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de finance -pipe- 03.10.2008 bailouts multiply as crisis continues , but can they really help ? großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the rescue plans are more similar than they may seem as the us bailout plan is put to a revote , the eu is haggling over a large-scale rescue deal of its own after several european banks were saved this week .
just how similar are the plans - and will they help ? the banking crisis spread to germany this week when the german government offered a lifeline to commercial mortgage lender hypo real estate as it teetered on the verge of collapse .
the news came on the same day that the united states house of representatives failed to pass the $ 700 billion -lrb- 500 billion-euro -rrb- bailout plan proposed by secretary of the treasury henry paulson .
that plan has since been approved by the senate , with a few alterations , including up to $ 100 billion in tax break extensions for middle class families and businesses .
the german government has come up with a similar plan to bail out hypo real estate , albeit a slightly less expensive one .
on thursday , the european commission gave the go-ahead for the 35 billion-euro deal .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some institutions , like the venerable lehman brothers , did n't get bailouts - with disastrous results the government bailout in germany came just one week after german chancellor angela merkel denounced the us plan as being " too little , too late . "
she had since changed her mind and urged the us congress to pass a rescue package .
the house is tentatively set to revote on the bill on friday .
it all comes down to the taxpayer apart from the price tag , there are other differences between the rescue plans on both sides of the atlantic . in the us , the bill that has been passed by the senate calls for a government office to be set up which will initially take control of $ 250 billion in " troubled assets . "
according to helge berger , professor of economics and monetary theory at the free university in berlin , they will pay above market price for these assets , which basically amounts to a government subsidy .
" the government will assume that it will hold this paper to the very , very end , hoping that it will gain in value , " he added .
the german deal , on the other hand , is a 35 billion-euro private loan from a group of banks which is then guaranteed by the german government - and ultimately by the german tax payer .
but these methods are n't quite as different as they may seem , said berger .
" it may be that private banks are doing the financing right now , but they hold none of the risk , and i think that 's very important in economic terms , " berger said , emphasizing that the loan is guaranteed with public funds .
berger made it clear , however , that , just like in the american plan , the german one provides the government the option of seizing the company in the event of a default .
governments benefit from acquiring bank shares other countries in europe are feeling the crunch too .
great britain has nationalized lender bradford & bingley , while the benelux nations of belgium , luxembourg and the netherlands bailed out the insurance and banking group fortis with 11.2 billion euros . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : belgium , luxembourg and the netherlands pulled together 11.2 billion euros to bail out fortis with both of these plans , the respective governments did n't just get troubled assets , they also got shares in the banks .
berger said sees this as a huge advantage , since there are still viable credits owned by these financial institutions , which in turn are then owned by the governments .
though the benelux nations manage to reach an agreement on fortis , the european union as a whole is having trouble deciding on a joint response to the financial crisis .
europe divided on bloc-wide bailout on thursday french finance minister christine legarde suggested in an interview with the german newspaper handelsblatt that the eu should set up a european-wide rescue plan .
france currently holds the rotating eu presidency .
" what happens if a smaller eu state is affected by a looming bank collapse ?
maybe this country does not have the means to save the bank , " she said .
stock market expert ulrich barts , based in frankfurt , is in favor of the plan .
he said that banks need to start trusting one another again .
barts also called for more regulation , saying that a serious look should be taken at how banks sell products and that they have to reveal the risks involved in the products they sell .

just how similar are the plans - and will they help ? the banking crisis spread to germany this week when the german government offered a lifeline to commercial mortgage lender hypo real estate as it teetered on the verge of collapse .
the news came on the same day that the united states house of representatives failed to pass the $ 700 billion -lrb- 500 billion-euro -rrb- bailout plan proposed by secretary of the treasury henry paulson .
that plan has since been approved by the senate , with a few alterations , including up to $ 100 billion in tax break extensions for middle class families and businesses .
the german government has come up with a similar plan to bail out hypo real estate , albeit a slightly less expensive one .
on thursday , the european commission gave the go-ahead for the 35 billion-euro deal .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some institutions , like the venerable lehman brothers , did n't get bailouts - with disastrous results the government bailout in germany came just one week after german chancellor angela merkel denounced the us plan as being " too little , too late . "
she had since changed her mind and urged the us congress to pass a rescue package .
the house is tentatively set to revote on the bill on friday .
it all comes down to the taxpayer apart from the price tag , there are other differences between the rescue plans on both sides of the atlantic . in the us , the bill that has been passed by the senate calls for a government office to be set up which will initially take control of $ 250 billion in " troubled assets . "
according to helge berger , professor of economics and monetary theory at the free university in berlin , they will pay above market price for these assets , which basically amounts to a government subsidy .
" the government will assume that it will hold this paper to the very , very end , hoping that it will gain in value , " he added .
the german deal , on the other hand , is a 35 billion-euro private loan from a group of banks which is then guaranteed by the german government - and ultimately by the german tax payer .
but these methods are n't quite as different as they may seem , said berger .
" it may be that private banks are doing the financing right now , but they hold none of the risk , and i think that 's very important in economic terms , " berger said , emphasizing that the loan is guaranteed with public funds .
berger made it clear , however , that , just like in the american plan , the german one provides the government the option of seizing the company in the event of a default .
governments benefit from acquiring bank shares other countries in europe are feeling the crunch too .

though the benelux nations manage to reach an agreement on fortis , the european union as a whole is having trouble deciding on a joint response to the financial crisis .

the german deal , on the other hand , is a 35 billion-euro private loan from a group of banks which is then guaranteed by the german government - and ultimately by the german tax payer .
but these methods are n't quite as different as they may seem , said berger .
" it may be that private banks are doing the financing right now , but they hold none of the risk , and i think that 's very important in economic terms , " berger said , emphasizing that the loan is guaranteed with public funds .
berger made it clear , however , that , just like in the american plan , the german one provides the government the option of seizing the company in the event of a default .

just how similar are the plans - and will they help ? the banking crisis spread to germany this week when the german government offered a lifeline to commercial mortgage lender hypo real estate as it teetered on the verge of collapse .
the news came on the same day that the united states house of representatives failed to pass the $ 700 billion -lrb- 500 billion-euro -rrb- bailout plan proposed by secretary of the treasury henry paulson .
that plan has since been approved by the senate , with a few alterations , including up to $ 100 billion in tax break extensions for middle class families and businesses .
the german government has come up with a similar plan to bail out hypo real estate , albeit a slightly less expensive one .
on thursday , the european commission gave the go-ahead for the 35 billion-euro deal .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some institutions , like the venerable lehman brothers , did n't get bailouts - with disastrous results the government bailout in germany came just one week after german chancellor angela merkel denounced the us plan as being " too little , too late . "
she had since changed her mind and urged the us congress to pass a rescue package .
the house is tentatively set to revote on the bill on friday .
it all comes down to the taxpayer apart from the price tag , there are other differences between the rescue plans on both sides of the atlantic . in the us , the bill that has been passed by the senate calls for a government office to be set up which will initially take control of $ 250 billion in " troubled assets . "
according to helge berger , professor of economics and monetary theory at the free university in berlin , they will pay above market price for these assets , which basically amounts to a government subsidy .
" the government will assume that it will hold this paper to the very , very end , hoping that it will gain in value , " he added .
the german deal , on the other hand , is a 35 billion-euro private loan from a group of banks which is then guaranteed by the german government - and ultimately by the german tax payer .

newly released archives reveal that the bbc had an answer . archives released friday , oct .
3 , reveal that the bbc planned to transmit reassuring messages in the event of a nuclear attack by the soviet union .
the broadcast would have been repeated every two hours , and told people to " stay calm , " remain indoors , and conserve food and water .
according to archived documents , the message would have been : " this country has been attacked with nuclear weapons .
communications have been severely disrupted , and the number of casualties and the extent of the damage are not yet known . "
it would go on to remind people that there was nothing to be gained by trying to get away , and warned people that by leaving their homes they could be exposing themselves to greater danger , as radioactive fall-out , which follows a nuclear explosion , is many times more dangerous when one is directly exposed to it in the open .
familiar radio voices bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : nuclear attack was a very real threat during the cold war the transcript was part of files declassified by britain 's national archives , which releases official documents after 30 years .
the threat of a possible nuclear war between the united states and the soviet union was very real from the time the second world war ended to when the berlin wall fell in 1989 .
during this time , public service films gave information about how to prepare for a nuclear attack .
in addition to the script , the archive files included recommendations that the bbc continue to give live updates emphasizing that the broadcaster had not been " obliterated . "
there were also letters detailing discussions between the bbc and various government departments on the use of familiar voices , which were deemed necessary to reassure people " the bbc is still there . "
" the reassurance that ' the bbc is still there ' would not be gleaned from a recorded announcement by an unfamiliar voice , " wrote harold greenwood from the ministry of posts and telecommunications in a letter dated june 1974 .
" indeed , if an unfamiliar voice repeats the same announcement hour after hour for 12 hours listeners may begin to suspect that they are listening to a machine set to switch on every hour -lrb- or even that it has got stuck -rrb- and that perhaps after all the bbc has been obliterated , " he added .
conserve resources after attack the carefully-worded draft script included advice on how to conserve resources while inside after a nuclear strike .
" stay in your own homes , and if you live in an area where a fall-out warning has been given , stay in your fall-out room until you are told it is safe to come out , " it read .
" the message that the immediate danger has passed will be given by the sirens and repeated on this wavelength .

water must be rationed , and used only for essential drinking and cooking purposes .
it must not be used for flushing lavatories .
ration your food supply : it may have to last for 14 days or more . "
the message was meant to end with telling people that the bbc would repeat the broadcast in two hours ' time .

newly released archives reveal that the bbc had an answer . archives released friday , oct .
3 , reveal that the bbc planned to transmit reassuring messages in the event of a nuclear attack by the soviet union .
the broadcast would have been repeated every two hours , and told people to " stay calm , " remain indoors , and conserve food and water .
according to archived documents , the message would have been : " this country has been attacked with nuclear weapons .
communications have been severely disrupted , and the number of casualties and the extent of the damage are not yet known . "
it would go on to remind people that there was nothing to be gained by trying to get away , and warned people that by leaving their homes they could be exposing themselves to greater danger , as radioactive fall-out , which follows a nuclear explosion , is many times more dangerous when one is directly exposed to it in the open .
familiar radio voices bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : nuclear attack was a very real threat during the cold war the transcript was part of files declassified by britain 's national archives , which releases official documents after 30 years .
the threat of a possible nuclear war between the united states and the soviet union was very real from the time the second world war ended to when the berlin wall fell in 1989 .
during this time , public service films gave information about how to prepare for a nuclear attack .
in addition to the script , the archive files included recommendations that the bbc continue to give live updates emphasizing that the broadcaster had not been " obliterated . "
there were also letters detailing discussions between the bbc and various government departments on the use of familiar voices , which were deemed necessary to reassure people " the bbc is still there . "
" the reassurance that ' the bbc is still there ' would not be gleaned from a recorded announcement by an unfamiliar voice , " wrote harold greenwood from the ministry of posts and telecommunications in a letter dated june 1974 .
" indeed , if an unfamiliar voice repeats the same announcement hour after hour for 12 hours listeners may begin to suspect that they are listening to a machine set to switch on every hour -lrb- or even that it has got stuck -rrb- and that perhaps after all the bbc has been obliterated , " he added .
conserve resources after attack the carefully-worded draft script included advice on how to conserve resources while inside after a nuclear strike .
" stay in your own homes , and if you live in an area where a fall-out warning has been given , stay in your fall-out room until you are told it is safe to come out , " it read .
" the message that the immediate danger has passed will be given by the sirens and repeated on this wavelength .
make sure that the gas and all fuel supplies are turned off and that all fires are extinguished .
water must be rationed , and used only for essential drinking and cooking purposes .
it must not be used for flushing lavatories .
ration your food supply : it may have to last for 14 days or more . "
the message was meant to end with telling people that the bbc would repeat the broadcast in two hours ' time .

2 , in the russian city of st petersburg .
another big german company , basf , has already bought a quarter of the same field .
e.on controls a large part of germany 's gas and electricity supplies .
alternatives to russian gas part of the reason russia and germany are building the so-called nord stream pipeline under the baltic sea is to tap the siberian gas field , which has reserves of over 600 billion cubic meters , to feed the energy to german factories and homes .
other european nations have warned that germany may end up being too dependent on gazprom . e.on has tried harder than some of its german rivals to develop non-russian gas sources .
under the transaction , gazprom was able to buy back some of its own shares and reduce e.on 's influence on gazprom .
the owner of the production license and operator of the field will be russian oao severneftegazprom -lrb- sngp -rrb- , a statement by e.on said .

while several of the member states are in favor of more eu control , others , including germany , are n't so sure . german family minister ursula von der leyen spoke out against the strengthening of current eu regulations in this area during a meeting with her european counterparts in luxembourg on thursday .
supported by italy , denmark , the czech republic and greece , she accused the eu commission of exceeding its authority .
spain , great britain , the benelux nations , austria and sweden , by contrast , all stood behind the commission .
the proposals unveiled by eu social commissioner vladimir spidla are designed to beef up social protection across the bloc .
that includes the protection offered to disabled people , the old , homosexuals and religious and ethnic miniorities .
the draft legislation supplements existing laws that ensure mainly equal treatment in the workplace , seeking to root out discrimination in socially-sensitive areas as social security , health care , education and access to and supply of goods which are commercially available to the public , including housing . the measure proposes setting up " equality bodies " in all member states to which a sufferer of discrimination could complain before pursuing a possible court action .
for example , a lettings agency could be sued in court if it denied an apartment to homosexuals .
the proposal would not cover family law , so it would not try to legalize homosexual marriages .
it would also not try to change national measures that ensure the secular nature of their education system .
difference of opinion bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german family minister ursula von der leyen does n't think eu regulations should be strengthened von der leyen , however , maintained that no new eu regulations were necessary .
" we believe that germany has created a very high level of protection , " she said .
but the eu commission thinks that germany still needs to beef up protections against discrimination in terms of the housing market .
according to the recommendations put forth in july all professional rental agencies should be subject to the anti-discrimination regulations .
under the current rules in germany , they " usually " only apply to renters who have more than 50 properties to rent out .
however , von der leyen refused to discuss the content of the draft legislation .
the real question here is : " should europe meddle in national affairs or not ? " said the minister . not enough bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the eu proposed a european-wide strengthening of regulations protecting people with disabilities the dutch social minister piet hein donner held firm , saying that the european community is a community of shared values .

donner 's austrian counterpart , erwin buchinger even demanded even tougher regulations than the commission has already proposed .
" we would like a more ambitious approach for people with disabilities , " he said .
" the level of protection needs to be as high as possible . "
but even the supporters of the new guidelines are a little critical , specifically saying that the eu commission 's proposed plan is sloppily formulated and is full of obscurities .

3 , on the details of a planned multibillion-euro bail-out for germany 's ailing mortgage lender hypo real estate . the talks at the german bundesbank headquarters lasted 12 hours , and revolved around how much each participant would contribute to the 35 billion-euro -lrb- $ 48 billion -rrb- deal to save the country 's second largest mortgage lender , reported dpa news agency .
bundesbank presidnet axel weber , along with jochen sanio - head of the federal finance industry regulator bafin - as well as representatives of leading banks and insurance companies were involved in nailing down the final rescue deal .
besides commercial banks , germany 's state savings banks as well as cooperative banks were also to be involved in the rescue package , in addition to insurance firms .
sources told dpa that the insurance firms were called in to participate since many of them are strongly involved in bonds , with hre 's troubled subsidiary depfa itself involved in issuing such paper for trading on world markets .
trouble from subsidiary depfa depfa , which hre acquired just last year , has been the chief source of hre 's problems since , with depfa coming under pressure of late , being unable to raise sufficient short-term loans amid the liquidity crunch on international financial markets .
berlin and the finance industry had proposed a plan to save hypo real estate from collapse earlier this week .
the online edition of the die welt newspaper had said that the situation had become urgent and that hre faced the threat of insolvency if no deal had been reached by friday morning .
berlin said it would not be nationalizing munich-based hre , but would post a guarantee for it of 26.6 billion euros , while german commercial banks would protect hre from default with up to 8.5 billion euros .
hours ahead of the german finance sector 's agreement in frankfurt , the european commission in brussels late thursday gave its green light to the german government 's guarantee . dpa news agency -lrb- kjb -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

self-employed women would also get the same maternity leave as salaried employees under the proposal , the commission said .
" only 65.5 percent of women with dependent children are in work , compared with 91.7 percent of men .
our proposals to improve maternity leave will help women to combine work and family life , " eu equal opportunities commissioner vladimir spidla said .
" they should also help increase women 's participation in the labour market and help face up to the challenges of demographic ageing , " he noted .
longer leave will effect business : bushill-matthews but british conservative member of the european parliament philip bushill-matthews labelled the proposal counterproductive for small business and said the matter should be handled at a state level , not a european level .
" flexible working and work-life balance must be encouraged but it is not for brussels to tell british mothers and fathers how much leave they should take , " he said .
" small business will struggle to afford this extra cost .
ultimately some of the smallest businesses may think twice about employing young women through fear of them going on maternity leave . " dw staff -lrb- dm -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

self-employed women would also get the same maternity leave as salaried employees under the proposal , the commission said .
" only 65.5 percent of women with dependent children are in work , compared with 91.7 percent of men .
our proposals to improve maternity leave will help women to combine work and family life , " eu equal opportunities commissioner vladimir spidla said .
" they should also help increase women 's participation in the labour market and help face up to the challenges of demographic ageing , " he noted .
longer leave will effect business : bushill-matthews but british conservative member of the european parliament philip bushill-matthews labelled the proposal counterproductive for small business and said the matter should be handled at a state level , not a european level .
" flexible working and work-life balance must be encouraged but it is not for brussels to tell british mothers and fathers how much leave they should take , " he said .
" small business will struggle to afford this extra cost .
ultimately some of the smallest businesses may think twice about employing young women through fear of them going on maternity leave . " dw staff -lrb- dm -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

self-employed women would also get the same maternity leave as salaried employees under the proposal , the commission said .
" only 65.5 percent of women with dependent children are in work , compared with 91.7 percent of men .
our proposals to improve maternity leave will help women to combine work and family life , " eu equal opportunities commissioner vladimir spidla said .
" they should also help increase women 's participation in the labour market and help face up to the challenges of demographic ageing , " he noted .
longer leave will effect business : bushill-matthews but british conservative member of the european parliament philip bushill-matthews labelled the proposal counterproductive for small business and said the matter should be handled at a state level , not a european level .
" flexible working and work-life balance must be encouraged but it is not for brussels to tell british mothers and fathers how much leave they should take , " he said .
" small business will struggle to afford this extra cost .
ultimately some of the smallest businesses may think twice about employing young women through fear of them going on maternity leave . " dw staff -lrb- dm -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

self-employed women would also get the same maternity leave as salaried employees under the proposal , the commission said .
" only 65.5 percent of women with dependent children are in work , compared with 91.7 percent of men .
our proposals to improve maternity leave will help women to combine work and family life , " eu equal opportunities commissioner vladimir spidla said .
" they should also help increase women 's participation in the labour market and help face up to the challenges of demographic ageing , " he noted .
longer leave will effect business : bushill-matthews but british conservative member of the european parliament philip bushill-matthews labelled the proposal counterproductive for small business and said the matter should be handled at a state level , not a european level .
" flexible working and work-life balance must be encouraged but it is not for brussels to tell british mothers and fathers how much leave they should take , " he said .
" small business will struggle to afford this extra cost .
ultimately some of the smallest businesses may think twice about employing young women through fear of them going on maternity leave . " dw staff -lrb- dm -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

3 , on the details of a planned multibillion-euro bail-out for germany 's ailing mortgage lender hypo real estate . the talks at the german bundesbank headquarters lasted 12 hours , and revolved around how much each participant would contribute to the 35 billion-euro -lrb- $ 48 billion -rrb- deal to save the country 's second largest mortgage lender , reported dpa news agency .
bundesbank presidnet axel weber , along with jochen sanio - head of the federal finance industry regulator bafin - as well as representatives of leading banks and insurance companies were involved in nailing down the final rescue deal .
besides commercial banks , germany 's state savings banks as well as cooperative banks were also to be involved in the rescue package , in addition to insurance firms .
sources told dpa that the insurance firms were called in to participate since many of them are strongly involved in bonds , with hre 's troubled subsidiary depfa itself involved in issuing such paper for trading on world markets .
trouble from subsidiary depfa depfa , which hre acquired just last year , has been the chief source of hre 's problems since , with depfa coming under pressure of late , being unable to raise sufficient short-term loans amid the liquidity crunch on international financial markets .
berlin and the finance industry had proposed a plan to save hypo real estate from collapse earlier this week .
the online edition of the die welt newspaper had said that the situation had become urgent and that hre faced the threat of insolvency if no deal had been reached by friday morning .
berlin said it would not be nationalizing munich-based hre , but would post a guarantee for it of 26.6 billion euros , while german commercial banks would protect hre from default with up to 8.5 billion euros .
hours ahead of the german finance sector 's agreement in frankfurt , the european commission in brussels late thursday gave its green light to the german government 's guarantee . dpa news agency -lrb- kjb -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the powerful blast damaged the russian infantry building and blew out windows in surrounding structures up to a half a kilometer away , interfax reported .
officials in the rebel province said the incident occurred after a suspect automobile was confiscated from georgian citizens by russian soldiers .
the four-wheel-drive vehicle turned out to be packed with explosives and blew up near the soldiers ' military base .
eduard koikoty , south ossetia 's rebel leader , was quick to accuse georgian special forces of organizing the attack .

thousands of russian troops are stationed inside south ossetia , a second georgian breakaway province , abkhazia , as well as several “ buffer zones ” around those regions , after a brief war with georgia in august .
after georgian troops were overwhelmed by russian forces , a peace accord was brokered by the european union under which russia pledged to pull its troops out of undisputed georgian territory by oct .
10 , a promise russian president dmitry medvedev reiterated thursday the kremlin still planned to live up to .

while several of the member states are in favor of more eu control , others , including germany , are n't so sure . german family minister ursula von der leyen spoke out against the strengthening of current eu regulations in this area during a meeting with her european counterparts in luxembourg on thursday .
supported by italy , denmark , the czech republic and greece , she accused the eu commission of exceeding its authority .
spain , great britain , the benelux nations , austria and sweden , by contrast , all stood behind the commission .
the proposals unveiled by eu social commissioner vladimir spidla are designed to beef up social protection across the bloc .
that includes the protection offered to disabled people , the old , homosexuals and religious and ethnic miniorities .
the draft legislation supplements existing laws that ensure mainly equal treatment in the workplace , seeking to root out discrimination in socially-sensitive areas as social security , health care , education and access to and supply of goods which are commercially available to the public , including housing . the measure proposes setting up " equality bodies " in all member states to which a sufferer of discrimination could complain before pursuing a possible court action .
for example , a lettings agency could be sued in court if it denied an apartment to homosexuals .
the proposal would not cover family law , so it would not try to legalize homosexual marriages .
it would also not try to change national measures that ensure the secular nature of their education system .
difference of opinion bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german family minister ursula von der leyen does n't think eu regulations should be strengthened von der leyen , however , maintained that no new eu regulations were necessary .
" we believe that germany has created a very high level of protection , " she said .
but the eu commission thinks that germany still needs to beef up protections against discrimination in terms of the housing market .
according to the recommendations put forth in july all professional rental agencies should be subject to the anti-discrimination regulations .
under the current rules in germany , they " usually " only apply to renters who have more than 50 properties to rent out .
however , von der leyen refused to discuss the content of the draft legislation .
the real question here is : " should europe meddle in national affairs or not ? " said the minister . not enough bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the eu proposed a european-wide strengthening of regulations protecting people with disabilities the dutch social minister piet hein donner held firm , saying that the european community is a community of shared values .
" no member country can seriously have something against the recommendations of the commission , which aim to better protect these values , " he added .
donner 's austrian counterpart , erwin buchinger even demanded even tougher regulations than the commission has already proposed .
" we would like a more ambitious approach for people with disabilities , " he said .
" the level of protection needs to be as high as possible . "
but even the supporters of the new guidelines are a little critical , specifically saying that the eu commission 's proposed plan is sloppily formulated and is full of obscurities .

the statement continued by urging european governments , who have called on the us to shut down the detention center for terrorist suspects in guantanamo bay , " to let deeds follow their words and provide humanitarian protection for detainees who can not return to their home countries . "
appeal to mccain , obama the report stated that the council wanted to send a clear signal to us presidential candidates john mccain and barack obama , who have said they want to close the controversial detention center in cuba .
" both presidential contenders have expressed a desire to close down guantanamo and will need the cooperation of european partners , " the report added .
mccain and obama are drawing up plans on how to close the guantanamo detention camp , but they differ on the question of which suspects should be tried and before which type of court .
republican candidate mccain favors the continuation of special military tribunals , despite lawyers ' criticism that they disregard important defense rights .
meanwhile , his democrat rival prefers moving the accused suspects to a civil court or a normal military tribunal . dw staff -lrb- mrm -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

self-employed women would also get the same maternity leave as salaried employees under the proposal , the commission said .
" only 65.5 percent of women with dependent children are in work , compared with 91.7 percent of men .
our proposals to improve maternity leave will help women to combine work and family life , " eu equal opportunities commissioner vladimir spidla said .
" they should also help increase women 's participation in the labour market and help face up to the challenges of demographic ageing , " he noted .
longer leave will effect business : bushill-matthews but british conservative member of the european parliament philip bushill-matthews labelled the proposal counterproductive for small business and said the matter should be handled at a state level , not a european level .
" flexible working and work-life balance must be encouraged but it is not for brussels to tell british mothers and fathers how much leave they should take , " he said .
" small business will struggle to afford this extra cost .
ultimately some of the smallest businesses may think twice about employing young women through fear of them going on maternity leave . " dw staff -lrb- dm -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de european union -pipe- 03.10.2008 berlin opposes new eu anti-discrimination laws großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany thinks the eu should butt out of national matters back in july , the european commission proposed new eu-wide anti-discrimination legislation .
while several of the member states are in favor of more eu control , others , including germany , are n't so sure . german family minister ursula von der leyen spoke out against the strengthening of current eu regulations in this area during a meeting with her european counterparts in luxembourg on thursday .
supported by italy , denmark , the czech republic and greece , she accused the eu commission of exceeding its authority .
spain , great britain , the benelux nations , austria and sweden , by contrast , all stood behind the commission .
the proposals unveiled by eu social commissioner vladimir spidla are designed to beef up social protection across the bloc .
that includes the protection offered to disabled people , the old , homosexuals and religious and ethnic miniorities .
the draft legislation supplements existing laws that ensure mainly equal treatment in the workplace , seeking to root out discrimination in socially-sensitive areas as social security , health care , education and access to and supply of goods which are commercially available to the public , including housing . the measure proposes setting up " equality bodies " in all member states to which a sufferer of discrimination could complain before pursuing a possible court action .
for example , a lettings agency could be sued in court if it denied an apartment to homosexuals .
the proposal would not cover family law , so it would not try to legalize homosexual marriages .
it would also not try to change national measures that ensure the secular nature of their education system .
difference of opinion bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german family minister ursula von der leyen does n't think eu regulations should be strengthened von der leyen , however , maintained that no new eu regulations were necessary .
" we believe that germany has created a very high level of protection , " she said .
but the eu commission thinks that germany still needs to beef up protections against discrimination in terms of the housing market .
according to the recommendations put forth in july all professional rental agencies should be subject to the anti-discrimination regulations .
under the current rules in germany , they " usually " only apply to renters who have more than 50 properties to rent out .
however , von der leyen refused to discuss the content of the draft legislation .
the real question here is : " should europe meddle in national affairs or not ? " said the minister . not enough bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the eu proposed a european-wide strengthening of regulations protecting people with disabilities the dutch social minister piet hein donner held firm , saying that the european community is a community of shared values .
" no member country can seriously have something against the recommendations of the commission , which aim to better protect these values , " he added .
donner 's austrian counterpart , erwin buchinger even demanded even tougher regulations than the commission has already proposed .
" we would like a more ambitious approach for people with disabilities , " he said .
" the level of protection needs to be as high as possible . "
but even the supporters of the new guidelines are a little critical , specifically saying that the eu commission 's proposed plan is sloppily formulated and is full of obscurities .
" there are more questions that answers , " said dutch social minister donner .
the commission should now analyze the consequences of their recommendations before they proceed any further . dw staff -lrb- mrm -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

as a child , the democrat party 's candidate , barack obama , lived in indonesia for several years after his mother married an indonesian .
some indonesians think that means he understands them and the world better . indonesians in the united states feel a close bond with democrat presidential candidate barack obama and are watching the election campaign very closely .
abdul nuradnan , an indonesian citizen , says he often discusses the elections with relatives and friends back home : “ they usually ask whether there will be better relations with indonesia , if barack obama becomes president . ”
“ of course , ” he says , chuckling , “ i told them that might be so .

most indonesians favour obama but not everybody in indonesia seems as interested in the us elections as abdul nuradnan ’ s relatives .
a us-based pew research center poll earlier this year indicated that just 15 percent of the indonesian population was following the us elections - those who were interested mostly favoured obama .
there is a widespread hope that an obama win would change the way much of the world perceives the us .
the pew poll also found that fewer than 40 percent of indonesians have a positive view of the us - a 10 percentage point rise over the previous year .
richard wyke of the pew global attitudes project said this reflects worldwide opinion : “ there ’ s a lot of opposition , a lot of negative feelings about key aspects of american foreign policy in much of the world - indonesia included .
things like the war in iraq , the war on terror , a general perception of us unilateralism . ”

obama himself has said that the time he spent in indonesia has given him a better perspective of how other countries perceive us decisions - he said it was the strongest experience he had had in foreign relations .
however , not all observers believe that things would change considerably under an obama presidency .
faisal mangoenkosono , an assistant to the indonesian ambassador in washington last week cautioned his compatriots against raising their hopes too high .

" in america … as in europe and the rest of the world , we have to face up to the major corrections -lrb- of financial markets -rrb- that are underway , " trichet told french radio thursday .
" so we can not say that after such and such an action , it is all over . "
his sentiments were echoed in other parts of the world .
" even if the house passes the bill , we can not expect markets to recover given the weak economy , " said kazuhiro takahashi , head of equities at daiwa securities smbc in tokyo .
nevertheless , european commission president jose manuel barroso lent his support to us efforts to prop up its economy with the bailout plan , labelling it a " step in the right direction .
if at first you do n't succeed ...
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the us senate believes the revised bailout package will be passed by the house after the original bailout bill was defeated monday , sept .
29 , the legislation was revamped to include $ 150 billion in tax breaks for middle class american families and business , and insurance on bank deposits of up to $ 250,000 , up from the previous limit of $ 100,000 .
limits on exorbitant severance packages for wall street executives responsible for the bad investments that contributed to the crisis have been maintained in the revised legislation .
us president george w. bush pleaded thursday to the house to follow the lead taken by senate on wednesday and approve the plan , insisting the issue had gone beyond affecting new york and wall street and was now hitting " hard-working people . "
the markets have been turbulent this week amid fears the bill could once again fail ratification at the house .
us weakened politically and economically bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : russian president dmitry medvedev says the crisis has heralded an end to us economic domination whether the bailout is ratified or not , many see the current crisis in financial markets as having catalyzed a significant political and economic weakening of the us .
russian president dmitry medvedev was particularly forthright in his comments .
on thursday , he said the crisis had shown us global financial dominance was at an end and that there was a need for a new economic system .
" the time of domination by one economy and one currency has been consigned to the past once and for all , " medvedev said .
in europe , too , the us is regarded as ailing .
" they are no longer in a position of strength , on the economic level as well as the geostrategic level , " france 's european affairs minister jean-pierre jouyet told les echos financial newspaper friday .
jouyet said the meltdown of the us financial system gave impetus to calls for greater financial market regulation in preference over the free-market approach blamed for the crisis .
" europe today has a window of opportunity to make the case for standards and values in terms of regulation .
the financial industry must be of service to the financing of the real economy , " he said .
european leaders are split over the appropriateness of a us-style bailout for europe , with german chancellor angela merkel dismissing calls for a joint european fund to help underwrite the debts of flailing european banks .
financial institutions from britain , germany , and the benelux countries of belgium , the netherlands and luxembourg have all required state intervention to stay afloat in the midst of the crisis . dw staff -lrb- dm / jg -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" in america … as in europe and the rest of the world , we have to face up to the major corrections -lrb- of financial markets -rrb- that are underway , " trichet told french radio thursday .
" so we can not say that after such and such an action , it is all over . "
his sentiments were echoed in other parts of the world .
" even if the house passes the bill , we can not expect markets to recover given the weak economy , " said kazuhiro takahashi , head of equities at daiwa securities smbc in tokyo .
nevertheless , european commission president jose manuel barroso lent his support to us efforts to prop up its economy with the bailout plan , labelling it a " step in the right direction .
if at first you do n't succeed ...
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the us senate believes the revised bailout package will be passed by the house after the original bailout bill was defeated monday , sept .
29 , the legislation was revamped to include $ 150 billion in tax breaks for middle class american families and business , and insurance on bank deposits of up to $ 250,000 , up from the previous limit of $ 100,000 .
limits on exorbitant severance packages for wall street executives responsible for the bad investments that contributed to the crisis have been maintained in the revised legislation .
us president george w. bush pleaded thursday to the house to follow the lead taken by senate on wednesday and approve the plan , insisting the issue had gone beyond affecting new york and wall street and was now hitting " hard-working people . "
the markets have been turbulent this week amid fears the bill could once again fail ratification at the house .
us weakened politically and economically bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : russian president dmitry medvedev says the crisis has heralded an end to us economic domination whether the bailout is ratified or not , many see the current crisis in financial markets as having catalyzed a significant political and economic weakening of the us .
russian president dmitry medvedev was particularly forthright in his comments .
on thursday , he said the crisis had shown us global financial dominance was at an end and that there was a need for a new economic system .

bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the us senate believes the revised bailout package will be passed by the house after the original bailout bill was defeated monday , sept .
29 , the legislation was revamped to include $ 150 billion in tax breaks for middle class american families and business , and insurance on bank deposits of up to $ 250,000 , up from the previous limit of $ 100,000 .
limits on exorbitant severance packages for wall street executives responsible for the bad investments that contributed to the crisis have been maintained in the revised legislation .
us president george w. bush pleaded thursday to the house to follow the lead taken by senate on wednesday and approve the plan , insisting the issue had gone beyond affecting new york and wall street and was now hitting " hard-working people . "

while several of the member states are in favor of more eu control , others , including germany , are n't so sure . german family minister ursula von der leyen spoke out against the strengthening of current eu regulations in this area during a meeting with her european counterparts in luxembourg on thursday .
supported by italy , denmark , the czech republic and greece , she accused the eu commission of exceeding its authority .
spain , great britain , the benelux nations , austria and sweden , by contrast , all stood behind the commission .
the proposals unveiled by eu social commissioner vladimir spidla are designed to beef up social protection across the bloc .
that includes the protection offered to disabled people , the old , homosexuals and religious and ethnic miniorities .
the draft legislation supplements existing laws that ensure mainly equal treatment in the workplace , seeking to root out discrimination in socially-sensitive areas as social security , health care , education and access to and supply of goods which are commercially available to the public , including housing . the measure proposes setting up " equality bodies " in all member states to which a sufferer of discrimination could complain before pursuing a possible court action .
for example , a lettings agency could be sued in court if it denied an apartment to homosexuals .
the proposal would not cover family law , so it would not try to legalize homosexual marriages .
it would also not try to change national measures that ensure the secular nature of their education system .
difference of opinion bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german family minister ursula von der leyen does n't think eu regulations should be strengthened von der leyen , however , maintained that no new eu regulations were necessary .
" we believe that germany has created a very high level of protection , " she said .
but the eu commission thinks that germany still needs to beef up protections against discrimination in terms of the housing market .
according to the recommendations put forth in july all professional rental agencies should be subject to the anti-discrimination regulations .
under the current rules in germany , they " usually " only apply to renters who have more than 50 properties to rent out .
however , von der leyen refused to discuss the content of the draft legislation .
the real question here is : " should europe meddle in national affairs or not ? " said the minister . not enough bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the eu proposed a european-wide strengthening of regulations protecting people with disabilities the dutch social minister piet hein donner held firm , saying that the european community is a community of shared values .
" no member country can seriously have something against the recommendations of the commission , which aim to better protect these values , " he added .
donner 's austrian counterpart , erwin buchinger even demanded even tougher regulations than the commission has already proposed .
" we would like a more ambitious approach for people with disabilities , " he said .
" the level of protection needs to be as high as possible . "
but even the supporters of the new guidelines are a little critical , specifically saying that the eu commission 's proposed plan is sloppily formulated and is full of obscurities .

as a child , the democrat party 's candidate , barack obama , lived in indonesia for several years after his mother married an indonesian .
some indonesians think that means he understands them and the world better . indonesians in the united states feel a close bond with democrat presidential candidate barack obama and are watching the election campaign very closely .
abdul nuradnan , an indonesian citizen , says he often discusses the elections with relatives and friends back home : “ they usually ask whether there will be better relations with indonesia , if barack obama becomes president . ”
“ of course , ” he says , chuckling , “ i told them that might be so .
because barack obama lived for some time in indonesia , he has a better understanding . ”
most indonesians favour obama but not everybody in indonesia seems as interested in the us elections as abdul nuradnan ’ s relatives .
a us-based pew research center poll earlier this year indicated that just 15 percent of the indonesian population was following the us elections - those who were interested mostly favoured obama .
there is a widespread hope that an obama win would change the way much of the world perceives the us .
the pew poll also found that fewer than 40 percent of indonesians have a positive view of the us - a 10 percentage point rise over the previous year .
richard wyke of the pew global attitudes project said this reflects worldwide opinion : “ there ’ s a lot of opposition , a lot of negative feelings about key aspects of american foreign policy in much of the world - indonesia included .
things like the war in iraq , the war on terror , a general perception of us unilateralism . ”
more sensitive to international community obama ’ s advisors have said the democrat candidate would be much more sensitive to the needs of the international community if he became president than his republican rival john mccain .

as a child , the democrat party 's candidate , barack obama , lived in indonesia for several years after his mother married an indonesian .
some indonesians think that means he understands them and the world better . indonesians in the united states feel a close bond with democrat presidential candidate barack obama and are watching the election campaign very closely .
abdul nuradnan , an indonesian citizen , says he often discusses the elections with relatives and friends back home : “ they usually ask whether there will be better relations with indonesia , if barack obama becomes president . ”
“ of course , ” he says , chuckling , “ i told them that might be so .
because barack obama lived for some time in indonesia , he has a better understanding . ”
most indonesians favour obama but not everybody in indonesia seems as interested in the us elections as abdul nuradnan ’ s relatives .
a us-based pew research center poll earlier this year indicated that just 15 percent of the indonesian population was following the us elections - those who were interested mostly favoured obama .
there is a widespread hope that an obama win would change the way much of the world perceives the us .
the pew poll also found that fewer than 40 percent of indonesians have a positive view of the us - a 10 percentage point rise over the previous year .
richard wyke of the pew global attitudes project said this reflects worldwide opinion : “ there ’ s a lot of opposition , a lot of negative feelings about key aspects of american foreign policy in much of the world - indonesia included .
things like the war in iraq , the war on terror , a general perception of us unilateralism . ”
more sensitive to international community obama ’ s advisors have said the democrat candidate would be much more sensitive to the needs of the international community if he became president than his republican rival john mccain .
obama himself has said that the time he spent in indonesia has given him a better perspective of how other countries perceive us decisions - he said it was the strongest experience he had had in foreign relations .
however , not all observers believe that things would change considerably under an obama presidency .
faisal mangoenkosono , an assistant to the indonesian ambassador in washington last week cautioned his compatriots against raising their hopes too high .
“ they should always remember , ” he said , “ as indonesians , that he is through and through american .
and he would follow the interests of what is important for america so one should not be disappointed if he , at one time , were to rule against our interests . ”
but first he would have to be elected .
with one month to go before us citizens go to the polls , indonesians worldwide will continue to speculate about the good and bad sides of a possible obama presidency . laura iiyama 03/10/08 send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic 9798 global media forum human rights in a globalized world - challenges for the media japanese economy japan 's earthquake and tsunami are likely to affect the japanese economy in the coming weeks .

newly released archives reveal that the bbc had an answer . archives released friday , oct .
3 , reveal that the bbc planned to transmit reassuring messages in the event of a nuclear attack by the soviet union .
the broadcast would have been repeated every two hours , and told people to " stay calm , " remain indoors , and conserve food and water .
according to archived documents , the message would have been : " this country has been attacked with nuclear weapons .
communications have been severely disrupted , and the number of casualties and the extent of the damage are not yet known . "
it would go on to remind people that there was nothing to be gained by trying to get away , and warned people that by leaving their homes they could be exposing themselves to greater danger , as radioactive fall-out , which follows a nuclear explosion , is many times more dangerous when one is directly exposed to it in the open .
familiar radio voices bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : nuclear attack was a very real threat during the cold war the transcript was part of files declassified by britain 's national archives , which releases official documents after 30 years .
the threat of a possible nuclear war between the united states and the soviet union was very real from the time the second world war ended to when the berlin wall fell in 1989 .
during this time , public service films gave information about how to prepare for a nuclear attack .
in addition to the script , the archive files included recommendations that the bbc continue to give live updates emphasizing that the broadcaster had not been " obliterated . "
there were also letters detailing discussions between the bbc and various government departments on the use of familiar voices , which were deemed necessary to reassure people " the bbc is still there . "
" the reassurance that ' the bbc is still there ' would not be gleaned from a recorded announcement by an unfamiliar voice , " wrote harold greenwood from the ministry of posts and telecommunications in a letter dated june 1974 .
" indeed , if an unfamiliar voice repeats the same announcement hour after hour for 12 hours listeners may begin to suspect that they are listening to a machine set to switch on every hour -lrb- or even that it has got stuck -rrb- and that perhaps after all the bbc has been obliterated , " he added .
conserve resources after attack the carefully-worded draft script included advice on how to conserve resources while inside after a nuclear strike .
" stay in your own homes , and if you live in an area where a fall-out warning has been given , stay in your fall-out room until you are told it is safe to come out , " it read .
" the message that the immediate danger has passed will be given by the sirens and repeated on this wavelength .
make sure that the gas and all fuel supplies are turned off and that all fires are extinguished .
water must be rationed , and used only for essential drinking and cooking purposes .
it must not be used for flushing lavatories .
ration your food supply : it may have to last for 14 days or more . "
the message was meant to end with telling people that the bbc would repeat the broadcast in two hours ' time .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de european union -pipe- 03.10.2008 berlin opposes new eu anti-discrimination laws großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany thinks the eu should butt out of national matters back in july , the european commission proposed new eu-wide anti-discrimination legislation .
while several of the member states are in favor of more eu control , others , including germany , are n't so sure . german family minister ursula von der leyen spoke out against the strengthening of current eu regulations in this area during a meeting with her european counterparts in luxembourg on thursday .
supported by italy , denmark , the czech republic and greece , she accused the eu commission of exceeding its authority .
spain , great britain , the benelux nations , austria and sweden , by contrast , all stood behind the commission .
the proposals unveiled by eu social commissioner vladimir spidla are designed to beef up social protection across the bloc .
that includes the protection offered to disabled people , the old , homosexuals and religious and ethnic miniorities .
the draft legislation supplements existing laws that ensure mainly equal treatment in the workplace , seeking to root out discrimination in socially-sensitive areas as social security , health care , education and access to and supply of goods which are commercially available to the public , including housing . the measure proposes setting up " equality bodies " in all member states to which a sufferer of discrimination could complain before pursuing a possible court action .
for example , a lettings agency could be sued in court if it denied an apartment to homosexuals .
the proposal would not cover family law , so it would not try to legalize homosexual marriages .
it would also not try to change national measures that ensure the secular nature of their education system .
difference of opinion bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german family minister ursula von der leyen does n't think eu regulations should be strengthened von der leyen , however , maintained that no new eu regulations were necessary .
" we believe that germany has created a very high level of protection , " she said .
but the eu commission thinks that germany still needs to beef up protections against discrimination in terms of the housing market .
according to the recommendations put forth in july all professional rental agencies should be subject to the anti-discrimination regulations .
under the current rules in germany , they " usually " only apply to renters who have more than 50 properties to rent out .
however , von der leyen refused to discuss the content of the draft legislation .
the real question here is : " should europe meddle in national affairs or not ? " said the minister . not enough bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the eu proposed a european-wide strengthening of regulations protecting people with disabilities the dutch social minister piet hein donner held firm , saying that the european community is a community of shared values .
" no member country can seriously have something against the recommendations of the commission , which aim to better protect these values , " he added .
donner 's austrian counterpart , erwin buchinger even demanded even tougher regulations than the commission has already proposed .
" we would like a more ambitious approach for people with disabilities , " he said .
" the level of protection needs to be as high as possible . "
but even the supporters of the new guidelines are a little critical , specifically saying that the eu commission 's proposed plan is sloppily formulated and is full of obscurities .
" there are more questions that answers , " said dutch social minister donner .
the commission should now analyze the consequences of their recommendations before they proceed any further . dw staff -lrb- mrm -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

while several of the member states are in favor of more eu control , others , including germany , are n't so sure . german family minister ursula von der leyen spoke out against the strengthening of current eu regulations in this area during a meeting with her european counterparts in luxembourg on thursday .
supported by italy , denmark , the czech republic and greece , she accused the eu commission of exceeding its authority .
spain , great britain , the benelux nations , austria and sweden , by contrast , all stood behind the commission .
the proposals unveiled by eu social commissioner vladimir spidla are designed to beef up social protection across the bloc .
that includes the protection offered to disabled people , the old , homosexuals and religious and ethnic miniorities .
the draft legislation supplements existing laws that ensure mainly equal treatment in the workplace , seeking to root out discrimination in socially-sensitive areas as social security , health care , education and access to and supply of goods which are commercially available to the public , including housing . the measure proposes setting up " equality bodies " in all member states to which a sufferer of discrimination could complain before pursuing a possible court action .
for example , a lettings agency could be sued in court if it denied an apartment to homosexuals .
the proposal would not cover family law , so it would not try to legalize homosexual marriages .
it would also not try to change national measures that ensure the secular nature of their education system .
difference of opinion bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german family minister ursula von der leyen does n't think eu regulations should be strengthened von der leyen , however , maintained that no new eu regulations were necessary .
" we believe that germany has created a very high level of protection , " she said .
but the eu commission thinks that germany still needs to beef up protections against discrimination in terms of the housing market .
according to the recommendations put forth in july all professional rental agencies should be subject to the anti-discrimination regulations .
under the current rules in germany , they " usually " only apply to renters who have more than 50 properties to rent out .
however , von der leyen refused to discuss the content of the draft legislation .
the real question here is : " should europe meddle in national affairs or not ? " said the minister . not enough bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the eu proposed a european-wide strengthening of regulations protecting people with disabilities the dutch social minister piet hein donner held firm , saying that the european community is a community of shared values .

" we would like a more ambitious approach for people with disabilities , " he said .
" the level of protection needs to be as high as possible . "

just how similar are the plans - and will they help ? the banking crisis spread to germany this week when the german government offered a lifeline to commercial mortgage lender hypo real estate as it teetered on the verge of collapse .
the news came on the same day that the united states house of representatives failed to pass the $ 700 billion -lrb- 500 billion-euro -rrb- bailout plan proposed by secretary of the treasury henry paulson .
that plan has since been approved by the senate , with a few alterations , including up to $ 100 billion in tax break extensions for middle class families and businesses .
the german government has come up with a similar plan to bail out hypo real estate , albeit a slightly less expensive one .
on thursday , the european commission gave the go-ahead for the 35 billion-euro deal .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some institutions , like the venerable lehman brothers , did n't get bailouts - with disastrous results the government bailout in germany came just one week after german chancellor angela merkel denounced the us plan as being " too little , too late . "
she had since changed her mind and urged the us congress to pass a rescue package .
the house is tentatively set to revote on the bill on friday .
it all comes down to the taxpayer apart from the price tag , there are other differences between the rescue plans on both sides of the atlantic . in the us , the bill that has been passed by the senate calls for a government office to be set up which will initially take control of $ 250 billion in " troubled assets . "
according to helge berger , professor of economics and monetary theory at the free university in berlin , they will pay above market price for these assets , which basically amounts to a government subsidy .
" the government will assume that it will hold this paper to the very , very end , hoping that it will gain in value , " he added .
the german deal , on the other hand , is a 35 billion-euro private loan from a group of banks which is then guaranteed by the german government - and ultimately by the german tax payer .
but these methods are n't quite as different as they may seem , said berger .
" it may be that private banks are doing the financing right now , but they hold none of the risk , and i think that 's very important in economic terms , " berger said , emphasizing that the loan is guaranteed with public funds .
berger made it clear , however , that , just like in the american plan , the german one provides the government the option of seizing the company in the event of a default .
governments benefit from acquiring bank shares other countries in europe are feeling the crunch too .
great britain has nationalized lender bradford & bingley , while the benelux nations of belgium , luxembourg and the netherlands bailed out the insurance and banking group fortis with 11.2 billion euros . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : belgium , luxembourg and the netherlands pulled together 11.2 billion euros to bail out fortis with both of these plans , the respective governments did n't just get troubled assets , they also got shares in the banks .
berger said sees this as a huge advantage , since there are still viable credits owned by these financial institutions , which in turn are then owned by the governments .
though the benelux nations manage to reach an agreement on fortis , the european union as a whole is having trouble deciding on a joint response to the financial crisis .
europe divided on bloc-wide bailout on thursday french finance minister christine legarde suggested in an interview with the german newspaper handelsblatt that the eu should set up a european-wide rescue plan .
france currently holds the rotating eu presidency .
" what happens if a smaller eu state is affected by a looming bank collapse ?
maybe this country does not have the means to save the bank , " she said .
stock market expert ulrich barts , based in frankfurt , is in favor of the plan .
he said that banks need to start trusting one another again .
barts also called for more regulation , saying that a serious look should be taken at how banks sell products and that they have to reveal the risks involved in the products they sell .
" you also have to put in some sort of measure to allow the european union to act as a whole in order to help the financial sector in such a crisis and to detect possible problems earlier and then be able to act as the authorities have in the us , " he added .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : french finance minister christine lagarde proposed an eu wide rescue fund the proposed plan reportedly totaled 300 billion euros , though both the french and dutch governments have denied such a proposal has been made .
however , no matter what the final cost is , germany has said it is against it .
chancellor merkel will be attending the emergency finance summit on saturday in paris , which was called by french president nicolas sarkozy .
the leaders of britain and italy , european commission president jose manuel barroso , european central bank president jean-claude trichet and eurogroup chairman jean-claude juncker will also be there . mark mattox send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

just how similar are the plans - and will they help ? the banking crisis spread to germany this week when the german government offered a lifeline to commercial mortgage lender hypo real estate as it teetered on the verge of collapse .
the news came on the same day that the united states house of representatives failed to pass the $ 700 billion -lrb- 500 billion-euro -rrb- bailout plan proposed by secretary of the treasury henry paulson .
that plan has since been approved by the senate , with a few alterations , including up to $ 100 billion in tax break extensions for middle class families and businesses .
the german government has come up with a similar plan to bail out hypo real estate , albeit a slightly less expensive one .
on thursday , the european commission gave the go-ahead for the 35 billion-euro deal .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some institutions , like the venerable lehman brothers , did n't get bailouts - with disastrous results the government bailout in germany came just one week after german chancellor angela merkel denounced the us plan as being " too little , too late . "
she had since changed her mind and urged the us congress to pass a rescue package .
the house is tentatively set to revote on the bill on friday .
it all comes down to the taxpayer apart from the price tag , there are other differences between the rescue plans on both sides of the atlantic . in the us , the bill that has been passed by the senate calls for a government office to be set up which will initially take control of $ 250 billion in " troubled assets . "
according to helge berger , professor of economics and monetary theory at the free university in berlin , they will pay above market price for these assets , which basically amounts to a government subsidy .
" the government will assume that it will hold this paper to the very , very end , hoping that it will gain in value , " he added .
the german deal , on the other hand , is a 35 billion-euro private loan from a group of banks which is then guaranteed by the german government - and ultimately by the german tax payer .
but these methods are n't quite as different as they may seem , said berger .
" it may be that private banks are doing the financing right now , but they hold none of the risk , and i think that 's very important in economic terms , " berger said , emphasizing that the loan is guaranteed with public funds .
berger made it clear , however , that , just like in the american plan , the german one provides the government the option of seizing the company in the event of a default .
governments benefit from acquiring bank shares other countries in europe are feeling the crunch too .
great britain has nationalized lender bradford & bingley , while the benelux nations of belgium , luxembourg and the netherlands bailed out the insurance and banking group fortis with 11.2 billion euros . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : belgium , luxembourg and the netherlands pulled together 11.2 billion euros to bail out fortis with both of these plans , the respective governments did n't just get troubled assets , they also got shares in the banks .
berger said sees this as a huge advantage , since there are still viable credits owned by these financial institutions , which in turn are then owned by the governments .
though the benelux nations manage to reach an agreement on fortis , the european union as a whole is having trouble deciding on a joint response to the financial crisis .
europe divided on bloc-wide bailout on thursday french finance minister christine legarde suggested in an interview with the german newspaper handelsblatt that the eu should set up a european-wide rescue plan .
france currently holds the rotating eu presidency .
" what happens if a smaller eu state is affected by a looming bank collapse ?
maybe this country does not have the means to save the bank , " she said .
stock market expert ulrich barts , based in frankfurt , is in favor of the plan .
he said that banks need to start trusting one another again .
barts also called for more regulation , saying that a serious look should be taken at how banks sell products and that they have to reveal the risks involved in the products they sell .
" you also have to put in some sort of measure to allow the european union to act as a whole in order to help the financial sector in such a crisis and to detect possible problems earlier and then be able to act as the authorities have in the us , " he added .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : french finance minister christine lagarde proposed an eu wide rescue fund the proposed plan reportedly totaled 300 billion euros , though both the french and dutch governments have denied such a proposal has been made .
however , no matter what the final cost is , germany has said it is against it .
chancellor merkel will be attending the emergency finance summit on saturday in paris , which was called by french president nicolas sarkozy .
the leaders of britain and italy , european commission president jose manuel barroso , european central bank president jean-claude trichet and eurogroup chairman jean-claude juncker will also be there . mark mattox send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

self-employed women would also get the same maternity leave as salaried employees under the proposal , the commission said .

while several of the member states are in favor of more eu control , others , including germany , are n't so sure . german family minister ursula von der leyen spoke out against the strengthening of current eu regulations in this area during a meeting with her european counterparts in luxembourg on thursday .
supported by italy , denmark , the czech republic and greece , she accused the eu commission of exceeding its authority .
spain , great britain , the benelux nations , austria and sweden , by contrast , all stood behind the commission .
the proposals unveiled by eu social commissioner vladimir spidla are designed to beef up social protection across the bloc .
that includes the protection offered to disabled people , the old , homosexuals and religious and ethnic miniorities .
the draft legislation supplements existing laws that ensure mainly equal treatment in the workplace , seeking to root out discrimination in socially-sensitive areas as social security , health care , education and access to and supply of goods which are commercially available to the public , including housing . the measure proposes setting up " equality bodies " in all member states to which a sufferer of discrimination could complain before pursuing a possible court action .
for example , a lettings agency could be sued in court if it denied an apartment to homosexuals .
the proposal would not cover family law , so it would not try to legalize homosexual marriages .
it would also not try to change national measures that ensure the secular nature of their education system .
difference of opinion bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german family minister ursula von der leyen does n't think eu regulations should be strengthened von der leyen , however , maintained that no new eu regulations were necessary .
" we believe that germany has created a very high level of protection , " she said .
but the eu commission thinks that germany still needs to beef up protections against discrimination in terms of the housing market .
according to the recommendations put forth in july all professional rental agencies should be subject to the anti-discrimination regulations .
under the current rules in germany , they " usually " only apply to renters who have more than 50 properties to rent out .
however , von der leyen refused to discuss the content of the draft legislation .
the real question here is : " should europe meddle in national affairs or not ? " said the minister . not enough bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the eu proposed a european-wide strengthening of regulations protecting people with disabilities the dutch social minister piet hein donner held firm , saying that the european community is a community of shared values .

" the level of protection needs to be as high as possible . "
but even the supporters of the new guidelines are a little critical , specifically saying that the eu commission 's proposed plan is sloppily formulated and is full of obscurities .

just how similar are the plans - and will they help ? the banking crisis spread to germany this week when the german government offered a lifeline to commercial mortgage lender hypo real estate as it teetered on the verge of collapse .
the news came on the same day that the united states house of representatives failed to pass the $ 700 billion -lrb- 500 billion-euro -rrb- bailout plan proposed by secretary of the treasury henry paulson .
that plan has since been approved by the senate , with a few alterations , including up to $ 100 billion in tax break extensions for middle class families and businesses .
the german government has come up with a similar plan to bail out hypo real estate , albeit a slightly less expensive one .
on thursday , the european commission gave the go-ahead for the 35 billion-euro deal .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some institutions , like the venerable lehman brothers , did n't get bailouts - with disastrous results the government bailout in germany came just one week after german chancellor angela merkel denounced the us plan as being " too little , too late . "
she had since changed her mind and urged the us congress to pass a rescue package .
the house is tentatively set to revote on the bill on friday .
it all comes down to the taxpayer apart from the price tag , there are other differences between the rescue plans on both sides of the atlantic . in the us , the bill that has been passed by the senate calls for a government office to be set up which will initially take control of $ 250 billion in " troubled assets . "
according to helge berger , professor of economics and monetary theory at the free university in berlin , they will pay above market price for these assets , which basically amounts to a government subsidy .
" the government will assume that it will hold this paper to the very , very end , hoping that it will gain in value , " he added .
the german deal , on the other hand , is a 35 billion-euro private loan from a group of banks which is then guaranteed by the german government - and ultimately by the german tax payer .
but these methods are n't quite as different as they may seem , said berger .
" it may be that private banks are doing the financing right now , but they hold none of the risk , and i think that 's very important in economic terms , " berger said , emphasizing that the loan is guaranteed with public funds .
berger made it clear , however , that , just like in the american plan , the german one provides the government the option of seizing the company in the event of a default .
governments benefit from acquiring bank shares other countries in europe are feeling the crunch too .
great britain has nationalized lender bradford & bingley , while the benelux nations of belgium , luxembourg and the netherlands bailed out the insurance and banking group fortis with 11.2 billion euros . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : belgium , luxembourg and the netherlands pulled together 11.2 billion euros to bail out fortis with both of these plans , the respective governments did n't just get troubled assets , they also got shares in the banks .
berger said sees this as a huge advantage , since there are still viable credits owned by these financial institutions , which in turn are then owned by the governments .
though the benelux nations manage to reach an agreement on fortis , the european union as a whole is having trouble deciding on a joint response to the financial crisis .
europe divided on bloc-wide bailout on thursday french finance minister christine legarde suggested in an interview with the german newspaper handelsblatt that the eu should set up a european-wide rescue plan .
france currently holds the rotating eu presidency .
" what happens if a smaller eu state is affected by a looming bank collapse ?
maybe this country does not have the means to save the bank , " she said .
stock market expert ulrich barts , based in frankfurt , is in favor of the plan .
he said that banks need to start trusting one another again .
barts also called for more regulation , saying that a serious look should be taken at how banks sell products and that they have to reveal the risks involved in the products they sell .
" you also have to put in some sort of measure to allow the european union to act as a whole in order to help the financial sector in such a crisis and to detect possible problems earlier and then be able to act as the authorities have in the us , " he added .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : french finance minister christine lagarde proposed an eu wide rescue fund the proposed plan reportedly totaled 300 billion euros , though both the french and dutch governments have denied such a proposal has been made .
however , no matter what the final cost is , germany has said it is against it .
chancellor merkel will be attending the emergency finance summit on saturday in paris , which was called by french president nicolas sarkozy .
the leaders of britain and italy , european commission president jose manuel barroso , european central bank president jean-claude trichet and eurogroup chairman jean-claude juncker will also be there . mark mattox send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

while several of the member states are in favor of more eu control , others , including germany , are n't so sure . german family minister ursula von der leyen spoke out against the strengthening of current eu regulations in this area during a meeting with her european counterparts in luxembourg on thursday .
supported by italy , denmark , the czech republic and greece , she accused the eu commission of exceeding its authority .
spain , great britain , the benelux nations , austria and sweden , by contrast , all stood behind the commission .
the proposals unveiled by eu social commissioner vladimir spidla are designed to beef up social protection across the bloc .
that includes the protection offered to disabled people , the old , homosexuals and religious and ethnic miniorities .
the draft legislation supplements existing laws that ensure mainly equal treatment in the workplace , seeking to root out discrimination in socially-sensitive areas as social security , health care , education and access to and supply of goods which are commercially available to the public , including housing . the measure proposes setting up " equality bodies " in all member states to which a sufferer of discrimination could complain before pursuing a possible court action .
for example , a lettings agency could be sued in court if it denied an apartment to homosexuals .
the proposal would not cover family law , so it would not try to legalize homosexual marriages .
it would also not try to change national measures that ensure the secular nature of their education system .
difference of opinion bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german family minister ursula von der leyen does n't think eu regulations should be strengthened von der leyen , however , maintained that no new eu regulations were necessary .
" we believe that germany has created a very high level of protection , " she said .
but the eu commission thinks that germany still needs to beef up protections against discrimination in terms of the housing market .
according to the recommendations put forth in july all professional rental agencies should be subject to the anti-discrimination regulations .
under the current rules in germany , they " usually " only apply to renters who have more than 50 properties to rent out .
however , von der leyen refused to discuss the content of the draft legislation .
the real question here is : " should europe meddle in national affairs or not ? " said the minister . not enough bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the eu proposed a european-wide strengthening of regulations protecting people with disabilities the dutch social minister piet hein donner held firm , saying that the european community is a community of shared values .
" no member country can seriously have something against the recommendations of the commission , which aim to better protect these values , " he added .
donner 's austrian counterpart , erwin buchinger even demanded even tougher regulations than the commission has already proposed .
" we would like a more ambitious approach for people with disabilities , " he said .
" the level of protection needs to be as high as possible . "
but even the supporters of the new guidelines are a little critical , specifically saying that the eu commission 's proposed plan is sloppily formulated and is full of obscurities .
" there are more questions that answers , " said dutch social minister donner .
the commission should now analyze the consequences of their recommendations before they proceed any further . dw staff -lrb- mrm -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" in america … as in europe and the rest of the world , we have to face up to the major corrections -lrb- of financial markets -rrb- that are underway , " trichet told french radio thursday .
" so we can not say that after such and such an action , it is all over . "
his sentiments were echoed in other parts of the world .
" even if the house passes the bill , we can not expect markets to recover given the weak economy , " said kazuhiro takahashi , head of equities at daiwa securities smbc in tokyo .
nevertheless , european commission president jose manuel barroso lent his support to us efforts to prop up its economy with the bailout plan , labelling it a " step in the right direction .

bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the us senate believes the revised bailout package will be passed by the house after the original bailout bill was defeated monday , sept .
29 , the legislation was revamped to include $ 150 billion in tax breaks for middle class american families and business , and insurance on bank deposits of up to $ 250,000 , up from the previous limit of $ 100,000 .
limits on exorbitant severance packages for wall street executives responsible for the bad investments that contributed to the crisis have been maintained in the revised legislation .
us president george w. bush pleaded thursday to the house to follow the lead taken by senate on wednesday and approve the plan , insisting the issue had gone beyond affecting new york and wall street and was now hitting " hard-working people . "
the markets have been turbulent this week amid fears the bill could once again fail ratification at the house .

russian president dmitry medvedev was particularly forthright in his comments .
on thursday , he said the crisis had shown us global financial dominance was at an end and that there was a need for a new economic system .
" the time of domination by one economy and one currency has been consigned to the past once and for all , " medvedev said .
in europe , too , the us is regarded as ailing .
" they are no longer in a position of strength , on the economic level as well as the geostrategic level , " france 's european affairs minister jean-pierre jouyet told les echos financial newspaper friday .
jouyet said the meltdown of the us financial system gave impetus to calls for greater financial market regulation in preference over the free-market approach blamed for the crisis .
" europe today has a window of opportunity to make the case for standards and values in terms of regulation .
the financial industry must be of service to the financing of the real economy , " he said .

" in america … as in europe and the rest of the world , we have to face up to the major corrections -lrb- of financial markets -rrb- that are underway , " trichet told french radio thursday .
" so we can not say that after such and such an action , it is all over . "
his sentiments were echoed in other parts of the world .
" even if the house passes the bill , we can not expect markets to recover given the weak economy , " said kazuhiro takahashi , head of equities at daiwa securities smbc in tokyo .
nevertheless , european commission president jose manuel barroso lent his support to us efforts to prop up its economy with the bailout plan , labelling it a " step in the right direction .
if at first you do n't succeed ...
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the us senate believes the revised bailout package will be passed by the house after the original bailout bill was defeated monday , sept .
29 , the legislation was revamped to include $ 150 billion in tax breaks for middle class american families and business , and insurance on bank deposits of up to $ 250,000 , up from the previous limit of $ 100,000 .
limits on exorbitant severance packages for wall street executives responsible for the bad investments that contributed to the crisis have been maintained in the revised legislation .
us president george w. bush pleaded thursday to the house to follow the lead taken by senate on wednesday and approve the plan , insisting the issue had gone beyond affecting new york and wall street and was now hitting " hard-working people . "
the markets have been turbulent this week amid fears the bill could once again fail ratification at the house .
us weakened politically and economically bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : russian president dmitry medvedev says the crisis has heralded an end to us economic domination whether the bailout is ratified or not , many see the current crisis in financial markets as having catalyzed a significant political and economic weakening of the us .
russian president dmitry medvedev was particularly forthright in his comments .
on thursday , he said the crisis had shown us global financial dominance was at an end and that there was a need for a new economic system .
" the time of domination by one economy and one currency has been consigned to the past once and for all , " medvedev said .
in europe , too , the us is regarded as ailing .
" they are no longer in a position of strength , on the economic level as well as the geostrategic level , " france 's european affairs minister jean-pierre jouyet told les echos financial newspaper friday .
jouyet said the meltdown of the us financial system gave impetus to calls for greater financial market regulation in preference over the free-market approach blamed for the crisis .
" europe today has a window of opportunity to make the case for standards and values in terms of regulation .
the financial industry must be of service to the financing of the real economy , " he said .
european leaders are split over the appropriateness of a us-style bailout for europe , with german chancellor angela merkel dismissing calls for a joint european fund to help underwrite the debts of flailing european banks .

bundesbank presidnet axel weber , along with jochen sanio - head of the federal finance industry regulator bafin - as well as representatives of leading banks and insurance companies were involved in nailing down the final rescue deal .
besides commercial banks , germany 's state savings banks as well as cooperative banks were also to be involved in the rescue package , in addition to insurance firms .

the online edition of the die welt newspaper had said that the situation had become urgent and that hre faced the threat of insolvency if no deal had been reached by friday morning .
berlin said it would not be nationalizing munich-based hre , but would post a guarantee for it of 26.6 billion euros , while german commercial banks would protect hre from default with up to 8.5 billion euros .

the powerful blast damaged the russian infantry building and blew out windows in surrounding structures up to a half a kilometer away , interfax reported .
officials in the rebel province said the incident occurred after a suspect automobile was confiscated from georgian citizens by russian soldiers .
the four-wheel-drive vehicle turned out to be packed with explosives and blew up near the soldiers ' military base .
eduard koikoty , south ossetia 's rebel leader , was quick to accuse georgian special forces of organizing the attack .
" this was an attack planned by the georgian ministry of national security , " kokoity told russia 's state-run itar-tass news agency in tskhinvali .
georgia says its hands are clean bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : abkhazia , highlighted left , and south ossetia have declared independence from georgia georgian interior ministry spokesman shota utiashivili denied his country 's involvement in what appeared to be a car bombing targeting russian soldiers .

thousands of russian troops are stationed inside south ossetia , a second georgian breakaway province , abkhazia , as well as several “ buffer zones ” around those regions , after a brief war with georgia in august .

newly released archives reveal that the bbc had an answer . archives released friday , oct .
3 , reveal that the bbc planned to transmit reassuring messages in the event of a nuclear attack by the soviet union .
the broadcast would have been repeated every two hours , and told people to " stay calm , " remain indoors , and conserve food and water .
according to archived documents , the message would have been : " this country has been attacked with nuclear weapons .
communications have been severely disrupted , and the number of casualties and the extent of the damage are not yet known . "
it would go on to remind people that there was nothing to be gained by trying to get away , and warned people that by leaving their homes they could be exposing themselves to greater danger , as radioactive fall-out , which follows a nuclear explosion , is many times more dangerous when one is directly exposed to it in the open .
familiar radio voices bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : nuclear attack was a very real threat during the cold war the transcript was part of files declassified by britain 's national archives , which releases official documents after 30 years .
the threat of a possible nuclear war between the united states and the soviet union was very real from the time the second world war ended to when the berlin wall fell in 1989 .
during this time , public service films gave information about how to prepare for a nuclear attack .
in addition to the script , the archive files included recommendations that the bbc continue to give live updates emphasizing that the broadcaster had not been " obliterated . "
there were also letters detailing discussions between the bbc and various government departments on the use of familiar voices , which were deemed necessary to reassure people " the bbc is still there . "
" the reassurance that ' the bbc is still there ' would not be gleaned from a recorded announcement by an unfamiliar voice , " wrote harold greenwood from the ministry of posts and telecommunications in a letter dated june 1974 .
" indeed , if an unfamiliar voice repeats the same announcement hour after hour for 12 hours listeners may begin to suspect that they are listening to a machine set to switch on every hour -lrb- or even that it has got stuck -rrb- and that perhaps after all the bbc has been obliterated , " he added .
conserve resources after attack the carefully-worded draft script included advice on how to conserve resources while inside after a nuclear strike .
" stay in your own homes , and if you live in an area where a fall-out warning has been given , stay in your fall-out room until you are told it is safe to come out , " it read .
" the message that the immediate danger has passed will be given by the sirens and repeated on this wavelength .
make sure that the gas and all fuel supplies are turned off and that all fires are extinguished .
water must be rationed , and used only for essential drinking and cooking purposes .
it must not be used for flushing lavatories .
ration your food supply : it may have to last for 14 days or more . "
the message was meant to end with telling people that the bbc would repeat the broadcast in two hours ' time .
it asked them to stay tuned to that wavelength , but reminded them to switch their radios off in the meantime to save batteries . dw staff -lrb- mrm -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

as a child , the democrat party 's candidate , barack obama , lived in indonesia for several years after his mother married an indonesian .
some indonesians think that means he understands them and the world better . indonesians in the united states feel a close bond with democrat presidential candidate barack obama and are watching the election campaign very closely .
abdul nuradnan , an indonesian citizen , says he often discusses the elections with relatives and friends back home : “ they usually ask whether there will be better relations with indonesia , if barack obama becomes president . ”
“ of course , ” he says , chuckling , “ i told them that might be so .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de history -pipe- 03.10.2008 bbc planned reassuring message for nuclear war großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : britain had prepared for the worst during the cold war , the question of who would calm and instruct the masses in the event of a nuclear strike was a very real concern .
newly released archives reveal that the bbc had an answer . archives released friday , oct .
3 , reveal that the bbc planned to transmit reassuring messages in the event of a nuclear attack by the soviet union .
the broadcast would have been repeated every two hours , and told people to " stay calm , " remain indoors , and conserve food and water .
according to archived documents , the message would have been : " this country has been attacked with nuclear weapons .
communications have been severely disrupted , and the number of casualties and the extent of the damage are not yet known . "
it would go on to remind people that there was nothing to be gained by trying to get away , and warned people that by leaving their homes they could be exposing themselves to greater danger , as radioactive fall-out , which follows a nuclear explosion , is many times more dangerous when one is directly exposed to it in the open .
familiar radio voices bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : nuclear attack was a very real threat during the cold war the transcript was part of files declassified by britain 's national archives , which releases official documents after 30 years .
the threat of a possible nuclear war between the united states and the soviet union was very real from the time the second world war ended to when the berlin wall fell in 1989 .
during this time , public service films gave information about how to prepare for a nuclear attack .
in addition to the script , the archive files included recommendations that the bbc continue to give live updates emphasizing that the broadcaster had not been " obliterated . "
there were also letters detailing discussions between the bbc and various government departments on the use of familiar voices , which were deemed necessary to reassure people " the bbc is still there . "
" the reassurance that ' the bbc is still there ' would not be gleaned from a recorded announcement by an unfamiliar voice , " wrote harold greenwood from the ministry of posts and telecommunications in a letter dated june 1974 .
" indeed , if an unfamiliar voice repeats the same announcement hour after hour for 12 hours listeners may begin to suspect that they are listening to a machine set to switch on every hour -lrb- or even that it has got stuck -rrb- and that perhaps after all the bbc has been obliterated , " he added .
conserve resources after attack the carefully-worded draft script included advice on how to conserve resources while inside after a nuclear strike .
" stay in your own homes , and if you live in an area where a fall-out warning has been given , stay in your fall-out room until you are told it is safe to come out , " it read .

2 , in the russian city of st petersburg .
another big german company , basf , has already bought a quarter of the same field .
e.on controls a large part of germany 's gas and electricity supplies .
alternatives to russian gas part of the reason russia and germany are building the so-called nord stream pipeline under the baltic sea is to tap the siberian gas field , which has reserves of over 600 billion cubic meters , to feed the energy to german factories and homes .
other european nations have warned that germany may end up being too dependent on gazprom . e.on has tried harder than some of its german rivals to develop non-russian gas sources .
under the transaction , gazprom was able to buy back some of its own shares and reduce e.on 's influence on gazprom .
the owner of the production license and operator of the field will be russian oao severneftegazprom -lrb- sngp -rrb- , a statement by e.on said .
gazprom will hold just over half of sngp .
e.on 's ruhrgas unit and and basf 's wintershall division will each hold a stake of 25 percent minus one share .
energy for millions gas production at the site started last year and will reach around 25 billion cubic meters annually as early as next year , enough to supply a metropolis of approximately 10 million households .
under a complex swap , gazprom is to receive e.on ruhrgas 's 49 percent stake in the russian company zao gerosgaz , which holds just under 3 percent of gazprom shares .
after the transaction , e.on ruhrgas will still hold a 3.5-percent direct stake in gazprom . dpa news agency -lrb- kjb -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

newly released archives reveal that the bbc had an answer . archives released friday , oct .
3 , reveal that the bbc planned to transmit reassuring messages in the event of a nuclear attack by the soviet union .
the broadcast would have been repeated every two hours , and told people to " stay calm , " remain indoors , and conserve food and water .
according to archived documents , the message would have been : " this country has been attacked with nuclear weapons .
communications have been severely disrupted , and the number of casualties and the extent of the damage are not yet known . "
it would go on to remind people that there was nothing to be gained by trying to get away , and warned people that by leaving their homes they could be exposing themselves to greater danger , as radioactive fall-out , which follows a nuclear explosion , is many times more dangerous when one is directly exposed to it in the open .
familiar radio voices bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : nuclear attack was a very real threat during the cold war the transcript was part of files declassified by britain 's national archives , which releases official documents after 30 years .
the threat of a possible nuclear war between the united states and the soviet union was very real from the time the second world war ended to when the berlin wall fell in 1989 .
during this time , public service films gave information about how to prepare for a nuclear attack .
in addition to the script , the archive files included recommendations that the bbc continue to give live updates emphasizing that the broadcaster had not been " obliterated . "
there were also letters detailing discussions between the bbc and various government departments on the use of familiar voices , which were deemed necessary to reassure people " the bbc is still there . "
" the reassurance that ' the bbc is still there ' would not be gleaned from a recorded announcement by an unfamiliar voice , " wrote harold greenwood from the ministry of posts and telecommunications in a letter dated june 1974 .
" indeed , if an unfamiliar voice repeats the same announcement hour after hour for 12 hours listeners may begin to suspect that they are listening to a machine set to switch on every hour -lrb- or even that it has got stuck -rrb- and that perhaps after all the bbc has been obliterated , " he added .
conserve resources after attack the carefully-worded draft script included advice on how to conserve resources while inside after a nuclear strike .
" stay in your own homes , and if you live in an area where a fall-out warning has been given , stay in your fall-out room until you are told it is safe to come out , " it read .
" the message that the immediate danger has passed will be given by the sirens and repeated on this wavelength .
make sure that the gas and all fuel supplies are turned off and that all fires are extinguished .
water must be rationed , and used only for essential drinking and cooking purposes .

newly released archives reveal that the bbc had an answer . archives released friday , oct .
3 , reveal that the bbc planned to transmit reassuring messages in the event of a nuclear attack by the soviet union .
the broadcast would have been repeated every two hours , and told people to " stay calm , " remain indoors , and conserve food and water .
according to archived documents , the message would have been : " this country has been attacked with nuclear weapons .
communications have been severely disrupted , and the number of casualties and the extent of the damage are not yet known . "
it would go on to remind people that there was nothing to be gained by trying to get away , and warned people that by leaving their homes they could be exposing themselves to greater danger , as radioactive fall-out , which follows a nuclear explosion , is many times more dangerous when one is directly exposed to it in the open .
familiar radio voices bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : nuclear attack was a very real threat during the cold war the transcript was part of files declassified by britain 's national archives , which releases official documents after 30 years .
the threat of a possible nuclear war between the united states and the soviet union was very real from the time the second world war ended to when the berlin wall fell in 1989 .
during this time , public service films gave information about how to prepare for a nuclear attack .
in addition to the script , the archive files included recommendations that the bbc continue to give live updates emphasizing that the broadcaster had not been " obliterated . "
there were also letters detailing discussions between the bbc and various government departments on the use of familiar voices , which were deemed necessary to reassure people " the bbc is still there . "
" the reassurance that ' the bbc is still there ' would not be gleaned from a recorded announcement by an unfamiliar voice , " wrote harold greenwood from the ministry of posts and telecommunications in a letter dated june 1974 .
" indeed , if an unfamiliar voice repeats the same announcement hour after hour for 12 hours listeners may begin to suspect that they are listening to a machine set to switch on every hour -lrb- or even that it has got stuck -rrb- and that perhaps after all the bbc has been obliterated , " he added .
conserve resources after attack the carefully-worded draft script included advice on how to conserve resources while inside after a nuclear strike .
" stay in your own homes , and if you live in an area where a fall-out warning has been given , stay in your fall-out room until you are told it is safe to come out , " it read .
" the message that the immediate danger has passed will be given by the sirens and repeated on this wavelength .
make sure that the gas and all fuel supplies are turned off and that all fires are extinguished .
water must be rationed , and used only for essential drinking and cooking purposes .
it must not be used for flushing lavatories .
ration your food supply : it may have to last for 14 days or more . "

3 , on the details of a planned multibillion-euro bail-out for germany 's ailing mortgage lender hypo real estate . the talks at the german bundesbank headquarters lasted 12 hours , and revolved around how much each participant would contribute to the 35 billion-euro -lrb- $ 48 billion -rrb- deal to save the country 's second largest mortgage lender , reported dpa news agency .
bundesbank presidnet axel weber , along with jochen sanio - head of the federal finance industry regulator bafin - as well as representatives of leading banks and insurance companies were involved in nailing down the final rescue deal .
besides commercial banks , germany 's state savings banks as well as cooperative banks were also to be involved in the rescue package , in addition to insurance firms .
sources told dpa that the insurance firms were called in to participate since many of them are strongly involved in bonds , with hre 's troubled subsidiary depfa itself involved in issuing such paper for trading on world markets .
trouble from subsidiary depfa depfa , which hre acquired just last year , has been the chief source of hre 's problems since , with depfa coming under pressure of late , being unable to raise sufficient short-term loans amid the liquidity crunch on international financial markets .
berlin and the finance industry had proposed a plan to save hypo real estate from collapse earlier this week .
the online edition of the die welt newspaper had said that the situation had become urgent and that hre faced the threat of insolvency if no deal had been reached by friday morning .
berlin said it would not be nationalizing munich-based hre , but would post a guarantee for it of 26.6 billion euros , while german commercial banks would protect hre from default with up to 8.5 billion euros .
hours ahead of the german finance sector 's agreement in frankfurt , the european commission in brussels late thursday gave its green light to the german government 's guarantee . dpa news agency -lrb- kjb -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

communications have been severely disrupted , and the number of casualties and the extent of the damage are not yet known . "
it would go on to remind people that there was nothing to be gained by trying to get away , and warned people that by leaving their homes they could be exposing themselves to greater danger , as radioactive fall-out , which follows a nuclear explosion , is many times more dangerous when one is directly exposed to it in the open .
familiar radio voices bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : nuclear attack was a very real threat during the cold war the transcript was part of files declassified by britain 's national archives , which releases official documents after 30 years .
the threat of a possible nuclear war between the united states and the soviet union was very real from the time the second world war ended to when the berlin wall fell in 1989 .
during this time , public service films gave information about how to prepare for a nuclear attack .
in addition to the script , the archive files included recommendations that the bbc continue to give live updates emphasizing that the broadcaster had not been " obliterated . "
there were also letters detailing discussions between the bbc and various government departments on the use of familiar voices , which were deemed necessary to reassure people " the bbc is still there . "
" the reassurance that ' the bbc is still there ' would not be gleaned from a recorded announcement by an unfamiliar voice , " wrote harold greenwood from the ministry of posts and telecommunications in a letter dated june 1974 .
" indeed , if an unfamiliar voice repeats the same announcement hour after hour for 12 hours listeners may begin to suspect that they are listening to a machine set to switch on every hour -lrb- or even that it has got stuck -rrb- and that perhaps after all the bbc has been obliterated , " he added .
conserve resources after attack the carefully-worded draft script included advice on how to conserve resources while inside after a nuclear strike .
" stay in your own homes , and if you live in an area where a fall-out warning has been given , stay in your fall-out room until you are told it is safe to come out , " it read .
" the message that the immediate danger has passed will be given by the sirens and repeated on this wavelength .
make sure that the gas and all fuel supplies are turned off and that all fires are extinguished .
water must be rationed , and used only for essential drinking and cooking purposes .
it must not be used for flushing lavatories .
ration your food supply : it may have to last for 14 days or more . "
the message was meant to end with telling people that the bbc would repeat the broadcast in two hours ' time .
it asked them to stay tuned to that wavelength , but reminded them to switch their radios off in the meantime to save batteries . dw staff -lrb- mrm -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

just how similar are the plans - and will they help ? the banking crisis spread to germany this week when the german government offered a lifeline to commercial mortgage lender hypo real estate as it teetered on the verge of collapse .
the news came on the same day that the united states house of representatives failed to pass the $ 700 billion -lrb- 500 billion-euro -rrb- bailout plan proposed by secretary of the treasury henry paulson .
that plan has since been approved by the senate , with a few alterations , including up to $ 100 billion in tax break extensions for middle class families and businesses .
the german government has come up with a similar plan to bail out hypo real estate , albeit a slightly less expensive one .
on thursday , the european commission gave the go-ahead for the 35 billion-euro deal .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some institutions , like the venerable lehman brothers , did n't get bailouts - with disastrous results the government bailout in germany came just one week after german chancellor angela merkel denounced the us plan as being " too little , too late . "
she had since changed her mind and urged the us congress to pass a rescue package .
the house is tentatively set to revote on the bill on friday .
it all comes down to the taxpayer apart from the price tag , there are other differences between the rescue plans on both sides of the atlantic . in the us , the bill that has been passed by the senate calls for a government office to be set up which will initially take control of $ 250 billion in " troubled assets . "
according to helge berger , professor of economics and monetary theory at the free university in berlin , they will pay above market price for these assets , which basically amounts to a government subsidy .
" the government will assume that it will hold this paper to the very , very end , hoping that it will gain in value , " he added .
the german deal , on the other hand , is a 35 billion-euro private loan from a group of banks which is then guaranteed by the german government - and ultimately by the german tax payer .
but these methods are n't quite as different as they may seem , said berger .
" it may be that private banks are doing the financing right now , but they hold none of the risk , and i think that 's very important in economic terms , " berger said , emphasizing that the loan is guaranteed with public funds .
berger made it clear , however , that , just like in the american plan , the german one provides the government the option of seizing the company in the event of a default .
governments benefit from acquiring bank shares other countries in europe are feeling the crunch too .

he said that banks need to start trusting one another again .
barts also called for more regulation , saying that a serious look should be taken at how banks sell products and that they have to reveal the risks involved in the products they sell .
" you also have to put in some sort of measure to allow the european union to act as a whole in order to help the financial sector in such a crisis and to detect possible problems earlier and then be able to act as the authorities have in the us , " he added .

2 , in the russian city of st petersburg .
another big german company , basf , has already bought a quarter of the same field .
e.on controls a large part of germany 's gas and electricity supplies .
alternatives to russian gas part of the reason russia and germany are building the so-called nord stream pipeline under the baltic sea is to tap the siberian gas field , which has reserves of over 600 billion cubic meters , to feed the energy to german factories and homes .
other european nations have warned that germany may end up being too dependent on gazprom . e.on has tried harder than some of its german rivals to develop non-russian gas sources .
under the transaction , gazprom was able to buy back some of its own shares and reduce e.on 's influence on gazprom .
the owner of the production license and operator of the field will be russian oao severneftegazprom -lrb- sngp -rrb- , a statement by e.on said .
gazprom will hold just over half of sngp .
e.on 's ruhrgas unit and and basf 's wintershall division will each hold a stake of 25 percent minus one share .
energy for millions gas production at the site started last year and will reach around 25 billion cubic meters annually as early as next year , enough to supply a metropolis of approximately 10 million households .
under a complex swap , gazprom is to receive e.on ruhrgas 's 49 percent stake in the russian company zao gerosgaz , which holds just under 3 percent of gazprom shares .
after the transaction , e.on ruhrgas will still hold a 3.5-percent direct stake in gazprom . dpa news agency -lrb- kjb -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

newly released archives reveal that the bbc had an answer . archives released friday , oct .
3 , reveal that the bbc planned to transmit reassuring messages in the event of a nuclear attack by the soviet union .
the broadcast would have been repeated every two hours , and told people to " stay calm , " remain indoors , and conserve food and water .
according to archived documents , the message would have been : " this country has been attacked with nuclear weapons .
communications have been severely disrupted , and the number of casualties and the extent of the damage are not yet known . "
it would go on to remind people that there was nothing to be gained by trying to get away , and warned people that by leaving their homes they could be exposing themselves to greater danger , as radioactive fall-out , which follows a nuclear explosion , is many times more dangerous when one is directly exposed to it in the open .
familiar radio voices bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : nuclear attack was a very real threat during the cold war the transcript was part of files declassified by britain 's national archives , which releases official documents after 30 years .
the threat of a possible nuclear war between the united states and the soviet union was very real from the time the second world war ended to when the berlin wall fell in 1989 .
during this time , public service films gave information about how to prepare for a nuclear attack .
in addition to the script , the archive files included recommendations that the bbc continue to give live updates emphasizing that the broadcaster had not been " obliterated . "
there were also letters detailing discussions between the bbc and various government departments on the use of familiar voices , which were deemed necessary to reassure people " the bbc is still there . "
" the reassurance that ' the bbc is still there ' would not be gleaned from a recorded announcement by an unfamiliar voice , " wrote harold greenwood from the ministry of posts and telecommunications in a letter dated june 1974 .
" indeed , if an unfamiliar voice repeats the same announcement hour after hour for 12 hours listeners may begin to suspect that they are listening to a machine set to switch on every hour -lrb- or even that it has got stuck -rrb- and that perhaps after all the bbc has been obliterated , " he added .
conserve resources after attack the carefully-worded draft script included advice on how to conserve resources while inside after a nuclear strike .
" stay in your own homes , and if you live in an area where a fall-out warning has been given , stay in your fall-out room until you are told it is safe to come out , " it read .
" the message that the immediate danger has passed will be given by the sirens and repeated on this wavelength .
make sure that the gas and all fuel supplies are turned off and that all fires are extinguished .
water must be rationed , and used only for essential drinking and cooking purposes .
it must not be used for flushing lavatories .
ration your food supply : it may have to last for 14 days or more . "
the message was meant to end with telling people that the bbc would repeat the broadcast in two hours ' time .
it asked them to stay tuned to that wavelength , but reminded them to switch their radios off in the meantime to save batteries . dw staff -lrb- mrm -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de finance -pipe- 03.10.2008 bailouts multiply as crisis continues , but can they really help ? großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the rescue plans are more similar than they may seem as the us bailout plan is put to a revote , the eu is haggling over a large-scale rescue deal of its own after several european banks were saved this week .
just how similar are the plans - and will they help ? the banking crisis spread to germany this week when the german government offered a lifeline to commercial mortgage lender hypo real estate as it teetered on the verge of collapse .
the news came on the same day that the united states house of representatives failed to pass the $ 700 billion -lrb- 500 billion-euro -rrb- bailout plan proposed by secretary of the treasury henry paulson .
that plan has since been approved by the senate , with a few alterations , including up to $ 100 billion in tax break extensions for middle class families and businesses .
the german government has come up with a similar plan to bail out hypo real estate , albeit a slightly less expensive one .
on thursday , the european commission gave the go-ahead for the 35 billion-euro deal .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some institutions , like the venerable lehman brothers , did n't get bailouts - with disastrous results the government bailout in germany came just one week after german chancellor angela merkel denounced the us plan as being " too little , too late . "
she had since changed her mind and urged the us congress to pass a rescue package .
the house is tentatively set to revote on the bill on friday .
it all comes down to the taxpayer apart from the price tag , there are other differences between the rescue plans on both sides of the atlantic . in the us , the bill that has been passed by the senate calls for a government office to be set up which will initially take control of $ 250 billion in " troubled assets . "
according to helge berger , professor of economics and monetary theory at the free university in berlin , they will pay above market price for these assets , which basically amounts to a government subsidy .
" the government will assume that it will hold this paper to the very , very end , hoping that it will gain in value , " he added .
the german deal , on the other hand , is a 35 billion-euro private loan from a group of banks which is then guaranteed by the german government - and ultimately by the german tax payer .
but these methods are n't quite as different as they may seem , said berger .
" it may be that private banks are doing the financing right now , but they hold none of the risk , and i think that 's very important in economic terms , " berger said , emphasizing that the loan is guaranteed with public funds .
berger made it clear , however , that , just like in the american plan , the german one provides the government the option of seizing the company in the event of a default .
governments benefit from acquiring bank shares other countries in europe are feeling the crunch too .
great britain has nationalized lender bradford & bingley , while the benelux nations of belgium , luxembourg and the netherlands bailed out the insurance and banking group fortis with 11.2 billion euros . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : belgium , luxembourg and the netherlands pulled together 11.2 billion euros to bail out fortis with both of these plans , the respective governments did n't just get troubled assets , they also got shares in the banks .
berger said sees this as a huge advantage , since there are still viable credits owned by these financial institutions , which in turn are then owned by the governments .
though the benelux nations manage to reach an agreement on fortis , the european union as a whole is having trouble deciding on a joint response to the financial crisis .
europe divided on bloc-wide bailout on thursday french finance minister christine legarde suggested in an interview with the german newspaper handelsblatt that the eu should set up a european-wide rescue plan .
france currently holds the rotating eu presidency .
" what happens if a smaller eu state is affected by a looming bank collapse ?
maybe this country does not have the means to save the bank , " she said .
stock market expert ulrich barts , based in frankfurt , is in favor of the plan .
he said that banks need to start trusting one another again .
barts also called for more regulation , saying that a serious look should be taken at how banks sell products and that they have to reveal the risks involved in the products they sell .
" you also have to put in some sort of measure to allow the european union to act as a whole in order to help the financial sector in such a crisis and to detect possible problems earlier and then be able to act as the authorities have in the us , " he added .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : french finance minister christine lagarde proposed an eu wide rescue fund the proposed plan reportedly totaled 300 billion euros , though both the french and dutch governments have denied such a proposal has been made .

just how similar are the plans - and will they help ? the banking crisis spread to germany this week when the german government offered a lifeline to commercial mortgage lender hypo real estate as it teetered on the verge of collapse .
the news came on the same day that the united states house of representatives failed to pass the $ 700 billion -lrb- 500 billion-euro -rrb- bailout plan proposed by secretary of the treasury henry paulson .
that plan has since been approved by the senate , with a few alterations , including up to $ 100 billion in tax break extensions for middle class families and businesses .
the german government has come up with a similar plan to bail out hypo real estate , albeit a slightly less expensive one .
on thursday , the european commission gave the go-ahead for the 35 billion-euro deal .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some institutions , like the venerable lehman brothers , did n't get bailouts - with disastrous results the government bailout in germany came just one week after german chancellor angela merkel denounced the us plan as being " too little , too late . "
she had since changed her mind and urged the us congress to pass a rescue package .
the house is tentatively set to revote on the bill on friday .
it all comes down to the taxpayer apart from the price tag , there are other differences between the rescue plans on both sides of the atlantic . in the us , the bill that has been passed by the senate calls for a government office to be set up which will initially take control of $ 250 billion in " troubled assets . "
according to helge berger , professor of economics and monetary theory at the free university in berlin , they will pay above market price for these assets , which basically amounts to a government subsidy .
" the government will assume that it will hold this paper to the very , very end , hoping that it will gain in value , " he added .
the german deal , on the other hand , is a 35 billion-euro private loan from a group of banks which is then guaranteed by the german government - and ultimately by the german tax payer .
but these methods are n't quite as different as they may seem , said berger .
" it may be that private banks are doing the financing right now , but they hold none of the risk , and i think that 's very important in economic terms , " berger said , emphasizing that the loan is guaranteed with public funds .
berger made it clear , however , that , just like in the american plan , the german one provides the government the option of seizing the company in the event of a default .
governments benefit from acquiring bank shares other countries in europe are feeling the crunch too .
great britain has nationalized lender bradford & bingley , while the benelux nations of belgium , luxembourg and the netherlands bailed out the insurance and banking group fortis with 11.2 billion euros . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : belgium , luxembourg and the netherlands pulled together 11.2 billion euros to bail out fortis with both of these plans , the respective governments did n't just get troubled assets , they also got shares in the banks .
berger said sees this as a huge advantage , since there are still viable credits owned by these financial institutions , which in turn are then owned by the governments .
though the benelux nations manage to reach an agreement on fortis , the european union as a whole is having trouble deciding on a joint response to the financial crisis .
europe divided on bloc-wide bailout on thursday french finance minister christine legarde suggested in an interview with the german newspaper handelsblatt that the eu should set up a european-wide rescue plan .
france currently holds the rotating eu presidency .
" what happens if a smaller eu state is affected by a looming bank collapse ?
maybe this country does not have the means to save the bank , " she said .
stock market expert ulrich barts , based in frankfurt , is in favor of the plan .
he said that banks need to start trusting one another again .
barts also called for more regulation , saying that a serious look should be taken at how banks sell products and that they have to reveal the risks involved in the products they sell .
" you also have to put in some sort of measure to allow the european union to act as a whole in order to help the financial sector in such a crisis and to detect possible problems earlier and then be able to act as the authorities have in the us , " he added .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : french finance minister christine lagarde proposed an eu wide rescue fund the proposed plan reportedly totaled 300 billion euros , though both the french and dutch governments have denied such a proposal has been made .

just how similar are the plans - and will they help ? the banking crisis spread to germany this week when the german government offered a lifeline to commercial mortgage lender hypo real estate as it teetered on the verge of collapse .
the news came on the same day that the united states house of representatives failed to pass the $ 700 billion -lrb- 500 billion-euro -rrb- bailout plan proposed by secretary of the treasury henry paulson .
that plan has since been approved by the senate , with a few alterations , including up to $ 100 billion in tax break extensions for middle class families and businesses .
the german government has come up with a similar plan to bail out hypo real estate , albeit a slightly less expensive one .
on thursday , the european commission gave the go-ahead for the 35 billion-euro deal .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some institutions , like the venerable lehman brothers , did n't get bailouts - with disastrous results the government bailout in germany came just one week after german chancellor angela merkel denounced the us plan as being " too little , too late . "
she had since changed her mind and urged the us congress to pass a rescue package .
the house is tentatively set to revote on the bill on friday .
it all comes down to the taxpayer apart from the price tag , there are other differences between the rescue plans on both sides of the atlantic . in the us , the bill that has been passed by the senate calls for a government office to be set up which will initially take control of $ 250 billion in " troubled assets . "
according to helge berger , professor of economics and monetary theory at the free university in berlin , they will pay above market price for these assets , which basically amounts to a government subsidy .
" the government will assume that it will hold this paper to the very , very end , hoping that it will gain in value , " he added .
the german deal , on the other hand , is a 35 billion-euro private loan from a group of banks which is then guaranteed by the german government - and ultimately by the german tax payer .
but these methods are n't quite as different as they may seem , said berger .
" it may be that private banks are doing the financing right now , but they hold none of the risk , and i think that 's very important in economic terms , " berger said , emphasizing that the loan is guaranteed with public funds .
berger made it clear , however , that , just like in the american plan , the german one provides the government the option of seizing the company in the event of a default .
governments benefit from acquiring bank shares other countries in europe are feeling the crunch too .
great britain has nationalized lender bradford & bingley , while the benelux nations of belgium , luxembourg and the netherlands bailed out the insurance and banking group fortis with 11.2 billion euros . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : belgium , luxembourg and the netherlands pulled together 11.2 billion euros to bail out fortis with both of these plans , the respective governments did n't just get troubled assets , they also got shares in the banks .
berger said sees this as a huge advantage , since there are still viable credits owned by these financial institutions , which in turn are then owned by the governments .
though the benelux nations manage to reach an agreement on fortis , the european union as a whole is having trouble deciding on a joint response to the financial crisis .
europe divided on bloc-wide bailout on thursday french finance minister christine legarde suggested in an interview with the german newspaper handelsblatt that the eu should set up a european-wide rescue plan .
france currently holds the rotating eu presidency .
" what happens if a smaller eu state is affected by a looming bank collapse ?
maybe this country does not have the means to save the bank , " she said .
stock market expert ulrich barts , based in frankfurt , is in favor of the plan .
he said that banks need to start trusting one another again .
barts also called for more regulation , saying that a serious look should be taken at how banks sell products and that they have to reveal the risks involved in the products they sell .
" you also have to put in some sort of measure to allow the european union to act as a whole in order to help the financial sector in such a crisis and to detect possible problems earlier and then be able to act as the authorities have in the us , " he added .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : french finance minister christine lagarde proposed an eu wide rescue fund the proposed plan reportedly totaled 300 billion euros , though both the french and dutch governments have denied such a proposal has been made .
however , no matter what the final cost is , germany has said it is against it .
chancellor merkel will be attending the emergency finance summit on saturday in paris , which was called by french president nicolas sarkozy .
the leaders of britain and italy , european commission president jose manuel barroso , european central bank president jean-claude trichet and eurogroup chairman jean-claude juncker will also be there . mark mattox send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

newly released archives reveal that the bbc had an answer . archives released friday , oct .
3 , reveal that the bbc planned to transmit reassuring messages in the event of a nuclear attack by the soviet union .
the broadcast would have been repeated every two hours , and told people to " stay calm , " remain indoors , and conserve food and water .
according to archived documents , the message would have been : " this country has been attacked with nuclear weapons .
communications have been severely disrupted , and the number of casualties and the extent of the damage are not yet known . "
it would go on to remind people that there was nothing to be gained by trying to get away , and warned people that by leaving their homes they could be exposing themselves to greater danger , as radioactive fall-out , which follows a nuclear explosion , is many times more dangerous when one is directly exposed to it in the open .
familiar radio voices bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : nuclear attack was a very real threat during the cold war the transcript was part of files declassified by britain 's national archives , which releases official documents after 30 years .
the threat of a possible nuclear war between the united states and the soviet union was very real from the time the second world war ended to when the berlin wall fell in 1989 .
during this time , public service films gave information about how to prepare for a nuclear attack .
in addition to the script , the archive files included recommendations that the bbc continue to give live updates emphasizing that the broadcaster had not been " obliterated . "
there were also letters detailing discussions between the bbc and various government departments on the use of familiar voices , which were deemed necessary to reassure people " the bbc is still there . "
" the reassurance that ' the bbc is still there ' would not be gleaned from a recorded announcement by an unfamiliar voice , " wrote harold greenwood from the ministry of posts and telecommunications in a letter dated june 1974 .
" indeed , if an unfamiliar voice repeats the same announcement hour after hour for 12 hours listeners may begin to suspect that they are listening to a machine set to switch on every hour -lrb- or even that it has got stuck -rrb- and that perhaps after all the bbc has been obliterated , " he added .
conserve resources after attack the carefully-worded draft script included advice on how to conserve resources while inside after a nuclear strike .
" stay in your own homes , and if you live in an area where a fall-out warning has been given , stay in your fall-out room until you are told it is safe to come out , " it read .

water must be rationed , and used only for essential drinking and cooking purposes .
it must not be used for flushing lavatories .
ration your food supply : it may have to last for 14 days or more . "
the message was meant to end with telling people that the bbc would repeat the broadcast in two hours ' time .

2 , in the russian city of st petersburg .
another big german company , basf , has already bought a quarter of the same field .
e.on controls a large part of germany 's gas and electricity supplies .
alternatives to russian gas part of the reason russia and germany are building the so-called nord stream pipeline under the baltic sea is to tap the siberian gas field , which has reserves of over 600 billion cubic meters , to feed the energy to german factories and homes .
other european nations have warned that germany may end up being too dependent on gazprom . e.on has tried harder than some of its german rivals to develop non-russian gas sources .
under the transaction , gazprom was able to buy back some of its own shares and reduce e.on 's influence on gazprom .
the owner of the production license and operator of the field will be russian oao severneftegazprom -lrb- sngp -rrb- , a statement by e.on said .
gazprom will hold just over half of sngp .
e.on 's ruhrgas unit and and basf 's wintershall division will each hold a stake of 25 percent minus one share .
energy for millions gas production at the site started last year and will reach around 25 billion cubic meters annually as early as next year , enough to supply a metropolis of approximately 10 million households .
under a complex swap , gazprom is to receive e.on ruhrgas 's 49 percent stake in the russian company zao gerosgaz , which holds just under 3 percent of gazprom shares .
after the transaction , e.on ruhrgas will still hold a 3.5-percent direct stake in gazprom . dpa news agency -lrb- kjb -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

self-employed women would also get the same maternity leave as salaried employees under the proposal , the commission said .
" only 65.5 percent of women with dependent children are in work , compared with 91.7 percent of men .
our proposals to improve maternity leave will help women to combine work and family life , " eu equal opportunities commissioner vladimir spidla said .
" they should also help increase women 's participation in the labour market and help face up to the challenges of demographic ageing , " he noted .
longer leave will effect business : bushill-matthews but british conservative member of the european parliament philip bushill-matthews labelled the proposal counterproductive for small business and said the matter should be handled at a state level , not a european level .
" flexible working and work-life balance must be encouraged but it is not for brussels to tell british mothers and fathers how much leave they should take , " he said .
" small business will struggle to afford this extra cost .
ultimately some of the smallest businesses may think twice about employing young women through fear of them going on maternity leave . " dw staff -lrb- dm -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" in america … as in europe and the rest of the world , we have to face up to the major corrections -lrb- of financial markets -rrb- that are underway , " trichet told french radio thursday .
" so we can not say that after such and such an action , it is all over . "
his sentiments were echoed in other parts of the world .
" even if the house passes the bill , we can not expect markets to recover given the weak economy , " said kazuhiro takahashi , head of equities at daiwa securities smbc in tokyo .
nevertheless , european commission president jose manuel barroso lent his support to us efforts to prop up its economy with the bailout plan , labelling it a " step in the right direction .
if at first you do n't succeed ...
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the us senate believes the revised bailout package will be passed by the house after the original bailout bill was defeated monday , sept .
29 , the legislation was revamped to include $ 150 billion in tax breaks for middle class american families and business , and insurance on bank deposits of up to $ 250,000 , up from the previous limit of $ 100,000 .
limits on exorbitant severance packages for wall street executives responsible for the bad investments that contributed to the crisis have been maintained in the revised legislation .
us president george w. bush pleaded thursday to the house to follow the lead taken by senate on wednesday and approve the plan , insisting the issue had gone beyond affecting new york and wall street and was now hitting " hard-working people . "
the markets have been turbulent this week amid fears the bill could once again fail ratification at the house .
us weakened politically and economically bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : russian president dmitry medvedev says the crisis has heralded an end to us economic domination whether the bailout is ratified or not , many see the current crisis in financial markets as having catalyzed a significant political and economic weakening of the us .
russian president dmitry medvedev was particularly forthright in his comments .
on thursday , he said the crisis had shown us global financial dominance was at an end and that there was a need for a new economic system .
" the time of domination by one economy and one currency has been consigned to the past once and for all , " medvedev said .
in europe , too , the us is regarded as ailing .
" they are no longer in a position of strength , on the economic level as well as the geostrategic level , " france 's european affairs minister jean-pierre jouyet told les echos financial newspaper friday .
jouyet said the meltdown of the us financial system gave impetus to calls for greater financial market regulation in preference over the free-market approach blamed for the crisis .
" europe today has a window of opportunity to make the case for standards and values in terms of regulation .
the financial industry must be of service to the financing of the real economy , " he said .
european leaders are split over the appropriateness of a us-style bailout for europe , with german chancellor angela merkel dismissing calls for a joint european fund to help underwrite the debts of flailing european banks .

longer leave will effect business : bushill-matthews but british conservative member of the european parliament philip bushill-matthews labelled the proposal counterproductive for small business and said the matter should be handled at a state level , not a european level .
" flexible working and work-life balance must be encouraged but it is not for brussels to tell british mothers and fathers how much leave they should take , " he said .
" small business will struggle to afford this extra cost .
ultimately some of the smallest businesses may think twice about employing young women through fear of them going on maternity leave . " dw staff -lrb- dm -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

newly released archives reveal that the bbc had an answer . archives released friday , oct .
3 , reveal that the bbc planned to transmit reassuring messages in the event of a nuclear attack by the soviet union .
the broadcast would have been repeated every two hours , and told people to " stay calm , " remain indoors , and conserve food and water .
according to archived documents , the message would have been : " this country has been attacked with nuclear weapons .
communications have been severely disrupted , and the number of casualties and the extent of the damage are not yet known . "
it would go on to remind people that there was nothing to be gained by trying to get away , and warned people that by leaving their homes they could be exposing themselves to greater danger , as radioactive fall-out , which follows a nuclear explosion , is many times more dangerous when one is directly exposed to it in the open .
familiar radio voices bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : nuclear attack was a very real threat during the cold war the transcript was part of files declassified by britain 's national archives , which releases official documents after 30 years .
the threat of a possible nuclear war between the united states and the soviet union was very real from the time the second world war ended to when the berlin wall fell in 1989 .
during this time , public service films gave information about how to prepare for a nuclear attack .
in addition to the script , the archive files included recommendations that the bbc continue to give live updates emphasizing that the broadcaster had not been " obliterated . "
there were also letters detailing discussions between the bbc and various government departments on the use of familiar voices , which were deemed necessary to reassure people " the bbc is still there . "
" the reassurance that ' the bbc is still there ' would not be gleaned from a recorded announcement by an unfamiliar voice , " wrote harold greenwood from the ministry of posts and telecommunications in a letter dated june 1974 .
" indeed , if an unfamiliar voice repeats the same announcement hour after hour for 12 hours listeners may begin to suspect that they are listening to a machine set to switch on every hour -lrb- or even that it has got stuck -rrb- and that perhaps after all the bbc has been obliterated , " he added .
conserve resources after attack the carefully-worded draft script included advice on how to conserve resources while inside after a nuclear strike .
" stay in your own homes , and if you live in an area where a fall-out warning has been given , stay in your fall-out room until you are told it is safe to come out , " it read .
" the message that the immediate danger has passed will be given by the sirens and repeated on this wavelength .
make sure that the gas and all fuel supplies are turned off and that all fires are extinguished .
water must be rationed , and used only for essential drinking and cooking purposes .
it must not be used for flushing lavatories .
ration your food supply : it may have to last for 14 days or more . "
the message was meant to end with telling people that the bbc would repeat the broadcast in two hours ' time .

" in america … as in europe and the rest of the world , we have to face up to the major corrections -lrb- of financial markets -rrb- that are underway , " trichet told french radio thursday .
" so we can not say that after such and such an action , it is all over . "
his sentiments were echoed in other parts of the world .
" even if the house passes the bill , we can not expect markets to recover given the weak economy , " said kazuhiro takahashi , head of equities at daiwa securities smbc in tokyo .
nevertheless , european commission president jose manuel barroso lent his support to us efforts to prop up its economy with the bailout plan , labelling it a " step in the right direction .
if at first you do n't succeed ...
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the us senate believes the revised bailout package will be passed by the house after the original bailout bill was defeated monday , sept .
29 , the legislation was revamped to include $ 150 billion in tax breaks for middle class american families and business , and insurance on bank deposits of up to $ 250,000 , up from the previous limit of $ 100,000 .
limits on exorbitant severance packages for wall street executives responsible for the bad investments that contributed to the crisis have been maintained in the revised legislation .
us president george w. bush pleaded thursday to the house to follow the lead taken by senate on wednesday and approve the plan , insisting the issue had gone beyond affecting new york and wall street and was now hitting " hard-working people . "
the markets have been turbulent this week amid fears the bill could once again fail ratification at the house .
us weakened politically and economically bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : russian president dmitry medvedev says the crisis has heralded an end to us economic domination whether the bailout is ratified or not , many see the current crisis in financial markets as having catalyzed a significant political and economic weakening of the us .
russian president dmitry medvedev was particularly forthright in his comments .
on thursday , he said the crisis had shown us global financial dominance was at an end and that there was a need for a new economic system .
" the time of domination by one economy and one currency has been consigned to the past once and for all , " medvedev said .
in europe , too , the us is regarded as ailing .
" they are no longer in a position of strength , on the economic level as well as the geostrategic level , " france 's european affairs minister jean-pierre jouyet told les echos financial newspaper friday .
jouyet said the meltdown of the us financial system gave impetus to calls for greater financial market regulation in preference over the free-market approach blamed for the crisis .
" europe today has a window of opportunity to make the case for standards and values in terms of regulation .

" in america … as in europe and the rest of the world , we have to face up to the major corrections -lrb- of financial markets -rrb- that are underway , " trichet told french radio thursday .
" so we can not say that after such and such an action , it is all over . "
his sentiments were echoed in other parts of the world .
" even if the house passes the bill , we can not expect markets to recover given the weak economy , " said kazuhiro takahashi , head of equities at daiwa securities smbc in tokyo .
nevertheless , european commission president jose manuel barroso lent his support to us efforts to prop up its economy with the bailout plan , labelling it a " step in the right direction .
if at first you do n't succeed ...
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the us senate believes the revised bailout package will be passed by the house after the original bailout bill was defeated monday , sept .
29 , the legislation was revamped to include $ 150 billion in tax breaks for middle class american families and business , and insurance on bank deposits of up to $ 250,000 , up from the previous limit of $ 100,000 .
limits on exorbitant severance packages for wall street executives responsible for the bad investments that contributed to the crisis have been maintained in the revised legislation .
us president george w. bush pleaded thursday to the house to follow the lead taken by senate on wednesday and approve the plan , insisting the issue had gone beyond affecting new york and wall street and was now hitting " hard-working people . "
the markets have been turbulent this week amid fears the bill could once again fail ratification at the house .
us weakened politically and economically bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : russian president dmitry medvedev says the crisis has heralded an end to us economic domination whether the bailout is ratified or not , many see the current crisis in financial markets as having catalyzed a significant political and economic weakening of the us .
russian president dmitry medvedev was particularly forthright in his comments .
on thursday , he said the crisis had shown us global financial dominance was at an end and that there was a need for a new economic system .
" the time of domination by one economy and one currency has been consigned to the past once and for all , " medvedev said .
in europe , too , the us is regarded as ailing .
" they are no longer in a position of strength , on the economic level as well as the geostrategic level , " france 's european affairs minister jean-pierre jouyet told les echos financial newspaper friday .
jouyet said the meltdown of the us financial system gave impetus to calls for greater financial market regulation in preference over the free-market approach blamed for the crisis .
" europe today has a window of opportunity to make the case for standards and values in terms of regulation .
the financial industry must be of service to the financing of the real economy , " he said .

while several of the member states are in favor of more eu control , others , including germany , are n't so sure . german family minister ursula von der leyen spoke out against the strengthening of current eu regulations in this area during a meeting with her european counterparts in luxembourg on thursday .
supported by italy , denmark , the czech republic and greece , she accused the eu commission of exceeding its authority .
spain , great britain , the benelux nations , austria and sweden , by contrast , all stood behind the commission .
the proposals unveiled by eu social commissioner vladimir spidla are designed to beef up social protection across the bloc .
that includes the protection offered to disabled people , the old , homosexuals and religious and ethnic miniorities .
the draft legislation supplements existing laws that ensure mainly equal treatment in the workplace , seeking to root out discrimination in socially-sensitive areas as social security , health care , education and access to and supply of goods which are commercially available to the public , including housing . the measure proposes setting up " equality bodies " in all member states to which a sufferer of discrimination could complain before pursuing a possible court action .
for example , a lettings agency could be sued in court if it denied an apartment to homosexuals .
the proposal would not cover family law , so it would not try to legalize homosexual marriages .
it would also not try to change national measures that ensure the secular nature of their education system .
difference of opinion bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german family minister ursula von der leyen does n't think eu regulations should be strengthened von der leyen , however , maintained that no new eu regulations were necessary .
" we believe that germany has created a very high level of protection , " she said .
but the eu commission thinks that germany still needs to beef up protections against discrimination in terms of the housing market .
according to the recommendations put forth in july all professional rental agencies should be subject to the anti-discrimination regulations .
under the current rules in germany , they " usually " only apply to renters who have more than 50 properties to rent out .
however , von der leyen refused to discuss the content of the draft legislation .
the real question here is : " should europe meddle in national affairs or not ? " said the minister . not enough bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the eu proposed a european-wide strengthening of regulations protecting people with disabilities the dutch social minister piet hein donner held firm , saying that the european community is a community of shared values .
" no member country can seriously have something against the recommendations of the commission , which aim to better protect these values , " he added .
donner 's austrian counterpart , erwin buchinger even demanded even tougher regulations than the commission has already proposed .
" we would like a more ambitious approach for people with disabilities , " he said .
" the level of protection needs to be as high as possible . "
but even the supporters of the new guidelines are a little critical , specifically saying that the eu commission 's proposed plan is sloppily formulated and is full of obscurities .

while several of the member states are in favor of more eu control , others , including germany , are n't so sure . german family minister ursula von der leyen spoke out against the strengthening of current eu regulations in this area during a meeting with her european counterparts in luxembourg on thursday .
supported by italy , denmark , the czech republic and greece , she accused the eu commission of exceeding its authority .
spain , great britain , the benelux nations , austria and sweden , by contrast , all stood behind the commission .
the proposals unveiled by eu social commissioner vladimir spidla are designed to beef up social protection across the bloc .
that includes the protection offered to disabled people , the old , homosexuals and religious and ethnic miniorities .
the draft legislation supplements existing laws that ensure mainly equal treatment in the workplace , seeking to root out discrimination in socially-sensitive areas as social security , health care , education and access to and supply of goods which are commercially available to the public , including housing . the measure proposes setting up " equality bodies " in all member states to which a sufferer of discrimination could complain before pursuing a possible court action .
for example , a lettings agency could be sued in court if it denied an apartment to homosexuals .
the proposal would not cover family law , so it would not try to legalize homosexual marriages .
it would also not try to change national measures that ensure the secular nature of their education system .
difference of opinion bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german family minister ursula von der leyen does n't think eu regulations should be strengthened von der leyen , however , maintained that no new eu regulations were necessary .
" we believe that germany has created a very high level of protection , " she said .
but the eu commission thinks that germany still needs to beef up protections against discrimination in terms of the housing market .
according to the recommendations put forth in july all professional rental agencies should be subject to the anti-discrimination regulations .
under the current rules in germany , they " usually " only apply to renters who have more than 50 properties to rent out .
however , von der leyen refused to discuss the content of the draft legislation .
the real question here is : " should europe meddle in national affairs or not ? " said the minister . not enough bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the eu proposed a european-wide strengthening of regulations protecting people with disabilities the dutch social minister piet hein donner held firm , saying that the european community is a community of shared values .

3 , on the details of a planned multibillion-euro bail-out for germany 's ailing mortgage lender hypo real estate . the talks at the german bundesbank headquarters lasted 12 hours , and revolved around how much each participant would contribute to the 35 billion-euro -lrb- $ 48 billion -rrb- deal to save the country 's second largest mortgage lender , reported dpa news agency .
bundesbank presidnet axel weber , along with jochen sanio - head of the federal finance industry regulator bafin - as well as representatives of leading banks and insurance companies were involved in nailing down the final rescue deal .
besides commercial banks , germany 's state savings banks as well as cooperative banks were also to be involved in the rescue package , in addition to insurance firms .
sources told dpa that the insurance firms were called in to participate since many of them are strongly involved in bonds , with hre 's troubled subsidiary depfa itself involved in issuing such paper for trading on world markets .
trouble from subsidiary depfa depfa , which hre acquired just last year , has been the chief source of hre 's problems since , with depfa coming under pressure of late , being unable to raise sufficient short-term loans amid the liquidity crunch on international financial markets .
berlin and the finance industry had proposed a plan to save hypo real estate from collapse earlier this week .
the online edition of the die welt newspaper had said that the situation had become urgent and that hre faced the threat of insolvency if no deal had been reached by friday morning .
berlin said it would not be nationalizing munich-based hre , but would post a guarantee for it of 26.6 billion euros , while german commercial banks would protect hre from default with up to 8.5 billion euros .
hours ahead of the german finance sector 's agreement in frankfurt , the european commission in brussels late thursday gave its green light to the german government 's guarantee . dpa news agency -lrb- kjb -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

self-employed women would also get the same maternity leave as salaried employees under the proposal , the commission said .
" only 65.5 percent of women with dependent children are in work , compared with 91.7 percent of men .
our proposals to improve maternity leave will help women to combine work and family life , " eu equal opportunities commissioner vladimir spidla said .
" they should also help increase women 's participation in the labour market and help face up to the challenges of demographic ageing , " he noted .
longer leave will effect business : bushill-matthews but british conservative member of the european parliament philip bushill-matthews labelled the proposal counterproductive for small business and said the matter should be handled at a state level , not a european level .
" flexible working and work-life balance must be encouraged but it is not for brussels to tell british mothers and fathers how much leave they should take , " he said .

just how similar are the plans - and will they help ? the banking crisis spread to germany this week when the german government offered a lifeline to commercial mortgage lender hypo real estate as it teetered on the verge of collapse .
the news came on the same day that the united states house of representatives failed to pass the $ 700 billion -lrb- 500 billion-euro -rrb- bailout plan proposed by secretary of the treasury henry paulson .
that plan has since been approved by the senate , with a few alterations , including up to $ 100 billion in tax break extensions for middle class families and businesses .
the german government has come up with a similar plan to bail out hypo real estate , albeit a slightly less expensive one .
on thursday , the european commission gave the go-ahead for the 35 billion-euro deal .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some institutions , like the venerable lehman brothers , did n't get bailouts - with disastrous results the government bailout in germany came just one week after german chancellor angela merkel denounced the us plan as being " too little , too late . "
she had since changed her mind and urged the us congress to pass a rescue package .
the house is tentatively set to revote on the bill on friday .
it all comes down to the taxpayer apart from the price tag , there are other differences between the rescue plans on both sides of the atlantic . in the us , the bill that has been passed by the senate calls for a government office to be set up which will initially take control of $ 250 billion in " troubled assets . "
according to helge berger , professor of economics and monetary theory at the free university in berlin , they will pay above market price for these assets , which basically amounts to a government subsidy .
" the government will assume that it will hold this paper to the very , very end , hoping that it will gain in value , " he added .
the german deal , on the other hand , is a 35 billion-euro private loan from a group of banks which is then guaranteed by the german government - and ultimately by the german tax payer .
but these methods are n't quite as different as they may seem , said berger .
" it may be that private banks are doing the financing right now , but they hold none of the risk , and i think that 's very important in economic terms , " berger said , emphasizing that the loan is guaranteed with public funds .
berger made it clear , however , that , just like in the american plan , the german one provides the government the option of seizing the company in the event of a default .
governments benefit from acquiring bank shares other countries in europe are feeling the crunch too .
great britain has nationalized lender bradford & bingley , while the benelux nations of belgium , luxembourg and the netherlands bailed out the insurance and banking group fortis with 11.2 billion euros . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : belgium , luxembourg and the netherlands pulled together 11.2 billion euros to bail out fortis with both of these plans , the respective governments did n't just get troubled assets , they also got shares in the banks .
berger said sees this as a huge advantage , since there are still viable credits owned by these financial institutions , which in turn are then owned by the governments .
though the benelux nations manage to reach an agreement on fortis , the european union as a whole is having trouble deciding on a joint response to the financial crisis .
europe divided on bloc-wide bailout on thursday french finance minister christine legarde suggested in an interview with the german newspaper handelsblatt that the eu should set up a european-wide rescue plan .
france currently holds the rotating eu presidency .
" what happens if a smaller eu state is affected by a looming bank collapse ?
maybe this country does not have the means to save the bank , " she said .
stock market expert ulrich barts , based in frankfurt , is in favor of the plan .
he said that banks need to start trusting one another again .
barts also called for more regulation , saying that a serious look should be taken at how banks sell products and that they have to reveal the risks involved in the products they sell .
" you also have to put in some sort of measure to allow the european union to act as a whole in order to help the financial sector in such a crisis and to detect possible problems earlier and then be able to act as the authorities have in the us , " he added .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : french finance minister christine lagarde proposed an eu wide rescue fund the proposed plan reportedly totaled 300 billion euros , though both the french and dutch governments have denied such a proposal has been made .
however , no matter what the final cost is , germany has said it is against it .
chancellor merkel will be attending the emergency finance summit on saturday in paris , which was called by french president nicolas sarkozy .
the leaders of britain and italy , european commission president jose manuel barroso , european central bank president jean-claude trichet and eurogroup chairman jean-claude juncker will also be there . mark mattox send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

3 , on the details of a planned multibillion-euro bail-out for germany 's ailing mortgage lender hypo real estate . the talks at the german bundesbank headquarters lasted 12 hours , and revolved around how much each participant would contribute to the 35 billion-euro -lrb- $ 48 billion -rrb- deal to save the country 's second largest mortgage lender , reported dpa news agency .
bundesbank presidnet axel weber , along with jochen sanio - head of the federal finance industry regulator bafin - as well as representatives of leading banks and insurance companies were involved in nailing down the final rescue deal .
besides commercial banks , germany 's state savings banks as well as cooperative banks were also to be involved in the rescue package , in addition to insurance firms .

the online edition of the die welt newspaper had said that the situation had become urgent and that hre faced the threat of insolvency if no deal had been reached by friday morning .

the statement continued by urging european governments , who have called on the us to shut down the detention center for terrorist suspects in guantanamo bay , " to let deeds follow their words and provide humanitarian protection for detainees who can not return to their home countries . "
appeal to mccain , obama the report stated that the council wanted to send a clear signal to us presidential candidates john mccain and barack obama , who have said they want to close the controversial detention center in cuba .
" both presidential contenders have expressed a desire to close down guantanamo and will need the cooperation of european partners , " the report added .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de asia -pipe- 03.10.2008 indonesians back barack obama großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : barack obama as a child in indonesia with his family many indonesians are closely watching this year 's us presidential election - both in indonesia and in the united states .
as a child , the democrat party 's candidate , barack obama , lived in indonesia for several years after his mother married an indonesian .
some indonesians think that means he understands them and the world better . indonesians in the united states feel a close bond with democrat presidential candidate barack obama and are watching the election campaign very closely .
abdul nuradnan , an indonesian citizen , says he often discusses the elections with relatives and friends back home : “ they usually ask whether there will be better relations with indonesia , if barack obama becomes president . ”
“ of course , ” he says , chuckling , “ i told them that might be so .
because barack obama lived for some time in indonesia , he has a better understanding . ”
most indonesians favour obama but not everybody in indonesia seems as interested in the us elections as abdul nuradnan ’ s relatives .
a us-based pew research center poll earlier this year indicated that just 15 percent of the indonesian population was following the us elections - those who were interested mostly favoured obama .
there is a widespread hope that an obama win would change the way much of the world perceives the us .
the pew poll also found that fewer than 40 percent of indonesians have a positive view of the us - a 10 percentage point rise over the previous year .
richard wyke of the pew global attitudes project said this reflects worldwide opinion : “ there ’ s a lot of opposition , a lot of negative feelings about key aspects of american foreign policy in much of the world - indonesia included .
things like the war in iraq , the war on terror , a general perception of us unilateralism . ”
more sensitive to international community obama ’ s advisors have said the democrat candidate would be much more sensitive to the needs of the international community if he became president than his republican rival john mccain .
obama himself has said that the time he spent in indonesia has given him a better perspective of how other countries perceive us decisions - he said it was the strongest experience he had had in foreign relations .
however , not all observers believe that things would change considerably under an obama presidency .
faisal mangoenkosono , an assistant to the indonesian ambassador in washington last week cautioned his compatriots against raising their hopes too high .
“ they should always remember , ” he said , “ as indonesians , that he is through and through american .
and he would follow the interests of what is important for america so one should not be disappointed if he , at one time , were to rule against our interests . ”
but first he would have to be elected .
with one month to go before us citizens go to the polls , indonesians worldwide will continue to speculate about the good and bad sides of a possible obama presidency . laura iiyama 03/10/08 send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic 07 media center watch and listen explore new content daily in dw 's multimedia archive .

while several of the member states are in favor of more eu control , others , including germany , are n't so sure . german family minister ursula von der leyen spoke out against the strengthening of current eu regulations in this area during a meeting with her european counterparts in luxembourg on thursday .
supported by italy , denmark , the czech republic and greece , she accused the eu commission of exceeding its authority .
spain , great britain , the benelux nations , austria and sweden , by contrast , all stood behind the commission .
the proposals unveiled by eu social commissioner vladimir spidla are designed to beef up social protection across the bloc .
that includes the protection offered to disabled people , the old , homosexuals and religious and ethnic miniorities .
the draft legislation supplements existing laws that ensure mainly equal treatment in the workplace , seeking to root out discrimination in socially-sensitive areas as social security , health care , education and access to and supply of goods which are commercially available to the public , including housing . the measure proposes setting up " equality bodies " in all member states to which a sufferer of discrimination could complain before pursuing a possible court action .
for example , a lettings agency could be sued in court if it denied an apartment to homosexuals .
the proposal would not cover family law , so it would not try to legalize homosexual marriages .
it would also not try to change national measures that ensure the secular nature of their education system .
difference of opinion bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german family minister ursula von der leyen does n't think eu regulations should be strengthened von der leyen , however , maintained that no new eu regulations were necessary .
" we believe that germany has created a very high level of protection , " she said .
but the eu commission thinks that germany still needs to beef up protections against discrimination in terms of the housing market .
according to the recommendations put forth in july all professional rental agencies should be subject to the anti-discrimination regulations .
under the current rules in germany , they " usually " only apply to renters who have more than 50 properties to rent out .
however , von der leyen refused to discuss the content of the draft legislation .
the real question here is : " should europe meddle in national affairs or not ? " said the minister . not enough bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the eu proposed a european-wide strengthening of regulations protecting people with disabilities the dutch social minister piet hein donner held firm , saying that the european community is a community of shared values .
" no member country can seriously have something against the recommendations of the commission , which aim to better protect these values , " he added .
donner 's austrian counterpart , erwin buchinger even demanded even tougher regulations than the commission has already proposed .
" we would like a more ambitious approach for people with disabilities , " he said .
" the level of protection needs to be as high as possible . "
but even the supporters of the new guidelines are a little critical , specifically saying that the eu commission 's proposed plan is sloppily formulated and is full of obscurities .
" there are more questions that answers , " said dutch social minister donner .
the commission should now analyze the consequences of their recommendations before they proceed any further . dw staff -lrb- mrm -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

while several of the member states are in favor of more eu control , others , including germany , are n't so sure . german family minister ursula von der leyen spoke out against the strengthening of current eu regulations in this area during a meeting with her european counterparts in luxembourg on thursday .
supported by italy , denmark , the czech republic and greece , she accused the eu commission of exceeding its authority .
spain , great britain , the benelux nations , austria and sweden , by contrast , all stood behind the commission .
the proposals unveiled by eu social commissioner vladimir spidla are designed to beef up social protection across the bloc .
that includes the protection offered to disabled people , the old , homosexuals and religious and ethnic miniorities .
the draft legislation supplements existing laws that ensure mainly equal treatment in the workplace , seeking to root out discrimination in socially-sensitive areas as social security , health care , education and access to and supply of goods which are commercially available to the public , including housing . the measure proposes setting up " equality bodies " in all member states to which a sufferer of discrimination could complain before pursuing a possible court action .
for example , a lettings agency could be sued in court if it denied an apartment to homosexuals .
the proposal would not cover family law , so it would not try to legalize homosexual marriages .
it would also not try to change national measures that ensure the secular nature of their education system .
difference of opinion bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german family minister ursula von der leyen does n't think eu regulations should be strengthened von der leyen , however , maintained that no new eu regulations were necessary .
" we believe that germany has created a very high level of protection , " she said .
but the eu commission thinks that germany still needs to beef up protections against discrimination in terms of the housing market .
according to the recommendations put forth in july all professional rental agencies should be subject to the anti-discrimination regulations .
under the current rules in germany , they " usually " only apply to renters who have more than 50 properties to rent out .
however , von der leyen refused to discuss the content of the draft legislation .
the real question here is : " should europe meddle in national affairs or not ? " said the minister . not enough bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the eu proposed a european-wide strengthening of regulations protecting people with disabilities the dutch social minister piet hein donner held firm , saying that the european community is a community of shared values .
" no member country can seriously have something against the recommendations of the commission , which aim to better protect these values , " he added .
donner 's austrian counterpart , erwin buchinger even demanded even tougher regulations than the commission has already proposed .
" we would like a more ambitious approach for people with disabilities , " he said .
" the level of protection needs to be as high as possible . "
but even the supporters of the new guidelines are a little critical , specifically saying that the eu commission 's proposed plan is sloppily formulated and is full of obscurities .
" there are more questions that answers , " said dutch social minister donner .

self-employed women would also get the same maternity leave as salaried employees under the proposal , the commission said .

just how similar are the plans - and will they help ? the banking crisis spread to germany this week when the german government offered a lifeline to commercial mortgage lender hypo real estate as it teetered on the verge of collapse .
the news came on the same day that the united states house of representatives failed to pass the $ 700 billion -lrb- 500 billion-euro -rrb- bailout plan proposed by secretary of the treasury henry paulson .
that plan has since been approved by the senate , with a few alterations , including up to $ 100 billion in tax break extensions for middle class families and businesses .
the german government has come up with a similar plan to bail out hypo real estate , albeit a slightly less expensive one .
on thursday , the european commission gave the go-ahead for the 35 billion-euro deal .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some institutions , like the venerable lehman brothers , did n't get bailouts - with disastrous results the government bailout in germany came just one week after german chancellor angela merkel denounced the us plan as being " too little , too late . "
she had since changed her mind and urged the us congress to pass a rescue package .
the house is tentatively set to revote on the bill on friday .
it all comes down to the taxpayer apart from the price tag , there are other differences between the rescue plans on both sides of the atlantic . in the us , the bill that has been passed by the senate calls for a government office to be set up which will initially take control of $ 250 billion in " troubled assets . "
according to helge berger , professor of economics and monetary theory at the free university in berlin , they will pay above market price for these assets , which basically amounts to a government subsidy .
" the government will assume that it will hold this paper to the very , very end , hoping that it will gain in value , " he added .
the german deal , on the other hand , is a 35 billion-euro private loan from a group of banks which is then guaranteed by the german government - and ultimately by the german tax payer .
but these methods are n't quite as different as they may seem , said berger .
" it may be that private banks are doing the financing right now , but they hold none of the risk , and i think that 's very important in economic terms , " berger said , emphasizing that the loan is guaranteed with public funds .
berger made it clear , however , that , just like in the american plan , the german one provides the government the option of seizing the company in the event of a default .
governments benefit from acquiring bank shares other countries in europe are feeling the crunch too .
great britain has nationalized lender bradford & bingley , while the benelux nations of belgium , luxembourg and the netherlands bailed out the insurance and banking group fortis with 11.2 billion euros . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : belgium , luxembourg and the netherlands pulled together 11.2 billion euros to bail out fortis with both of these plans , the respective governments did n't just get troubled assets , they also got shares in the banks .
berger said sees this as a huge advantage , since there are still viable credits owned by these financial institutions , which in turn are then owned by the governments .
though the benelux nations manage to reach an agreement on fortis , the european union as a whole is having trouble deciding on a joint response to the financial crisis .
europe divided on bloc-wide bailout on thursday french finance minister christine legarde suggested in an interview with the german newspaper handelsblatt that the eu should set up a european-wide rescue plan .
france currently holds the rotating eu presidency .
" what happens if a smaller eu state is affected by a looming bank collapse ?
maybe this country does not have the means to save the bank , " she said .
stock market expert ulrich barts , based in frankfurt , is in favor of the plan .
he said that banks need to start trusting one another again .
barts also called for more regulation , saying that a serious look should be taken at how banks sell products and that they have to reveal the risks involved in the products they sell .
" you also have to put in some sort of measure to allow the european union to act as a whole in order to help the financial sector in such a crisis and to detect possible problems earlier and then be able to act as the authorities have in the us , " he added .

" in america … as in europe and the rest of the world , we have to face up to the major corrections -lrb- of financial markets -rrb- that are underway , " trichet told french radio thursday .
" so we can not say that after such and such an action , it is all over . "
his sentiments were echoed in other parts of the world .
" even if the house passes the bill , we can not expect markets to recover given the weak economy , " said kazuhiro takahashi , head of equities at daiwa securities smbc in tokyo .
nevertheless , european commission president jose manuel barroso lent his support to us efforts to prop up its economy with the bailout plan , labelling it a " step in the right direction .
if at first you do n't succeed ...
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the us senate believes the revised bailout package will be passed by the house after the original bailout bill was defeated monday , sept .
29 , the legislation was revamped to include $ 150 billion in tax breaks for middle class american families and business , and insurance on bank deposits of up to $ 250,000 , up from the previous limit of $ 100,000 .
limits on exorbitant severance packages for wall street executives responsible for the bad investments that contributed to the crisis have been maintained in the revised legislation .
us president george w. bush pleaded thursday to the house to follow the lead taken by senate on wednesday and approve the plan , insisting the issue had gone beyond affecting new york and wall street and was now hitting " hard-working people . "
the markets have been turbulent this week amid fears the bill could once again fail ratification at the house .
us weakened politically and economically bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : russian president dmitry medvedev says the crisis has heralded an end to us economic domination whether the bailout is ratified or not , many see the current crisis in financial markets as having catalyzed a significant political and economic weakening of the us .
russian president dmitry medvedev was particularly forthright in his comments .
on thursday , he said the crisis had shown us global financial dominance was at an end and that there was a need for a new economic system .
" the time of domination by one economy and one currency has been consigned to the past once and for all , " medvedev said .
in europe , too , the us is regarded as ailing .
" they are no longer in a position of strength , on the economic level as well as the geostrategic level , " france 's european affairs minister jean-pierre jouyet told les echos financial newspaper friday .
jouyet said the meltdown of the us financial system gave impetus to calls for greater financial market regulation in preference over the free-market approach blamed for the crisis .
" europe today has a window of opportunity to make the case for standards and values in terms of regulation .
the financial industry must be of service to the financing of the real economy , " he said .
european leaders are split over the appropriateness of a us-style bailout for europe , with german chancellor angela merkel dismissing calls for a joint european fund to help underwrite the debts of flailing european banks .
financial institutions from britain , germany , and the benelux countries of belgium , the netherlands and luxembourg have all required state intervention to stay afloat in the midst of the crisis . dw staff -lrb- dm / jg -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the german government has come up with a similar plan to bail out hypo real estate , albeit a slightly less expensive one .
on thursday , the european commission gave the go-ahead for the 35 billion-euro deal .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some institutions , like the venerable lehman brothers , did n't get bailouts - with disastrous results the government bailout in germany came just one week after german chancellor angela merkel denounced the us plan as being " too little , too late . "
she had since changed her mind and urged the us congress to pass a rescue package .
the house is tentatively set to revote on the bill on friday .
it all comes down to the taxpayer apart from the price tag , there are other differences between the rescue plans on both sides of the atlantic . in the us , the bill that has been passed by the senate calls for a government office to be set up which will initially take control of $ 250 billion in " troubled assets . "
according to helge berger , professor of economics and monetary theory at the free university in berlin , they will pay above market price for these assets , which basically amounts to a government subsidy .
" the government will assume that it will hold this paper to the very , very end , hoping that it will gain in value , " he added .
the german deal , on the other hand , is a 35 billion-euro private loan from a group of banks which is then guaranteed by the german government - and ultimately by the german tax payer .
but these methods are n't quite as different as they may seem , said berger .
" it may be that private banks are doing the financing right now , but they hold none of the risk , and i think that 's very important in economic terms , " berger said , emphasizing that the loan is guaranteed with public funds .
berger made it clear , however , that , just like in the american plan , the german one provides the government the option of seizing the company in the event of a default .
governments benefit from acquiring bank shares other countries in europe are feeling the crunch too .
great britain has nationalized lender bradford & bingley , while the benelux nations of belgium , luxembourg and the netherlands bailed out the insurance and banking group fortis with 11.2 billion euros . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : belgium , luxembourg and the netherlands pulled together 11.2 billion euros to bail out fortis with both of these plans , the respective governments did n't just get troubled assets , they also got shares in the banks .
berger said sees this as a huge advantage , since there are still viable credits owned by these financial institutions , which in turn are then owned by the governments .
though the benelux nations manage to reach an agreement on fortis , the european union as a whole is having trouble deciding on a joint response to the financial crisis .
europe divided on bloc-wide bailout on thursday french finance minister christine legarde suggested in an interview with the german newspaper handelsblatt that the eu should set up a european-wide rescue plan .
france currently holds the rotating eu presidency .
" what happens if a smaller eu state is affected by a looming bank collapse ?
maybe this country does not have the means to save the bank , " she said .
stock market expert ulrich barts , based in frankfurt , is in favor of the plan .
he said that banks need to start trusting one another again .
barts also called for more regulation , saying that a serious look should be taken at how banks sell products and that they have to reveal the risks involved in the products they sell .
" you also have to put in some sort of measure to allow the european union to act as a whole in order to help the financial sector in such a crisis and to detect possible problems earlier and then be able to act as the authorities have in the us , " he added .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : french finance minister christine lagarde proposed an eu wide rescue fund the proposed plan reportedly totaled 300 billion euros , though both the french and dutch governments have denied such a proposal has been made .
however , no matter what the final cost is , germany has said it is against it .
chancellor merkel will be attending the emergency finance summit on saturday in paris , which was called by french president nicolas sarkozy .
the leaders of britain and italy , european commission president jose manuel barroso , european central bank president jean-claude trichet and eurogroup chairman jean-claude juncker will also be there . mark mattox send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

communications have been severely disrupted , and the number of casualties and the extent of the damage are not yet known . "
it would go on to remind people that there was nothing to be gained by trying to get away , and warned people that by leaving their homes they could be exposing themselves to greater danger , as radioactive fall-out , which follows a nuclear explosion , is many times more dangerous when one is directly exposed to it in the open .

2 , in the russian city of st petersburg .
another big german company , basf , has already bought a quarter of the same field .
e.on controls a large part of germany 's gas and electricity supplies .
alternatives to russian gas part of the reason russia and germany are building the so-called nord stream pipeline under the baltic sea is to tap the siberian gas field , which has reserves of over 600 billion cubic meters , to feed the energy to german factories and homes .
other european nations have warned that germany may end up being too dependent on gazprom . e.on has tried harder than some of its german rivals to develop non-russian gas sources .
under the transaction , gazprom was able to buy back some of its own shares and reduce e.on 's influence on gazprom .
the owner of the production license and operator of the field will be russian oao severneftegazprom -lrb- sngp -rrb- , a statement by e.on said .
gazprom will hold just over half of sngp .
e.on 's ruhrgas unit and and basf 's wintershall division will each hold a stake of 25 percent minus one share .
energy for millions gas production at the site started last year and will reach around 25 billion cubic meters annually as early as next year , enough to supply a metropolis of approximately 10 million households .
under a complex swap , gazprom is to receive e.on ruhrgas 's 49 percent stake in the russian company zao gerosgaz , which holds just under 3 percent of gazprom shares .
after the transaction , e.on ruhrgas will still hold a 3.5-percent direct stake in gazprom . dpa news agency -lrb- kjb -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

self-employed women would also get the same maternity leave as salaried employees under the proposal , the commission said .
" only 65.5 percent of women with dependent children are in work , compared with 91.7 percent of men .
our proposals to improve maternity leave will help women to combine work and family life , " eu equal opportunities commissioner vladimir spidla said .
" they should also help increase women 's participation in the labour market and help face up to the challenges of demographic ageing , " he noted .
longer leave will effect business : bushill-matthews but british conservative member of the european parliament philip bushill-matthews labelled the proposal counterproductive for small business and said the matter should be handled at a state level , not a european level .
" flexible working and work-life balance must be encouraged but it is not for brussels to tell british mothers and fathers how much leave they should take , " he said .
" small business will struggle to afford this extra cost .
ultimately some of the smallest businesses may think twice about employing young women through fear of them going on maternity leave . " dw staff -lrb- dm -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

3 , on the details of a planned multibillion-euro bail-out for germany 's ailing mortgage lender hypo real estate . the talks at the german bundesbank headquarters lasted 12 hours , and revolved around how much each participant would contribute to the 35 billion-euro -lrb- $ 48 billion -rrb- deal to save the country 's second largest mortgage lender , reported dpa news agency .
bundesbank presidnet axel weber , along with jochen sanio - head of the federal finance industry regulator bafin - as well as representatives of leading banks and insurance companies were involved in nailing down the final rescue deal .
besides commercial banks , germany 's state savings banks as well as cooperative banks were also to be involved in the rescue package , in addition to insurance firms .
sources told dpa that the insurance firms were called in to participate since many of them are strongly involved in bonds , with hre 's troubled subsidiary depfa itself involved in issuing such paper for trading on world markets .
trouble from subsidiary depfa depfa , which hre acquired just last year , has been the chief source of hre 's problems since , with depfa coming under pressure of late , being unable to raise sufficient short-term loans amid the liquidity crunch on international financial markets .
berlin and the finance industry had proposed a plan to save hypo real estate from collapse earlier this week .
the online edition of the die welt newspaper had said that the situation had become urgent and that hre faced the threat of insolvency if no deal had been reached by friday morning .
berlin said it would not be nationalizing munich-based hre , but would post a guarantee for it of 26.6 billion euros , while german commercial banks would protect hre from default with up to 8.5 billion euros .
hours ahead of the german finance sector 's agreement in frankfurt , the european commission in brussels late thursday gave its green light to the german government 's guarantee . dpa news agency -lrb- kjb -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

3 , on the details of a planned multibillion-euro bail-out for germany 's ailing mortgage lender hypo real estate . the talks at the german bundesbank headquarters lasted 12 hours , and revolved around how much each participant would contribute to the 35 billion-euro -lrb- $ 48 billion -rrb- deal to save the country 's second largest mortgage lender , reported dpa news agency .
bundesbank presidnet axel weber , along with jochen sanio - head of the federal finance industry regulator bafin - as well as representatives of leading banks and insurance companies were involved in nailing down the final rescue deal .
besides commercial banks , germany 's state savings banks as well as cooperative banks were also to be involved in the rescue package , in addition to insurance firms .
sources told dpa that the insurance firms were called in to participate since many of them are strongly involved in bonds , with hre 's troubled subsidiary depfa itself involved in issuing such paper for trading on world markets .
trouble from subsidiary depfa depfa , which hre acquired just last year , has been the chief source of hre 's problems since , with depfa coming under pressure of late , being unable to raise sufficient short-term loans amid the liquidity crunch on international financial markets .
berlin and the finance industry had proposed a plan to save hypo real estate from collapse earlier this week .
the online edition of the die welt newspaper had said that the situation had become urgent and that hre faced the threat of insolvency if no deal had been reached by friday morning .
berlin said it would not be nationalizing munich-based hre , but would post a guarantee for it of 26.6 billion euros , while german commercial banks would protect hre from default with up to 8.5 billion euros .

they normally generate interest levels to match .
but campaign 2008 has been different all along - and the battle of the bottom of the ticket was different too , in this year of firsts .
democrat joe biden and his republican counterpart , sarah palin , are political polar opposites and they inhabit very different cultural galaxies but they do have one thing in common ; they are united by a flair for the kind of political slips that can shape the destiny of campaigns in which hundreds of millions of dollars have been invested .
we do n't know the exact figures yet but tens of millions of americans will have watched the full 90 minutes last night .
and one more statistic we 'll never know - how many watched in the hope that mr biden would strike a couple of bum notes or that mrs palin , who has floundered in recent television appearances , would simply implode and take the whole republican campaign with her .
many viewers will have stayed on to the end , watching as you watch high-wire artists performing without a net , with a guilty fascination at the possibility that one might fall .
who won ?
in the end , anyone hoping for a moment of train-wreck television would have been disappointed .
mr biden and mrs palin were both competent , if not exactly sparkling . "
i 'd be inclined to call it even , while noting that mrs palin perhaps exceeded expectations and even got a couple of cheeky digs in towards the end " the highly restrictive format in which the moderator worked through a list of questions with very little interaction between the candidates and few supplementary challenges pretty much ensured that neither would be able to deliver a knock-out blow .
the unavoidable question on these occasions is simply " who won ? " , and on this occasion it is particularly difficult to answer .
i 'd be inclined to call it even , while noting that mrs palin perhaps exceeded expectations and even got a couple of cheeky digs in towards the end .
having said that , mrs palin gave her supporters some anxious moments - particularly in the early part of the debate where she dealt with at least one question on the economy by ignoring it and offered a distinctly wobbly response on climate change - as though she could n't quite remember the details of a hastily learned answer .
most of the time though , it felt we were watching two over-rehearsed performances in parallel , in which both candidates will feel they got their messages across .
moose shooting it started off stiff and awkward , with mr biden lavishing praise and name-checks on barack obama and mrs palin doing much the same thing for her running mate , john mccain .
there were lengthy dry exchanges on foreign policy and on the $ 700bn -lrb- £ 380bn -rrb- bail-out which is stalled on capitol hill at the moment , and in those passages , neither candidate really stood out .
mrs palin seemed particularly nervous at first , clearly mindful of the way in which her disastrous performances in recent network television interviews had dulled the lustre of her surprise selection as candidate for the vice-presidency and damaged the mccain campaign .
the woman who famously knows how to shoot a moose has n't shot anything lately but herself .
in the foot .
she settled comfortably enough into her core message - she is not a washington insider and she is a rallying point for the america of " hockey moms and joe six-packs " that lies beyond the washington " beltway " .
the most interesting part of the debate perhaps came when the two were effectively fighting over which of them most faithfully represents the world of blue-collar america where the millions of floating voters who will decide this election live .
she referred to her home town , saying : " we need a little bit of reality from wasilla main street ... " and he responded immediately with a reference to his " … all you got to do is go down union street in wilmington with me and go to kay 's restaurant … " ground rules the stilted format did n't help the drama - perhaps the most effective dig of the evening came when mrs palin used one of the most quoted lines from the history of us debating , from the reagan-carter debate in 1980 : " there you go again … " it probably scored a few points with republicans , although perhaps that 's not entirely fair to mr biden .
it was generally accepted in american politics that as an older man debating with a younger woman he could n't afford to seem overbearing , confrontational or patronising .
he avoided those traps , but those ground rules made it difficult for him to land any scoring punches .
mrs palin grew in confidence as the evening went on , to the point where when the moderator gwen ifill tried to catch her out with a question quoting her previous views on the vice-presidency she dismissed them as a lame attempt at a joke - adding " and yours was a lame attempt at a joke too , because no-one got it " .
pitfalls avoided the candidates were at their best at their most personal .
joe biden 's voice caught momentarily as he recalled the days when he did n't know whether or not his other children would survive their injuries from the car accident in which his wife and infant daughter died .
mrs palin winked at her father in her audience when she announced that he was there and offered a " shout-out " to the third-grade class her brother teaches , offering extra credits for students who 'd stayed up late to watch the debate .
on the whole , though , it was an evening of pitfalls avoided , rather than victories won .
both sides will naturally claim victory , as you would expect , and both will feel they got some points across , but mrs palin 's advisers - who have clearly worked hard to brief her in the last few days - will feel a sense of relief that they got their candidate through her biggest challenge .
she was never going to win the election for them tonight , but she could have lost it and she did n't .

the watchdog ofwat has revealed that bills would increase by 9 % more than inflation between 2010-2015 .
the average bill will be £ 355 , before inflation is considered , by 2015 , as firms look to boost investment .
" my job is to ensure customers get a fair deal from the water industry , " said ofwat boss regina finn .
" we need to balance investment in the future with what customers are able to pay now , " she added .
" we will analyse the water companies ' proposals rigorously and challenge them to justify all investment .
we will protect customers from any unnecessary price rises . "
water firms proposed these increases to help pay for an investment programme of £ 27bn in the industry over the five-year period .
ofwat said the capital investment programme was roughly 37 % more than the current 2005-10 period , in which companies ' investments totalled slightly under £ 20bn .

it follows the row over a party dossier attacking rhodri morgan , from which mr bourne has dissociated himself , after it was said to be signed off by him .
the document called the first minister the " clown prince of wales " and criticised his dress sense and hair .
but mr bourne later said it went too far and it had not been issued by him .
bbc wales welsh affairs editor vaughan roderick said although there was some backing for mr bourne 's position from assembly members , informal discussions will take place at a senior level in the party this weekend ahead of a meeting of its assembly group on tuesday .
earlier mr bourne told the richard evans programme on bbc radio wales : " we have good personal relations and i hope we always will .
" it was a dossier that was issued by my party and it was not issued by me personally . "
i did think in certain respects it had gone too far " nick bourne , welsh conservative leader " i spoke to rhodri as soon as i got back on tuesday -lrb- from the conservative conference -rrb- and sought him out and we had a very good conversation .
" i did think in certain respects it had gone too far .
i told him that .
" we have our political differences and let 's focus on those .
" i have given a very clear instruction to my assembly members and to my staff that is what we do . "
the 39-page document claimed mr morgan 's " behaviour and comments " had become " increasingly erratic and unusual . "
it said he was " noted for his unique dress sense and hairstyle " .
the dossier also listed occasions when it suggests " eyebrows were raised by his attire . "
for example , the document observed that mr morgan wore a " woolly red jumper and beige cargo pants " at a function in honour of the former swansea west labour mp donald -lsb- now lord -rsb- anderson in 2005 .
the dossier accused mr morgan of looking to the past rather than preparing for the future , said he had blamed others for his " own shortcomings " and been guilty of " storing up trouble for the future , for his successors , and for wales . "
however , conservative sources have contradicted mr bourne 's version of events .
they claimed the dossier , which was issued in mr bourne 's name , had been " signed off " by him .
speaking shortly after the document was issued last weekend , mr morgan said he had heard that " there is some really unpleasant political stuff going on and you just have to accept that . "
" i 've chosen to ignore them completely , " he said .

earlier mr bourne told the richard evans programme on bbc radio wales : " we have good personal relations and i hope we always will .
" it was a dossier that was issued by my party and it was not issued by me personally .
i did think in certain respects it had gone too far nick bourne , welsh conservative leader " i spoke to rhodri as soon as i got back on tuesday -lrb- from the conservative conference -rrb- and sought him out and we had a very good conversation .
" i did think in certain respects it had gone too far .
i told him that .
" we have our political differences and let 's focus on those .
" i have given a very clear instruction to my assembly members and to my staff that is what we do . "
the 39-page document claimed mr morgan 's " behaviour and comments " had become " increasingly erratic and unusual . "
it said he was " noted for his unique dress sense and hairstyle " .
the dossier also listed occasions when it suggests " eyebrows were raised by his attire . "
for example , the document observed that mr morgan wore a " woolly red jumper and beige cargo pants " at a function in honour of the former swansea west labour mp donald -lsb- now lord -rsb- anderson in 2005 .

the dossier accused mr morgan of looking to the past rather than preparing for the future , said he had blamed others for his " own shortcomings " and been guilty of " storing up trouble for the future , for his successors , and for wales . "
however , conservative sources have contradicted mr bourne 's version of events .
they claimed the dossier , which was issued in mr bourne 's name , had been " signed off " by him .
speaking shortly after the document was issued last weekend , mr morgan said he had heard that " there is some really unpleasant political stuff going on and you just have to accept that . "
" i 've chosen to ignore them completely , " he said .

bbc news -pipe- americas -pipe- fact-checking the biden-palin debate bbc news / americas graphics version bbc sport home news front page -pipe- africa -pipe- americas -pipe- asia-pacific -pipe- europe -pipe- middle east -pipe- south asia -pipe- uk -pipe- business -pipe- health -pipe- science & environment -pipe- technology -pipe- entertainment -pipe- also in the news -pipe- have your say -pipe- 06:11 gmt , friday , 3 october 2008 07:11 uk fact-checking the biden-palin debate facts and figures were flying around in the debate between us vice-presidential candidates joe biden and sarah palin .
the bbc news website took a look to see which claims were accurate .
the us commander in afghanistan claim : joe biden said that the us " commanding general in afghanistan said the surge principle in iraq will not work in afghanistan " .
sarah palin responded by saying that " mcclellan did not say definitively the surge principles would not work in afghanistan " .
fact : on 2 october , the washington post quoted the head of the nato-led coalition in afghanistan , gen david mckiernan , as saying : " the word i do n't use for afghanistan is ' surge ' . "
verdict : mrs palin not only got the name of the us commander in afghanistan wrong , but it would seem she also distorted his position .
iraq 's budget surplus claim : joe biden said that " iraqis have an $ 80bn surplus " .
fact : according to factcheck.org , this is " an out-of-date projection .
the iraqis currently have $ 29bn in the bank , and could have $ 47bn to $ 59bn by the end of the year . "
verdict : joe biden is guilty of using out-of-date figures , but his substantive point - that the iraqis have resources to " spend their own money ... to take their own responsibility " - still holds .
obama 's readiness to be president claim : sarah palin reminded joe biden of his statement during the democratic primaries that barack obama " was not ready to be commander in chief " .
fact : joe biden did indeed say this , on 19 august , 2007 , in a tv debate between the various democratic presidential hopefuls .
verdict : mrs palin 's quote was perfectly accurate .
-lrb- however , mr biden did rethink his position .
by may 2008 - before mr obama had sewn up the nomination , and before he had picked mr biden to be his running-mate - he was claiming that mr obama had " learned a hell of a lot " . -rrb-
mccain 's sub-prime surprise claim : joe biden pointed out that " john mccain said as early as last december , quote - i 'm paraphrasing - ' i 'm surprised about this subprime mortgage crisis " ' .
fact : in a 4 november interview with a new hampshire newspaper , the keene sentinel , john mccain said " i 'd like to tell you i did anticipate -lsb- the mortgage crisis -rsb- , but i have to give you straight talk , i did not " .
verdict : mr biden 's paraphrase is a fair reflection of mr mccain 's words , although he got the date wrong by a month .
biden 's support for mccain 's iraq position claim : sarah palin said that joe biden " had supported john mccain 's military strategies -lsb- in iraq -rsb- pretty adamantly until this race " .
fact : jonathan weisman of the washington post characterises mr biden as " an outspoken opponent of ... troop increases in iraq as soon as bush announced them after the 2006 elections " .
as foreign relations committee chairman , he led the most heated hearings before the troops were actually deployed .
verdict : mrs palin 's claim is untrue .
mr biden opposed the surge - of which mr mccain was a prominent proponent - long before the beginning of the presidential campaign , and maintained this position throughout the race .
mccain on spain claim : joe biden asserted that " john mccain said as recently as a couple of weeks ago he would n't even sit down with the government of spain " .
fact : john mccain , in an interview with a spanish-language radio station , refused to commit to a meeting with the spanish prime minister , saying only that he " would be willing to meet with those leaders who are our friends and want to work with us in a cooperative fashion " .
many observers said at the time that mr mccain 's answer was based on a mishearing of the question he had been asked -lrb- which had followed a series of questions about america 's relationship with diplomatic foes in latin america -rrb- .
but a mccain campaign aide later confirmed that " the questioner asked several times about senator mccain 's willingness to meet -lsb- spanish pm -rsb- zapatero - and id 'd him in the question so there is no doubt senator mccain knew exactly to whom the question referred .
senator mccain refused to commit to a white house meeting with president zapatero in this interview . "
verdict : while it would have been true for mr biden to say that mr mccain had signalled -lrb- whether intentionally or not -rrb- a cooling in relations with spain , mr mccain did not rule out a meeting with the spanish prime minister .

the bbc news website took a look to see which claims were accurate .
the us commander in afghanistan claim : joe biden said that the us " commanding general in afghanistan said the surge principle in iraq will not work in afghanistan " .
sarah palin responded by saying that " mcclellan did not say definitively the surge principles would not work in afghanistan " .
fact : on 2 october , the washington post quoted the head of the nato-led coalition in afghanistan , gen david mckiernan , as saying : " the word i do n't use for afghanistan is ' surge ' . "
verdict : mrs palin not only got the name of the us commander in afghanistan wrong , but it would seem she also distorted his position .
iraq 's budget surplus claim : joe biden said that " iraqis have an $ 80bn surplus " .
fact : according to factcheck.org , this is " an out-of-date projection .
the iraqis currently have $ 29bn in the bank , and could have $ 47bn to $ 59bn by the end of the year . "
verdict : joe biden is guilty of using out-of-date figures , but his substantive point - that the iraqis have resources to " spend their own money ... to take their own responsibility " - still holds .
obama 's readiness to be president claim : sarah palin reminded joe biden of his statement during the democratic primaries that barack obama " was not ready to be commander in chief " .
fact : joe biden did indeed say this , on 19 august , 2007 , in a tv debate between the various democratic presidential hopefuls .
verdict : mrs palin 's quote was perfectly accurate .
-lrb- however , mr biden did rethink his position .
by may 2008 - before mr obama had sewn up the nomination , and before he had picked mr biden to be his running-mate - he was claiming that mr obama had " learned a hell of a lot " . -rrb-
mccain 's sub-prime surprise claim : joe biden pointed out that " john mccain said as early as last december , quote - i 'm paraphrasing - ' i 'm surprised about this subprime mortgage crisis " ' .
fact : in a 4 november interview with a new hampshire newspaper , the keene sentinel , john mccain said " i 'd like to tell you i did anticipate -lsb- the mortgage crisis -rsb- , but i have to give you straight talk , i did not " .
verdict : mr biden 's paraphrase is a fair reflection of mr mccain 's words , although he got the date wrong by a month .
biden 's support for mccain 's iraq position claim : sarah palin said that joe biden " had supported john mccain 's military strategies -lsb- in iraq -rsb- pretty adamantly until this race " .
fact : jonathan weisman of the washington post characterises mr biden as " an outspoken opponent of ... troop increases in iraq as soon as bush announced them after the 2006 elections " .
as foreign relations committee chairman , he led the most heated hearings before the troops were actually deployed .
verdict : mrs palin 's claim is untrue .
mr biden opposed the surge - of which mr mccain was a prominent proponent - long before the beginning of the presidential campaign , and maintained this position throughout the race .
mccain on spain claim : joe biden asserted that " john mccain said as recently as a couple of weeks ago he would n't even sit down with the government of spain " .
fact : john mccain , in an interview with a spanish-language radio station , refused to commit to a meeting with the spanish prime minister , saying only that he " would be willing to meet with those leaders who are our friends and want to work with us in a cooperative fashion " .
many observers said at the time that mr mccain 's answer was based on a mishearing of the question he had been asked -lrb- which had followed a series of questions about america 's relationship with diplomatic foes in latin america -rrb- .
but a mccain campaign aide later confirmed that " the questioner asked several times about senator mccain 's willingness to meet -lsb- spanish pm -rsb- zapatero - and id 'd him in the question so there is no doubt senator mccain knew exactly to whom the question referred .
senator mccain refused to commit to a white house meeting with president zapatero in this interview . "
verdict : while it would have been true for mr biden to say that mr mccain had signalled -lrb- whether intentionally or not -rrb- a cooling in relations with spain , mr mccain did not rule out a meeting with the spanish prime minister .

bbc news -pipe- americas -pipe- fact-checking the biden-palin debate british broadcasting corporation home accessibility links skip to content skip to local navigation skip to bbc.co.uk navigation skip to bbc.co.uk search help accessibility help bbc news updated every minute of every day one-minute world news news front page africa americas asia-pacific europe middle east south asia uk business health science & environment technology entertainment also in the news - video and audio - programmes have your say in pictures country profiles special reports related bbc sites sport weather on this day editors ' blog bbc world service languages espanol brazil caribbean more page last updated at 06:11 gmt , friday , 3 october 2008 07:11 uk e-mail this to a friend printable version biden and palin debate latest news analysis blow-by-blow highlights key quotes scorecard fact checker facts and figures were flying around in the debate between us vice-presidential candidates joe biden and sarah palin .
the bbc news website took a look to see which claims were accurate .
the us commander in afghanistan claim : joe biden said that the us " commanding general in afghanistan said the surge principle in iraq will not work in afghanistan " .
sarah palin responded by saying that " mcclellan did not say definitively the surge principles would not work in afghanistan " .
fact : on 2 october , the washington post quoted the head of the nato-led coalition in afghanistan , gen david mckiernan , as saying : " the word i do n't use for afghanistan is ' surge ' . "
verdict : mrs palin not only got the name of the us commander in afghanistan wrong , but it would seem she also distorted his position .
iraq 's budget surplus claim : joe biden said that " iraqis have an $ 80bn surplus " .
fact : according to factcheck.org , this is " an out-of-date projection .
the iraqis currently have $ 29bn in the bank , and could have $ 47bn to $ 59bn by the end of the year . "
verdict : joe biden is guilty of using out-of-date figures , but his substantive point - that the iraqis have resources to " spend their own money ... to take their own responsibility " - still holds .
obama 's readiness to be president claim : sarah palin reminded joe biden of his statement during the democratic primaries that barack obama " was not ready to be commander in chief " .
fact : joe biden did indeed say this , on 19 august , 2007 , in a tv debate between the various democratic presidential hopefuls .
verdict : mrs palin 's quote was perfectly accurate .
-lrb- however , mr biden did rethink his position .
by may 2008 - before mr obama had sewn up the nomination , and before he had picked mr biden to be his running-mate - he was claiming that mr obama had " learned a hell of a lot " . -rrb-
mccain 's sub-prime surprise claim : joe biden pointed out that " john mccain said as early as last december , quote - i 'm paraphrasing - ' i 'm surprised about this subprime mortgage crisis " ' .
fact : in a 4 november interview with a new hampshire newspaper , the keene sentinel , john mccain said " i 'd like to tell you i did anticipate -lsb- the mortgage crisis -rsb- , but i have to give you straight talk , i did not " .
verdict : mr biden 's paraphrase is a fair reflection of mr mccain 's words , although he got the date wrong by a month .
biden 's support for mccain 's iraq position claim : sarah palin said that joe biden " had supported john mccain 's military strategies -lsb- in iraq -rsb- pretty adamantly until this race " .
fact : jonathan weisman of the washington post characterises mr biden as " an outspoken opponent of ... troop increases in iraq as soon as bush announced them after the 2006 elections " .
as foreign relations committee chairman , he led the most heated hearings before the troops were actually deployed .
verdict : mrs palin 's claim is untrue .
mr biden opposed the surge - of which mr mccain was a prominent proponent - long before the beginning of the presidential campaign , and maintained this position throughout the race .
mccain on spain claim : joe biden asserted that " john mccain said as recently as a couple of weeks ago he would n't even sit down with the government of spain " .
fact : john mccain , in an interview with a spanish-language radio station , refused to commit to a meeting with the spanish prime minister , saying only that he " would be willing to meet with those leaders who are our friends and want to work with us in a cooperative fashion " .
many observers said at the time that mr mccain 's answer was based on a mishearing of the question he had been asked -lrb- which had followed a series of questions about america 's relationship with diplomatic foes in latin america -rrb- .
but a mccain campaign aide later confirmed that " the questioner asked several times about senator mccain 's willingness to meet -lsb- spanish pm -rsb- zapatero - and id 'd him in the question so there is no doubt senator mccain knew exactly to whom the question referred .
senator mccain refused to commit to a white house meeting with president zapatero in this interview . "
verdict : while it would have been true for mr biden to say that mr mccain had signalled -lrb- whether intentionally or not -rrb- a cooling in relations with spain , mr mccain did not rule out a meeting with the spanish prime minister .

climate change same-sex couples bringing change iraq war on terror nuclear proliferation middle east feeling voters ' pain economy climate change palin : we know that it 's real .
i 'm not one to attribute every man - activity of man to the changes in the climate .
there is something to be said also for man 's activities , but also for the cyclical temperature changes on our planet .
but there are real changes going on in our climate .
and i do n't want to argue about the causes .
biden : i think it 's clearly man-made .
and , look , this probably explains the biggest fundamental difference ...
if you do n't understand what the cause is , it 's virtually impossible to come up with a solution .
we know what the cause is .
the cause is man-made ...
that 's why the polar icecap is melting .
return to top same-sex marriage biden : the fact of the matter is that under the constitution , same-sex couples should be able to have visitation rights in the hospitals , joint ownership of property , life insurance policies , et cetera ...
in an obama-biden administration , there will be absolutely no distinction from a constitutional standpoint or a legal standpoint between a same-sex and a heterosexual couple ...
barack obama nor i support redefining from a civil side what constitutes marriage . "
palin : i am tolerant ... but in that tolerance also , no-one would ever propose , not in a mccain-palin administration , to do anything to prohibit , say , visitations in a hospital ...
but i will tell americans straight up that i do n't support defining marriage as anything but between one man and one woman .
return to top bringing change palin : now , what i 've done as a governor and as a mayor is i 've had that track record of reform .
and i 've joined this team that is a team of mavericks with john mccain ...
we 're known for putting partisan politics aside to just get the job done ...
we 're tired of the old politics as usual .
oh , yeah , it 's so obvious i 'm a washington outsider .
biden : i have n't heard how -lsb- mccain 's -rsb- policy is going to be different on iran than george bush 's .
i have n't heard how his policy is going to be different with israel than george bush 's .
i have n't heard how his policy in afghanistan is going to be different than george bush 's .
i have n't heard how his policy in pakistan is going to be different than george bush 's ...
and you know where that policy has taken us .
return to top iraq biden : john mccain and dick cheney said while i was saying we would not be greeted as liberators , we would not ...
john mccain was saying the sunnis and shias got along with each other without reading the history of the last 700 years .
john mccain said there would be enough oil to pay for this .
john mccain has been dead wrong .
palin : your plan is a white flag of surrender in iraq and that is not what our troops need to hear today , that 's for sure .
and it 's not what our nation needs to be able to count on .
you guys opposed the surge .
the surge worked .
barack obama still ca n't admit the surge works .
return to top war on terror palin : there have been huge blunders in the war .
there have been huge blunders throughout this administration , as there are with every administration .
biden : john continues to tell us that the central war in the front on terror is in iraq .
i promise you , if an attack comes in the homeland , it 's going to come ... from al-qaeda planning in the hills of afghanistan and pakistan .
that 's where they live .
return to top nuclear proliferation biden : pakistan already has nuclear weapons .
pakistan already has deployed nuclear weapons .
pakistan 's weapons can already hit israel and the mediterranean .
iran getting a nuclear weapon would be very , very destabilising ...
so they 're both very dangerous .
they both would be game-changers .
palin : an armed , nuclear-armed , especially iran , is so extremely dangerous to consider ...
iran claiming that israel , as he termed it , a stinking corpse , a country that should be wiped off the face of the earth .
now a leader like ahmadinejad , who is not sane or stable , when he says things like that , is not one whom we can allow to acquire nuclear weapons .
return to top middle east palin : a two-state solution is the solution ...
israel is our strongest and best ally in the middle east ... building our embassy , also , in jerusalem , those things that we look forward to being able to accomplish with this peace-seeking nation .
i can promise you , in a mccain-palin administration , that commitment is there to work with our friends in israel .
i 'm so encouraged to know that we both love israel .
biden : it has been an abject failure , this administration 's policy ...
here 's what the president said when we said no .
he insisted on elections on the west bank , when i said , and others said , and barack obama said : " big mistake .
hamas will win .
you 'll legitimise them . "
what happened ?
hamas won .
return to top feeling voters ' pain biden : look , i understand what it 's like to be a single parent .
when my wife and daughter died and my two sons were gravely injured , i understand what it 's like as a parent to wonder what it 's like if your kid 's going to make it .
i understand what it 's like to sit around the kitchen table with a father who says , " i 've got to leave , champ , because there 's no jobs here . "
palin : being a mom , one very concerned about a son in the war , about a special needs child , about kids heading off to college , how are we going to pay those tuition bills ?
about times ... in our past where we did n't have health insurance and we know what other americans are going through as they sit around the kitchen table ...
i 've been there .
i know what the hurts are .
return to top economy biden : two years ago barack obama warned about the sub-prime mortgage crisis .
john mccain said shortly after that , in december , he was surprised there was a sub-prime mortgage problem .
we let wall street run wild ...
john mccain thought the answer is that tried-and-true republican response , deregulate , deregulate .
palin : darn right it was the predator lenders , who tried to talk americans into thinking that it was smart to buy a $ 300,000 house if we could only afford a $ 100,000 house .
there was deception there , and there was greed and there is corruption on wall street ...
i think we need to band together and say never again .

biden : i think it 's clearly man-made .
and , look , this probably explains the biggest fundamental difference ...
if you do n't understand what the cause is , it 's virtually impossible to come up with a solution .
we know what the cause is .
the cause is man-made ...
that 's why the polar icecap is melting .
return to top same-sex marriage key words used most frequently by joe biden in the debate enlarge image biden : the fact of the matter is that under the constitution , same-sex couples should be able to have visitation rights in the hospitals , joint ownership of property , life insurance policies , et cetera ...
in an obama-biden administration , there will be absolutely no distinction from a constitutional standpoint or a legal standpoint between a same-sex and a heterosexual couple ...
barack obama nor i support redefining from a civil side what constitutes marriage . "
palin : i am tolerant ... but in that tolerance also , no-one would ever propose , not in a mccain-palin administration , to do anything to prohibit , say , visitations in a hospital ...
but i will tell americans straight up that i do n't support defining marriage as anything but between one man and one woman .
return to top bringing change palin : now , what i 've done as a governor and as a mayor is i 've had that track record of reform .
and i 've joined this team that is a team of mavericks with john mccain ...
we 're known for putting partisan politics aside to just get the job done ...
we 're tired of the old politics as usual .
oh , yeah , it 's so obvious i 'm a washington outsider .
biden : i have n't heard how -lsb- mccain 's -rsb- policy is going to be different on iran than george bush 's .
i have n't heard how his policy is going to be different with israel than george bush 's .
i have n't heard how his policy in afghanistan is going to be different than george bush 's .
i have n't heard how his policy in pakistan is going to be different than george bush 's ...
and you know where that policy has taken us .
return to top iraq biden : john mccain and dick cheney said while i was saying we would not be greeted as liberators , we would not ...
john mccain was saying the sunnis and shias got along with each other without reading the history of the last 700 years .
john mccain said there would be enough oil to pay for this .
john mccain has been dead wrong .
palin : your plan is a white flag of surrender in iraq and that is not what our troops need to hear today , that 's for sure .
and it 's not what our nation needs to be able to count on .
you guys opposed the surge .
the surge worked .
barack obama still ca n't admit the surge works .
return to top war on terror palin : there have been huge blunders in the war .
there have been huge blunders throughout this administration , as there are with every administration .
biden : john continues to tell us that the central war in the front on terror is in iraq .
i promise you , if an attack comes in the homeland , it 's going to come ... from al-qaeda planning in the hills of afghanistan and pakistan .
that 's where they live .
return to top nuclear proliferation biden : pakistan already has nuclear weapons .
pakistan already has deployed nuclear weapons .
pakistan 's weapons can already hit israel and the mediterranean .
iran getting a nuclear weapon would be very , very destabilising ...
so they 're both very dangerous .
they both would be game-changers .
palin : an armed , nuclear-armed , especially iran , is so extremely dangerous to consider ...
iran claiming that israel , as he termed it , a stinking corpse , a country that should be wiped off the face of the earth .
now a leader like ahmadinejad , who is not sane or stable , when he says things like that , is not one whom we can allow to acquire nuclear weapons .
return to top middle east palin : a two-state solution is the solution ...
israel is our strongest and best ally in the middle east ... building our embassy , also , in jerusalem , those things that we look forward to being able to accomplish with this peace-seeking nation .
i can promise you , in a mccain-palin administration , that commitment is there to work with our friends in israel .
i 'm so encouraged to know that we both love israel .
biden : it has been an abject failure , this administration 's policy ...
here 's what the president said when we said no .
he insisted on elections on the west bank , when i said , and others said , and barack obama said : " big mistake .
hamas will win .
you 'll legitimise them . "
what happened ?
hamas won .
return to top feeling voters ' pain biden : look , i understand what it 's like to be a single parent .
when my wife and daughter died and my two sons were gravely injured , i understand what it 's like as a parent to wonder what it 's like if your kid 's going to make it .
i understand what it 's like to sit around the kitchen table with a father who says , " i 've got to leave , champ , because there 's no jobs here . "
palin : being a mom , one very concerned about a son in the war , about a special needs child , about kids heading off to college , how are we going to pay those tuition bills ?
about times ... in our past where we did n't have health insurance and we know what other americans are going through as they sit around the kitchen table ...
i 've been there .
i know what the hurts are .
return to top economy biden : two years ago barack obama warned about the sub-prime mortgage crisis .
john mccain said shortly after that , in december , he was surprised there was a sub-prime mortgage problem .
we let wall street run wild ...
john mccain thought the answer is that tried-and-true republican response , deregulate , deregulate .
palin : darn right it was the predator lenders , who tried to talk americans into thinking that it was smart to buy a $ 300,000 house if we could only afford a $ 100,000 house .
there was deception there , and there was greed and there is corruption on wall street ...
i think we need to band together and say never again .

there have been huge blunders throughout this administration , as there are with every administration .
biden : john continues to tell us that the central war in the front on terror is in iraq .
i promise you , if an attack comes in the homeland , it 's going to come ... from al-qaeda planning in the hills of afghanistan and pakistan .
that 's where they live .
return to top nuclear proliferation biden : pakistan already has nuclear weapons .
pakistan already has deployed nuclear weapons .
pakistan 's weapons can already hit israel and the mediterranean .
iran getting a nuclear weapon would be very , very destabilising ...
so they 're both very dangerous .
they both would be game-changers .
palin : an armed , nuclear-armed , especially iran , is so extremely dangerous to consider ...
iran claiming that israel , as he termed it , a stinking corpse , a country that should be wiped off the face of the earth .
now a leader like ahmadinejad , who is not sane or stable , when he says things like that , is not one whom we can allow to acquire nuclear weapons .
return to top middle east palin : a two-state solution is the solution ...
israel is our strongest and best ally in the middle east ... building our embassy , also , in jerusalem , those things that we look forward to being able to accomplish with this peace-seeking nation .
i can promise you , in a mccain-palin administration , that commitment is there to work with our friends in israel .
i 'm so encouraged to know that we both love israel .
biden : it has been an abject failure , this administration 's policy ...
here 's what the president said when we said no .
he insisted on elections on the west bank , when i said , and others said , and barack obama said : " big mistake .
hamas will win .
you 'll legitimise them . "
what happened ?
hamas won .
return to top feeling voters ' pain biden : look , i understand what it 's like to be a single parent .
when my wife and daughter died and my two sons were gravely injured , i understand what it 's like as a parent to wonder what it 's like if your kid 's going to make it .
i understand what it 's like to sit around the kitchen table with a father who says , " i 've got to leave , champ , because there 's no jobs here . "
palin : being a mom , one very concerned about a son in the war , about a special needs child , about kids heading off to college , how are we going to pay those tuition bills ?
about times ... in our past where we did n't have health insurance and we know what other americans are going through as they sit around the kitchen table ...
i 've been there .
i know what the hurts are .
return to top economy biden : two years ago barack obama warned about the sub-prime mortgage crisis .
john mccain said shortly after that , in december , he was surprised there was a sub-prime mortgage problem .
we let wall street run wild ...
john mccain thought the answer is that tried-and-true republican response , deregulate , deregulate .
palin : darn right it was the predator lenders , who tried to talk americans into thinking that it was smart to buy a $ 300,000 house if we could only afford a $ 100,000 house .
there was deception there , and there was greed and there is corruption on wall street ...
i think we need to band together and say never again .

the vp candidates discuss the economic bail-out plan the two us vice-presidential candidates have traded blows on the financial crisis , climate change and foreign policy in their only tv debate .
democrat joe biden sought to link republican presidential candidate john mccain to the policies of president bush , saying he was " no maverick " .
republican sarah palin defended herself against claims of inexperience and said the mccain ticket would bring change .
voter polls suggested mr biden had won but mrs palin did better than expected .
the debate at washington university in st louis , missouri , was seen as particularly crucial for mrs palin , whose poll ratings have fallen .
the bbc 's jane o 'brien in washington says mrs palin played to her strengths and her image as a mother in touch with ordinary americans .
for the most part she spoke fluently but simply about the economy , climate change and the war in iraq , our correspondent says , and there were few of the stumbling gaffes that have become the staple of late-night comedy shows .
two polls conducted after the debate , by us networks cnn and cbs news , judged mr biden the winner .
however , the cnn poll found a large majority thought mrs palin had done better than expected .
' hockey moms ' asked by moderator gwen ifill who was at fault for the current problems with the us banking system , mrs palin blamed predatory lenders and " greed and corruption " on wall street .
it would be a travesty if we were to quit now in iraq sarah palin republican vp nominee biden and palin dodge pitfalls debate as it happened experts score the debate in quotes : palin and biden debate hockey moms rate the debate senator mccain would " put partisanship aside " to help resolve the crisis , she said , and had raised the alarm over mortgage giants fannie mae and freddie mac long ago .
she said " joe six-packs and hockey moms across the country " - referring to middle-class voters - needed to say " never again " to wall street chiefs .
mrs palin also accused democratic presidential candidate barack obama of seeking to raise taxes but mr biden rejected that claim .
he said the economic crisis was evidence that the policies of the past eight years had been " the worst we 've ever had " and accused mr mccain of being " out of touch " on the economy .
senator obama 's plan to raise taxes on households earning over $ 250,000 was " fairness " , mr biden said , unlike mr mccain 's proposals for more tax breaks for big companies .
' dead wrong ' on foreign policy , mrs palin accused mr obama of refusing to acknowledge that the " surge " strategy of extra troops in iraq had worked .
he 's not been a maverick on virtually anything that people talk about around the kitchen table joe biden democratic vp nominee " it would be a travesty if we were to quit now in iraq , " she said , describing mr obama 's plan to withdraw combat troops a " white flag of surrender " .
mr biden countered by saying mr mccain had been " dead wrong " on iraq and had yet to present a plan to end the conflict .
he said the us was wasting $ 10bn a month in iraq while ignoring the real front line in the fight against terrorism , afghanistan .
in turn , mrs palin said mr obama was naive for saying he was willing to talk directly to the leaders of iran , north korea and cuba .
" that is beyond bad judgment .
that is dangerous , " she said .
the pair also sparred on the issue of climate change .
mrs palin , governor of energy-rich alaska , said human activities were a factor in climate change but that climatic cycles were also an element .
she urged us energy independence as part of the answer .
key words used most frequently by joe biden in the debate enlarge image mr biden pointed to climate change as one of the major points on which the two campaigns differed , saying : " if you do n't understand what the cause is , it 's virtually impossible to come up with a solution . "
he said he and mr obama backed " clean-coal " technology and accused mr mccain of having voted against funding for alternative energy projects and seeing only one solution : " drill , drill , drill . "
while mrs palin described her party 's candidate as " the consummate maverick " , her rival argued that mr mccain had followed the bush administration 's policies on important issues such as iraq .
" he 's not been a maverick on virtually anything that people talk about around the kitchen table , " mr biden said .
overall , commentators highlighted mrs palin 's frequent use of a " folksy " style , for example using expressions like " doggone it " and telling her opponent : " aw , say it ai n't so , joe . "
they also noted how mr biden appeared emotional as he talked about raising his two young sons alone after a car crash killed his first wife .
poll shift according to a pew research center poll , two-thirds of voters planned to follow the debate , far more than in 2004 .
sarah palin was a huge hit at the republican convention last month a new poll by the washington post suggests that 60 % of voters now see mrs palin as lacking the experience to be an effective president .
one-third say they are less likely to vote for senator mccain , as a result .
independent voters , who are not affiliated to either political party , have the most sceptical views of the 44-year-old alaska governor .
another poll , for cbs news , gives senator barack obama 49 % to 40 % for mr mccain .
it is the latest in a series of opinion polls that have shown a significant shift in the direction of mr obama since the economic crisis began .
mrs palin , whose fiery speech at last month 's republican convention inspired christian conservatives , produces unusually strong feelings - both positive and negative - among voters .
key words used most frequently by sarah palin in the debate enlarge image although mrs palin has succeeded in mobilising conservative republicans , her key challenge is to appeal to the swing voters who could determine who will win the battleground states , analysts say .
in particular , she needs to win over the " wal-mart moms " - white , working-class married women .
a recent poll of customers of discount giant wal-mart suggested that mr mccain was slightly ahead with this group in ohio and florida , while mr obama was leading in virginia and colorado .
meanwhile , the mccain campaign is scaling back its operations in another swing state , michigan , effectively conceding the advantage to mr obama there .

the vp candidates discuss the economic bail-out plan the two us vice-presidential candidates have traded blows on the financial crisis , climate change and foreign policy in their only tv debate .
democrat joe biden sought to link republican presidential candidate john mccain to the policies of president bush , saying he was " no maverick " .
republican sarah palin defended herself against claims of inexperience and said the mccain ticket would bring change .
voter polls suggested mr biden had won but mrs palin did better than expected .
the debate at washington university in st louis , missouri , was seen as particularly crucial for mrs palin , whose poll ratings have fallen .
the bbc 's jane o 'brien in washington says mrs palin played to her strengths and her image as a mother in touch with ordinary americans .
for the most part she spoke fluently but simply about the economy , climate change and the war in iraq , our correspondent says , and there were few of the stumbling gaffes that have become the staple of late-night comedy shows .
two polls conducted after the debate , by us networks cnn and cbs news , judged mr biden the winner .
however , the cnn poll found a large majority thought mrs palin had done better than expected .
' hockey moms ' asked by moderator gwen ifill who was at fault for the current problems with the us banking system , mrs palin blamed predatory lenders and " greed and corruption " on wall street .
it would be a travesty if we were to quit now in iraq sarah palin republican vp nominee biden and palin dodge pitfalls debate as it happened experts score the debate in quotes : palin and biden debate hockey moms rate the debate senator mccain would " put partisanship aside " to help resolve the crisis , she said , and had raised the alarm over mortgage giants fannie mae and freddie mac long ago .
she said " joe six-packs and hockey moms across the country " - referring to middle-class voters - needed to say " never again " to wall street chiefs .
mrs palin also accused democratic presidential candidate barack obama of seeking to raise taxes but mr biden rejected that claim .
he said the economic crisis was evidence that the policies of the past eight years had been " the worst we 've ever had " and accused mr mccain of being " out of touch " on the economy .
senator obama 's plan to raise taxes on households earning over $ 250,000 was " fairness " , mr biden said , unlike mr mccain 's proposals for more tax breaks for big companies .
' dead wrong ' on foreign policy , mrs palin accused mr obama of refusing to acknowledge that the " surge " strategy of extra troops in iraq had worked .
he 's not been a maverick on virtually anything that people talk about around the kitchen table joe biden democratic vp nominee " it would be a travesty if we were to quit now in iraq , " she said , describing mr obama 's plan to withdraw combat troops a " white flag of surrender " .
mr biden countered by saying mr mccain had been " dead wrong " on iraq and had yet to present a plan to end the conflict .
he said the us was wasting $ 10bn a month in iraq while ignoring the real front line in the fight against terrorism , afghanistan .
in turn , mrs palin said mr obama was naive for saying he was willing to talk directly to the leaders of iran , north korea and cuba .
" that is beyond bad judgment .
that is dangerous , " she said .
the pair also sparred on the issue of climate change .
mrs palin , governor of energy-rich alaska , said human activities were a factor in climate change but that climatic cycles were also an element .
she urged us energy independence as part of the answer .
key words used most frequently by joe biden in the debate enlarge image mr biden pointed to climate change as one of the major points on which the two campaigns differed , saying : " if you do n't understand what the cause is , it 's virtually impossible to come up with a solution . "
he said he and mr obama backed " clean-coal " technology and accused mr mccain of having voted against funding for alternative energy projects and seeing only one solution : " drill , drill , drill . "
while mrs palin described her party 's candidate as " the consummate maverick " , her rival argued that mr mccain had followed the bush administration 's policies on important issues such as iraq .
" he 's not been a maverick on virtually anything that people talk about around the kitchen table , " mr biden said .
overall , commentators highlighted mrs palin 's frequent use of a " folksy " style , for example using expressions like " doggone it " and telling her opponent : " aw , say it ai n't so , joe . "
they also noted how mr biden appeared emotional as he talked about raising his two young sons alone after a car crash killed his first wife .
poll shift according to a pew research center poll , two-thirds of voters planned to follow the debate , far more than in 2004 .
sarah palin was a huge hit at the republican convention last month a new poll by the washington post suggests that 60 % of voters now see mrs palin as lacking the experience to be an effective president .
one-third say they are less likely to vote for senator mccain , as a result .
independent voters , who are not affiliated to either political party , have the most sceptical views of the 44-year-old alaska governor .
another poll , for cbs news , gives senator barack obama 49 % to 40 % for mr mccain .
it is the latest in a series of opinion polls that have shown a significant shift in the direction of mr obama since the economic crisis began .
mrs palin , whose fiery speech at last month 's republican convention inspired christian conservatives , produces unusually strong feelings - both positive and negative - among voters .
key words used most frequently by sarah palin in the debate enlarge image although mrs palin has succeeded in mobilising conservative republicans , her key challenge is to appeal to the swing voters who could determine who will win the battleground states , analysts say .
in particular , she needs to win over the " wal-mart moms " - white , working-class married women .
a recent poll of customers of discount giant wal-mart suggested that mr mccain was slightly ahead with this group in ohio and florida , while mr obama was leading in virginia and colorado .
meanwhile , the mccain campaign is scaling back its operations in another swing state , michigan , effectively conceding the advantage to mr obama there .

independent voters , who are not affiliated to either political party , have the most sceptical views of the 44-year-old alaska governor .
another poll , for cbs news , gives senator barack obama 49 % to 40 % for mr mccain .
it is the latest in a series of opinion polls that have shown a significant shift in the direction of mr obama since the economic crisis began .
mrs palin , whose fiery speech at last month 's republican convention inspired christian conservatives , produces unusually strong feelings - both positive and negative - among voters .
although mrs palin has succeeded in mobilising conservative republicans , her key challenge is to appeal to the swing voters who could determine who will win the battleground states , analysts say .
in particular , she needs to win over the " wal-mart moms " - white , working-class married women .
a recent poll of customers of discount giant wal-mart suggested that mr mccain was slightly ahead with this group in ohio and florida , while mr obama was leading in virginia and colorado .
meanwhile , the mccain campaign is scaling back its operations in another swing state , michigan , effectively conceding the advantage to mr obama there .
