the interpretation of what he said had been " politically wrong , " he told reporters .
about 50 nations , including germany , have recognized kosovo as independent , whereas serbia insists kosovo still belongs to it . tadic said belgrade would never recognize its independence , but was making an effort to shift the kosovo issue " from the political corner to the legal corner " by taking it to the international court of justice .
he said it was asking the united nations to refer the matter to the court in the hague .
about 100,000 ethnic serbs live in kosovo and their towns have largely rejected government by pristina .

the interpretation of what he said had been " politically wrong , " he told reporters .
about 50 nations , including germany , have recognized kosovo as independent , whereas serbia insists kosovo still belongs to it . tadic said belgrade would never recognize its independence , but was making an effort to shift the kosovo issue " from the political corner to the legal corner " by taking it to the international court of justice .
he said it was asking the united nations to refer the matter to the court in the hague .
about 100,000 ethnic serbs live in kosovo and their towns have largely rejected government by pristina .
the tadic visit to berlin was seen as part of the president 's efforts to develop closer ties with the european union .

germany would send one frigate , said defense minister franz-josef jung . french defense minister herve morin announced that the anti-piracy security operation could begin as soon as next month in the wake of calls from somali president abdullahi yusuf ahmed for the international community to combat rising piracy off the lawless nation 's waters .
" there is very broad european willingness .
many countries want to take part .
ten have clearly given their accord to take part in such a mission , " morin said wednesday , oct .
1 , at the meeting in the french seaside resort of deauville .
" we have given a mandate -lrb- to eu top brass -rrb- to continue the planning for the launch of this operation in the month of november , " he told reporters .
" we will see what means , nato and european , can be added . "
belgium , cyprus , france , germany , lithuania , the netherlands , spain , sweden and possibly britain would be involved in the task force , morin said .
" we have to coordinate between the ships that are in the zone and those we are going to send , " he said , and added that nato countries , particularly the united states , had vessels in the area .
germany has agreed to provide a frigate for the eu naval task force , which will include three frigates , a supply ship and three maritime surveillance ships , defense minister franz-josef jung said at the meeting .
germany to send frigate to somalia bildunterschrift : germany 's " emden " was deployed off somalia as part of operation enduring freedom " i think it 's necessary to counter pirates effectively , " jung told reporters .
" i support a mission that pushes back piracy , secures the seas and ensures free maritime trade . "
piracy is rife and well organized in the region where somalia 's north-eastern tip juts into the indian ocean , preying on a key maritime route leading to the suez canal .
an estimated 30 percent of the world 's oil passes through the territory .
sixty ships have been seized this year alone and somali pirates are currently holding 13 vessels captive with more than 200 sailors .
the pirates operate high-powered speedboats and are heavily armed , sometimes holding ships for weeks until they are released for large ransoms paid by governments or owners .
the somali government was joined in its calls for action by global shipping groups last month which urged the world 's naval powers to do more to stop piracy .
global shipping groups call for action the groups , including the international chamber of shipping , bimco and oil tanker group intercargo , said they were " utterly amazed " governments were unable to secure one of the world 's most important seaways .
they also warned that continued inaction risked causing a repetition of the crisis in the early 1970s when the suez canal was closed and merchant shipping was diverted around the cape of good hope at africa 's southern tip , leading to major consequences for international trade , including higher transport costs and the maintenance of inventories .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : president yusaf warns of consequences for the world somalia 's president yusaf warned in a speech in the capital mogadishu this week that the pirates represented a risk to the whole world . " they -lrb- pirates -rrb- are imposing an embargo on the somali people and the international community because they are blocking movement between the mediterranean and the indian ocean , which affects not only somalia but the whole world , " yusuf told reporters .
" i call on the somali people to fight against the pirates .
i also call on the international community to act quickly on what is happening in somali waters as well as on shore , " he added .
us navy monitor seized arms ship the pirates who seized a belize-flagged freighter with its 21-man crew and 33 soviet-era t-72 battle tanks on board last thursday say they are under 24-hour surveillance from us ships and helicopters .
" we are prepared for any eventuality , " warned pirate spokesman sugule ali by satellite telephone from the ship .
" we are sticking to the demand for $ 20 million .
this is not ransom , but a fine for unlawfully transporting weapons on somali waters , " ali said .
there are 21 ukrainians , russians and latvians in the crew .
the ship 's captain died of an illness on board , according to russian media .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the " faina " is carrying a consignment of army tanks the bahrain-based us navy fifth fleet said several ships and helicopters were in the area to support the destroyer uss howard as it observed its target , now docked at the somali port village of hobyo .
abdikadir musa yusuf , deputy seaports minister for the somali breakaway region of puntland , said , " there are negotiations going on between the pirates and the foreign ships . "
the pentagon said it wanted a peaceful resolution and us warships were there to make sure pirates do not make off with its military cargo .
" but at this point , what we are most concerned about is seeing a peaceful solution to this problem , " pentagon spokesman geoff morrell said , adding that the us navy was not negotiating with the pirates .
he said the main us concern was " that this cargo does not end up in the hands of anyone who would use it in a way that would be destabilizing to the region .

" with the weakening of demand , upside risks to price stability have diminished somewhat , but they have not disappeared , " trichet said on thursday , oct 2 , in a monthly news conference . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : trichet delivered a somber message euro zone inflation has also fallen to 3.6 percent , though it remains well above the ecb 's target of just below 2 percent . trichet said ecb policymakers recognised " the extraordinary high level of uncertainty stemming from latest developments " on turbulent financial markets and the credit crunch .
" economic activity in the euro area is weakening with contracting domestic demand and tighter financing conditions , " he said . european stocks tumble the financial crisis has brought the world to an extraordinary level of uncertainty and governments must respond with equally unprecedented measures , trichet said thursday . " nothing in the past resembles what we are currently seeing , " he told france 24 news channel .
" we are witnessing events that we have not been seen since world war ii . " european stocks fell thursday amid news of bleak us economic data and jitters as the us house of representatives votes on a massive $ 700 billion bailout . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : market turmoil has caused much anguish at stock exchanges in europe around europe , germany 's dax index was down 2.5 percent , uk 's ftse 100 index fell 1.8 percent and france 's cac 40 dropped 2.3 percent . asian markets too took a new hammering amid uncertainty about the next stage of the us package . the bank of japan injected another 1.6 trillion yen -lrb- $ 15 billion , 10.7 billion euros -rrb- into the financial system - its 12th straight daily injection .
eurogroup chief jean-claude juncker called european officials to " put in place a more systematic defense strategy " to protect the 27-nation european union -lrb- eu -rrb- from banking failures , rather than be satisfied " with case by case reactions . " he said the subject would be discussed saturday in paris during a meeting of representatives from britain , france , germany and italy along with european commission president jose manuel barroso , juncker himself , and trichet . germany , france joust over alleged french bailout plan meanwhile , amid calls by the eu commission on wednesday for stronger pan-european cooperation to tackle a raging credit crisis that has lashed banks on the continent , france and germany were at loggerheads over the idea of a us-style bail out for europe . french finance minister christine lagarde told german business daily handelsblatt that a " european safety net " could be needed to prevent a bank in a smaller eu country from going bankrupt . " what happens if a smaller eu state is hit by looming bank collapse ?
maybe this country does not have the means to save the bank .
therefore the question of a european safety net solution comes up , " lagarde told the paper . the comments came ahead of a proposed meeting on the financial crisis by the leaders of europe 's four biggest economies in paris on the weekend .
france currently heads the eu 's rotating presidency . news reports quoted a european official , who did not wish to be named , saying that paris had floated the idea of a 300 billion euro -lrb- $ 440 billion -rrb- rescue fund but lagarde denied the statement from the source in berlin that her government wanted the huge rescue package .
" there is no such a thing , " lagarde told bbc television after being asked about the reported proposal . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel has ruled out issuing " blank checks " to banks whether there is or was ever a french bail-out plan , germany was quick to reject the idea regardless . " germany does not think much of such a plan , " german finance ministry spokesman torsten albig told afp . earlier , chancellor angela merkel said germany " can not and will not issue a blank check for all banks , regardless of whether they behave in a responsible manner or not . " barroso calls for more " credibility " in eu efforts eu commission president jose manuel barroso said wednesday europe needs to " inject credibility " into its efforts to tackle the current financial crisis , as a major us banking bailout hangs in the balance . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : barroso says europe needs more coordinated regulatory measures to tackle the crisis " we are asking and urging member states for closer cooperation .
it is critically important for confidence in the markets , " barroso said . barroso said the existing system of regulation , based largely on national governments and regulators , could cope with the current crisis , but the european union needed to go further in coordinated action to restore full confidence . " we need a further strengthening of the supervision structures at european level , " he told a news conference on wednesday . rebuffing french calls for eu limits on state aid to be suspended or revised in the light of the crisis , barroso said upholding the competition rules was vital , but the commission would apply them flexibly . dw staff -lrb- sp / kjb / nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" with the weakening of demand , upside risks to price stability have diminished somewhat , but they have not disappeared , " trichet said on thursday , oct 2 , in a monthly news conference . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : trichet delivered a somber message euro zone inflation has also fallen to 3.6 percent , though it remains well above the ecb 's target of just below 2 percent . trichet said ecb policymakers recognised " the extraordinary high level of uncertainty stemming from latest developments " on turbulent financial markets and the credit crunch .
" economic activity in the euro area is weakening with contracting domestic demand and tighter financing conditions , " he said . european stocks tumble the financial crisis has brought the world to an extraordinary level of uncertainty and governments must respond with equally unprecedented measures , trichet said thursday . " nothing in the past resembles what we are currently seeing , " he told france 24 news channel .
" we are witnessing events that we have not been seen since world war ii . " european stocks fell thursday amid news of bleak us economic data and jitters as the us house of representatives votes on a massive $ 700 billion bailout . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : market turmoil has caused much anguish at stock exchanges in europe around europe , germany 's dax index was down 2.5 percent , uk 's ftse 100 index fell 1.8 percent and france 's cac 40 dropped 2.3 percent . asian markets too took a new hammering amid uncertainty about the next stage of the us package . the bank of japan injected another 1.6 trillion yen -lrb- $ 15 billion , 10.7 billion euros -rrb- into the financial system - its 12th straight daily injection .
eurogroup chief jean-claude juncker called european officials to " put in place a more systematic defense strategy " to protect the 27-nation european union -lrb- eu -rrb- from banking failures , rather than be satisfied " with case by case reactions . " he said the subject would be discussed saturday in paris during a meeting of representatives from britain , france , germany and italy along with european commission president jose manuel barroso , juncker himself , and trichet . germany , france joust over alleged french bailout plan meanwhile , amid calls by the eu commission on wednesday for stronger pan-european cooperation to tackle a raging credit crisis that has lashed banks on the continent , france and germany were at loggerheads over the idea of a us-style bail out for europe . french finance minister christine lagarde told german business daily handelsblatt that a " european safety net " could be needed to prevent a bank in a smaller eu country from going bankrupt . " what happens if a smaller eu state is hit by looming bank collapse ?
maybe this country does not have the means to save the bank .
therefore the question of a european safety net solution comes up , " lagarde told the paper . the comments came ahead of a proposed meeting on the financial crisis by the leaders of europe 's four biggest economies in paris on the weekend .
france currently heads the eu 's rotating presidency . news reports quoted a european official , who did not wish to be named , saying that paris had floated the idea of a 300 billion euro -lrb- $ 440 billion -rrb- rescue fund but lagarde denied the statement from the source in berlin that her government wanted the huge rescue package .

" germany does not think much of such a plan , " german finance ministry spokesman torsten albig told afp . earlier , chancellor angela merkel said germany " can not and will not issue a blank check for all banks , regardless of whether they behave in a responsible manner or not . " barroso calls for more " credibility " in eu efforts eu commission president jose manuel barroso said wednesday europe needs to " inject credibility " into its efforts to tackle the current financial crisis , as a major us banking bailout hangs in the balance . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : barroso says europe needs more coordinated regulatory measures to tackle the crisis " we are asking and urging member states for closer cooperation .
it is critically important for confidence in the markets , " barroso said . barroso said the existing system of regulation , based largely on national governments and regulators , could cope with the current crisis , but the european union needed to go further in coordinated action to restore full confidence . " we need a further strengthening of the supervision structures at european level , " he told a news conference on wednesday . rebuffing french calls for eu limits on state aid to be suspended or revised in the light of the crisis , barroso said upholding the competition rules was vital , but the commission would apply them flexibly . dw staff -lrb- sp / kjb / nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the somali government was joined in its calls for action by global shipping groups last month which urged the world 's naval powers to do more to stop piracy .
global shipping groups call for action the groups , including the international chamber of shipping , bimco and oil tanker group intercargo , said they were " utterly amazed " governments were unable to secure one of the world 's most important seaways .
they also warned that continued inaction risked causing a repetition of the crisis in the early 1970s when the suez canal was closed and merchant shipping was diverted around the cape of good hope at africa 's southern tip , leading to major consequences for international trade , including higher transport costs and the maintenance of inventories .

the interpretation of what he said had been " politically wrong , " he told reporters .
about 50 nations , including germany , have recognized kosovo as independent , whereas serbia insists kosovo still belongs to it . tadic said belgrade would never recognize its independence , but was making an effort to shift the kosovo issue " from the political corner to the legal corner " by taking it to the international court of justice .
he said it was asking the united nations to refer the matter to the court in the hague .
about 100,000 ethnic serbs live in kosovo and their towns have largely rejected government by pristina .
the tadic visit to berlin was seen as part of the president 's efforts to develop closer ties with the european union .

" with the weakening of demand , upside risks to price stability have diminished somewhat , but they have not disappeared , " trichet said on thursday , oct 2 , in a monthly news conference . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : trichet delivered a somber message euro zone inflation has also fallen to 3.6 percent , though it remains well above the ecb 's target of just below 2 percent . trichet said ecb policymakers recognised " the extraordinary high level of uncertainty stemming from latest developments " on turbulent financial markets and the credit crunch .
" economic activity in the euro area is weakening with contracting domestic demand and tighter financing conditions , " he said . european stocks tumble the financial crisis has brought the world to an extraordinary level of uncertainty and governments must respond with equally unprecedented measures , trichet said thursday . " nothing in the past resembles what we are currently seeing , " he told france 24 news channel .
" we are witnessing events that we have not been seen since world war ii . " european stocks fell thursday amid news of bleak us economic data and jitters as the us house of representatives votes on a massive $ 700 billion bailout . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : market turmoil has caused much anguish at stock exchanges in europe around europe , germany 's dax index was down 2.5 percent , uk 's ftse 100 index fell 1.8 percent and france 's cac 40 dropped 2.3 percent . asian markets too took a new hammering amid uncertainty about the next stage of the us package . the bank of japan injected another 1.6 trillion yen -lrb- $ 15 billion , 10.7 billion euros -rrb- into the financial system - its 12th straight daily injection .
eurogroup chief jean-claude juncker called european officials to " put in place a more systematic defense strategy " to protect the 27-nation european union -lrb- eu -rrb- from banking failures , rather than be satisfied " with case by case reactions . " he said the subject would be discussed saturday in paris during a meeting of representatives from britain , france , germany and italy along with european commission president jose manuel barroso , juncker himself , and trichet . germany , france joust over alleged french bailout plan meanwhile , amid calls by the eu commission on wednesday for stronger pan-european cooperation to tackle a raging credit crisis that has lashed banks on the continent , france and germany were at loggerheads over the idea of a us-style bail out for europe . french finance minister christine lagarde told german business daily handelsblatt that a " european safety net " could be needed to prevent a bank in a smaller eu country from going bankrupt . " what happens if a smaller eu state is hit by looming bank collapse ?
maybe this country does not have the means to save the bank .
therefore the question of a european safety net solution comes up , " lagarde told the paper . the comments came ahead of a proposed meeting on the financial crisis by the leaders of europe 's four biggest economies in paris on the weekend .
france currently heads the eu 's rotating presidency . news reports quoted a european official , who did not wish to be named , saying that paris had floated the idea of a 300 billion euro -lrb- $ 440 billion -rrb- rescue fund but lagarde denied the statement from the source in berlin that her government wanted the huge rescue package .
" there is no such a thing , " lagarde told bbc television after being asked about the reported proposal . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel has ruled out issuing " blank checks " to banks whether there is or was ever a french bail-out plan , germany was quick to reject the idea regardless . " germany does not think much of such a plan , " german finance ministry spokesman torsten albig told afp . earlier , chancellor angela merkel said germany " can not and will not issue a blank check for all banks , regardless of whether they behave in a responsible manner or not . " barroso calls for more " credibility " in eu efforts eu commission president jose manuel barroso said wednesday europe needs to " inject credibility " into its efforts to tackle the current financial crisis , as a major us banking bailout hangs in the balance . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : barroso says europe needs more coordinated regulatory measures to tackle the crisis " we are asking and urging member states for closer cooperation .
it is critically important for confidence in the markets , " barroso said . barroso said the existing system of regulation , based largely on national governments and regulators , could cope with the current crisis , but the european union needed to go further in coordinated action to restore full confidence . " we need a further strengthening of the supervision structures at european level , " he told a news conference on wednesday . rebuffing french calls for eu limits on state aid to be suspended or revised in the light of the crisis , barroso said upholding the competition rules was vital , but the commission would apply them flexibly . dw staff -lrb- sp / kjb / nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

germany would send one frigate , said defense minister franz-josef jung . french defense minister herve morin announced that the anti-piracy security operation could begin as soon as next month in the wake of calls from somali president abdullahi yusuf ahmed for the international community to combat rising piracy off the lawless nation 's waters .
" there is very broad european willingness .
many countries want to take part .
ten have clearly given their accord to take part in such a mission , " morin said wednesday , oct .
1 , at the meeting in the french seaside resort of deauville .
" we have given a mandate -lrb- to eu top brass -rrb- to continue the planning for the launch of this operation in the month of november , " he told reporters .
" we will see what means , nato and european , can be added . "
belgium , cyprus , france , germany , lithuania , the netherlands , spain , sweden and possibly britain would be involved in the task force , morin said .
" we have to coordinate between the ships that are in the zone and those we are going to send , " he said , and added that nato countries , particularly the united states , had vessels in the area .
germany has agreed to provide a frigate for the eu naval task force , which will include three frigates , a supply ship and three maritime surveillance ships , defense minister franz-josef jung said at the meeting .
germany to send frigate to somalia bildunterschrift : germany 's " emden " was deployed off somalia as part of operation enduring freedom " i think it 's necessary to counter pirates effectively , " jung told reporters .
" i support a mission that pushes back piracy , secures the seas and ensures free maritime trade . "
piracy is rife and well organized in the region where somalia 's north-eastern tip juts into the indian ocean , preying on a key maritime route leading to the suez canal .
an estimated 30 percent of the world 's oil passes through the territory .
sixty ships have been seized this year alone and somali pirates are currently holding 13 vessels captive with more than 200 sailors .
the pirates operate high-powered speedboats and are heavily armed , sometimes holding ships for weeks until they are released for large ransoms paid by governments or owners .
the somali government was joined in its calls for action by global shipping groups last month which urged the world 's naval powers to do more to stop piracy .
global shipping groups call for action the groups , including the international chamber of shipping , bimco and oil tanker group intercargo , said they were " utterly amazed " governments were unable to secure one of the world 's most important seaways .
they also warned that continued inaction risked causing a repetition of the crisis in the early 1970s when the suez canal was closed and merchant shipping was diverted around the cape of good hope at africa 's southern tip , leading to major consequences for international trade , including higher transport costs and the maintenance of inventories .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : president yusaf warns of consequences for the world somalia 's president yusaf warned in a speech in the capital mogadishu this week that the pirates represented a risk to the whole world . " they -lrb- pirates -rrb- are imposing an embargo on the somali people and the international community because they are blocking movement between the mediterranean and the indian ocean , which affects not only somalia but the whole world , " yusuf told reporters .
" i call on the somali people to fight against the pirates .
i also call on the international community to act quickly on what is happening in somali waters as well as on shore , " he added .
us navy monitor seized arms ship the pirates who seized a belize-flagged freighter with its 21-man crew and 33 soviet-era t-72 battle tanks on board last thursday say they are under 24-hour surveillance from us ships and helicopters .
" we are prepared for any eventuality , " warned pirate spokesman sugule ali by satellite telephone from the ship .
" we are sticking to the demand for $ 20 million .
this is not ransom , but a fine for unlawfully transporting weapons on somali waters , " ali said .
there are 21 ukrainians , russians and latvians in the crew .
the ship 's captain died of an illness on board , according to russian media .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the " faina " is carrying a consignment of army tanks the bahrain-based us navy fifth fleet said several ships and helicopters were in the area to support the destroyer uss howard as it observed its target , now docked at the somali port village of hobyo .
abdikadir musa yusuf , deputy seaports minister for the somali breakaway region of puntland , said , " there are negotiations going on between the pirates and the foreign ships . "
the pentagon said it wanted a peaceful resolution and us warships were there to make sure pirates do not make off with its military cargo .
" but at this point , what we are most concerned about is seeing a peaceful solution to this problem , " pentagon spokesman geoff morrell said , adding that the us navy was not negotiating with the pirates .
he said the main us concern was " that this cargo does not end up in the hands of anyone who would use it in a way that would be destabilizing to the region .

he said indirectly that europe risked losing political power if it was unable to defend itself .
at the heart of sarkozy 's military agenda is a desire to see europe able to stand alone if need be .
in line with this goal , the defense ministers committed at the meeting to filling key military shortfalls such as a lack of transport aircraft and helicopters , better troop protection and the ability to gather intelligence , including by satellite .

the city was devastated , and there were enormous casualties among civilians and refugees .
historians have argued about just how many people were killed in the firebombing on the night of feb .
13-14 , 1945 , with estimates ranging from 25,000 to 135,000 .
now , a special commission of a dozen experts , including university professors , archivists and military historians have said that after four years of research , the lower figure is more accurate .
so far , they have confirmed 18,000 deaths and say they have found no reason to assume that the final tally will be significantly higher .
their research is to continue until 2009 .
the team is drawing on archival and official documents , burial records and eye witness reports .
they have ruled out one theory suggesting that the death toll was much higher due to an unknown number of casualties among war refugees .
the authorities kept detailed records of all the victims - both german and foreign , the researchers said . dw staff -lrb- dc -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" if the united states has a rescue plan , europe should be ready to offer similar solutions , " he said , as quoted by dow jones newswires .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de auto industry -pipe- 02.10.2008 paris motor show opens amid industry gloom großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the paris show opened thursday for the press , but the public must wait until saturday the largest motor show on earth opened in paris on thursday as the auto industry attempts to convince the world it is moving forward with an eye on the environment as well as on profit margins . the expo convened amid uncertainty in the auto industry as to how the global credit crisis will affect car sales , and as france proposed earlier this week to weaken european union laws on the amount of carbon dioxide -lrb- co2 -rrb- cars should be allowed to emit .
with exponentially rising petrol prices , new environmental legislation and already falling sales figures , most of the major auto makers were keen to show off their latest lines of hybrids , electro-cars and fuel savers at the biennial mondial de paris car show .
over 360 marquees from 25 countries are represented at the car expo , which attracted some 1.43 million people at the last show in 2006 .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the bugatti veyron 16.4 grand is on display in paris out for public display at this year 's event will be 90 new models and new green technologies from automakers such as toyota , honda , nissan , general motors , peugeot and citroen .
credit crisis to crunch auto sales but behind the veneer and marketing hype , auto executives are worried about what lies ahead for the industry , with fears the latest credit crunch could hit car sales significantly over the next two to three years .
predictions are already dire .
economic forecaster global insight predicts the usually strong selling month of september could see a double-digit decline in sales figures .
" car sales across western europe will slump in september as consumer confidence evaporates in the face of the financial crisis , tougher credit restrictions and inflationary pressures elsewhere , " global insight said in a report published on its web site wednesday .
the forecaster said the once-generous financing deals used by dealerships to tempt buyers into their lots have effectively been dried up by the credit crisis .
" the problem stems from in-house financing divisions ' ability to offer loans and lease deals .
as the credit crisis has all but frozen inter-bank lending , the ability to package and re-sell the resultant consumer loans has left the system paralyzed , " it said .
france seeks more co2 leeway environmental groups on wednesday reacted with outrage to the french proposal to weaken planned european union laws on co2 car emissions .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : french president nicolas sarkozy 's government 's counter-proposal will ease the burden for carmakers on thursday the european parliament 's environment committee voted through a version of a law originally proposed by the eu 's executive , the european commission , demanding that cars sold in the eu emit no more than 120 grams of co2 per kilometer -lrb- g / km -rrb- by 2012 .
penalties for non-compliance should rise to 95 euros -lrb- $ 135.80 -rrb- per g / km for each car sold over the limit by 2015 , and the eu should bring in a target of at least 95 g / km by 2020 , the committee said .
but the french government 's proposal calls for a fine of no more than 80 euros per g / km over the limit and a long-range target " in the range 95-110 g / km . "
moreover , it declares that the law should only apply to the most efficient 60 percent of europe 's new auto fleet when it comes into force in 2012 , with the least efficient cars only coming into the system in 2015 .
the proposal , which would need the backing of the eu 's member states and the european parliament , is now likely to set up a heated political battle as lobbyists on both sides push for a deal before the parliament 's next plenary session on oct .
20-23 .

" the russian reaction in this conflict -lrb- the russo-georgian war -rrb- we consider to be disproportionate and we said -lrb- to the russians -rrb- , that we now need to build trust , " merkel said .
a key first step would be withdrawal of all russian troops from georgian territory by oct .
10 in line with a european union- brokered ceasefire between moscow and tbilisi , she said . medvedev , in his opening remarks , anticipated merkel 's criticism , calling georgia 's august attack on the renegade province of south ossetia " aggressive nationalism , " and international claims russia was the attacker in the conflict " dishonest propaganda . " the world , despite worsening relations between moscow and nato nations over georgia , would nonetheless never see a new cold war , medvedev claimed , " because there are no reasons for it . " russia and germany have " differing views on this matter -lrb- the caucasus situation -rrb- , " merkel said . western nations and russia need to engage each other in a series of " preventative talks " to forestall future conflicts , and to prepare the ground for cooperation , she said . russo-european coordination over the role of military observers deployed to georgia from the organization of security and cooperation in europe -lrb- osce -rrb- is one of the first topics requiring greater mutual understanding , merkel said . eu monitors deploy russian combat forces on wednesday delayed and in some places restricted the movement of osce observers through a buffer zone in south osseia , despite european claims the observers should be allowed to travel unhindered . merkel named as other areas of disagreement requiring further discussion the renegade moldovan province transnistria , kosovo , and bosnia-herzogovina - all european territories over whose future status russia and nato nations sharply disagree . medvedev called for more clarity and direct talk between russia and the west , saying what was needed was " the voice of truth stated loudly . " " we have to accept the mutual dependance of countries and nations in the modern world , " medvedev said .
" this interdependence does not only apply to economies , but the spheres of science , technology , culture , and education . " " we need to go forwards , and not focus on the past , " medvedev said . dpa news agency -lrb- dc -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de regulation -pipe- 02.10.2008 landmark assisted suicide case begins in uk großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : assisted suicide is a hot button issue in many european countries in a case which could affect the european convention on human rights , a woman with multiple sclerosis has launched a bid in london 's high court to clarify the law on assisted suicide . debbie purdy , 45 , wants assurance that her husband can not be prosecuted for helping her travel to switzerland to end her life at some stage in the future .
the law in england and wales states that assisted suicide is a crime punishable with a maximum sentence of 14 years in prison .
purdy fears that her husband , a cuban national , would be treated more harshly were he to accompany her .
she said that if her husband is liable for prosecution , she would travel abroad alone while she is healthy enough to do so - but before she is ready to die .
" i enjoy my life and the people around me , and i do n't want to die until my condition becomes unbearable .
if the law is not clarified , i may be forced to travel abroad alone before i am ready , " she said in a statement .
" i just want clarity so i know whether or not my husband omar will be prosecuted or questioned by the police if i decide to travel abroad and he accompanies me . "
purdy has said she is considering traveling to a clinic run by the swiss right-to-die organization , dignitas .
since 1992 , almost 100 british citizens have ended their lives at the dignitas clinic without their relatives being prosecuted .
purdy and the organization dignity in dying say they want to know if a decision has been made not to prosecute relatives .
in june , two top judges in britain allowed purdy to bring a full judicial review in the case , which her lawyer says may fall within the scope of the european convention on human rights .
the hearing is set to last for two days , and judgment is likely to be reserved until a later date .
hot button issue in germany advocates on both sides of the euthanasia debate in germany will be watching with interest to see how the director of public prosecutions -lrb- dpp -rrb- responds to purdy 's case , as in recent months , assisted suicide has again become a hot button issue .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : former state senator for justice roger kusch presents a video to journalists about the medically assisted suicide of bettina schardt in wuerzburg in july , former hamburg justice senator and right-to-die campaigner roger kusch , said he had assisted a 79-year-old woman who committed suicide despite the fact that she had no life-threatening disease or great amount of pain .
his participation in her death was strongly condemned by german chancellor angela merkel , who stressed that her christian democratic union -lrb- cdu -rrb- opposed any form of assisted suicide .
bavaria and four other german states are pushing for new laws to ban commercial ventures that help people kill themselves .
many in germany want to prevent the country from following in switzerland 's footsteps .
opponents to assisted suicide say that liberal swiss laws on euthanasia have led to a bustling trade in assisted suicide with the help of organizations like dignitas . dw staff -lrb- dc -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the law in england and wales states that assisted suicide is a crime punishable with a maximum sentence of 14 years in prison .

she said that if her husband is liable for prosecution , she would travel abroad alone while she is healthy enough to do so - but before she is ready to die .
" i enjoy my life and the people around me , and i do n't want to die until my condition becomes unbearable .
if the law is not clarified , i may be forced to travel abroad alone before i am ready , " she said in a statement .
" i just want clarity so i know whether or not my husband omar will be prosecuted or questioned by the police if i decide to travel abroad and he accompanies me . "
purdy has said she is considering traveling to a clinic run by the swiss right-to-die organization , dignitas .
since 1992 , almost 100 british citizens have ended their lives at the dignitas clinic without their relatives being prosecuted .

in june , two top judges in britain allowed purdy to bring a full judicial review in the case , which her lawyer says may fall within the scope of the european convention on human rights .

the law in england and wales states that assisted suicide is a crime punishable with a maximum sentence of 14 years in prison .
purdy fears that her husband , a cuban national , would be treated more harshly were he to accompany her .
she said that if her husband is liable for prosecution , she would travel abroad alone while she is healthy enough to do so - but before she is ready to die .
" i enjoy my life and the people around me , and i do n't want to die until my condition becomes unbearable .
if the law is not clarified , i may be forced to travel abroad alone before i am ready , " she said in a statement .
" i just want clarity so i know whether or not my husband omar will be prosecuted or questioned by the police if i decide to travel abroad and he accompanies me . "
purdy has said she is considering traveling to a clinic run by the swiss right-to-die organization , dignitas .
since 1992 , almost 100 british citizens have ended their lives at the dignitas clinic without their relatives being prosecuted .
purdy and the organization dignity in dying say they want to know if a decision has been made not to prosecute relatives .
in june , two top judges in britain allowed purdy to bring a full judicial review in the case , which her lawyer says may fall within the scope of the european convention on human rights .
the hearing is set to last for two days , and judgment is likely to be reserved until a later date .
hot button issue in germany advocates on both sides of the euthanasia debate in germany will be watching with interest to see how the director of public prosecutions -lrb- dpp -rrb- responds to purdy 's case , as in recent months , assisted suicide has again become a hot button issue .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : former state senator for justice roger kusch presents a video to journalists about the medically assisted suicide of bettina schardt in wuerzburg in july , former hamburg justice senator and right-to-die campaigner roger kusch , said he had assisted a 79-year-old woman who committed suicide despite the fact that she had no life-threatening disease or great amount of pain .
his participation in her death was strongly condemned by german chancellor angela merkel , who stressed that her christian democratic union -lrb- cdu -rrb- opposed any form of assisted suicide .
bavaria and four other german states are pushing for new laws to ban commercial ventures that help people kill themselves .
many in germany want to prevent the country from following in switzerland 's footsteps .
opponents to assisted suicide say that liberal swiss laws on euthanasia have led to a bustling trade in assisted suicide with the help of organizations like dignitas . dw staff -lrb- dc -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de asia -pipe- 02.10.2008 us senate passes nuclear deal with india großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : india provoked outrage worldwide in 1998 when it conducted nuclear tests - critics of the 123 agreement fear it will now be able to conduct atomic weapons tests with impunity with 86 “ yeas ” to 13 “ nays ” , the us senate endorsed a landmark 123 nuclear agreement between the united states and india on wednesday , thus removing the final legislative hurdle to resuming civilian nuclear trade between the two countries .
us secretary of state condoleeza rice is expected to go to india later this week to sign the agreement with her indian counterpart pranab mukherjee . for the first time in over 30 years , american businesses will now be able to sell nuclear fuel , technology and reactors to nuclear-armed india .
in return , india will allow un inspections of some of its civilian nuclear facilities .
in 1974 , the south asian nation provoked the world ’ s ire when it tested an underground nuclear weapon .
us president bush welcomed the senate ’ s decision and said he “ looked forward to signing the bill into law ” .
the republican senator richard lugar was also jubilant about the decision : “ this is an opportunity for the united states and india to come together in a way that is historically important for the world . ”
a victory achieved at lightning speed in india , leaders from the ruling united progressive alliance also hailed the deal saying it was “ a victory for prime minister manmohan singh ’ s government ” .
abishek manu singhvi , the spokesman for the congress party , marvelled at the “ lightning speed ” through which india had “ passed through all the tests - through the iaea -lsb- international atomic energy agency -rsb- , the house of representatives and senate .
ultimately , it ’ s a tribute and a compliment to india ’ s standing in the world . ”
india ’ s “ standing in the world ” was also complimented when , earlier this week , singh signed a similar landmark civilian nuclear deal with french president nicolas sarkozy , whilst on a state visit to france .
france is the second producer of nuclear energy in the world after the united states .
these deals with the us and france will bring india a long way further to meeting its soaring energy needs , say observers .
coming back to india from his trips to the us and europe earlier this week , prime minister singh explained how important the civilian nuclear deal was : “ it protects all the essential interests of our country , it protects our strategic programme , it opens up new options , while india manages its energy situation and it ’ s a part of our quest for policies which will widen our development options . ”
“ surrender to us imperialism ” but in india , leaders of the opposition are not so sure about this .
their reaction on thursday was that the government had surrendered to “ us imperialism ” and that the agreement violated india ’ s “ sovereignty and nuclear independence ” .
in the us , critics feared that the deal would allow india to resume atomic weapons testing with impunity , making it a de facto nuclear state without having signed the international nuclear non-proliferation treaty .
“ this is virtually an invitation to india to resume nuclear testing secure in the knowledge that a resumption of testing would not nullify this new nuclear trade agreement .
i believe this to be a grave mistake , ” said democrat senator tom harkin .

us secretary of state condoleeza rice is expected to go to india later this week to sign the agreement with her indian counterpart pranab mukherjee . for the first time in over 30 years , american businesses will now be able to sell nuclear fuel , technology and reactors to nuclear-armed india .
in return , india will allow un inspections of some of its civilian nuclear facilities .
in 1974 , the south asian nation provoked the world ’ s ire when it tested an underground nuclear weapon .
us president bush welcomed the senate ’ s decision and said he “ looked forward to signing the bill into law ” .
the republican senator richard lugar was also jubilant about the decision : “ this is an opportunity for the united states and india to come together in a way that is historically important for the world . ”
a victory achieved at lightning speed in india , leaders from the ruling united progressive alliance also hailed the deal saying it was “ a victory for prime minister manmohan singh ’ s government ” .
abishek manu singhvi , the spokesman for the congress party , marvelled at the “ lightning speed ” through which india had “ passed through all the tests - through the iaea -lsb- international atomic energy agency -rsb- , the house of representatives and senate .
ultimately , it ’ s a tribute and a compliment to india ’ s standing in the world . ”
india ’ s “ standing in the world ” was also complimented when , earlier this week , singh signed a similar landmark civilian nuclear deal with french president nicolas sarkozy , whilst on a state visit to france .
france is the second producer of nuclear energy in the world after the united states .
these deals with the us and france will bring india a long way further to meeting its soaring energy needs , say observers .
coming back to india from his trips to the us and europe earlier this week , prime minister singh explained how important the civilian nuclear deal was : “ it protects all the essential interests of our country , it protects our strategic programme , it opens up new options , while india manages its energy situation and it ’ s a part of our quest for policies which will widen our development options . ”
“ surrender to us imperialism ” but in india , leaders of the opposition are not so sure about this .
their reaction on thursday was that the government had surrendered to “ us imperialism ” and that the agreement violated india ’ s “ sovereignty and nuclear independence ” .
in the us , critics feared that the deal would allow india to resume atomic weapons testing with impunity , making it a de facto nuclear state without having signed the international nuclear non-proliferation treaty .
“ this is virtually an invitation to india to resume nuclear testing secure in the knowledge that a resumption of testing would not nullify this new nuclear trade agreement .
i believe this to be a grave mistake , ” said democrat senator tom harkin .
india says it has a sovereign right to conduct nuclear weapons tests .
this is a claim which has always worried neighbouring rival pakistan , which wants a similar deal with the us .
on thursday , pakistani prime minister yousuf raza gilani said islamabad would make efforts to develop civilian nuclear technology and that the us would have to “ accommodate ” these efforts . dw staff -lrb- act -rrb- 02/10/08 send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic 9801 pakistan floods in pakistan click here to find out more about pakistan 's flood situation and relief work .

abishek manu singhvi , the spokesman for the congress party , marvelled at the “ lightning speed ” through which india had “ passed through all the tests - through the iaea -lsb- international atomic energy agency -rsb- , the house of representatives and senate .
ultimately , it ’ s a tribute and a compliment to india ’ s standing in the world . ”
india ’ s “ standing in the world ” was also complimented when , earlier this week , singh signed a similar landmark civilian nuclear deal with french president nicolas sarkozy , whilst on a state visit to france .
france is the second producer of nuclear energy in the world after the united states .
these deals with the us and france will bring india a long way further to meeting its soaring energy needs , say observers .
coming back to india from his trips to the us and europe earlier this week , prime minister singh explained how important the civilian nuclear deal was : “ it protects all the essential interests of our country , it protects our strategic programme , it opens up new options , while india manages its energy situation and it ’ s a part of our quest for policies which will widen our development options . ”
“ surrender to us imperialism ” but in india , leaders of the opposition are not so sure about this .
their reaction on thursday was that the government had surrendered to “ us imperialism ” and that the agreement violated india ’ s “ sovereignty and nuclear independence ” .
in the us , critics feared that the deal would allow india to resume atomic weapons testing with impunity , making it a de facto nuclear state without having signed the international nuclear non-proliferation treaty .
“ this is virtually an invitation to india to resume nuclear testing secure in the knowledge that a resumption of testing would not nullify this new nuclear trade agreement .
i believe this to be a grave mistake , ” said democrat senator tom harkin .
india says it has a sovereign right to conduct nuclear weapons tests .
this is a claim which has always worried neighbouring rival pakistan , which wants a similar deal with the us .
on thursday , pakistani prime minister yousuf raza gilani said islamabad would make efforts to develop civilian nuclear technology and that the us would have to “ accommodate ” these efforts . dw staff -lrb- act -rrb- 02/10/08 send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic 9801 global media forum human rights in a globalized world - challenges for the media thai election one year after the bloody crackdown in bangkok , a lot of questions remain unanswered .

" if the united states has a rescue plan , europe should be ready to offer similar solutions , " he said , as quoted by dow jones newswires .
but peter struck , head of the german social democratic party 's parliamentary group , castigated the head of germany 's largest bank for his comments , saying he " felt contempt " for the " type of opportunism " shown by ackermann .
" as long as the banks were on course for making profits , mr. ackermann was the one screaming loudest that the state shouldn ’ t get involved , " struck told news agency dpa , adding that ackermann 's tune has changed now that profits are threatened by the credit crisis .
struck said that attitude made it particularly irksome that the head of germany ’ s leading bank is " now the first to call for massive aid from taxpayer funds " to help prop up crumbling financial institutions .
no bailout for europe bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german chancellor angela merkel has strongly opposed any europe-wide bailout strategy complementing struck 's talk down of ackermann were comments made by chancellor angela merkel , who said : " the alliance will not issue any blank checks to banks , whether they behave responsibly or not . "
merkel said she favoured " better protection and early warning systems " over a bailout package , insisting european banking regulations needed upgrading .
" it can not be that … in finance markets , several billion products exist to which no sufficient rules count , " she said .
at a european level , there also seems to be distaste for a financial bailout package with jean-claude juncker , chairman of the group of countries that share the euro , insisting thursday that no consideration was being given to a gigantic euro bailout .
" i do not see the necessity for such a program in europe , " he said , pleading for more intensive regulation of the finance sector . dw staff -lrb- dm -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" the russian reaction in this conflict -lrb- the russo-georgian war -rrb- we consider to be disproportionate and we said -lrb- to the russians -rrb- , that we now need to build trust , " merkel said .
a key first step would be withdrawal of all russian troops from georgian territory by oct .

" the world , despite worsening relations between moscow and nato nations over georgia , would nonetheless never see a new cold war , medvedev claimed , " because there are no reasons for it . " russia and germany have " differing views on this matter -lrb- the caucasus situation -rrb- , " merkel said . western nations and russia need to engage each other in a series of " preventative talks " to forestall future conflicts , and to prepare the ground for cooperation , she said . russo-european coordination over the role of military observers deployed to georgia from the organization of security and cooperation in europe -lrb- osce -rrb- is one of the first topics requiring greater mutual understanding , merkel said . eu monitors deploy russian combat forces on wednesday delayed and in some places restricted the movement of osce observers through a buffer zone in south osseia , despite european claims the observers should be allowed to travel unhindered . merkel named as other areas of disagreement requiring further discussion the renegade moldovan province transnistria , kosovo , and bosnia-herzogovina - all european territories over whose future status russia and nato nations sharply disagree . medvedev called for more clarity and direct talk between russia and the west , saying what was needed was " the voice of truth stated loudly . " " we have to accept the mutual dependance of countries and nations in the modern world , " medvedev said .

" if we are talking about a european defence industry , we must accept the idea that not everybody is doing the same thing as everybody else , " morin said .
" for example , we could do some work in france and other work elsewhere , and then pool together . "
french president nicolas sarkozy , whose country holds the rotating eu presidency , said wednesday that europe lacked the " appropriate measures to enact its defense policies . "
he said indirectly that europe risked losing political power if it was unable to defend itself .
at the heart of sarkozy 's military agenda is a desire to see europe able to stand alone if need be .
in line with this goal , the defense ministers committed at the meeting to filling key military shortfalls such as a lack of transport aircraft and helicopters , better troop protection and the ability to gather intelligence , including by satellite .
the key decisions made at the deauville meeting are to be finalized in brussels on nov .

integrated european defense manufacturing bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : production of the airbus a400m has been delayed by up to two years but there was growing evidence in deauville that eu leaders were warming to the idea that more could be done together , particularly at a time of economic slowdown .
one such example of cooperation is that concerning the a400m military transport aircraft , the components of which are being built by airbus in six countries : belgium - flaps - britain - flaps and outer wing box - france - nose fuselage and rudder - germany - fuselage - spain - tail - and turkey - ailerons and spoilers .
production has fallen behind , however , and delivery of the a400m 's may take two years longer than originally scheduled , according to reports .
military erasmus a majority of eu countries also backed french plans for an exchange program involving young military officers .
inspired by the erasmus student exchange program , it would see officers from one member state spend some time training in another european country .
the project aims to increase cooperation between military colleges in order to improve interoperability and mould a common european defence culture , morin said .
however , some ministers expressed concern that such a program could turn into a one-way travelling system , whereby officers from poorer member states would want to spend time in some of europe 's best colleges , and fewer officers from richer states would be willing to train in countries such as romania or bulgaria . dpa news agency -lrb- dm -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the law in england and wales states that assisted suicide is a crime punishable with a maximum sentence of 14 years in prison .

she said that if her husband is liable for prosecution , she would travel abroad alone while she is healthy enough to do so - but before she is ready to die .
" i enjoy my life and the people around me , and i do n't want to die until my condition becomes unbearable .

purdy has said she is considering traveling to a clinic run by the swiss right-to-die organization , dignitas .

japanese-owned sony is the world 's second-biggest recording company .
bertelsmann said sony had paid the purchase price for its 50-percent stake and that the takeover had cleared all anti-trust hurdles and was finalized wednesday .
sources said sony paid less than 1 billion euros to buy out bertelsmann .
smei is expected to have annual revenues of 3 billion euros -lrb- $ 4 billion -rrb- and to employ a staff of around 6,000 .
bertelsmann , based in guetersloh , germany , said it would keep the bmg brand and gear its remaining music business to music rights management , representing artists and authors mainly in europe .
bmg rights management would retain " selected european music catalogues " with the work of more than 200 artists which had been managed by the joint venture with sony .

" if we are talking about a european defence industry , we must accept the idea that not everybody is doing the same thing as everybody else , " morin said .
" for example , we could do some work in france and other work elsewhere , and then pool together . "
french president nicolas sarkozy , whose country holds the rotating eu presidency , said wednesday that europe lacked the " appropriate measures to enact its defense policies . "
he said indirectly that europe risked losing political power if it was unable to defend itself .
at the heart of sarkozy 's military agenda is a desire to see europe able to stand alone if need be .
in line with this goal , the defense ministers committed at the meeting to filling key military shortfalls such as a lack of transport aircraft and helicopters , better troop protection and the ability to gather intelligence , including by satellite .
the key decisions made at the deauville meeting are to be finalized in brussels on nov .

" if the united states has a rescue plan , europe should be ready to offer similar solutions , " he said , as quoted by dow jones newswires .
but peter struck , head of the german social democratic party 's parliamentary group , castigated the head of germany 's largest bank for his comments , saying he " felt contempt " for the " type of opportunism " shown by ackermann .
" as long as the banks were on course for making profits , mr. ackermann was the one screaming loudest that the state shouldn ’ t get involved , " struck told news agency dpa , adding that ackermann 's tune has changed now that profits are threatened by the credit crisis .
struck said that attitude made it particularly irksome that the head of germany ’ s leading bank is " now the first to call for massive aid from taxpayer funds " to help prop up crumbling financial institutions .
no bailout for europe bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german chancellor angela merkel has strongly opposed any europe-wide bailout strategy complementing struck 's talk down of ackermann were comments made by chancellor angela merkel , who said : " the alliance will not issue any blank checks to banks , whether they behave responsibly or not . "
merkel said she favoured " better protection and early warning systems " over a bailout package , insisting european banking regulations needed upgrading .
" it can not be that … in finance markets , several billion products exist to which no sufficient rules count , " she said .
at a european level , there also seems to be distaste for a financial bailout package with jean-claude juncker , chairman of the group of countries that share the euro , insisting thursday that no consideration was being given to a gigantic euro bailout .
" i do not see the necessity for such a program in europe , " he said , pleading for more intensive regulation of the finance sector . dw staff -lrb- dm -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

with exponentially rising petrol prices , new environmental legislation and already falling sales figures , most of the major auto makers were keen to show off their latest lines of hybrids , electro-cars and fuel savers at the biennial mondial de paris car show .
over 360 marquees from 25 countries are represented at the car expo , which attracted some 1.43 million people at the last show in 2006 .

credit crisis to crunch auto sales but behind the veneer and marketing hype , auto executives are worried about what lies ahead for the industry , with fears the latest credit crunch could hit car sales significantly over the next two to three years .
predictions are already dire .
economic forecaster global insight predicts the usually strong selling month of september could see a double-digit decline in sales figures .
" car sales across western europe will slump in september as consumer confidence evaporates in the face of the financial crisis , tougher credit restrictions and inflationary pressures elsewhere , " global insight said in a report published on its web site wednesday .
the forecaster said the once-generous financing deals used by dealerships to tempt buyers into their lots have effectively been dried up by the credit crisis .
" the problem stems from in-house financing divisions ' ability to offer loans and lease deals .
as the credit crisis has all but frozen inter-bank lending , the ability to package and re-sell the resultant consumer loans has left the system paralyzed , " it said .
france seeks more co2 leeway environmental groups on wednesday reacted with outrage to the french proposal to weaken planned european union laws on co2 car emissions .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : french president nicolas sarkozy 's government 's counter-proposal will ease the burden for carmakers on thursday the european parliament 's environment committee voted through a version of a law originally proposed by the eu 's executive , the european commission , demanding that cars sold in the eu emit no more than 120 grams of co2 per kilometer -lrb- g / km -rrb- by 2012 .
penalties for non-compliance should rise to 95 euros -lrb- $ 135.80 -rrb- per g / km for each car sold over the limit by 2015 , and the eu should bring in a target of at least 95 g / km by 2020 , the committee said .
but the french government 's proposal calls for a fine of no more than 80 euros per g / km over the limit and a long-range target " in the range 95-110 g / km . "
moreover , it declares that the law should only apply to the most efficient 60 percent of europe 's new auto fleet when it comes into force in 2012 , with the least efficient cars only coming into the system in 2015 .
the proposal , which would need the backing of the eu 's member states and the european parliament , is now likely to set up a heated political battle as lobbyists on both sides push for a deal before the parliament 's next plenary session on oct .
20-23 .
green groups angered the french government , which currently holds the eu 's rotating presidency , " is giving up any pretence of trying to limit the climate impact of cars , " greenpeace said in a statement wednesday .

" if we are talking about a european defence industry , we must accept the idea that not everybody is doing the same thing as everybody else , " morin said .
" for example , we could do some work in france and other work elsewhere , and then pool together . "
french president nicolas sarkozy , whose country holds the rotating eu presidency , said wednesday that europe lacked the " appropriate measures to enact its defense policies . "
he said indirectly that europe risked losing political power if it was unable to defend itself .
at the heart of sarkozy 's military agenda is a desire to see europe able to stand alone if need be .
in line with this goal , the defense ministers committed at the meeting to filling key military shortfalls such as a lack of transport aircraft and helicopters , better troop protection and the ability to gather intelligence , including by satellite .
the key decisions made at the deauville meeting are to be finalized in brussels on nov .

" the russian reaction in this conflict -lrb- the russo-georgian war -rrb- we consider to be disproportionate and we said -lrb- to the russians -rrb- , that we now need to build trust , " merkel said .
a key first step would be withdrawal of all russian troops from georgian territory by oct .
10 in line with a european union- brokered ceasefire between moscow and tbilisi , she said . medvedev , in his opening remarks , anticipated merkel 's criticism , calling georgia 's august attack on the renegade province of south ossetia " aggressive nationalism , " and international claims russia was the attacker in the conflict " dishonest propaganda . " the world , despite worsening relations between moscow and nato nations over georgia , would nonetheless never see a new cold war , medvedev claimed , " because there are no reasons for it . " russia and germany have " differing views on this matter -lrb- the caucasus situation -rrb- , " merkel said . western nations and russia need to engage each other in a series of " preventative talks " to forestall future conflicts , and to prepare the ground for cooperation , she said . russo-european coordination over the role of military observers deployed to georgia from the organization of security and cooperation in europe -lrb- osce -rrb- is one of the first topics requiring greater mutual understanding , merkel said . eu monitors deploy russian combat forces on wednesday delayed and in some places restricted the movement of osce observers through a buffer zone in south osseia , despite european claims the observers should be allowed to travel unhindered . merkel named as other areas of disagreement requiring further discussion the renegade moldovan province transnistria , kosovo , and bosnia-herzogovina - all european territories over whose future status russia and nato nations sharply disagree . medvedev called for more clarity and direct talk between russia and the west , saying what was needed was " the voice of truth stated loudly . " " we have to accept the mutual dependance of countries and nations in the modern world , " medvedev said .
" this interdependence does not only apply to economies , but the spheres of science , technology , culture , and education .

the law in england and wales states that assisted suicide is a crime punishable with a maximum sentence of 14 years in prison .
purdy fears that her husband , a cuban national , would be treated more harshly were he to accompany her .
she said that if her husband is liable for prosecution , she would travel abroad alone while she is healthy enough to do so - but before she is ready to die .
" i enjoy my life and the people around me , and i do n't want to die until my condition becomes unbearable .
if the law is not clarified , i may be forced to travel abroad alone before i am ready , " she said in a statement .
" i just want clarity so i know whether or not my husband omar will be prosecuted or questioned by the police if i decide to travel abroad and he accompanies me . "
purdy has said she is considering traveling to a clinic run by the swiss right-to-die organization , dignitas .
since 1992 , almost 100 british citizens have ended their lives at the dignitas clinic without their relatives being prosecuted .
purdy and the organization dignity in dying say they want to know if a decision has been made not to prosecute relatives .
in june , two top judges in britain allowed purdy to bring a full judicial review in the case , which her lawyer says may fall within the scope of the european convention on human rights .
the hearing is set to last for two days , and judgment is likely to be reserved until a later date .
hot button issue in germany advocates on both sides of the euthanasia debate in germany will be watching with interest to see how the director of public prosecutions -lrb- dpp -rrb- responds to purdy 's case , as in recent months , assisted suicide has again become a hot button issue .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : former state senator for justice roger kusch presents a video to journalists about the medically assisted suicide of bettina schardt in wuerzburg in july , former hamburg justice senator and right-to-die campaigner roger kusch , said he had assisted a 79-year-old woman who committed suicide despite the fact that she had no life-threatening disease or great amount of pain .
his participation in her death was strongly condemned by german chancellor angela merkel , who stressed that her christian democratic union -lrb- cdu -rrb- opposed any form of assisted suicide .
bavaria and four other german states are pushing for new laws to ban commercial ventures that help people kill themselves .
many in germany want to prevent the country from following in switzerland 's footsteps .
opponents to assisted suicide say that liberal swiss laws on euthanasia have led to a bustling trade in assisted suicide with the help of organizations like dignitas . dw staff -lrb- dc -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

us secretary of state condoleeza rice is expected to go to india later this week to sign the agreement with her indian counterpart pranab mukherjee . for the first time in over 30 years , american businesses will now be able to sell nuclear fuel , technology and reactors to nuclear-armed india .
in return , india will allow un inspections of some of its civilian nuclear facilities .
in 1974 , the south asian nation provoked the world ’ s ire when it tested an underground nuclear weapon .
us president bush welcomed the senate ’ s decision and said he “ looked forward to signing the bill into law ” .
the republican senator richard lugar was also jubilant about the decision : “ this is an opportunity for the united states and india to come together in a way that is historically important for the world . ”
a victory achieved at lightning speed in india , leaders from the ruling united progressive alliance also hailed the deal saying it was “ a victory for prime minister manmohan singh ’ s government ” .
abishek manu singhvi , the spokesman for the congress party , marvelled at the “ lightning speed ” through which india had “ passed through all the tests - through the iaea -lsb- international atomic energy agency -rsb- , the house of representatives and senate .

merkel had joined a host of western critics who said the war had made normal dealings with russia impossible , and called for ties to be reviewed .
still , she has backed a deal negotiated by french president nicolas sarkozy , under which russia agreed to pull out of undisputed georgian territories by oct .
10 once eu monitors had been deployed in the region .
and despite her condemnation of russia 's actions in georgia , she has distinguished herself among her eu counterparts by insisting the lines of communication with moscow remain open .
thursday 's talks with medvedev are expected to touch on the eu monitoring mission in " buffer zones " around south ossetia and fellow rebel enclave abkhazia .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany and russia have enjoyed close relations in the past but according to kremlin sources , the russian leader is also expected to show that his country has not been isolated in europe by focusing on developing further political and economic ties , including the ambitious north stream project - a gas pipeline to deliver gas from siberia to europe beneath the baltic sea .
germany is russia 's single biggest trading partner with bilateral turnover set to reach 43 billion euros -lrb- $ 60 billion -rrb- this year .
some 4,600 german firms have subsidiaries in russia and every fourth machine imported by russia is made in germany .
" the meeting is aimed at confirming the stability and maturity of the russian-german partnership free from political fluctuations , " a kremlin source told reporters ahead of the forum .
council of europe keeps dialogue open russia still could face consequences in europe for its actions in august during the conflict with georgia .
on wednesday , secretary general of the council of europe terry davis said the organization would examine allegations of human rights violations during the war .
the european court of human rights in strasbourg had received " more than 1,700 complaints " from the region , he added .
court officials told news agency afp that the vast majority of the complaints had been made by south ossetians against georgia .
diplomats in strasbourg added that it was possible the complaints were part of an orchestrated campaign against tbilisi .
however , the council of europe , which is not related to the european union , voted against withdrawing russia 's voting rights after a request to do so by two dozen members .
swiss member andreas gross said the vote signified willingness to maintain " dialogue between us and the two countries . "
a council report published on monday found both moscow and tbilisi were responsible for the conflict 's escalation into " open and fully-fledged warfare . " dw staff -lrb- dc -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

germany would send one frigate , said defense minister franz-josef jung . french defense minister herve morin announced that the anti-piracy security operation could begin as soon as next month in the wake of calls from somali president abdullahi yusuf ahmed for the international community to combat rising piracy off the lawless nation 's waters .
" there is very broad european willingness .
many countries want to take part .
ten have clearly given their accord to take part in such a mission , " morin said wednesday , oct .
1 , at the meeting in the french seaside resort of deauville .
" we have given a mandate -lrb- to eu top brass -rrb- to continue the planning for the launch of this operation in the month of november , " he told reporters .
" we will see what means , nato and european , can be added . "
belgium , cyprus , france , germany , lithuania , the netherlands , spain , sweden and possibly britain would be involved in the task force , morin said .
" we have to coordinate between the ships that are in the zone and those we are going to send , " he said , and added that nato countries , particularly the united states , had vessels in the area .
germany has agreed to provide a frigate for the eu naval task force , which will include three frigates , a supply ship and three maritime surveillance ships , defense minister franz-josef jung said at the meeting .
germany to send frigate to somalia bildunterschrift : germany 's " emden " was deployed off somalia as part of operation enduring freedom " i think it 's necessary to counter pirates effectively , " jung told reporters .
" i support a mission that pushes back piracy , secures the seas and ensures free maritime trade . "
piracy is rife and well organized in the region where somalia 's north-eastern tip juts into the indian ocean , preying on a key maritime route leading to the suez canal .
an estimated 30 percent of the world 's oil passes through the territory .
sixty ships have been seized this year alone and somali pirates are currently holding 13 vessels captive with more than 200 sailors .
the pirates operate high-powered speedboats and are heavily armed , sometimes holding ships for weeks until they are released for large ransoms paid by governments or owners .
the somali government was joined in its calls for action by global shipping groups last month which urged the world 's naval powers to do more to stop piracy .
global shipping groups call for action the groups , including the international chamber of shipping , bimco and oil tanker group intercargo , said they were " utterly amazed " governments were unable to secure one of the world 's most important seaways .
they also warned that continued inaction risked causing a repetition of the crisis in the early 1970s when the suez canal was closed and merchant shipping was diverted around the cape of good hope at africa 's southern tip , leading to major consequences for international trade , including higher transport costs and the maintenance of inventories .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : president yusaf warns of consequences for the world somalia 's president yusaf warned in a speech in the capital mogadishu this week that the pirates represented a risk to the whole world . " they -lrb- pirates -rrb- are imposing an embargo on the somali people and the international community because they are blocking movement between the mediterranean and the indian ocean , which affects not only somalia but the whole world , " yusuf told reporters .
" i call on the somali people to fight against the pirates .
i also call on the international community to act quickly on what is happening in somali waters as well as on shore , " he added .
us navy monitor seized arms ship the pirates who seized a belize-flagged freighter with its 21-man crew and 33 soviet-era t-72 battle tanks on board last thursday say they are under 24-hour surveillance from us ships and helicopters .
" we are prepared for any eventuality , " warned pirate spokesman sugule ali by satellite telephone from the ship .
" we are sticking to the demand for $ 20 million .
this is not ransom , but a fine for unlawfully transporting weapons on somali waters , " ali said .
there are 21 ukrainians , russians and latvians in the crew .
the ship 's captain died of an illness on board , according to russian media .

abdikadir musa yusuf , deputy seaports minister for the somali breakaway region of puntland , said , " there are negotiations going on between the pirates and the foreign ships . "
the pentagon said it wanted a peaceful resolution and us warships were there to make sure pirates do not make off with its military cargo .
" but at this point , what we are most concerned about is seeing a peaceful solution to this problem , " pentagon spokesman geoff morrell said , adding that the us navy was not negotiating with the pirates .
he said the main us concern was " that this cargo does not end up in the hands of anyone who would use it in a way that would be destabilizing to the region .

moreover , it declares that the law should only apply to the most efficient 60 percent of europe 's new auto fleet when it comes into force in 2012 , with the least efficient cars only coming into the system in 2015 .

" the problem stems from in-house financing divisions ' ability to offer loans and lease deals .
as the credit crisis has all but frozen inter-bank lending , the ability to package and re-sell the resultant consumer loans has left the system paralyzed , " it said .
france seeks more co2 leeway environmental groups on wednesday reacted with outrage to the french proposal to weaken planned european union laws on co2 car emissions .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : french president nicolas sarkozy 's government 's counter-proposal will ease the burden for carmakers on thursday the european parliament 's environment committee voted through a version of a law originally proposed by the eu 's executive , the european commission , demanding that cars sold in the eu emit no more than 120 grams of co2 per kilometer -lrb- g / km -rrb- by 2012 .
penalties for non-compliance should rise to 95 euros -lrb- $ 135.80 -rrb- per g / km for each car sold over the limit by 2015 , and the eu should bring in a target of at least 95 g / km by 2020 , the committee said .
but the french government 's proposal calls for a fine of no more than 80 euros per g / km over the limit and a long-range target " in the range 95-110 g / km . "
moreover , it declares that the law should only apply to the most efficient 60 percent of europe 's new auto fleet when it comes into force in 2012 , with the least efficient cars only coming into the system in 2015 .
the proposal , which would need the backing of the eu 's member states and the european parliament , is now likely to set up a heated political battle as lobbyists on both sides push for a deal before the parliament 's next plenary session on oct .
20-23 .
green groups angered the french government , which currently holds the eu 's rotating presidency , " is giving up any pretence of trying to limit the climate impact of cars , " greenpeace said in a statement wednesday .
the proposal , presented to diplomats tuesday , " totally ignores " the european parliament vote and shows that france is " totally out of touch with the needs of citizens who are desperate to reduce their fuel bills , ” a spokesman for brussels-based group transport and environment told news agency dpa . dw staff -lrb- dm -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the law in england and wales states that assisted suicide is a crime punishable with a maximum sentence of 14 years in prison .

she said that if her husband is liable for prosecution , she would travel abroad alone while she is healthy enough to do so - but before she is ready to die .
" i enjoy my life and the people around me , and i do n't want to die until my condition becomes unbearable .

purdy has said she is considering traveling to a clinic run by the swiss right-to-die organization , dignitas .
since 1992 , almost 100 british citizens have ended their lives at the dignitas clinic without their relatives being prosecuted .
purdy and the organization dignity in dying say they want to know if a decision has been made not to prosecute relatives .
in june , two top judges in britain allowed purdy to bring a full judicial review in the case , which her lawyer says may fall within the scope of the european convention on human rights .

global shipping groups call for action the groups , including the international chamber of shipping , bimco and oil tanker group intercargo , said they were " utterly amazed " governments were unable to secure one of the world 's most important seaways .
they also warned that continued inaction risked causing a repetition of the crisis in the early 1970s when the suez canal was closed and merchant shipping was diverted around the cape of good hope at africa 's southern tip , leading to major consequences for international trade , including higher transport costs and the maintenance of inventories .

" the russian reaction in this conflict -lrb- the russo-georgian war -rrb- we consider to be disproportionate and we said -lrb- to the russians -rrb- , that we now need to build trust , " merkel said .
a key first step would be withdrawal of all russian troops from georgian territory by oct .
10 in line with a european union- brokered ceasefire between moscow and tbilisi , she said . medvedev , in his opening remarks , anticipated merkel 's criticism , calling georgia 's august attack on the renegade province of south ossetia " aggressive nationalism , " and international claims russia was the attacker in the conflict " dishonest propaganda . " the world , despite worsening relations between moscow and nato nations over georgia , would nonetheless never see a new cold war , medvedev claimed , " because there are no reasons for it . " russia and germany have " differing views on this matter -lrb- the caucasus situation -rrb- , " merkel said . western nations and russia need to engage each other in a series of " preventative talks " to forestall future conflicts , and to prepare the ground for cooperation , she said . russo-european coordination over the role of military observers deployed to georgia from the organization of security and cooperation in europe -lrb- osce -rrb- is one of the first topics requiring greater mutual understanding , merkel said . eu monitors deploy russian combat forces on wednesday delayed and in some places restricted the movement of osce observers through a buffer zone in south osseia , despite european claims the observers should be allowed to travel unhindered . merkel named as other areas of disagreement requiring further discussion the renegade moldovan province transnistria , kosovo , and bosnia-herzogovina - all european territories over whose future status russia and nato nations sharply disagree . medvedev called for more clarity and direct talk between russia and the west , saying what was needed was " the voice of truth stated loudly . " " we have to accept the mutual dependance of countries and nations in the modern world , " medvedev said .

with exponentially rising petrol prices , new environmental legislation and already falling sales figures , most of the major auto makers were keen to show off their latest lines of hybrids , electro-cars and fuel savers at the biennial mondial de paris car show .
over 360 marquees from 25 countries are represented at the car expo , which attracted some 1.43 million people at the last show in 2006 .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the bugatti veyron 16.4 grand is on display in paris out for public display at this year 's event will be 90 new models and new green technologies from automakers such as toyota , honda , nissan , general motors , peugeot and citroen .
credit crisis to crunch auto sales but behind the veneer and marketing hype , auto executives are worried about what lies ahead for the industry , with fears the latest credit crunch could hit car sales significantly over the next two to three years .
predictions are already dire .
economic forecaster global insight predicts the usually strong selling month of september could see a double-digit decline in sales figures .
" car sales across western europe will slump in september as consumer confidence evaporates in the face of the financial crisis , tougher credit restrictions and inflationary pressures elsewhere , " global insight said in a report published on its web site wednesday .
the forecaster said the once-generous financing deals used by dealerships to tempt buyers into their lots have effectively been dried up by the credit crisis .
" the problem stems from in-house financing divisions ' ability to offer loans and lease deals .
as the credit crisis has all but frozen inter-bank lending , the ability to package and re-sell the resultant consumer loans has left the system paralyzed , " it said .
france seeks more co2 leeway environmental groups on wednesday reacted with outrage to the french proposal to weaken planned european union laws on co2 car emissions .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : french president nicolas sarkozy 's government 's counter-proposal will ease the burden for carmakers on thursday the european parliament 's environment committee voted through a version of a law originally proposed by the eu 's executive , the european commission , demanding that cars sold in the eu emit no more than 120 grams of co2 per kilometer -lrb- g / km -rrb- by 2012 .
penalties for non-compliance should rise to 95 euros -lrb- $ 135.80 -rrb- per g / km for each car sold over the limit by 2015 , and the eu should bring in a target of at least 95 g / km by 2020 , the committee said .
but the french government 's proposal calls for a fine of no more than 80 euros per g / km over the limit and a long-range target " in the range 95-110 g / km . "
moreover , it declares that the law should only apply to the most efficient 60 percent of europe 's new auto fleet when it comes into force in 2012 , with the least efficient cars only coming into the system in 2015 .
the proposal , which would need the backing of the eu 's member states and the european parliament , is now likely to set up a heated political battle as lobbyists on both sides push for a deal before the parliament 's next plenary session on oct .
20-23 .
green groups angered the french government , which currently holds the eu 's rotating presidency , " is giving up any pretence of trying to limit the climate impact of cars , " greenpeace said in a statement wednesday .
the proposal , presented to diplomats tuesday , " totally ignores " the european parliament vote and shows that france is " totally out of touch with the needs of citizens who are desperate to reduce their fuel bills , ” a spokesman for brussels-based group transport and environment told news agency dpa . dw staff -lrb- dm -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

germany would send one frigate , said defense minister franz-josef jung . french defense minister herve morin announced that the anti-piracy security operation could begin as soon as next month in the wake of calls from somali president abdullahi yusuf ahmed for the international community to combat rising piracy off the lawless nation 's waters .
" there is very broad european willingness .
many countries want to take part .
ten have clearly given their accord to take part in such a mission , " morin said wednesday , oct .
1 , at the meeting in the french seaside resort of deauville .
" we have given a mandate -lrb- to eu top brass -rrb- to continue the planning for the launch of this operation in the month of november , " he told reporters .
" we will see what means , nato and european , can be added . "
belgium , cyprus , france , germany , lithuania , the netherlands , spain , sweden and possibly britain would be involved in the task force , morin said .
" we have to coordinate between the ships that are in the zone and those we are going to send , " he said , and added that nato countries , particularly the united states , had vessels in the area .
germany has agreed to provide a frigate for the eu naval task force , which will include three frigates , a supply ship and three maritime surveillance ships , defense minister franz-josef jung said at the meeting .
germany to send frigate to somalia bildunterschrift : germany 's " emden " was deployed off somalia as part of operation enduring freedom " i think it 's necessary to counter pirates effectively , " jung told reporters .
" i support a mission that pushes back piracy , secures the seas and ensures free maritime trade . "
piracy is rife and well organized in the region where somalia 's north-eastern tip juts into the indian ocean , preying on a key maritime route leading to the suez canal .
an estimated 30 percent of the world 's oil passes through the territory .
sixty ships have been seized this year alone and somali pirates are currently holding 13 vessels captive with more than 200 sailors .
the pirates operate high-powered speedboats and are heavily armed , sometimes holding ships for weeks until they are released for large ransoms paid by governments or owners .
the somali government was joined in its calls for action by global shipping groups last month which urged the world 's naval powers to do more to stop piracy .
global shipping groups call for action the groups , including the international chamber of shipping , bimco and oil tanker group intercargo , said they were " utterly amazed " governments were unable to secure one of the world 's most important seaways .
they also warned that continued inaction risked causing a repetition of the crisis in the early 1970s when the suez canal was closed and merchant shipping was diverted around the cape of good hope at africa 's southern tip , leading to major consequences for international trade , including higher transport costs and the maintenance of inventories .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : president yusaf warns of consequences for the world somalia 's president yusaf warned in a speech in the capital mogadishu this week that the pirates represented a risk to the whole world . " they -lrb- pirates -rrb- are imposing an embargo on the somali people and the international community because they are blocking movement between the mediterranean and the indian ocean , which affects not only somalia but the whole world , " yusuf told reporters .
" i call on the somali people to fight against the pirates .
i also call on the international community to act quickly on what is happening in somali waters as well as on shore , " he added .
us navy monitor seized arms ship the pirates who seized a belize-flagged freighter with its 21-man crew and 33 soviet-era t-72 battle tanks on board last thursday say they are under 24-hour surveillance from us ships and helicopters .
" we are prepared for any eventuality , " warned pirate spokesman sugule ali by satellite telephone from the ship .

this is not ransom , but a fine for unlawfully transporting weapons on somali waters , " ali said .

he said it was asking the united nations to refer the matter to the court in the hague .
about 100,000 ethnic serbs live in kosovo and their towns have largely rejected government by pristina .

the law in england and wales states that assisted suicide is a crime punishable with a maximum sentence of 14 years in prison .
purdy fears that her husband , a cuban national , would be treated more harshly were he to accompany her .
she said that if her husband is liable for prosecution , she would travel abroad alone while she is healthy enough to do so - but before she is ready to die .
" i enjoy my life and the people around me , and i do n't want to die until my condition becomes unbearable .
if the law is not clarified , i may be forced to travel abroad alone before i am ready , " she said in a statement .
" i just want clarity so i know whether or not my husband omar will be prosecuted or questioned by the police if i decide to travel abroad and he accompanies me . "
purdy has said she is considering traveling to a clinic run by the swiss right-to-die organization , dignitas .
since 1992 , almost 100 british citizens have ended their lives at the dignitas clinic without their relatives being prosecuted .
purdy and the organization dignity in dying say they want to know if a decision has been made not to prosecute relatives .
in june , two top judges in britain allowed purdy to bring a full judicial review in the case , which her lawyer says may fall within the scope of the european convention on human rights .
the hearing is set to last for two days , and judgment is likely to be reserved until a later date .
hot button issue in germany advocates on both sides of the euthanasia debate in germany will be watching with interest to see how the director of public prosecutions -lrb- dpp -rrb- responds to purdy 's case , as in recent months , assisted suicide has again become a hot button issue .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : former state senator for justice roger kusch presents a video to journalists about the medically assisted suicide of bettina schardt in wuerzburg in july , former hamburg justice senator and right-to-die campaigner roger kusch , said he had assisted a 79-year-old woman who committed suicide despite the fact that she had no life-threatening disease or great amount of pain .
his participation in her death was strongly condemned by german chancellor angela merkel , who stressed that her christian democratic union -lrb- cdu -rrb- opposed any form of assisted suicide .
bavaria and four other german states are pushing for new laws to ban commercial ventures that help people kill themselves .
many in germany want to prevent the country from following in switzerland 's footsteps .
opponents to assisted suicide say that liberal swiss laws on euthanasia have led to a bustling trade in assisted suicide with the help of organizations like dignitas . dw staff -lrb- dc -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the law in england and wales states that assisted suicide is a crime punishable with a maximum sentence of 14 years in prison .

purdy has said she is considering traveling to a clinic run by the swiss right-to-die organization , dignitas .
since 1992 , almost 100 british citizens have ended their lives at the dignitas clinic without their relatives being prosecuted .

" the world , despite worsening relations between moscow and nato nations over georgia , would nonetheless never see a new cold war , medvedev claimed , " because there are no reasons for it . " russia and germany have " differing views on this matter -lrb- the caucasus situation -rrb- , " merkel said . western nations and russia need to engage each other in a series of " preventative talks " to forestall future conflicts , and to prepare the ground for cooperation , she said . russo-european coordination over the role of military observers deployed to georgia from the organization of security and cooperation in europe -lrb- osce -rrb- is one of the first topics requiring greater mutual understanding , merkel said . eu monitors deploy russian combat forces on wednesday delayed and in some places restricted the movement of osce observers through a buffer zone in south osseia , despite european claims the observers should be allowed to travel unhindered . merkel named as other areas of disagreement requiring further discussion the renegade moldovan province transnistria , kosovo , and bosnia-herzogovina - all european territories over whose future status russia and nato nations sharply disagree . medvedev called for more clarity and direct talk between russia and the west , saying what was needed was " the voice of truth stated loudly . " " we have to accept the mutual dependance of countries and nations in the modern world , " medvedev said .
" this interdependence does not only apply to economies , but the spheres of science , technology , culture , and education .

" if the united states has a rescue plan , europe should be ready to offer similar solutions , " he said , as quoted by dow jones newswires .
but peter struck , head of the german social democratic party 's parliamentary group , castigated the head of germany 's largest bank for his comments , saying he " felt contempt " for the " type of opportunism " shown by ackermann .
" as long as the banks were on course for making profits , mr. ackermann was the one screaming loudest that the state shouldn ’ t get involved , " struck told news agency dpa , adding that ackermann 's tune has changed now that profits are threatened by the credit crisis .
struck said that attitude made it particularly irksome that the head of germany ’ s leading bank is " now the first to call for massive aid from taxpayer funds " to help prop up crumbling financial institutions .
no bailout for europe bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german chancellor angela merkel has strongly opposed any europe-wide bailout strategy complementing struck 's talk down of ackermann were comments made by chancellor angela merkel , who said : " the alliance will not issue any blank checks to banks , whether they behave responsibly or not . "
merkel said she favoured " better protection and early warning systems " over a bailout package , insisting european banking regulations needed upgrading .
" it can not be that … in finance markets , several billion products exist to which no sufficient rules count , " she said .
at a european level , there also seems to be distaste for a financial bailout package with jean-claude juncker , chairman of the group of countries that share the euro , insisting thursday that no consideration was being given to a gigantic euro bailout .
" i do not see the necessity for such a program in europe , " he said , pleading for more intensive regulation of the finance sector . dw staff -lrb- dm -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" if the united states has a rescue plan , europe should be ready to offer similar solutions , " he said , as quoted by dow jones newswires .
but peter struck , head of the german social democratic party 's parliamentary group , castigated the head of germany 's largest bank for his comments , saying he " felt contempt " for the " type of opportunism " shown by ackermann .
" as long as the banks were on course for making profits , mr. ackermann was the one screaming loudest that the state shouldn ’ t get involved , " struck told news agency dpa , adding that ackermann 's tune has changed now that profits are threatened by the credit crisis .
struck said that attitude made it particularly irksome that the head of germany ’ s leading bank is " now the first to call for massive aid from taxpayer funds " to help prop up crumbling financial institutions .

" if we are talking about a european defence industry , we must accept the idea that not everybody is doing the same thing as everybody else , " morin said .
" for example , we could do some work in france and other work elsewhere , and then pool together . "
french president nicolas sarkozy , whose country holds the rotating eu presidency , said wednesday that europe lacked the " appropriate measures to enact its defense policies . "
he said indirectly that europe risked losing political power if it was unable to defend itself .
at the heart of sarkozy 's military agenda is a desire to see europe able to stand alone if need be .
in line with this goal , the defense ministers committed at the meeting to filling key military shortfalls such as a lack of transport aircraft and helicopters , better troop protection and the ability to gather intelligence , including by satellite .
the key decisions made at the deauville meeting are to be finalized in brussels on nov .

one such example of cooperation is that concerning the a400m military transport aircraft , the components of which are being built by airbus in six countries : belgium - flaps - britain - flaps and outer wing box - france - nose fuselage and rudder - germany - fuselage - spain - tail - and turkey - ailerons and spoilers .
production has fallen behind , however , and delivery of the a400m 's may take two years longer than originally scheduled , according to reports .
military erasmus a majority of eu countries also backed french plans for an exchange program involving young military officers .
inspired by the erasmus student exchange program , it would see officers from one member state spend some time training in another european country .
the project aims to increase cooperation between military colleges in order to improve interoperability and mould a common european defence culture , morin said .
however , some ministers expressed concern that such a program could turn into a one-way travelling system , whereby officers from poorer member states would want to spend time in some of europe 's best colleges , and fewer officers from richer states would be willing to train in countries such as romania or bulgaria . dpa news agency -lrb- dm -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" if we are talking about a european defence industry , we must accept the idea that not everybody is doing the same thing as everybody else , " morin said .
" for example , we could do some work in france and other work elsewhere , and then pool together . "
french president nicolas sarkozy , whose country holds the rotating eu presidency , said wednesday that europe lacked the " appropriate measures to enact its defense policies . "
he said indirectly that europe risked losing political power if it was unable to defend itself .
at the heart of sarkozy 's military agenda is a desire to see europe able to stand alone if need be .
in line with this goal , the defense ministers committed at the meeting to filling key military shortfalls such as a lack of transport aircraft and helicopters , better troop protection and the ability to gather intelligence , including by satellite .
the key decisions made at the deauville meeting are to be finalized in brussels on nov .

integrated european defense manufacturing bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : production of the airbus a400m has been delayed by up to two years but there was growing evidence in deauville that eu leaders were warming to the idea that more could be done together , particularly at a time of economic slowdown .
one such example of cooperation is that concerning the a400m military transport aircraft , the components of which are being built by airbus in six countries : belgium - flaps - britain - flaps and outer wing box - france - nose fuselage and rudder - germany - fuselage - spain - tail - and turkey - ailerons and spoilers .
production has fallen behind , however , and delivery of the a400m 's may take two years longer than originally scheduled , according to reports .
military erasmus a majority of eu countries also backed french plans for an exchange program involving young military officers .
inspired by the erasmus student exchange program , it would see officers from one member state spend some time training in another european country .
the project aims to increase cooperation between military colleges in order to improve interoperability and mould a common european defence culture , morin said .
however , some ministers expressed concern that such a program could turn into a one-way travelling system , whereby officers from poorer member states would want to spend time in some of europe 's best colleges , and fewer officers from richer states would be willing to train in countries such as romania or bulgaria . dpa news agency -lrb- dm -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de auto industry -pipe- 02.10.2008 paris motor show opens amid industry gloom großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the paris show opened thursday for the press , but the public must wait until saturday the largest motor show on earth opened in paris on thursday as the auto industry attempts to convince the world it is moving forward with an eye on the environment as well as on profit margins . the expo convened amid uncertainty in the auto industry as to how the global credit crisis will affect car sales , and as france proposed earlier this week to weaken european union laws on the amount of carbon dioxide -lrb- co2 -rrb- cars should be allowed to emit .
with exponentially rising petrol prices , new environmental legislation and already falling sales figures , most of the major auto makers were keen to show off their latest lines of hybrids , electro-cars and fuel savers at the biennial mondial de paris car show .
over 360 marquees from 25 countries are represented at the car expo , which attracted some 1.43 million people at the last show in 2006 .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the bugatti veyron 16.4 grand is on display in paris out for public display at this year 's event will be 90 new models and new green technologies from automakers such as toyota , honda , nissan , general motors , peugeot and citroen .
credit crisis to crunch auto sales but behind the veneer and marketing hype , auto executives are worried about what lies ahead for the industry , with fears the latest credit crunch could hit car sales significantly over the next two to three years .
predictions are already dire .
economic forecaster global insight predicts the usually strong selling month of september could see a double-digit decline in sales figures .
" car sales across western europe will slump in september as consumer confidence evaporates in the face of the financial crisis , tougher credit restrictions and inflationary pressures elsewhere , " global insight said in a report published on its web site wednesday .
the forecaster said the once-generous financing deals used by dealerships to tempt buyers into their lots have effectively been dried up by the credit crisis .
" the problem stems from in-house financing divisions ' ability to offer loans and lease deals .
as the credit crisis has all but frozen inter-bank lending , the ability to package and re-sell the resultant consumer loans has left the system paralyzed , " it said .
france seeks more co2 leeway environmental groups on wednesday reacted with outrage to the french proposal to weaken planned european union laws on co2 car emissions .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : french president nicolas sarkozy 's government 's counter-proposal will ease the burden for carmakers on thursday the european parliament 's environment committee voted through a version of a law originally proposed by the eu 's executive , the european commission , demanding that cars sold in the eu emit no more than 120 grams of co2 per kilometer -lrb- g / km -rrb- by 2012 .
penalties for non-compliance should rise to 95 euros -lrb- $ 135.80 -rrb- per g / km for each car sold over the limit by 2015 , and the eu should bring in a target of at least 95 g / km by 2020 , the committee said .
but the french government 's proposal calls for a fine of no more than 80 euros per g / km over the limit and a long-range target " in the range 95-110 g / km . "
moreover , it declares that the law should only apply to the most efficient 60 percent of europe 's new auto fleet when it comes into force in 2012 , with the least efficient cars only coming into the system in 2015 .
the proposal , which would need the backing of the eu 's member states and the european parliament , is now likely to set up a heated political battle as lobbyists on both sides push for a deal before the parliament 's next plenary session on oct .
20-23 .
green groups angered the french government , which currently holds the eu 's rotating presidency , " is giving up any pretence of trying to limit the climate impact of cars , " greenpeace said in a statement wednesday .
the proposal , presented to diplomats tuesday , " totally ignores " the european parliament vote and shows that france is " totally out of touch with the needs of citizens who are desperate to reduce their fuel bills , ” a spokesman for brussels-based group transport and environment told news agency dpa . dw staff -lrb- dm -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the interpretation of what he said had been " politically wrong , " he told reporters .
about 50 nations , including germany , have recognized kosovo as independent , whereas serbia insists kosovo still belongs to it . tadic said belgrade would never recognize its independence , but was making an effort to shift the kosovo issue " from the political corner to the legal corner " by taking it to the international court of justice .
he said it was asking the united nations to refer the matter to the court in the hague .
about 100,000 ethnic serbs live in kosovo and their towns have largely rejected government by pristina .
the tadic visit to berlin was seen as part of the president 's efforts to develop closer ties with the european union .
he was also meeting with german foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier . dpa news agency -lrb- kjb -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

germany would send one frigate , said defense minister franz-josef jung . french defense minister herve morin announced that the anti-piracy security operation could begin as soon as next month in the wake of calls from somali president abdullahi yusuf ahmed for the international community to combat rising piracy off the lawless nation 's waters .
" there is very broad european willingness .
many countries want to take part .
ten have clearly given their accord to take part in such a mission , " morin said wednesday , oct .
1 , at the meeting in the french seaside resort of deauville .
" we have given a mandate -lrb- to eu top brass -rrb- to continue the planning for the launch of this operation in the month of november , " he told reporters .
" we will see what means , nato and european , can be added . "
belgium , cyprus , france , germany , lithuania , the netherlands , spain , sweden and possibly britain would be involved in the task force , morin said .
" we have to coordinate between the ships that are in the zone and those we are going to send , " he said , and added that nato countries , particularly the united states , had vessels in the area .
germany has agreed to provide a frigate for the eu naval task force , which will include three frigates , a supply ship and three maritime surveillance ships , defense minister franz-josef jung said at the meeting .
germany to send frigate to somalia bildunterschrift : germany 's " emden " was deployed off somalia as part of operation enduring freedom " i think it 's necessary to counter pirates effectively , " jung told reporters .
" i support a mission that pushes back piracy , secures the seas and ensures free maritime trade . "
piracy is rife and well organized in the region where somalia 's north-eastern tip juts into the indian ocean , preying on a key maritime route leading to the suez canal .
an estimated 30 percent of the world 's oil passes through the territory .
sixty ships have been seized this year alone and somali pirates are currently holding 13 vessels captive with more than 200 sailors .
the pirates operate high-powered speedboats and are heavily armed , sometimes holding ships for weeks until they are released for large ransoms paid by governments or owners .
the somali government was joined in its calls for action by global shipping groups last month which urged the world 's naval powers to do more to stop piracy .
global shipping groups call for action the groups , including the international chamber of shipping , bimco and oil tanker group intercargo , said they were " utterly amazed " governments were unable to secure one of the world 's most important seaways .
they also warned that continued inaction risked causing a repetition of the crisis in the early 1970s when the suez canal was closed and merchant shipping was diverted around the cape of good hope at africa 's southern tip , leading to major consequences for international trade , including higher transport costs and the maintenance of inventories .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : president yusaf warns of consequences for the world somalia 's president yusaf warned in a speech in the capital mogadishu this week that the pirates represented a risk to the whole world . " they -lrb- pirates -rrb- are imposing an embargo on the somali people and the international community because they are blocking movement between the mediterranean and the indian ocean , which affects not only somalia but the whole world , " yusuf told reporters .
" i call on the somali people to fight against the pirates .
i also call on the international community to act quickly on what is happening in somali waters as well as on shore , " he added .
us navy monitor seized arms ship the pirates who seized a belize-flagged freighter with its 21-man crew and 33 soviet-era t-72 battle tanks on board last thursday say they are under 24-hour surveillance from us ships and helicopters .
" we are prepared for any eventuality , " warned pirate spokesman sugule ali by satellite telephone from the ship .
" we are sticking to the demand for $ 20 million .
this is not ransom , but a fine for unlawfully transporting weapons on somali waters , " ali said .
there are 21 ukrainians , russians and latvians in the crew .
the ship 's captain died of an illness on board , according to russian media .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the " faina " is carrying a consignment of army tanks the bahrain-based us navy fifth fleet said several ships and helicopters were in the area to support the destroyer uss howard as it observed its target , now docked at the somali port village of hobyo .
abdikadir musa yusuf , deputy seaports minister for the somali breakaway region of puntland , said , " there are negotiations going on between the pirates and the foreign ships . "
the pentagon said it wanted a peaceful resolution and us warships were there to make sure pirates do not make off with its military cargo .
" but at this point , what we are most concerned about is seeing a peaceful solution to this problem , " pentagon spokesman geoff morrell said , adding that the us navy was not negotiating with the pirates .
he said the main us concern was " that this cargo does not end up in the hands of anyone who would use it in a way that would be destabilizing to the region .

this year , however , all eyes will be on the leaders of the two nations as they join the forum , to see how they interact in the wake of the recent war in georgia .
merkel had joined a host of western critics who said the war had made normal dealings with russia impossible , and called for ties to be reviewed .
still , she has backed a deal negotiated by french president nicolas sarkozy , under which russia agreed to pull out of undisputed georgian territories by oct .
10 once eu monitors had been deployed in the region .
and despite her condemnation of russia 's actions in georgia , she has distinguished herself among her eu counterparts by insisting the lines of communication with moscow remain open .
thursday 's talks with medvedev are expected to touch on the eu monitoring mission in " buffer zones " around south ossetia and fellow rebel enclave abkhazia .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany and russia have enjoyed close relations in the past but according to kremlin sources , the russian leader is also expected to show that his country has not been isolated in europe by focusing on developing further political and economic ties , including the ambitious north stream project - a gas pipeline to deliver gas from siberia to europe beneath the baltic sea .
germany is russia 's single biggest trading partner with bilateral turnover set to reach 43 billion euros -lrb- $ 60 billion -rrb- this year .
some 4,600 german firms have subsidiaries in russia and every fourth machine imported by russia is made in germany .
" the meeting is aimed at confirming the stability and maturity of the russian-german partnership free from political fluctuations , " a kremlin source told reporters ahead of the forum .
council of europe keeps dialogue open russia still could face consequences in europe for its actions in august during the conflict with georgia .
on wednesday , secretary general of the council of europe terry davis said the organization would examine allegations of human rights violations during the war .
the european court of human rights in strasbourg had received " more than 1,700 complaints " from the region , he added .
court officials told news agency afp that the vast majority of the complaints had been made by south ossetians against georgia .
diplomats in strasbourg added that it was possible the complaints were part of an orchestrated campaign against tbilisi .
however , the council of europe , which is not related to the european union , voted against withdrawing russia 's voting rights after a request to do so by two dozen members .
swiss member andreas gross said the vote signified willingness to maintain " dialogue between us and the two countries . "
a council report published on monday found both moscow and tbilisi were responsible for the conflict 's escalation into " open and fully-fledged warfare . " dw staff -lrb- dc -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the interpretation of what he said had been " politically wrong , " he told reporters .
about 50 nations , including germany , have recognized kosovo as independent , whereas serbia insists kosovo still belongs to it . tadic said belgrade would never recognize its independence , but was making an effort to shift the kosovo issue " from the political corner to the legal corner " by taking it to the international court of justice .
he said it was asking the united nations to refer the matter to the court in the hague .
about 100,000 ethnic serbs live in kosovo and their towns have largely rejected government by pristina .
the tadic visit to berlin was seen as part of the president 's efforts to develop closer ties with the european union .

the law in england and wales states that assisted suicide is a crime punishable with a maximum sentence of 14 years in prison .
purdy fears that her husband , a cuban national , would be treated more harshly were he to accompany her .
she said that if her husband is liable for prosecution , she would travel abroad alone while she is healthy enough to do so - but before she is ready to die .
" i enjoy my life and the people around me , and i do n't want to die until my condition becomes unbearable .
if the law is not clarified , i may be forced to travel abroad alone before i am ready , " she said in a statement .
" i just want clarity so i know whether or not my husband omar will be prosecuted or questioned by the police if i decide to travel abroad and he accompanies me . "
purdy has said she is considering traveling to a clinic run by the swiss right-to-die organization , dignitas .
since 1992 , almost 100 british citizens have ended their lives at the dignitas clinic without their relatives being prosecuted .
purdy and the organization dignity in dying say they want to know if a decision has been made not to prosecute relatives .
in june , two top judges in britain allowed purdy to bring a full judicial review in the case , which her lawyer says may fall within the scope of the european convention on human rights .
the hearing is set to last for two days , and judgment is likely to be reserved until a later date .
hot button issue in germany advocates on both sides of the euthanasia debate in germany will be watching with interest to see how the director of public prosecutions -lrb- dpp -rrb- responds to purdy 's case , as in recent months , assisted suicide has again become a hot button issue .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : former state senator for justice roger kusch presents a video to journalists about the medically assisted suicide of bettina schardt in wuerzburg in july , former hamburg justice senator and right-to-die campaigner roger kusch , said he had assisted a 79-year-old woman who committed suicide despite the fact that she had no life-threatening disease or great amount of pain .
his participation in her death was strongly condemned by german chancellor angela merkel , who stressed that her christian democratic union -lrb- cdu -rrb- opposed any form of assisted suicide .
bavaria and four other german states are pushing for new laws to ban commercial ventures that help people kill themselves .
many in germany want to prevent the country from following in switzerland 's footsteps .
opponents to assisted suicide say that liberal swiss laws on euthanasia have led to a bustling trade in assisted suicide with the help of organizations like dignitas . dw staff -lrb- dc -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" if the united states has a rescue plan , europe should be ready to offer similar solutions , " he said , as quoted by dow jones newswires .
but peter struck , head of the german social democratic party 's parliamentary group , castigated the head of germany 's largest bank for his comments , saying he " felt contempt " for the " type of opportunism " shown by ackermann .
" as long as the banks were on course for making profits , mr. ackermann was the one screaming loudest that the state shouldn ’ t get involved , " struck told news agency dpa , adding that ackermann 's tune has changed now that profits are threatened by the credit crisis .
struck said that attitude made it particularly irksome that the head of germany ’ s leading bank is " now the first to call for massive aid from taxpayer funds " to help prop up crumbling financial institutions .
no bailout for europe bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german chancellor angela merkel has strongly opposed any europe-wide bailout strategy complementing struck 's talk down of ackermann were comments made by chancellor angela merkel , who said : " the alliance will not issue any blank checks to banks , whether they behave responsibly or not . "
merkel said she favoured " better protection and early warning systems " over a bailout package , insisting european banking regulations needed upgrading .
" it can not be that … in finance markets , several billion products exist to which no sufficient rules count , " she said .
at a european level , there also seems to be distaste for a financial bailout package with jean-claude juncker , chairman of the group of countries that share the euro , insisting thursday that no consideration was being given to a gigantic euro bailout .
" i do not see the necessity for such a program in europe , " he said , pleading for more intensive regulation of the finance sector . dw staff -lrb- dm -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the interpretation of what he said had been " politically wrong , " he told reporters .
about 50 nations , including germany , have recognized kosovo as independent , whereas serbia insists kosovo still belongs to it . tadic said belgrade would never recognize its independence , but was making an effort to shift the kosovo issue " from the political corner to the legal corner " by taking it to the international court of justice .
he said it was asking the united nations to refer the matter to the court in the hague .
about 100,000 ethnic serbs live in kosovo and their towns have largely rejected government by pristina .
the tadic visit to berlin was seen as part of the president 's efforts to develop closer ties with the european union .

with exponentially rising petrol prices , new environmental legislation and already falling sales figures , most of the major auto makers were keen to show off their latest lines of hybrids , electro-cars and fuel savers at the biennial mondial de paris car show .
over 360 marquees from 25 countries are represented at the car expo , which attracted some 1.43 million people at the last show in 2006 .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the bugatti veyron 16.4 grand is on display in paris out for public display at this year 's event will be 90 new models and new green technologies from automakers such as toyota , honda , nissan , general motors , peugeot and citroen .
credit crisis to crunch auto sales but behind the veneer and marketing hype , auto executives are worried about what lies ahead for the industry , with fears the latest credit crunch could hit car sales significantly over the next two to three years .
predictions are already dire .
economic forecaster global insight predicts the usually strong selling month of september could see a double-digit decline in sales figures .
" car sales across western europe will slump in september as consumer confidence evaporates in the face of the financial crisis , tougher credit restrictions and inflationary pressures elsewhere , " global insight said in a report published on its web site wednesday .
the forecaster said the once-generous financing deals used by dealerships to tempt buyers into their lots have effectively been dried up by the credit crisis .
" the problem stems from in-house financing divisions ' ability to offer loans and lease deals .
as the credit crisis has all but frozen inter-bank lending , the ability to package and re-sell the resultant consumer loans has left the system paralyzed , " it said .
france seeks more co2 leeway environmental groups on wednesday reacted with outrage to the french proposal to weaken planned european union laws on co2 car emissions .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : french president nicolas sarkozy 's government 's counter-proposal will ease the burden for carmakers on thursday the european parliament 's environment committee voted through a version of a law originally proposed by the eu 's executive , the european commission , demanding that cars sold in the eu emit no more than 120 grams of co2 per kilometer -lrb- g / km -rrb- by 2012 .
penalties for non-compliance should rise to 95 euros -lrb- $ 135.80 -rrb- per g / km for each car sold over the limit by 2015 , and the eu should bring in a target of at least 95 g / km by 2020 , the committee said .
but the french government 's proposal calls for a fine of no more than 80 euros per g / km over the limit and a long-range target " in the range 95-110 g / km . "
moreover , it declares that the law should only apply to the most efficient 60 percent of europe 's new auto fleet when it comes into force in 2012 , with the least efficient cars only coming into the system in 2015 .
the proposal , which would need the backing of the eu 's member states and the european parliament , is now likely to set up a heated political battle as lobbyists on both sides push for a deal before the parliament 's next plenary session on oct .
20-23 .
green groups angered the french government , which currently holds the eu 's rotating presidency , " is giving up any pretence of trying to limit the climate impact of cars , " greenpeace said in a statement wednesday .
the proposal , presented to diplomats tuesday , " totally ignores " the european parliament vote and shows that france is " totally out of touch with the needs of citizens who are desperate to reduce their fuel bills , ” a spokesman for brussels-based group transport and environment told news agency dpa . dw staff -lrb- dm -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the city was devastated , and there were enormous casualties among civilians and refugees .
historians have argued about just how many people were killed in the firebombing on the night of feb .
13-14 , 1945 , with estimates ranging from 25,000 to 135,000 .
now , a special commission of a dozen experts , including university professors , archivists and military historians have said that after four years of research , the lower figure is more accurate .
so far , they have confirmed 18,000 deaths and say they have found no reason to assume that the final tally will be significantly higher .
their research is to continue until 2009 .
the team is drawing on archival and official documents , burial records and eye witness reports .
they have ruled out one theory suggesting that the death toll was much higher due to an unknown number of casualties among war refugees .

" if we are talking about a european defence industry , we must accept the idea that not everybody is doing the same thing as everybody else , " morin said .
" for example , we could do some work in france and other work elsewhere , and then pool together . "
french president nicolas sarkozy , whose country holds the rotating eu presidency , said wednesday that europe lacked the " appropriate measures to enact its defense policies . "
he said indirectly that europe risked losing political power if it was unable to defend itself .
at the heart of sarkozy 's military agenda is a desire to see europe able to stand alone if need be .
in line with this goal , the defense ministers committed at the meeting to filling key military shortfalls such as a lack of transport aircraft and helicopters , better troop protection and the ability to gather intelligence , including by satellite .
the key decisions made at the deauville meeting are to be finalized in brussels on nov .

integrated european defense manufacturing bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : production of the airbus a400m has been delayed by up to two years but there was growing evidence in deauville that eu leaders were warming to the idea that more could be done together , particularly at a time of economic slowdown .
one such example of cooperation is that concerning the a400m military transport aircraft , the components of which are being built by airbus in six countries : belgium - flaps - britain - flaps and outer wing box - france - nose fuselage and rudder - germany - fuselage - spain - tail - and turkey - ailerons and spoilers .
production has fallen behind , however , and delivery of the a400m 's may take two years longer than originally scheduled , according to reports .
military erasmus a majority of eu countries also backed french plans for an exchange program involving young military officers .
inspired by the erasmus student exchange program , it would see officers from one member state spend some time training in another european country .
the project aims to increase cooperation between military colleges in order to improve interoperability and mould a common european defence culture , morin said .
however , some ministers expressed concern that such a program could turn into a one-way travelling system , whereby officers from poorer member states would want to spend time in some of europe 's best colleges , and fewer officers from richer states would be willing to train in countries such as romania or bulgaria . dpa news agency -lrb- dm -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" with the weakening of demand , upside risks to price stability have diminished somewhat , but they have not disappeared , " trichet said on thursday , oct 2 , in a monthly news conference . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : trichet delivered a somber message euro zone inflation has also fallen to 3.6 percent , though it remains well above the ecb 's target of just below 2 percent . trichet said ecb policymakers recognised " the extraordinary high level of uncertainty stemming from latest developments " on turbulent financial markets and the credit crunch .
" economic activity in the euro area is weakening with contracting domestic demand and tighter financing conditions , " he said . european stocks tumble the financial crisis has brought the world to an extraordinary level of uncertainty and governments must respond with equally unprecedented measures , trichet said thursday . " nothing in the past resembles what we are currently seeing , " he told france 24 news channel .
" we are witnessing events that we have not been seen since world war ii . " european stocks fell thursday amid news of bleak us economic data and jitters as the us house of representatives votes on a massive $ 700 billion bailout . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : market turmoil has caused much anguish at stock exchanges in europe around europe , germany 's dax index was down 2.5 percent , uk 's ftse 100 index fell 1.8 percent and france 's cac 40 dropped 2.3 percent . asian markets too took a new hammering amid uncertainty about the next stage of the us package . the bank of japan injected another 1.6 trillion yen -lrb- $ 15 billion , 10.7 billion euros -rrb- into the financial system - its 12th straight daily injection .
eurogroup chief jean-claude juncker called european officials to " put in place a more systematic defense strategy " to protect the 27-nation european union -lrb- eu -rrb- from banking failures , rather than be satisfied " with case by case reactions . " he said the subject would be discussed saturday in paris during a meeting of representatives from britain , france , germany and italy along with european commission president jose manuel barroso , juncker himself , and trichet . germany , france joust over alleged french bailout plan meanwhile , amid calls by the eu commission on wednesday for stronger pan-european cooperation to tackle a raging credit crisis that has lashed banks on the continent , france and germany were at loggerheads over the idea of a us-style bail out for europe . french finance minister christine lagarde told german business daily handelsblatt that a " european safety net " could be needed to prevent a bank in a smaller eu country from going bankrupt . " what happens if a smaller eu state is hit by looming bank collapse ?
maybe this country does not have the means to save the bank .
therefore the question of a european safety net solution comes up , " lagarde told the paper . the comments came ahead of a proposed meeting on the financial crisis by the leaders of europe 's four biggest economies in paris on the weekend .
france currently heads the eu 's rotating presidency . news reports quoted a european official , who did not wish to be named , saying that paris had floated the idea of a 300 billion euro -lrb- $ 440 billion -rrb- rescue fund but lagarde denied the statement from the source in berlin that her government wanted the huge rescue package .
" there is no such a thing , " lagarde told bbc television after being asked about the reported proposal . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel has ruled out issuing " blank checks " to banks whether there is or was ever a french bail-out plan , germany was quick to reject the idea regardless . " germany does not think much of such a plan , " german finance ministry spokesman torsten albig told afp . earlier , chancellor angela merkel said germany " can not and will not issue a blank check for all banks , regardless of whether they behave in a responsible manner or not . " barroso calls for more " credibility " in eu efforts eu commission president jose manuel barroso said wednesday europe needs to " inject credibility " into its efforts to tackle the current financial crisis , as a major us banking bailout hangs in the balance . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : barroso says europe needs more coordinated regulatory measures to tackle the crisis " we are asking and urging member states for closer cooperation .
it is critically important for confidence in the markets , " barroso said . barroso said the existing system of regulation , based largely on national governments and regulators , could cope with the current crisis , but the european union needed to go further in coordinated action to restore full confidence . " we need a further strengthening of the supervision structures at european level , " he told a news conference on wednesday . rebuffing french calls for eu limits on state aid to be suspended or revised in the light of the crisis , barroso said upholding the competition rules was vital , but the commission would apply them flexibly . dw staff -lrb- sp / kjb / nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" with the weakening of demand , upside risks to price stability have diminished somewhat , but they have not disappeared , " trichet said on thursday , oct 2 , in a monthly news conference . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : trichet delivered a somber message euro zone inflation has also fallen to 3.6 percent , though it remains well above the ecb 's target of just below 2 percent . trichet said ecb policymakers recognised " the extraordinary high level of uncertainty stemming from latest developments " on turbulent financial markets and the credit crunch .
" economic activity in the euro area is weakening with contracting domestic demand and tighter financing conditions , " he said . european stocks tumble the financial crisis has brought the world to an extraordinary level of uncertainty and governments must respond with equally unprecedented measures , trichet said thursday . " nothing in the past resembles what we are currently seeing , " he told france 24 news channel .
" we are witnessing events that we have not been seen since world war ii . " european stocks fell thursday amid news of bleak us economic data and jitters as the us house of representatives votes on a massive $ 700 billion bailout . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : market turmoil has caused much anguish at stock exchanges in europe around europe , germany 's dax index was down 2.5 percent , uk 's ftse 100 index fell 1.8 percent and france 's cac 40 dropped 2.3 percent . asian markets too took a new hammering amid uncertainty about the next stage of the us package . the bank of japan injected another 1.6 trillion yen -lrb- $ 15 billion , 10.7 billion euros -rrb- into the financial system - its 12th straight daily injection .
eurogroup chief jean-claude juncker called european officials to " put in place a more systematic defense strategy " to protect the 27-nation european union -lrb- eu -rrb- from banking failures , rather than be satisfied " with case by case reactions . " he said the subject would be discussed saturday in paris during a meeting of representatives from britain , france , germany and italy along with european commission president jose manuel barroso , juncker himself , and trichet . germany , france joust over alleged french bailout plan meanwhile , amid calls by the eu commission on wednesday for stronger pan-european cooperation to tackle a raging credit crisis that has lashed banks on the continent , france and germany were at loggerheads over the idea of a us-style bail out for europe . french finance minister christine lagarde told german business daily handelsblatt that a " european safety net " could be needed to prevent a bank in a smaller eu country from going bankrupt . " what happens if a smaller eu state is hit by looming bank collapse ?
maybe this country does not have the means to save the bank .

" with the weakening of demand , upside risks to price stability have diminished somewhat , but they have not disappeared , " trichet said on thursday , oct 2 , in a monthly news conference . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : trichet delivered a somber message euro zone inflation has also fallen to 3.6 percent , though it remains well above the ecb 's target of just below 2 percent . trichet said ecb policymakers recognised " the extraordinary high level of uncertainty stemming from latest developments " on turbulent financial markets and the credit crunch .
" economic activity in the euro area is weakening with contracting domestic demand and tighter financing conditions , " he said . european stocks tumble the financial crisis has brought the world to an extraordinary level of uncertainty and governments must respond with equally unprecedented measures , trichet said thursday . " nothing in the past resembles what we are currently seeing , " he told france 24 news channel .
" we are witnessing events that we have not been seen since world war ii .

eurogroup chief jean-claude juncker called european officials to " put in place a more systematic defense strategy " to protect the 27-nation european union -lrb- eu -rrb- from banking failures , rather than be satisfied " with case by case reactions . " he said the subject would be discussed saturday in paris during a meeting of representatives from britain , france , germany and italy along with european commission president jose manuel barroso , juncker himself , and trichet . germany , france joust over alleged french bailout plan meanwhile , amid calls by the eu commission on wednesday for stronger pan-european cooperation to tackle a raging credit crisis that has lashed banks on the continent , france and germany were at loggerheads over the idea of a us-style bail out for europe . french finance minister christine lagarde told german business daily handelsblatt that a " european safety net " could be needed to prevent a bank in a smaller eu country from going bankrupt . " what happens if a smaller eu state is hit by looming bank collapse ?
maybe this country does not have the means to save the bank .
therefore the question of a european safety net solution comes up , " lagarde told the paper . the comments came ahead of a proposed meeting on the financial crisis by the leaders of europe 's four biggest economies in paris on the weekend .
france currently heads the eu 's rotating presidency . news reports quoted a european official , who did not wish to be named , saying that paris had floated the idea of a 300 billion euro -lrb- $ 440 billion -rrb- rescue fund but lagarde denied the statement from the source in berlin that her government wanted the huge rescue package .

" germany does not think much of such a plan , " german finance ministry spokesman torsten albig told afp . earlier , chancellor angela merkel said germany " can not and will not issue a blank check for all banks , regardless of whether they behave in a responsible manner or not . " barroso calls for more " credibility " in eu efforts eu commission president jose manuel barroso said wednesday europe needs to " inject credibility " into its efforts to tackle the current financial crisis , as a major us banking bailout hangs in the balance . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : barroso says europe needs more coordinated regulatory measures to tackle the crisis " we are asking and urging member states for closer cooperation .
it is critically important for confidence in the markets , " barroso said . barroso said the existing system of regulation , based largely on national governments and regulators , could cope with the current crisis , but the european union needed to go further in coordinated action to restore full confidence . " we need a further strengthening of the supervision structures at european level , " he told a news conference on wednesday . rebuffing french calls for eu limits on state aid to be suspended or revised in the light of the crisis , barroso said upholding the competition rules was vital , but the commission would apply them flexibly . dw staff -lrb- sp / kjb / nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the law in england and wales states that assisted suicide is a crime punishable with a maximum sentence of 14 years in prison .
purdy fears that her husband , a cuban national , would be treated more harshly were he to accompany her .
she said that if her husband is liable for prosecution , she would travel abroad alone while she is healthy enough to do so - but before she is ready to die .
" i enjoy my life and the people around me , and i do n't want to die until my condition becomes unbearable .
if the law is not clarified , i may be forced to travel abroad alone before i am ready , " she said in a statement .
" i just want clarity so i know whether or not my husband omar will be prosecuted or questioned by the police if i decide to travel abroad and he accompanies me . "
purdy has said she is considering traveling to a clinic run by the swiss right-to-die organization , dignitas .
since 1992 , almost 100 british citizens have ended their lives at the dignitas clinic without their relatives being prosecuted .
purdy and the organization dignity in dying say they want to know if a decision has been made not to prosecute relatives .
in june , two top judges in britain allowed purdy to bring a full judicial review in the case , which her lawyer says may fall within the scope of the european convention on human rights .
the hearing is set to last for two days , and judgment is likely to be reserved until a later date .
hot button issue in germany advocates on both sides of the euthanasia debate in germany will be watching with interest to see how the director of public prosecutions -lrb- dpp -rrb- responds to purdy 's case , as in recent months , assisted suicide has again become a hot button issue .

his participation in her death was strongly condemned by german chancellor angela merkel , who stressed that her christian democratic union -lrb- cdu -rrb- opposed any form of assisted suicide .
bavaria and four other german states are pushing for new laws to ban commercial ventures that help people kill themselves .

the city was devastated , and there were enormous casualties among civilians and refugees .
historians have argued about just how many people were killed in the firebombing on the night of feb .
13-14 , 1945 , with estimates ranging from 25,000 to 135,000 .
now , a special commission of a dozen experts , including university professors , archivists and military historians have said that after four years of research , the lower figure is more accurate .
so far , they have confirmed 18,000 deaths and say they have found no reason to assume that the final tally will be significantly higher .
their research is to continue until 2009 .
the team is drawing on archival and official documents , burial records and eye witness reports .
they have ruled out one theory suggesting that the death toll was much higher due to an unknown number of casualties among war refugees .

the city was devastated , and there were enormous casualties among civilians and refugees .
historians have argued about just how many people were killed in the firebombing on the night of feb .
13-14 , 1945 , with estimates ranging from 25,000 to 135,000 .
now , a special commission of a dozen experts , including university professors , archivists and military historians have said that after four years of research , the lower figure is more accurate .
so far , they have confirmed 18,000 deaths and say they have found no reason to assume that the final tally will be significantly higher .
their research is to continue until 2009 .
the team is drawing on archival and official documents , burial records and eye witness reports .
they have ruled out one theory suggesting that the death toll was much higher due to an unknown number of casualties among war refugees .
the authorities kept detailed records of all the victims - both german and foreign , the researchers said . dw staff -lrb- dc -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

germany would send one frigate , said defense minister franz-josef jung . french defense minister herve morin announced that the anti-piracy security operation could begin as soon as next month in the wake of calls from somali president abdullahi yusuf ahmed for the international community to combat rising piracy off the lawless nation 's waters .
" there is very broad european willingness .
many countries want to take part .
ten have clearly given their accord to take part in such a mission , " morin said wednesday , oct .
1 , at the meeting in the french seaside resort of deauville .
" we have given a mandate -lrb- to eu top brass -rrb- to continue the planning for the launch of this operation in the month of november , " he told reporters .
" we will see what means , nato and european , can be added . "
belgium , cyprus , france , germany , lithuania , the netherlands , spain , sweden and possibly britain would be involved in the task force , morin said .
" we have to coordinate between the ships that are in the zone and those we are going to send , " he said , and added that nato countries , particularly the united states , had vessels in the area .
germany has agreed to provide a frigate for the eu naval task force , which will include three frigates , a supply ship and three maritime surveillance ships , defense minister franz-josef jung said at the meeting .
germany to send frigate to somalia bildunterschrift : germany 's " emden " was deployed off somalia as part of operation enduring freedom " i think it 's necessary to counter pirates effectively , " jung told reporters .
" i support a mission that pushes back piracy , secures the seas and ensures free maritime trade . "
piracy is rife and well organized in the region where somalia 's north-eastern tip juts into the indian ocean , preying on a key maritime route leading to the suez canal .
an estimated 30 percent of the world 's oil passes through the territory .
sixty ships have been seized this year alone and somali pirates are currently holding 13 vessels captive with more than 200 sailors .
the pirates operate high-powered speedboats and are heavily armed , sometimes holding ships for weeks until they are released for large ransoms paid by governments or owners .
the somali government was joined in its calls for action by global shipping groups last month which urged the world 's naval powers to do more to stop piracy .
global shipping groups call for action the groups , including the international chamber of shipping , bimco and oil tanker group intercargo , said they were " utterly amazed " governments were unable to secure one of the world 's most important seaways .
they also warned that continued inaction risked causing a repetition of the crisis in the early 1970s when the suez canal was closed and merchant shipping was diverted around the cape of good hope at africa 's southern tip , leading to major consequences for international trade , including higher transport costs and the maintenance of inventories .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : president yusaf warns of consequences for the world somalia 's president yusaf warned in a speech in the capital mogadishu this week that the pirates represented a risk to the whole world . " they -lrb- pirates -rrb- are imposing an embargo on the somali people and the international community because they are blocking movement between the mediterranean and the indian ocean , which affects not only somalia but the whole world , " yusuf told reporters .
" i call on the somali people to fight against the pirates .
i also call on the international community to act quickly on what is happening in somali waters as well as on shore , " he added .
us navy monitor seized arms ship the pirates who seized a belize-flagged freighter with its 21-man crew and 33 soviet-era t-72 battle tanks on board last thursday say they are under 24-hour surveillance from us ships and helicopters .
" we are prepared for any eventuality , " warned pirate spokesman sugule ali by satellite telephone from the ship .
" we are sticking to the demand for $ 20 million .
this is not ransom , but a fine for unlawfully transporting weapons on somali waters , " ali said .

germany would send one frigate , said defense minister franz-josef jung . french defense minister herve morin announced that the anti-piracy security operation could begin as soon as next month in the wake of calls from somali president abdullahi yusuf ahmed for the international community to combat rising piracy off the lawless nation 's waters .
" there is very broad european willingness .
many countries want to take part .
ten have clearly given their accord to take part in such a mission , " morin said wednesday , oct .
1 , at the meeting in the french seaside resort of deauville .
" we have given a mandate -lrb- to eu top brass -rrb- to continue the planning for the launch of this operation in the month of november , " he told reporters .
" we will see what means , nato and european , can be added . "
belgium , cyprus , france , germany , lithuania , the netherlands , spain , sweden and possibly britain would be involved in the task force , morin said .
" we have to coordinate between the ships that are in the zone and those we are going to send , " he said , and added that nato countries , particularly the united states , had vessels in the area .
germany has agreed to provide a frigate for the eu naval task force , which will include three frigates , a supply ship and three maritime surveillance ships , defense minister franz-josef jung said at the meeting .
germany to send frigate to somalia bildunterschrift : germany 's " emden " was deployed off somalia as part of operation enduring freedom " i think it 's necessary to counter pirates effectively , " jung told reporters .
" i support a mission that pushes back piracy , secures the seas and ensures free maritime trade . "
piracy is rife and well organized in the region where somalia 's north-eastern tip juts into the indian ocean , preying on a key maritime route leading to the suez canal .
an estimated 30 percent of the world 's oil passes through the territory .
sixty ships have been seized this year alone and somali pirates are currently holding 13 vessels captive with more than 200 sailors .
the pirates operate high-powered speedboats and are heavily armed , sometimes holding ships for weeks until they are released for large ransoms paid by governments or owners .
the somali government was joined in its calls for action by global shipping groups last month which urged the world 's naval powers to do more to stop piracy .
global shipping groups call for action the groups , including the international chamber of shipping , bimco and oil tanker group intercargo , said they were " utterly amazed " governments were unable to secure one of the world 's most important seaways .
they also warned that continued inaction risked causing a repetition of the crisis in the early 1970s when the suez canal was closed and merchant shipping was diverted around the cape of good hope at africa 's southern tip , leading to major consequences for international trade , including higher transport costs and the maintenance of inventories .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : president yusaf warns of consequences for the world somalia 's president yusaf warned in a speech in the capital mogadishu this week that the pirates represented a risk to the whole world . " they -lrb- pirates -rrb- are imposing an embargo on the somali people and the international community because they are blocking movement between the mediterranean and the indian ocean , which affects not only somalia but the whole world , " yusuf told reporters .
" i call on the somali people to fight against the pirates .
i also call on the international community to act quickly on what is happening in somali waters as well as on shore , " he added .
us navy monitor seized arms ship the pirates who seized a belize-flagged freighter with its 21-man crew and 33 soviet-era t-72 battle tanks on board last thursday say they are under 24-hour surveillance from us ships and helicopters .
" we are prepared for any eventuality , " warned pirate spokesman sugule ali by satellite telephone from the ship .
" we are sticking to the demand for $ 20 million .
this is not ransom , but a fine for unlawfully transporting weapons on somali waters , " ali said .
there are 21 ukrainians , russians and latvians in the crew .
the ship 's captain died of an illness on board , according to russian media .

the law in england and wales states that assisted suicide is a crime punishable with a maximum sentence of 14 years in prison .
purdy fears that her husband , a cuban national , would be treated more harshly were he to accompany her .
she said that if her husband is liable for prosecution , she would travel abroad alone while she is healthy enough to do so - but before she is ready to die .
" i enjoy my life and the people around me , and i do n't want to die until my condition becomes unbearable .
if the law is not clarified , i may be forced to travel abroad alone before i am ready , " she said in a statement .
" i just want clarity so i know whether or not my husband omar will be prosecuted or questioned by the police if i decide to travel abroad and he accompanies me . "
purdy has said she is considering traveling to a clinic run by the swiss right-to-die organization , dignitas .
since 1992 , almost 100 british citizens have ended their lives at the dignitas clinic without their relatives being prosecuted .
purdy and the organization dignity in dying say they want to know if a decision has been made not to prosecute relatives .
in june , two top judges in britain allowed purdy to bring a full judicial review in the case , which her lawyer says may fall within the scope of the european convention on human rights .
the hearing is set to last for two days , and judgment is likely to be reserved until a later date .
hot button issue in germany advocates on both sides of the euthanasia debate in germany will be watching with interest to see how the director of public prosecutions -lrb- dpp -rrb- responds to purdy 's case , as in recent months , assisted suicide has again become a hot button issue .

his participation in her death was strongly condemned by german chancellor angela merkel , who stressed that her christian democratic union -lrb- cdu -rrb- opposed any form of assisted suicide .
bavaria and four other german states are pushing for new laws to ban commercial ventures that help people kill themselves .
many in germany want to prevent the country from following in switzerland 's footsteps .

" with the weakening of demand , upside risks to price stability have diminished somewhat , but they have not disappeared , " trichet said on thursday , oct 2 , in a monthly news conference . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : trichet delivered a somber message euro zone inflation has also fallen to 3.6 percent , though it remains well above the ecb 's target of just below 2 percent . trichet said ecb policymakers recognised " the extraordinary high level of uncertainty stemming from latest developments " on turbulent financial markets and the credit crunch .
" economic activity in the euro area is weakening with contracting domestic demand and tighter financing conditions , " he said . european stocks tumble the financial crisis has brought the world to an extraordinary level of uncertainty and governments must respond with equally unprecedented measures , trichet said thursday . " nothing in the past resembles what we are currently seeing , " he told france 24 news channel .
" we are witnessing events that we have not been seen since world war ii .

eurogroup chief jean-claude juncker called european officials to " put in place a more systematic defense strategy " to protect the 27-nation european union -lrb- eu -rrb- from banking failures , rather than be satisfied " with case by case reactions . " he said the subject would be discussed saturday in paris during a meeting of representatives from britain , france , germany and italy along with european commission president jose manuel barroso , juncker himself , and trichet . germany , france joust over alleged french bailout plan meanwhile , amid calls by the eu commission on wednesday for stronger pan-european cooperation to tackle a raging credit crisis that has lashed banks on the continent , france and germany were at loggerheads over the idea of a us-style bail out for europe . french finance minister christine lagarde told german business daily handelsblatt that a " european safety net " could be needed to prevent a bank in a smaller eu country from going bankrupt . " what happens if a smaller eu state is hit by looming bank collapse ?
maybe this country does not have the means to save the bank .
therefore the question of a european safety net solution comes up , " lagarde told the paper . the comments came ahead of a proposed meeting on the financial crisis by the leaders of europe 's four biggest economies in paris on the weekend .
france currently heads the eu 's rotating presidency . news reports quoted a european official , who did not wish to be named , saying that paris had floated the idea of a 300 billion euro -lrb- $ 440 billion -rrb- rescue fund but lagarde denied the statement from the source in berlin that her government wanted the huge rescue package .

" barroso calls for more " credibility " in eu efforts eu commission president jose manuel barroso said wednesday europe needs to " inject credibility " into its efforts to tackle the current financial crisis , as a major us banking bailout hangs in the balance . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : barroso says europe needs more coordinated regulatory measures to tackle the crisis " we are asking and urging member states for closer cooperation .
it is critically important for confidence in the markets , " barroso said . barroso said the existing system of regulation , based largely on national governments and regulators , could cope with the current crisis , but the european union needed to go further in coordinated action to restore full confidence . " we need a further strengthening of the supervision structures at european level , " he told a news conference on wednesday . rebuffing french calls for eu limits on state aid to be suspended or revised in the light of the crisis , barroso said upholding the competition rules was vital , but the commission would apply them flexibly . dw staff -lrb- sp / kjb / nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" with the weakening of demand , upside risks to price stability have diminished somewhat , but they have not disappeared , " trichet said on thursday , oct 2 , in a monthly news conference . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : trichet delivered a somber message euro zone inflation has also fallen to 3.6 percent , though it remains well above the ecb 's target of just below 2 percent . trichet said ecb policymakers recognised " the extraordinary high level of uncertainty stemming from latest developments " on turbulent financial markets and the credit crunch .
" economic activity in the euro area is weakening with contracting domestic demand and tighter financing conditions , " he said . european stocks tumble the financial crisis has brought the world to an extraordinary level of uncertainty and governments must respond with equally unprecedented measures , trichet said thursday . " nothing in the past resembles what we are currently seeing , " he told france 24 news channel .

eurogroup chief jean-claude juncker called european officials to " put in place a more systematic defense strategy " to protect the 27-nation european union -lrb- eu -rrb- from banking failures , rather than be satisfied " with case by case reactions . " he said the subject would be discussed saturday in paris during a meeting of representatives from britain , france , germany and italy along with european commission president jose manuel barroso , juncker himself , and trichet . germany , france joust over alleged french bailout plan meanwhile , amid calls by the eu commission on wednesday for stronger pan-european cooperation to tackle a raging credit crisis that has lashed banks on the continent , france and germany were at loggerheads over the idea of a us-style bail out for europe . french finance minister christine lagarde told german business daily handelsblatt that a " european safety net " could be needed to prevent a bank in a smaller eu country from going bankrupt . " what happens if a smaller eu state is hit by looming bank collapse ?
maybe this country does not have the means to save the bank .
therefore the question of a european safety net solution comes up , " lagarde told the paper . the comments came ahead of a proposed meeting on the financial crisis by the leaders of europe 's four biggest economies in paris on the weekend .
france currently heads the eu 's rotating presidency . news reports quoted a european official , who did not wish to be named , saying that paris had floated the idea of a 300 billion euro -lrb- $ 440 billion -rrb- rescue fund but lagarde denied the statement from the source in berlin that her government wanted the huge rescue package .

" barroso calls for more " credibility " in eu efforts eu commission president jose manuel barroso said wednesday europe needs to " inject credibility " into its efforts to tackle the current financial crisis , as a major us banking bailout hangs in the balance . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : barroso says europe needs more coordinated regulatory measures to tackle the crisis " we are asking and urging member states for closer cooperation .
it is critically important for confidence in the markets , " barroso said . barroso said the existing system of regulation , based largely on national governments and regulators , could cope with the current crisis , but the european union needed to go further in coordinated action to restore full confidence . " we need a further strengthening of the supervision structures at european level , " he told a news conference on wednesday . rebuffing french calls for eu limits on state aid to be suspended or revised in the light of the crisis , barroso said upholding the competition rules was vital , but the commission would apply them flexibly . dw staff -lrb- sp / kjb / nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de auto industry -pipe- 02.10.2008 paris motor show opens amid industry gloom großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the paris show opened thursday for the press , but the public must wait until saturday the largest motor show on earth opened in paris on thursday as the auto industry attempts to convince the world it is moving forward with an eye on the environment as well as on profit margins . the expo convened amid uncertainty in the auto industry as to how the global credit crisis will affect car sales , and as france proposed earlier this week to weaken european union laws on the amount of carbon dioxide -lrb- co2 -rrb- cars should be allowed to emit .
with exponentially rising petrol prices , new environmental legislation and already falling sales figures , most of the major auto makers were keen to show off their latest lines of hybrids , electro-cars and fuel savers at the biennial mondial de paris car show .
over 360 marquees from 25 countries are represented at the car expo , which attracted some 1.43 million people at the last show in 2006 .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the bugatti veyron 16.4 grand is on display in paris out for public display at this year 's event will be 90 new models and new green technologies from automakers such as toyota , honda , nissan , general motors , peugeot and citroen .
credit crisis to crunch auto sales but behind the veneer and marketing hype , auto executives are worried about what lies ahead for the industry , with fears the latest credit crunch could hit car sales significantly over the next two to three years .
predictions are already dire .
economic forecaster global insight predicts the usually strong selling month of september could see a double-digit decline in sales figures .
" car sales across western europe will slump in september as consumer confidence evaporates in the face of the financial crisis , tougher credit restrictions and inflationary pressures elsewhere , " global insight said in a report published on its web site wednesday .
the forecaster said the once-generous financing deals used by dealerships to tempt buyers into their lots have effectively been dried up by the credit crisis .
" the problem stems from in-house financing divisions ' ability to offer loans and lease deals .
as the credit crisis has all but frozen inter-bank lending , the ability to package and re-sell the resultant consumer loans has left the system paralyzed , " it said .
france seeks more co2 leeway environmental groups on wednesday reacted with outrage to the french proposal to weaken planned european union laws on co2 car emissions .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : french president nicolas sarkozy 's government 's counter-proposal will ease the burden for carmakers on thursday the european parliament 's environment committee voted through a version of a law originally proposed by the eu 's executive , the european commission , demanding that cars sold in the eu emit no more than 120 grams of co2 per kilometer -lrb- g / km -rrb- by 2012 .
penalties for non-compliance should rise to 95 euros -lrb- $ 135.80 -rrb- per g / km for each car sold over the limit by 2015 , and the eu should bring in a target of at least 95 g / km by 2020 , the committee said .
but the french government 's proposal calls for a fine of no more than 80 euros per g / km over the limit and a long-range target " in the range 95-110 g / km . "
moreover , it declares that the law should only apply to the most efficient 60 percent of europe 's new auto fleet when it comes into force in 2012 , with the least efficient cars only coming into the system in 2015 .
the proposal , which would need the backing of the eu 's member states and the european parliament , is now likely to set up a heated political battle as lobbyists on both sides push for a deal before the parliament 's next plenary session on oct .
20-23 .
green groups angered the french government , which currently holds the eu 's rotating presidency , " is giving up any pretence of trying to limit the climate impact of cars , " greenpeace said in a statement wednesday .
the proposal , presented to diplomats tuesday , " totally ignores " the european parliament vote and shows that france is " totally out of touch with the needs of citizens who are desperate to reduce their fuel bills , ” a spokesman for brussels-based group transport and environment told news agency dpa . dw staff -lrb- dm -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the law in england and wales states that assisted suicide is a crime punishable with a maximum sentence of 14 years in prison .
purdy fears that her husband , a cuban national , would be treated more harshly were he to accompany her .
she said that if her husband is liable for prosecution , she would travel abroad alone while she is healthy enough to do so - but before she is ready to die .
" i enjoy my life and the people around me , and i do n't want to die until my condition becomes unbearable .
if the law is not clarified , i may be forced to travel abroad alone before i am ready , " she said in a statement .
" i just want clarity so i know whether or not my husband omar will be prosecuted or questioned by the police if i decide to travel abroad and he accompanies me . "
purdy has said she is considering traveling to a clinic run by the swiss right-to-die organization , dignitas .
since 1992 , almost 100 british citizens have ended their lives at the dignitas clinic without their relatives being prosecuted .
purdy and the organization dignity in dying say they want to know if a decision has been made not to prosecute relatives .
in june , two top judges in britain allowed purdy to bring a full judicial review in the case , which her lawyer says may fall within the scope of the european convention on human rights .
the hearing is set to last for two days , and judgment is likely to be reserved until a later date .
hot button issue in germany advocates on both sides of the euthanasia debate in germany will be watching with interest to see how the director of public prosecutions -lrb- dpp -rrb- responds to purdy 's case , as in recent months , assisted suicide has again become a hot button issue .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : former state senator for justice roger kusch presents a video to journalists about the medically assisted suicide of bettina schardt in wuerzburg in july , former hamburg justice senator and right-to-die campaigner roger kusch , said he had assisted a 79-year-old woman who committed suicide despite the fact that she had no life-threatening disease or great amount of pain .
his participation in her death was strongly condemned by german chancellor angela merkel , who stressed that her christian democratic union -lrb- cdu -rrb- opposed any form of assisted suicide .
bavaria and four other german states are pushing for new laws to ban commercial ventures that help people kill themselves .
many in germany want to prevent the country from following in switzerland 's footsteps .

smei is expected to have annual revenues of 3 billion euros -lrb- $ 4 billion -rrb- and to employ a staff of around 6,000 .
bertelsmann , based in guetersloh , germany , said it would keep the bmg brand and gear its remaining music business to music rights management , representing artists and authors mainly in europe .
bmg rights management would retain " selected european music catalogues " with the work of more than 200 artists which had been managed by the joint venture with sony .

with exponentially rising petrol prices , new environmental legislation and already falling sales figures , most of the major auto makers were keen to show off their latest lines of hybrids , electro-cars and fuel savers at the biennial mondial de paris car show .
over 360 marquees from 25 countries are represented at the car expo , which attracted some 1.43 million people at the last show in 2006 .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the bugatti veyron 16.4 grand is on display in paris out for public display at this year 's event will be 90 new models and new green technologies from automakers such as toyota , honda , nissan , general motors , peugeot and citroen .
credit crisis to crunch auto sales but behind the veneer and marketing hype , auto executives are worried about what lies ahead for the industry , with fears the latest credit crunch could hit car sales significantly over the next two to three years .
predictions are already dire .
economic forecaster global insight predicts the usually strong selling month of september could see a double-digit decline in sales figures .
" car sales across western europe will slump in september as consumer confidence evaporates in the face of the financial crisis , tougher credit restrictions and inflationary pressures elsewhere , " global insight said in a report published on its web site wednesday .
the forecaster said the once-generous financing deals used by dealerships to tempt buyers into their lots have effectively been dried up by the credit crisis .
" the problem stems from in-house financing divisions ' ability to offer loans and lease deals .
as the credit crisis has all but frozen inter-bank lending , the ability to package and re-sell the resultant consumer loans has left the system paralyzed , " it said .
france seeks more co2 leeway environmental groups on wednesday reacted with outrage to the french proposal to weaken planned european union laws on co2 car emissions .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : french president nicolas sarkozy 's government 's counter-proposal will ease the burden for carmakers on thursday the european parliament 's environment committee voted through a version of a law originally proposed by the eu 's executive , the european commission , demanding that cars sold in the eu emit no more than 120 grams of co2 per kilometer -lrb- g / km -rrb- by 2012 .
penalties for non-compliance should rise to 95 euros -lrb- $ 135.80 -rrb- per g / km for each car sold over the limit by 2015 , and the eu should bring in a target of at least 95 g / km by 2020 , the committee said .
but the french government 's proposal calls for a fine of no more than 80 euros per g / km over the limit and a long-range target " in the range 95-110 g / km . "
moreover , it declares that the law should only apply to the most efficient 60 percent of europe 's new auto fleet when it comes into force in 2012 , with the least efficient cars only coming into the system in 2015 .
the proposal , which would need the backing of the eu 's member states and the european parliament , is now likely to set up a heated political battle as lobbyists on both sides push for a deal before the parliament 's next plenary session on oct .
20-23 .
green groups angered the french government , which currently holds the eu 's rotating presidency , " is giving up any pretence of trying to limit the climate impact of cars , " greenpeace said in a statement wednesday .
the proposal , presented to diplomats tuesday , " totally ignores " the european parliament vote and shows that france is " totally out of touch with the needs of citizens who are desperate to reduce their fuel bills , ” a spokesman for brussels-based group transport and environment told news agency dpa . dw staff -lrb- dm -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

this year , however , all eyes will be on the leaders of the two nations as they join the forum , to see how they interact in the wake of the recent war in georgia .
merkel had joined a host of western critics who said the war had made normal dealings with russia impossible , and called for ties to be reviewed .
still , she has backed a deal negotiated by french president nicolas sarkozy , under which russia agreed to pull out of undisputed georgian territories by oct .
10 once eu monitors had been deployed in the region .
and despite her condemnation of russia 's actions in georgia , she has distinguished herself among her eu counterparts by insisting the lines of communication with moscow remain open .
thursday 's talks with medvedev are expected to touch on the eu monitoring mission in " buffer zones " around south ossetia and fellow rebel enclave abkhazia .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany and russia have enjoyed close relations in the past but according to kremlin sources , the russian leader is also expected to show that his country has not been isolated in europe by focusing on developing further political and economic ties , including the ambitious north stream project - a gas pipeline to deliver gas from siberia to europe beneath the baltic sea .
germany is russia 's single biggest trading partner with bilateral turnover set to reach 43 billion euros -lrb- $ 60 billion -rrb- this year .
some 4,600 german firms have subsidiaries in russia and every fourth machine imported by russia is made in germany .
" the meeting is aimed at confirming the stability and maturity of the russian-german partnership free from political fluctuations , " a kremlin source told reporters ahead of the forum .
council of europe keeps dialogue open russia still could face consequences in europe for its actions in august during the conflict with georgia .
on wednesday , secretary general of the council of europe terry davis said the organization would examine allegations of human rights violations during the war .
the european court of human rights in strasbourg had received " more than 1,700 complaints " from the region , he added .
court officials told news agency afp that the vast majority of the complaints had been made by south ossetians against georgia .
diplomats in strasbourg added that it was possible the complaints were part of an orchestrated campaign against tbilisi .
however , the council of europe , which is not related to the european union , voted against withdrawing russia 's voting rights after a request to do so by two dozen members .
swiss member andreas gross said the vote signified willingness to maintain " dialogue between us and the two countries . "
a council report published on monday found both moscow and tbilisi were responsible for the conflict 's escalation into " open and fully-fledged warfare . " dw staff -lrb- dc -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the law in england and wales states that assisted suicide is a crime punishable with a maximum sentence of 14 years in prison .
purdy fears that her husband , a cuban national , would be treated more harshly were he to accompany her .
she said that if her husband is liable for prosecution , she would travel abroad alone while she is healthy enough to do so - but before she is ready to die .
" i enjoy my life and the people around me , and i do n't want to die until my condition becomes unbearable .

the interpretation of what he said had been " politically wrong , " he told reporters .
about 50 nations , including germany , have recognized kosovo as independent , whereas serbia insists kosovo still belongs to it . tadic said belgrade would never recognize its independence , but was making an effort to shift the kosovo issue " from the political corner to the legal corner " by taking it to the international court of justice .
he said it was asking the united nations to refer the matter to the court in the hague .
about 100,000 ethnic serbs live in kosovo and their towns have largely rejected government by pristina .
the tadic visit to berlin was seen as part of the president 's efforts to develop closer ties with the european union .

with exponentially rising petrol prices , new environmental legislation and already falling sales figures , most of the major auto makers were keen to show off their latest lines of hybrids , electro-cars and fuel savers at the biennial mondial de paris car show .
over 360 marquees from 25 countries are represented at the car expo , which attracted some 1.43 million people at the last show in 2006 .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the bugatti veyron 16.4 grand is on display in paris out for public display at this year 's event will be 90 new models and new green technologies from automakers such as toyota , honda , nissan , general motors , peugeot and citroen .
credit crisis to crunch auto sales but behind the veneer and marketing hype , auto executives are worried about what lies ahead for the industry , with fears the latest credit crunch could hit car sales significantly over the next two to three years .
predictions are already dire .
economic forecaster global insight predicts the usually strong selling month of september could see a double-digit decline in sales figures .
" car sales across western europe will slump in september as consumer confidence evaporates in the face of the financial crisis , tougher credit restrictions and inflationary pressures elsewhere , " global insight said in a report published on its web site wednesday .
the forecaster said the once-generous financing deals used by dealerships to tempt buyers into their lots have effectively been dried up by the credit crisis .
" the problem stems from in-house financing divisions ' ability to offer loans and lease deals .
as the credit crisis has all but frozen inter-bank lending , the ability to package and re-sell the resultant consumer loans has left the system paralyzed , " it said .
france seeks more co2 leeway environmental groups on wednesday reacted with outrage to the french proposal to weaken planned european union laws on co2 car emissions .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : french president nicolas sarkozy 's government 's counter-proposal will ease the burden for carmakers on thursday the european parliament 's environment committee voted through a version of a law originally proposed by the eu 's executive , the european commission , demanding that cars sold in the eu emit no more than 120 grams of co2 per kilometer -lrb- g / km -rrb- by 2012 .
penalties for non-compliance should rise to 95 euros -lrb- $ 135.80 -rrb- per g / km for each car sold over the limit by 2015 , and the eu should bring in a target of at least 95 g / km by 2020 , the committee said .
but the french government 's proposal calls for a fine of no more than 80 euros per g / km over the limit and a long-range target " in the range 95-110 g / km . "
moreover , it declares that the law should only apply to the most efficient 60 percent of europe 's new auto fleet when it comes into force in 2012 , with the least efficient cars only coming into the system in 2015 .
the proposal , which would need the backing of the eu 's member states and the european parliament , is now likely to set up a heated political battle as lobbyists on both sides push for a deal before the parliament 's next plenary session on oct .
20-23 .
green groups angered the french government , which currently holds the eu 's rotating presidency , " is giving up any pretence of trying to limit the climate impact of cars , " greenpeace said in a statement wednesday .
the proposal , presented to diplomats tuesday , " totally ignores " the european parliament vote and shows that france is " totally out of touch with the needs of citizens who are desperate to reduce their fuel bills , ” a spokesman for brussels-based group transport and environment told news agency dpa . dw staff -lrb- dm -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

smei is expected to have annual revenues of 3 billion euros -lrb- $ 4 billion -rrb- and to employ a staff of around 6,000 .
bertelsmann , based in guetersloh , germany , said it would keep the bmg brand and gear its remaining music business to music rights management , representing artists and authors mainly in europe .
bmg rights management would retain " selected european music catalogues " with the work of more than 200 artists which had been managed by the joint venture with sony .

the city was devastated , and there were enormous casualties among civilians and refugees .
historians have argued about just how many people were killed in the firebombing on the night of feb .
13-14 , 1945 , with estimates ranging from 25,000 to 135,000 .
now , a special commission of a dozen experts , including university professors , archivists and military historians have said that after four years of research , the lower figure is more accurate .
so far , they have confirmed 18,000 deaths and say they have found no reason to assume that the final tally will be significantly higher .
their research is to continue until 2009 .
the team is drawing on archival and official documents , burial records and eye witness reports .
they have ruled out one theory suggesting that the death toll was much higher due to an unknown number of casualties among war refugees .
the authorities kept detailed records of all the victims - both german and foreign , the researchers said . dw staff -lrb- dc -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the interpretation of what he said had been " politically wrong , " he told reporters .
about 50 nations , including germany , have recognized kosovo as independent , whereas serbia insists kosovo still belongs to it . tadic said belgrade would never recognize its independence , but was making an effort to shift the kosovo issue " from the political corner to the legal corner " by taking it to the international court of justice .
he said it was asking the united nations to refer the matter to the court in the hague .
about 100,000 ethnic serbs live in kosovo and their towns have largely rejected government by pristina .
the tadic visit to berlin was seen as part of the president 's efforts to develop closer ties with the european union .

the interpretation of what he said had been " politically wrong , " he told reporters .
about 50 nations , including germany , have recognized kosovo as independent , whereas serbia insists kosovo still belongs to it . tadic said belgrade would never recognize its independence , but was making an effort to shift the kosovo issue " from the political corner to the legal corner " by taking it to the international court of justice .
he said it was asking the united nations to refer the matter to the court in the hague .
about 100,000 ethnic serbs live in kosovo and their towns have largely rejected government by pristina .
the tadic visit to berlin was seen as part of the president 's efforts to develop closer ties with the european union .
he was also meeting with german foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier . dpa news agency -lrb- kjb -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the interpretation of what he said had been " politically wrong , " he told reporters .
about 50 nations , including germany , have recognized kosovo as independent , whereas serbia insists kosovo still belongs to it . tadic said belgrade would never recognize its independence , but was making an effort to shift the kosovo issue " from the political corner to the legal corner " by taking it to the international court of justice .
he said it was asking the united nations to refer the matter to the court in the hague .
about 100,000 ethnic serbs live in kosovo and their towns have largely rejected government by pristina .
the tadic visit to berlin was seen as part of the president 's efforts to develop closer ties with the european union .

germany would send one frigate , said defense minister franz-josef jung . french defense minister herve morin announced that the anti-piracy security operation could begin as soon as next month in the wake of calls from somali president abdullahi yusuf ahmed for the international community to combat rising piracy off the lawless nation 's waters .
" there is very broad european willingness .
many countries want to take part .
ten have clearly given their accord to take part in such a mission , " morin said wednesday , oct .
1 , at the meeting in the french seaside resort of deauville .
" we have given a mandate -lrb- to eu top brass -rrb- to continue the planning for the launch of this operation in the month of november , " he told reporters .
" we will see what means , nato and european , can be added . "
belgium , cyprus , france , germany , lithuania , the netherlands , spain , sweden and possibly britain would be involved in the task force , morin said .
" we have to coordinate between the ships that are in the zone and those we are going to send , " he said , and added that nato countries , particularly the united states , had vessels in the area .
germany has agreed to provide a frigate for the eu naval task force , which will include three frigates , a supply ship and three maritime surveillance ships , defense minister franz-josef jung said at the meeting .
germany to send frigate to somalia bildunterschrift : germany 's " emden " was deployed off somalia as part of operation enduring freedom " i think it 's necessary to counter pirates effectively , " jung told reporters .
" i support a mission that pushes back piracy , secures the seas and ensures free maritime trade . "
piracy is rife and well organized in the region where somalia 's north-eastern tip juts into the indian ocean , preying on a key maritime route leading to the suez canal .

" we have given a mandate -lrb- to eu top brass -rrb- to continue the planning for the launch of this operation in the month of november , " he told reporters .
" we will see what means , nato and european , can be added . "
belgium , cyprus , france , germany , lithuania , the netherlands , spain , sweden and possibly britain would be involved in the task force , morin said .
" we have to coordinate between the ships that are in the zone and those we are going to send , " he said , and added that nato countries , particularly the united states , had vessels in the area .
germany has agreed to provide a frigate for the eu naval task force , which will include three frigates , a supply ship and three maritime surveillance ships , defense minister franz-josef jung said at the meeting .
germany to send frigate to somalia bildunterschrift : germany 's " emden " was deployed off somalia as part of operation enduring freedom " i think it 's necessary to counter pirates effectively , " jung told reporters .
" i support a mission that pushes back piracy , secures the seas and ensures free maritime trade . "
piracy is rife and well organized in the region where somalia 's north-eastern tip juts into the indian ocean , preying on a key maritime route leading to the suez canal .
an estimated 30 percent of the world 's oil passes through the territory .
sixty ships have been seized this year alone and somali pirates are currently holding 13 vessels captive with more than 200 sailors .
the pirates operate high-powered speedboats and are heavily armed , sometimes holding ships for weeks until they are released for large ransoms paid by governments or owners .
the somali government was joined in its calls for action by global shipping groups last month which urged the world 's naval powers to do more to stop piracy .
global shipping groups call for action the groups , including the international chamber of shipping , bimco and oil tanker group intercargo , said they were " utterly amazed " governments were unable to secure one of the world 's most important seaways .
they also warned that continued inaction risked causing a repetition of the crisis in the early 1970s when the suez canal was closed and merchant shipping was diverted around the cape of good hope at africa 's southern tip , leading to major consequences for international trade , including higher transport costs and the maintenance of inventories .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : president yusaf warns of consequences for the world somalia 's president yusaf warned in a speech in the capital mogadishu this week that the pirates represented a risk to the whole world . " they -lrb- pirates -rrb- are imposing an embargo on the somali people and the international community because they are blocking movement between the mediterranean and the indian ocean , which affects not only somalia but the whole world , " yusuf told reporters .
" i call on the somali people to fight against the pirates .
i also call on the international community to act quickly on what is happening in somali waters as well as on shore , " he added .
us navy monitor seized arms ship the pirates who seized a belize-flagged freighter with its 21-man crew and 33 soviet-era t-72 battle tanks on board last thursday say they are under 24-hour surveillance from us ships and helicopters .
" we are prepared for any eventuality , " warned pirate spokesman sugule ali by satellite telephone from the ship .
" we are sticking to the demand for $ 20 million .
this is not ransom , but a fine for unlawfully transporting weapons on somali waters , " ali said .
there are 21 ukrainians , russians and latvians in the crew .
the ship 's captain died of an illness on board , according to russian media .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the " faina " is carrying a consignment of army tanks the bahrain-based us navy fifth fleet said several ships and helicopters were in the area to support the destroyer uss howard as it observed its target , now docked at the somali port village of hobyo .
abdikadir musa yusuf , deputy seaports minister for the somali breakaway region of puntland , said , " there are negotiations going on between the pirates and the foreign ships . "
the pentagon said it wanted a peaceful resolution and us warships were there to make sure pirates do not make off with its military cargo .
" but at this point , what we are most concerned about is seeing a peaceful solution to this problem , " pentagon spokesman geoff morrell said , adding that the us navy was not negotiating with the pirates .
he said the main us concern was " that this cargo does not end up in the hands of anyone who would use it in a way that would be destabilizing to the region .

the city was devastated , and there were enormous casualties among civilians and refugees .
historians have argued about just how many people were killed in the firebombing on the night of feb .
13-14 , 1945 , with estimates ranging from 25,000 to 135,000 .
now , a special commission of a dozen experts , including university professors , archivists and military historians have said that after four years of research , the lower figure is more accurate .
so far , they have confirmed 18,000 deaths and say they have found no reason to assume that the final tally will be significantly higher .
their research is to continue until 2009 .
the team is drawing on archival and official documents , burial records and eye witness reports .
they have ruled out one theory suggesting that the death toll was much higher due to an unknown number of casualties among war refugees .
the authorities kept detailed records of all the victims - both german and foreign , the researchers said . dw staff -lrb- dc -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

this year , however , all eyes will be on the leaders of the two nations as they join the forum , to see how they interact in the wake of the recent war in georgia .
merkel had joined a host of western critics who said the war had made normal dealings with russia impossible , and called for ties to be reviewed .
still , she has backed a deal negotiated by french president nicolas sarkozy , under which russia agreed to pull out of undisputed georgian territories by oct .
10 once eu monitors had been deployed in the region .
and despite her condemnation of russia 's actions in georgia , she has distinguished herself among her eu counterparts by insisting the lines of communication with moscow remain open .
thursday 's talks with medvedev are expected to touch on the eu monitoring mission in " buffer zones " around south ossetia and fellow rebel enclave abkhazia .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany and russia have enjoyed close relations in the past but according to kremlin sources , the russian leader is also expected to show that his country has not been isolated in europe by focusing on developing further political and economic ties , including the ambitious north stream project - a gas pipeline to deliver gas from siberia to europe beneath the baltic sea .
germany is russia 's single biggest trading partner with bilateral turnover set to reach 43 billion euros -lrb- $ 60 billion -rrb- this year .
some 4,600 german firms have subsidiaries in russia and every fourth machine imported by russia is made in germany .
" the meeting is aimed at confirming the stability and maturity of the russian-german partnership free from political fluctuations , " a kremlin source told reporters ahead of the forum .
council of europe keeps dialogue open russia still could face consequences in europe for its actions in august during the conflict with georgia .
on wednesday , secretary general of the council of europe terry davis said the organization would examine allegations of human rights violations during the war .
the european court of human rights in strasbourg had received " more than 1,700 complaints " from the region , he added .
court officials told news agency afp that the vast majority of the complaints had been made by south ossetians against georgia .
diplomats in strasbourg added that it was possible the complaints were part of an orchestrated campaign against tbilisi .
however , the council of europe , which is not related to the european union , voted against withdrawing russia 's voting rights after a request to do so by two dozen members .
swiss member andreas gross said the vote signified willingness to maintain " dialogue between us and the two countries . "
a council report published on monday found both moscow and tbilisi were responsible for the conflict 's escalation into " open and fully-fledged warfare . " dw staff -lrb- dc -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the city was devastated , and there were enormous casualties among civilians and refugees .
historians have argued about just how many people were killed in the firebombing on the night of feb .
13-14 , 1945 , with estimates ranging from 25,000 to 135,000 .
now , a special commission of a dozen experts , including university professors , archivists and military historians have said that after four years of research , the lower figure is more accurate .
so far , they have confirmed 18,000 deaths and say they have found no reason to assume that the final tally will be significantly higher .
their research is to continue until 2009 .
the team is drawing on archival and official documents , burial records and eye witness reports .
they have ruled out one theory suggesting that the death toll was much higher due to an unknown number of casualties among war refugees .
the authorities kept detailed records of all the victims - both german and foreign , the researchers said . dw staff -lrb- dc -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de regulation -pipe- 02.10.2008 landmark assisted suicide case begins in uk großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : assisted suicide is a hot button issue in many european countries in a case which could affect the european convention on human rights , a woman with multiple sclerosis has launched a bid in london 's high court to clarify the law on assisted suicide . debbie purdy , 45 , wants assurance that her husband can not be prosecuted for helping her travel to switzerland to end her life at some stage in the future .
the law in england and wales states that assisted suicide is a crime punishable with a maximum sentence of 14 years in prison .
purdy fears that her husband , a cuban national , would be treated more harshly were he to accompany her .
she said that if her husband is liable for prosecution , she would travel abroad alone while she is healthy enough to do so - but before she is ready to die .
" i enjoy my life and the people around me , and i do n't want to die until my condition becomes unbearable .
if the law is not clarified , i may be forced to travel abroad alone before i am ready , " she said in a statement .
" i just want clarity so i know whether or not my husband omar will be prosecuted or questioned by the police if i decide to travel abroad and he accompanies me . "
purdy has said she is considering traveling to a clinic run by the swiss right-to-die organization , dignitas .
since 1992 , almost 100 british citizens have ended their lives at the dignitas clinic without their relatives being prosecuted .
purdy and the organization dignity in dying say they want to know if a decision has been made not to prosecute relatives .
in june , two top judges in britain allowed purdy to bring a full judicial review in the case , which her lawyer says may fall within the scope of the european convention on human rights .
the hearing is set to last for two days , and judgment is likely to be reserved until a later date .
hot button issue in germany advocates on both sides of the euthanasia debate in germany will be watching with interest to see how the director of public prosecutions -lrb- dpp -rrb- responds to purdy 's case , as in recent months , assisted suicide has again become a hot button issue .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : former state senator for justice roger kusch presents a video to journalists about the medically assisted suicide of bettina schardt in wuerzburg in july , former hamburg justice senator and right-to-die campaigner roger kusch , said he had assisted a 79-year-old woman who committed suicide despite the fact that she had no life-threatening disease or great amount of pain .
his participation in her death was strongly condemned by german chancellor angela merkel , who stressed that her christian democratic union -lrb- cdu -rrb- opposed any form of assisted suicide .
bavaria and four other german states are pushing for new laws to ban commercial ventures that help people kill themselves .
many in germany want to prevent the country from following in switzerland 's footsteps .
opponents to assisted suicide say that liberal swiss laws on euthanasia have led to a bustling trade in assisted suicide with the help of organizations like dignitas . dw staff -lrb- dc -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

germany would send one frigate , said defense minister franz-josef jung . french defense minister herve morin announced that the anti-piracy security operation could begin as soon as next month in the wake of calls from somali president abdullahi yusuf ahmed for the international community to combat rising piracy off the lawless nation 's waters .
" there is very broad european willingness .
many countries want to take part .
ten have clearly given their accord to take part in such a mission , " morin said wednesday , oct .
1 , at the meeting in the french seaside resort of deauville .
" we have given a mandate -lrb- to eu top brass -rrb- to continue the planning for the launch of this operation in the month of november , " he told reporters .
" we will see what means , nato and european , can be added . "
belgium , cyprus , france , germany , lithuania , the netherlands , spain , sweden and possibly britain would be involved in the task force , morin said .
" we have to coordinate between the ships that are in the zone and those we are going to send , " he said , and added that nato countries , particularly the united states , had vessels in the area .
germany has agreed to provide a frigate for the eu naval task force , which will include three frigates , a supply ship and three maritime surveillance ships , defense minister franz-josef jung said at the meeting .
germany to send frigate to somalia bildunterschrift : germany 's " emden " was deployed off somalia as part of operation enduring freedom " i think it 's necessary to counter pirates effectively , " jung told reporters .
" i support a mission that pushes back piracy , secures the seas and ensures free maritime trade . "
piracy is rife and well organized in the region where somalia 's north-eastern tip juts into the indian ocean , preying on a key maritime route leading to the suez canal .
an estimated 30 percent of the world 's oil passes through the territory .
sixty ships have been seized this year alone and somali pirates are currently holding 13 vessels captive with more than 200 sailors .
the pirates operate high-powered speedboats and are heavily armed , sometimes holding ships for weeks until they are released for large ransoms paid by governments or owners .
the somali government was joined in its calls for action by global shipping groups last month which urged the world 's naval powers to do more to stop piracy .
global shipping groups call for action the groups , including the international chamber of shipping , bimco and oil tanker group intercargo , said they were " utterly amazed " governments were unable to secure one of the world 's most important seaways .
they also warned that continued inaction risked causing a repetition of the crisis in the early 1970s when the suez canal was closed and merchant shipping was diverted around the cape of good hope at africa 's southern tip , leading to major consequences for international trade , including higher transport costs and the maintenance of inventories .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : president yusaf warns of consequences for the world somalia 's president yusaf warned in a speech in the capital mogadishu this week that the pirates represented a risk to the whole world . " they -lrb- pirates -rrb- are imposing an embargo on the somali people and the international community because they are blocking movement between the mediterranean and the indian ocean , which affects not only somalia but the whole world , " yusuf told reporters .
" i call on the somali people to fight against the pirates .
i also call on the international community to act quickly on what is happening in somali waters as well as on shore , " he added .
us navy monitor seized arms ship the pirates who seized a belize-flagged freighter with its 21-man crew and 33 soviet-era t-72 battle tanks on board last thursday say they are under 24-hour surveillance from us ships and helicopters .
" we are prepared for any eventuality , " warned pirate spokesman sugule ali by satellite telephone from the ship .
" we are sticking to the demand for $ 20 million .
this is not ransom , but a fine for unlawfully transporting weapons on somali waters , " ali said .
there are 21 ukrainians , russians and latvians in the crew .
the ship 's captain died of an illness on board , according to russian media .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the " faina " is carrying a consignment of army tanks the bahrain-based us navy fifth fleet said several ships and helicopters were in the area to support the destroyer uss howard as it observed its target , now docked at the somali port village of hobyo .
abdikadir musa yusuf , deputy seaports minister for the somali breakaway region of puntland , said , " there are negotiations going on between the pirates and the foreign ships . "
the pentagon said it wanted a peaceful resolution and us warships were there to make sure pirates do not make off with its military cargo .
" but at this point , what we are most concerned about is seeing a peaceful solution to this problem , " pentagon spokesman geoff morrell said , adding that the us navy was not negotiating with the pirates .
he said the main us concern was " that this cargo does not end up in the hands of anyone who would use it in a way that would be destabilizing to the region .

" if we are talking about a european defence industry , we must accept the idea that not everybody is doing the same thing as everybody else , " morin said .
" for example , we could do some work in france and other work elsewhere , and then pool together . "
french president nicolas sarkozy , whose country holds the rotating eu presidency , said wednesday that europe lacked the " appropriate measures to enact its defense policies . "
he said indirectly that europe risked losing political power if it was unable to defend itself .
at the heart of sarkozy 's military agenda is a desire to see europe able to stand alone if need be .
in line with this goal , the defense ministers committed at the meeting to filling key military shortfalls such as a lack of transport aircraft and helicopters , better troop protection and the ability to gather intelligence , including by satellite .
the key decisions made at the deauville meeting are to be finalized in brussels on nov .

integrated european defense manufacturing bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : production of the airbus a400m has been delayed by up to two years but there was growing evidence in deauville that eu leaders were warming to the idea that more could be done together , particularly at a time of economic slowdown .
one such example of cooperation is that concerning the a400m military transport aircraft , the components of which are being built by airbus in six countries : belgium - flaps - britain - flaps and outer wing box - france - nose fuselage and rudder - germany - fuselage - spain - tail - and turkey - ailerons and spoilers .
production has fallen behind , however , and delivery of the a400m 's may take two years longer than originally scheduled , according to reports .
military erasmus a majority of eu countries also backed french plans for an exchange program involving young military officers .
inspired by the erasmus student exchange program , it would see officers from one member state spend some time training in another european country .
the project aims to increase cooperation between military colleges in order to improve interoperability and mould a common european defence culture , morin said .
however , some ministers expressed concern that such a program could turn into a one-way travelling system , whereby officers from poorer member states would want to spend time in some of europe 's best colleges , and fewer officers from richer states would be willing to train in countries such as romania or bulgaria . dpa news agency -lrb- dm -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

with exponentially rising petrol prices , new environmental legislation and already falling sales figures , most of the major auto makers were keen to show off their latest lines of hybrids , electro-cars and fuel savers at the biennial mondial de paris car show .
over 360 marquees from 25 countries are represented at the car expo , which attracted some 1.43 million people at the last show in 2006 .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the bugatti veyron 16.4 grand is on display in paris out for public display at this year 's event will be 90 new models and new green technologies from automakers such as toyota , honda , nissan , general motors , peugeot and citroen .
credit crisis to crunch auto sales but behind the veneer and marketing hype , auto executives are worried about what lies ahead for the industry , with fears the latest credit crunch could hit car sales significantly over the next two to three years .
predictions are already dire .
economic forecaster global insight predicts the usually strong selling month of september could see a double-digit decline in sales figures .
" car sales across western europe will slump in september as consumer confidence evaporates in the face of the financial crisis , tougher credit restrictions and inflationary pressures elsewhere , " global insight said in a report published on its web site wednesday .
the forecaster said the once-generous financing deals used by dealerships to tempt buyers into their lots have effectively been dried up by the credit crisis .
" the problem stems from in-house financing divisions ' ability to offer loans and lease deals .
as the credit crisis has all but frozen inter-bank lending , the ability to package and re-sell the resultant consumer loans has left the system paralyzed , " it said .
france seeks more co2 leeway environmental groups on wednesday reacted with outrage to the french proposal to weaken planned european union laws on co2 car emissions .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : french president nicolas sarkozy 's government 's counter-proposal will ease the burden for carmakers on thursday the european parliament 's environment committee voted through a version of a law originally proposed by the eu 's executive , the european commission , demanding that cars sold in the eu emit no more than 120 grams of co2 per kilometer -lrb- g / km -rrb- by 2012 .
penalties for non-compliance should rise to 95 euros -lrb- $ 135.80 -rrb- per g / km for each car sold over the limit by 2015 , and the eu should bring in a target of at least 95 g / km by 2020 , the committee said .
but the french government 's proposal calls for a fine of no more than 80 euros per g / km over the limit and a long-range target " in the range 95-110 g / km . "
moreover , it declares that the law should only apply to the most efficient 60 percent of europe 's new auto fleet when it comes into force in 2012 , with the least efficient cars only coming into the system in 2015 .
the proposal , which would need the backing of the eu 's member states and the european parliament , is now likely to set up a heated political battle as lobbyists on both sides push for a deal before the parliament 's next plenary session on oct .

green groups angered the french government , which currently holds the eu 's rotating presidency , " is giving up any pretence of trying to limit the climate impact of cars , " greenpeace said in a statement wednesday .

the city was devastated , and there were enormous casualties among civilians and refugees .
historians have argued about just how many people were killed in the firebombing on the night of feb .
13-14 , 1945 , with estimates ranging from 25,000 to 135,000 .
now , a special commission of a dozen experts , including university professors , archivists and military historians have said that after four years of research , the lower figure is more accurate .
so far , they have confirmed 18,000 deaths and say they have found no reason to assume that the final tally will be significantly higher .
their research is to continue until 2009 .
the team is drawing on archival and official documents , burial records and eye witness reports .
they have ruled out one theory suggesting that the death toll was much higher due to an unknown number of casualties among war refugees .

the law in england and wales states that assisted suicide is a crime punishable with a maximum sentence of 14 years in prison .
purdy fears that her husband , a cuban national , would be treated more harshly were he to accompany her .
she said that if her husband is liable for prosecution , she would travel abroad alone while she is healthy enough to do so - but before she is ready to die .
" i enjoy my life and the people around me , and i do n't want to die until my condition becomes unbearable .
if the law is not clarified , i may be forced to travel abroad alone before i am ready , " she said in a statement .
" i just want clarity so i know whether or not my husband omar will be prosecuted or questioned by the police if i decide to travel abroad and he accompanies me . "
purdy has said she is considering traveling to a clinic run by the swiss right-to-die organization , dignitas .
since 1992 , almost 100 british citizens have ended their lives at the dignitas clinic without their relatives being prosecuted .
purdy and the organization dignity in dying say they want to know if a decision has been made not to prosecute relatives .
in june , two top judges in britain allowed purdy to bring a full judicial review in the case , which her lawyer says may fall within the scope of the european convention on human rights .
the hearing is set to last for two days , and judgment is likely to be reserved until a later date .
hot button issue in germany advocates on both sides of the euthanasia debate in germany will be watching with interest to see how the director of public prosecutions -lrb- dpp -rrb- responds to purdy 's case , as in recent months , assisted suicide has again become a hot button issue .

his participation in her death was strongly condemned by german chancellor angela merkel , who stressed that her christian democratic union -lrb- cdu -rrb- opposed any form of assisted suicide .
bavaria and four other german states are pushing for new laws to ban commercial ventures that help people kill themselves .

the law in england and wales states that assisted suicide is a crime punishable with a maximum sentence of 14 years in prison .
purdy fears that her husband , a cuban national , would be treated more harshly were he to accompany her .
she said that if her husband is liable for prosecution , she would travel abroad alone while she is healthy enough to do so - but before she is ready to die .
" i enjoy my life and the people around me , and i do n't want to die until my condition becomes unbearable .
if the law is not clarified , i may be forced to travel abroad alone before i am ready , " she said in a statement .
" i just want clarity so i know whether or not my husband omar will be prosecuted or questioned by the police if i decide to travel abroad and he accompanies me . "
purdy has said she is considering traveling to a clinic run by the swiss right-to-die organization , dignitas .
since 1992 , almost 100 british citizens have ended their lives at the dignitas clinic without their relatives being prosecuted .
purdy and the organization dignity in dying say they want to know if a decision has been made not to prosecute relatives .
in june , two top judges in britain allowed purdy to bring a full judicial review in the case , which her lawyer says may fall within the scope of the european convention on human rights .
the hearing is set to last for two days , and judgment is likely to be reserved until a later date .
hot button issue in germany advocates on both sides of the euthanasia debate in germany will be watching with interest to see how the director of public prosecutions -lrb- dpp -rrb- responds to purdy 's case , as in recent months , assisted suicide has again become a hot button issue .

his participation in her death was strongly condemned by german chancellor angela merkel , who stressed that her christian democratic union -lrb- cdu -rrb- opposed any form of assisted suicide .
bavaria and four other german states are pushing for new laws to ban commercial ventures that help people kill themselves .

" if the united states has a rescue plan , europe should be ready to offer similar solutions , " he said , as quoted by dow jones newswires .
but peter struck , head of the german social democratic party 's parliamentary group , castigated the head of germany 's largest bank for his comments , saying he " felt contempt " for the " type of opportunism " shown by ackermann .
" as long as the banks were on course for making profits , mr. ackermann was the one screaming loudest that the state shouldn ’ t get involved , " struck told news agency dpa , adding that ackermann 's tune has changed now that profits are threatened by the credit crisis .
struck said that attitude made it particularly irksome that the head of germany ’ s leading bank is " now the first to call for massive aid from taxpayer funds " to help prop up crumbling financial institutions .
no bailout for europe bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german chancellor angela merkel has strongly opposed any europe-wide bailout strategy complementing struck 's talk down of ackermann were comments made by chancellor angela merkel , who said : " the alliance will not issue any blank checks to banks , whether they behave responsibly or not . "
merkel said she favoured " better protection and early warning systems " over a bailout package , insisting european banking regulations needed upgrading .
" it can not be that … in finance markets , several billion products exist to which no sufficient rules count , " she said .
at a european level , there also seems to be distaste for a financial bailout package with jean-claude juncker , chairman of the group of countries that share the euro , insisting thursday that no consideration was being given to a gigantic euro bailout .
" i do not see the necessity for such a program in europe , " he said , pleading for more intensive regulation of the finance sector . dw staff -lrb- dm -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the interpretation of what he said had been " politically wrong , " he told reporters .
about 50 nations , including germany , have recognized kosovo as independent , whereas serbia insists kosovo still belongs to it . tadic said belgrade would never recognize its independence , but was making an effort to shift the kosovo issue " from the political corner to the legal corner " by taking it to the international court of justice .
he said it was asking the united nations to refer the matter to the court in the hague .
about 100,000 ethnic serbs live in kosovo and their towns have largely rejected government by pristina .
the tadic visit to berlin was seen as part of the president 's efforts to develop closer ties with the european union .

this year , however , all eyes will be on the leaders of the two nations as they join the forum , to see how they interact in the wake of the recent war in georgia .
merkel had joined a host of western critics who said the war had made normal dealings with russia impossible , and called for ties to be reviewed .
still , she has backed a deal negotiated by french president nicolas sarkozy , under which russia agreed to pull out of undisputed georgian territories by oct .
10 once eu monitors had been deployed in the region .
and despite her condemnation of russia 's actions in georgia , she has distinguished herself among her eu counterparts by insisting the lines of communication with moscow remain open .
thursday 's talks with medvedev are expected to touch on the eu monitoring mission in " buffer zones " around south ossetia and fellow rebel enclave abkhazia .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany and russia have enjoyed close relations in the past but according to kremlin sources , the russian leader is also expected to show that his country has not been isolated in europe by focusing on developing further political and economic ties , including the ambitious north stream project - a gas pipeline to deliver gas from siberia to europe beneath the baltic sea .
germany is russia 's single biggest trading partner with bilateral turnover set to reach 43 billion euros -lrb- $ 60 billion -rrb- this year .
some 4,600 german firms have subsidiaries in russia and every fourth machine imported by russia is made in germany .
" the meeting is aimed at confirming the stability and maturity of the russian-german partnership free from political fluctuations , " a kremlin source told reporters ahead of the forum .
council of europe keeps dialogue open russia still could face consequences in europe for its actions in august during the conflict with georgia .
on wednesday , secretary general of the council of europe terry davis said the organization would examine allegations of human rights violations during the war .
the european court of human rights in strasbourg had received " more than 1,700 complaints " from the region , he added .
court officials told news agency afp that the vast majority of the complaints had been made by south ossetians against georgia .
diplomats in strasbourg added that it was possible the complaints were part of an orchestrated campaign against tbilisi .
however , the council of europe , which is not related to the european union , voted against withdrawing russia 's voting rights after a request to do so by two dozen members .
swiss member andreas gross said the vote signified willingness to maintain " dialogue between us and the two countries . "
a council report published on monday found both moscow and tbilisi were responsible for the conflict 's escalation into " open and fully-fledged warfare . " dw staff -lrb- dc -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the law in england and wales states that assisted suicide is a crime punishable with a maximum sentence of 14 years in prison .
purdy fears that her husband , a cuban national , would be treated more harshly were he to accompany her .
she said that if her husband is liable for prosecution , she would travel abroad alone while she is healthy enough to do so - but before she is ready to die .
" i enjoy my life and the people around me , and i do n't want to die until my condition becomes unbearable .
if the law is not clarified , i may be forced to travel abroad alone before i am ready , " she said in a statement .
" i just want clarity so i know whether or not my husband omar will be prosecuted or questioned by the police if i decide to travel abroad and he accompanies me . "
purdy has said she is considering traveling to a clinic run by the swiss right-to-die organization , dignitas .
since 1992 , almost 100 british citizens have ended their lives at the dignitas clinic without their relatives being prosecuted .
purdy and the organization dignity in dying say they want to know if a decision has been made not to prosecute relatives .
in june , two top judges in britain allowed purdy to bring a full judicial review in the case , which her lawyer says may fall within the scope of the european convention on human rights .
the hearing is set to last for two days , and judgment is likely to be reserved until a later date .
hot button issue in germany advocates on both sides of the euthanasia debate in germany will be watching with interest to see how the director of public prosecutions -lrb- dpp -rrb- responds to purdy 's case , as in recent months , assisted suicide has again become a hot button issue .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : former state senator for justice roger kusch presents a video to journalists about the medically assisted suicide of bettina schardt in wuerzburg in july , former hamburg justice senator and right-to-die campaigner roger kusch , said he had assisted a 79-year-old woman who committed suicide despite the fact that she had no life-threatening disease or great amount of pain .
his participation in her death was strongly condemned by german chancellor angela merkel , who stressed that her christian democratic union -lrb- cdu -rrb- opposed any form of assisted suicide .
bavaria and four other german states are pushing for new laws to ban commercial ventures that help people kill themselves .
many in germany want to prevent the country from following in switzerland 's footsteps .
opponents to assisted suicide say that liberal swiss laws on euthanasia have led to a bustling trade in assisted suicide with the help of organizations like dignitas . dw staff -lrb- dc -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?
dw-world.de merkel remains strongly opposed to assisted suicide german chancellor angela merkel has spoken out in the strongest terms against euthanasia as the heated debate over a former hamburg government official 's involvement in the assisted suicide of a pensioner gathers pace .

" with the weakening of demand , upside risks to price stability have diminished somewhat , but they have not disappeared , " trichet said on thursday , oct 2 , in a monthly news conference . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : trichet delivered a somber message euro zone inflation has also fallen to 3.6 percent , though it remains well above the ecb 's target of just below 2 percent . trichet said ecb policymakers recognised " the extraordinary high level of uncertainty stemming from latest developments " on turbulent financial markets and the credit crunch .
" economic activity in the euro area is weakening with contracting domestic demand and tighter financing conditions , " he said . european stocks tumble the financial crisis has brought the world to an extraordinary level of uncertainty and governments must respond with equally unprecedented measures , trichet said thursday . " nothing in the past resembles what we are currently seeing , " he told france 24 news channel .
" we are witnessing events that we have not been seen since world war ii . " european stocks fell thursday amid news of bleak us economic data and jitters as the us house of representatives votes on a massive $ 700 billion bailout . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : market turmoil has caused much anguish at stock exchanges in europe around europe , germany 's dax index was down 2.5 percent , uk 's ftse 100 index fell 1.8 percent and france 's cac 40 dropped 2.3 percent . asian markets too took a new hammering amid uncertainty about the next stage of the us package . the bank of japan injected another 1.6 trillion yen -lrb- $ 15 billion , 10.7 billion euros -rrb- into the financial system - its 12th straight daily injection .
eurogroup chief jean-claude juncker called european officials to " put in place a more systematic defense strategy " to protect the 27-nation european union -lrb- eu -rrb- from banking failures , rather than be satisfied " with case by case reactions . " he said the subject would be discussed saturday in paris during a meeting of representatives from britain , france , germany and italy along with european commission president jose manuel barroso , juncker himself , and trichet . germany , france joust over alleged french bailout plan meanwhile , amid calls by the eu commission on wednesday for stronger pan-european cooperation to tackle a raging credit crisis that has lashed banks on the continent , france and germany were at loggerheads over the idea of a us-style bail out for europe . french finance minister christine lagarde told german business daily handelsblatt that a " european safety net " could be needed to prevent a bank in a smaller eu country from going bankrupt . " what happens if a smaller eu state is hit by looming bank collapse ?
maybe this country does not have the means to save the bank .
therefore the question of a european safety net solution comes up , " lagarde told the paper . the comments came ahead of a proposed meeting on the financial crisis by the leaders of europe 's four biggest economies in paris on the weekend .
france currently heads the eu 's rotating presidency . news reports quoted a european official , who did not wish to be named , saying that paris had floated the idea of a 300 billion euro -lrb- $ 440 billion -rrb- rescue fund but lagarde denied the statement from the source in berlin that her government wanted the huge rescue package .
" there is no such a thing , " lagarde told bbc television after being asked about the reported proposal . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel has ruled out issuing " blank checks " to banks whether there is or was ever a french bail-out plan , germany was quick to reject the idea regardless . " germany does not think much of such a plan , " german finance ministry spokesman torsten albig told afp . earlier , chancellor angela merkel said germany " can not and will not issue a blank check for all banks , regardless of whether they behave in a responsible manner or not . " barroso calls for more " credibility " in eu efforts eu commission president jose manuel barroso said wednesday europe needs to " inject credibility " into its efforts to tackle the current financial crisis , as a major us banking bailout hangs in the balance . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : barroso says europe needs more coordinated regulatory measures to tackle the crisis " we are asking and urging member states for closer cooperation .
it is critically important for confidence in the markets , " barroso said . barroso said the existing system of regulation , based largely on national governments and regulators , could cope with the current crisis , but the european union needed to go further in coordinated action to restore full confidence . " we need a further strengthening of the supervision structures at european level , " he told a news conference on wednesday . rebuffing french calls for eu limits on state aid to be suspended or revised in the light of the crisis , barroso said upholding the competition rules was vital , but the commission would apply them flexibly . dw staff -lrb- sp / kjb / nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the law in england and wales states that assisted suicide is a crime punishable with a maximum sentence of 14 years in prison .
purdy fears that her husband , a cuban national , would be treated more harshly were he to accompany her .
she said that if her husband is liable for prosecution , she would travel abroad alone while she is healthy enough to do so - but before she is ready to die .
" i enjoy my life and the people around me , and i do n't want to die until my condition becomes unbearable .
if the law is not clarified , i may be forced to travel abroad alone before i am ready , " she said in a statement .
" i just want clarity so i know whether or not my husband omar will be prosecuted or questioned by the police if i decide to travel abroad and he accompanies me . "
purdy has said she is considering traveling to a clinic run by the swiss right-to-die organization , dignitas .
since 1992 , almost 100 british citizens have ended their lives at the dignitas clinic without their relatives being prosecuted .
purdy and the organization dignity in dying say they want to know if a decision has been made not to prosecute relatives .
in june , two top judges in britain allowed purdy to bring a full judicial review in the case , which her lawyer says may fall within the scope of the european convention on human rights .
the hearing is set to last for two days , and judgment is likely to be reserved until a later date .
hot button issue in germany advocates on both sides of the euthanasia debate in germany will be watching with interest to see how the director of public prosecutions -lrb- dpp -rrb- responds to purdy 's case , as in recent months , assisted suicide has again become a hot button issue .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : former state senator for justice roger kusch presents a video to journalists about the medically assisted suicide of bettina schardt in wuerzburg in july , former hamburg justice senator and right-to-die campaigner roger kusch , said he had assisted a 79-year-old woman who committed suicide despite the fact that she had no life-threatening disease or great amount of pain .
his participation in her death was strongly condemned by german chancellor angela merkel , who stressed that her christian democratic union -lrb- cdu -rrb- opposed any form of assisted suicide .
bavaria and four other german states are pushing for new laws to ban commercial ventures that help people kill themselves .
many in germany want to prevent the country from following in switzerland 's footsteps .
opponents to assisted suicide say that liberal swiss laws on euthanasia have led to a bustling trade in assisted suicide with the help of organizations like dignitas . dw staff -lrb- dc -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" i just want clarity so i know whether or not my husband omar will be prosecuted or questioned by the police if i decide to travel abroad and he accompanies me . "
purdy has said she is considering traveling to a clinic run by the swiss right-to-die organization , dignitas .
since 1992 , almost 100 british citizens have ended their lives at the dignitas clinic without their relatives being prosecuted .
purdy and the organization dignity in dying say they want to know if a decision has been made not to prosecute relatives .
in june , two top judges in britain allowed purdy to bring a full judicial review in the case , which her lawyer says may fall within the scope of the european convention on human rights .

the city was devastated , and there were enormous casualties among civilians and refugees .
historians have argued about just how many people were killed in the firebombing on the night of feb .
13-14 , 1945 , with estimates ranging from 25,000 to 135,000 .
now , a special commission of a dozen experts , including university professors , archivists and military historians have said that after four years of research , the lower figure is more accurate .
so far , they have confirmed 18,000 deaths and say they have found no reason to assume that the final tally will be significantly higher .
their research is to continue until 2009 .
the team is drawing on archival and official documents , burial records and eye witness reports .
they have ruled out one theory suggesting that the death toll was much higher due to an unknown number of casualties among war refugees .
the authorities kept detailed records of all the victims - both german and foreign , the researchers said . dw staff -lrb- dc -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

germany would send one frigate , said defense minister franz-josef jung . french defense minister herve morin announced that the anti-piracy security operation could begin as soon as next month in the wake of calls from somali president abdullahi yusuf ahmed for the international community to combat rising piracy off the lawless nation 's waters .
" there is very broad european willingness .
many countries want to take part .
ten have clearly given their accord to take part in such a mission , " morin said wednesday , oct .
1 , at the meeting in the french seaside resort of deauville .
" we have given a mandate -lrb- to eu top brass -rrb- to continue the planning for the launch of this operation in the month of november , " he told reporters .
" we will see what means , nato and european , can be added . "
belgium , cyprus , france , germany , lithuania , the netherlands , spain , sweden and possibly britain would be involved in the task force , morin said .
" we have to coordinate between the ships that are in the zone and those we are going to send , " he said , and added that nato countries , particularly the united states , had vessels in the area .
germany has agreed to provide a frigate for the eu naval task force , which will include three frigates , a supply ship and three maritime surveillance ships , defense minister franz-josef jung said at the meeting .
germany to send frigate to somalia bildunterschrift : germany 's " emden " was deployed off somalia as part of operation enduring freedom " i think it 's necessary to counter pirates effectively , " jung told reporters .
" i support a mission that pushes back piracy , secures the seas and ensures free maritime trade . "
piracy is rife and well organized in the region where somalia 's north-eastern tip juts into the indian ocean , preying on a key maritime route leading to the suez canal .
an estimated 30 percent of the world 's oil passes through the territory .
sixty ships have been seized this year alone and somali pirates are currently holding 13 vessels captive with more than 200 sailors .
the pirates operate high-powered speedboats and are heavily armed , sometimes holding ships for weeks until they are released for large ransoms paid by governments or owners .
the somali government was joined in its calls for action by global shipping groups last month which urged the world 's naval powers to do more to stop piracy .
global shipping groups call for action the groups , including the international chamber of shipping , bimco and oil tanker group intercargo , said they were " utterly amazed " governments were unable to secure one of the world 's most important seaways .
they also warned that continued inaction risked causing a repetition of the crisis in the early 1970s when the suez canal was closed and merchant shipping was diverted around the cape of good hope at africa 's southern tip , leading to major consequences for international trade , including higher transport costs and the maintenance of inventories .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : president yusaf warns of consequences for the world somalia 's president yusaf warned in a speech in the capital mogadishu this week that the pirates represented a risk to the whole world . " they -lrb- pirates -rrb- are imposing an embargo on the somali people and the international community because they are blocking movement between the mediterranean and the indian ocean , which affects not only somalia but the whole world , " yusuf told reporters .

the interpretation of what he said had been " politically wrong , " he told reporters .
about 50 nations , including germany , have recognized kosovo as independent , whereas serbia insists kosovo still belongs to it . tadic said belgrade would never recognize its independence , but was making an effort to shift the kosovo issue " from the political corner to the legal corner " by taking it to the international court of justice .
he said it was asking the united nations to refer the matter to the court in the hague .
about 100,000 ethnic serbs live in kosovo and their towns have largely rejected government by pristina .
the tadic visit to berlin was seen as part of the president 's efforts to develop closer ties with the european union .

the city was devastated , and there were enormous casualties among civilians and refugees .
historians have argued about just how many people were killed in the firebombing on the night of feb .
13-14 , 1945 , with estimates ranging from 25,000 to 135,000 .
now , a special commission of a dozen experts , including university professors , archivists and military historians have said that after four years of research , the lower figure is more accurate .
so far , they have confirmed 18,000 deaths and say they have found no reason to assume that the final tally will be significantly higher .
their research is to continue until 2009 .
the team is drawing on archival and official documents , burial records and eye witness reports .
they have ruled out one theory suggesting that the death toll was much higher due to an unknown number of casualties among war refugees .
the authorities kept detailed records of all the victims - both german and foreign , the researchers said . dw staff -lrb- dc -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" the russian reaction in this conflict -lrb- the russo-georgian war -rrb- we consider to be disproportionate and we said -lrb- to the russians -rrb- , that we now need to build trust , " merkel said .
a key first step would be withdrawal of all russian troops from georgian territory by oct .
10 in line with a european union- brokered ceasefire between moscow and tbilisi , she said . medvedev , in his opening remarks , anticipated merkel 's criticism , calling georgia 's august attack on the renegade province of south ossetia " aggressive nationalism , " and international claims russia was the attacker in the conflict " dishonest propaganda . " the world , despite worsening relations between moscow and nato nations over georgia , would nonetheless never see a new cold war , medvedev claimed , " because there are no reasons for it . " russia and germany have " differing views on this matter -lrb- the caucasus situation -rrb- , " merkel said . western nations and russia need to engage each other in a series of " preventative talks " to forestall future conflicts , and to prepare the ground for cooperation , she said . russo-european coordination over the role of military observers deployed to georgia from the organization of security and cooperation in europe -lrb- osce -rrb- is one of the first topics requiring greater mutual understanding , merkel said . eu monitors deploy russian combat forces on wednesday delayed and in some places restricted the movement of osce observers through a buffer zone in south osseia , despite european claims the observers should be allowed to travel unhindered . merkel named as other areas of disagreement requiring further discussion the renegade moldovan province transnistria , kosovo , and bosnia-herzogovina - all european territories over whose future status russia and nato nations sharply disagree . medvedev called for more clarity and direct talk between russia and the west , saying what was needed was " the voice of truth stated loudly . " " we have to accept the mutual dependance of countries and nations in the modern world , " medvedev said .
" this interdependence does not only apply to economies , but the spheres of science , technology , culture , and education .

" the russian reaction in this conflict -lrb- the russo-georgian war -rrb- we consider to be disproportionate and we said -lrb- to the russians -rrb- , that we now need to build trust , " merkel said .
a key first step would be withdrawal of all russian troops from georgian territory by oct .
10 in line with a european union- brokered ceasefire between moscow and tbilisi , she said . medvedev , in his opening remarks , anticipated merkel 's criticism , calling georgia 's august attack on the renegade province of south ossetia " aggressive nationalism , " and international claims russia was the attacker in the conflict " dishonest propaganda . " the world , despite worsening relations between moscow and nato nations over georgia , would nonetheless never see a new cold war , medvedev claimed , " because there are no reasons for it . " russia and germany have " differing views on this matter -lrb- the caucasus situation -rrb- , " merkel said . western nations and russia need to engage each other in a series of " preventative talks " to forestall future conflicts , and to prepare the ground for cooperation , she said . russo-european coordination over the role of military observers deployed to georgia from the organization of security and cooperation in europe -lrb- osce -rrb- is one of the first topics requiring greater mutual understanding , merkel said . eu monitors deploy russian combat forces on wednesday delayed and in some places restricted the movement of osce observers through a buffer zone in south osseia , despite european claims the observers should be allowed to travel unhindered . merkel named as other areas of disagreement requiring further discussion the renegade moldovan province transnistria , kosovo , and bosnia-herzogovina - all european territories over whose future status russia and nato nations sharply disagree . medvedev called for more clarity and direct talk between russia and the west , saying what was needed was " the voice of truth stated loudly . " " we have to accept the mutual dependance of countries and nations in the modern world , " medvedev said .
" this interdependence does not only apply to economies , but the spheres of science , technology , culture , and education . " " we need to go forwards , and not focus on the past , " medvedev said . dpa news agency -lrb- dc -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" if the united states has a rescue plan , europe should be ready to offer similar solutions , " he said , as quoted by dow jones newswires .
but peter struck , head of the german social democratic party 's parliamentary group , castigated the head of germany 's largest bank for his comments , saying he " felt contempt " for the " type of opportunism " shown by ackermann .
" as long as the banks were on course for making profits , mr. ackermann was the one screaming loudest that the state shouldn ’ t get involved , " struck told news agency dpa , adding that ackermann 's tune has changed now that profits are threatened by the credit crisis .
struck said that attitude made it particularly irksome that the head of germany ’ s leading bank is " now the first to call for massive aid from taxpayer funds " to help prop up crumbling financial institutions .
no bailout for europe bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german chancellor angela merkel has strongly opposed any europe-wide bailout strategy complementing struck 's talk down of ackermann were comments made by chancellor angela merkel , who said : " the alliance will not issue any blank checks to banks , whether they behave responsibly or not . "
merkel said she favoured " better protection and early warning systems " over a bailout package , insisting european banking regulations needed upgrading .
" it can not be that … in finance markets , several billion products exist to which no sufficient rules count , " she said .
at a european level , there also seems to be distaste for a financial bailout package with jean-claude juncker , chairman of the group of countries that share the euro , insisting thursday that no consideration was being given to a gigantic euro bailout .
" i do not see the necessity for such a program in europe , " he said , pleading for more intensive regulation of the finance sector . dw staff -lrb- dm -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de defense -pipe- 02.10.2008 france urges eu states to pool security resources großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : french defence minister herve morin says a europe defensively divided will be ineffective the european union should boost its defense capabilities and learn to pool the resources of its individual states , the french defense minister said at an eu defense meeting thursday . european states ' defense industries must specialize their production capabilities to streamline the bloc 's security capacity and eliminate overlap , french defense minister herve morin said at the informal two-day meeting of eu defence ministers in deauville , france .
" if we are talking about a european defence industry , we must accept the idea that not everybody is doing the same thing as everybody else , " morin said .
" for example , we could do some work in france and other work elsewhere , and then pool together . "
french president nicolas sarkozy , whose country holds the rotating eu presidency , said wednesday that europe lacked the " appropriate measures to enact its defense policies . "
he said indirectly that europe risked losing political power if it was unable to defend itself .
at the heart of sarkozy 's military agenda is a desire to see europe able to stand alone if need be .
in line with this goal , the defense ministers committed at the meeting to filling key military shortfalls such as a lack of transport aircraft and helicopters , better troop protection and the ability to gather intelligence , including by satellite .
the key decisions made at the deauville meeting are to be finalized in brussels on nov .

integrated european defense manufacturing bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : production of the airbus a400m has been delayed by up to two years but there was growing evidence in deauville that eu leaders were warming to the idea that more could be done together , particularly at a time of economic slowdown .
one such example of cooperation is that concerning the a400m military transport aircraft , the components of which are being built by airbus in six countries : belgium - flaps - britain - flaps and outer wing box - france - nose fuselage and rudder - germany - fuselage - spain - tail - and turkey - ailerons and spoilers .
production has fallen behind , however , and delivery of the a400m 's may take two years longer than originally scheduled , according to reports .
military erasmus a majority of eu countries also backed french plans for an exchange program involving young military officers .
inspired by the erasmus student exchange program , it would see officers from one member state spend some time training in another european country .
the project aims to increase cooperation between military colleges in order to improve interoperability and mould a common european defence culture , morin said .
however , some ministers expressed concern that such a program could turn into a one-way travelling system , whereby officers from poorer member states would want to spend time in some of europe 's best colleges , and fewer officers from richer states would be willing to train in countries such as romania or bulgaria . dpa news agency -lrb- dm -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" russia and germany have " differing views on this matter -lrb- the caucasus situation -rrb- , " merkel said . western nations and russia need to engage each other in a series of " preventative talks " to forestall future conflicts , and to prepare the ground for cooperation , she said . russo-european coordination over the role of military observers deployed to georgia from the organization of security and cooperation in europe -lrb- osce -rrb- is one of the first topics requiring greater mutual understanding , merkel said . eu monitors deploy russian combat forces on wednesday delayed and in some places restricted the movement of osce observers through a buffer zone in south osseia , despite european claims the observers should be allowed to travel unhindered . merkel named as other areas of disagreement requiring further discussion the renegade moldovan province transnistria , kosovo , and bosnia-herzogovina - all european territories over whose future status russia and nato nations sharply disagree . medvedev called for more clarity and direct talk between russia and the west , saying what was needed was " the voice of truth stated loudly . " " we have to accept the mutual dependance of countries and nations in the modern world , " medvedev said .
" this interdependence does not only apply to economies , but the spheres of science , technology , culture , and education .

the city was devastated , and there were enormous casualties among civilians and refugees .
historians have argued about just how many people were killed in the firebombing on the night of feb .
13-14 , 1945 , with estimates ranging from 25,000 to 135,000 .
now , a special commission of a dozen experts , including university professors , archivists and military historians have said that after four years of research , the lower figure is more accurate .
so far , they have confirmed 18,000 deaths and say they have found no reason to assume that the final tally will be significantly higher .
their research is to continue until 2009 .
the team is drawing on archival and official documents , burial records and eye witness reports .
they have ruled out one theory suggesting that the death toll was much higher due to an unknown number of casualties among war refugees .
the authorities kept detailed records of all the victims - both german and foreign , the researchers said . dw staff -lrb- dc -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" if the united states has a rescue plan , europe should be ready to offer similar solutions , " he said , as quoted by dow jones newswires .
but peter struck , head of the german social democratic party 's parliamentary group , castigated the head of germany 's largest bank for his comments , saying he " felt contempt " for the " type of opportunism " shown by ackermann .
" as long as the banks were on course for making profits , mr. ackermann was the one screaming loudest that the state shouldn ’ t get involved , " struck told news agency dpa , adding that ackermann 's tune has changed now that profits are threatened by the credit crisis .
struck said that attitude made it particularly irksome that the head of germany ’ s leading bank is " now the first to call for massive aid from taxpayer funds " to help prop up crumbling financial institutions .
no bailout for europe bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german chancellor angela merkel has strongly opposed any europe-wide bailout strategy complementing struck 's talk down of ackermann were comments made by chancellor angela merkel , who said : " the alliance will not issue any blank checks to banks , whether they behave responsibly or not . "
merkel said she favoured " better protection and early warning systems " over a bailout package , insisting european banking regulations needed upgrading .
" it can not be that … in finance markets , several billion products exist to which no sufficient rules count , " she said .
at a european level , there also seems to be distaste for a financial bailout package with jean-claude juncker , chairman of the group of countries that share the euro , insisting thursday that no consideration was being given to a gigantic euro bailout .
" i do not see the necessity for such a program in europe , " he said , pleading for more intensive regulation of the finance sector . dw staff -lrb- dm -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

global shipping groups call for action the groups , including the international chamber of shipping , bimco and oil tanker group intercargo , said they were " utterly amazed " governments were unable to secure one of the world 's most important seaways .
they also warned that continued inaction risked causing a repetition of the crisis in the early 1970s when the suez canal was closed and merchant shipping was diverted around the cape of good hope at africa 's southern tip , leading to major consequences for international trade , including higher transport costs and the maintenance of inventories .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de auto industry -pipe- 02.10.2008 paris motor show opens amid industry gloom großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the paris show opened thursday for the press , but the public must wait until saturday the largest motor show on earth opened in paris on thursday as the auto industry attempts to convince the world it is moving forward with an eye on the environment as well as on profit margins . the expo convened amid uncertainty in the auto industry as to how the global credit crisis will affect car sales , and as france proposed earlier this week to weaken european union laws on the amount of carbon dioxide -lrb- co2 -rrb- cars should be allowed to emit .
with exponentially rising petrol prices , new environmental legislation and already falling sales figures , most of the major auto makers were keen to show off their latest lines of hybrids , electro-cars and fuel savers at the biennial mondial de paris car show .
over 360 marquees from 25 countries are represented at the car expo , which attracted some 1.43 million people at the last show in 2006 .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the bugatti veyron 16.4 grand is on display in paris out for public display at this year 's event will be 90 new models and new green technologies from automakers such as toyota , honda , nissan , general motors , peugeot and citroen .
credit crisis to crunch auto sales but behind the veneer and marketing hype , auto executives are worried about what lies ahead for the industry , with fears the latest credit crunch could hit car sales significantly over the next two to three years .
predictions are already dire .
economic forecaster global insight predicts the usually strong selling month of september could see a double-digit decline in sales figures .
" car sales across western europe will slump in september as consumer confidence evaporates in the face of the financial crisis , tougher credit restrictions and inflationary pressures elsewhere , " global insight said in a report published on its web site wednesday .
the forecaster said the once-generous financing deals used by dealerships to tempt buyers into their lots have effectively been dried up by the credit crisis .
" the problem stems from in-house financing divisions ' ability to offer loans and lease deals .
as the credit crisis has all but frozen inter-bank lending , the ability to package and re-sell the resultant consumer loans has left the system paralyzed , " it said .
france seeks more co2 leeway environmental groups on wednesday reacted with outrage to the french proposal to weaken planned european union laws on co2 car emissions .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : french president nicolas sarkozy 's government 's counter-proposal will ease the burden for carmakers on thursday the european parliament 's environment committee voted through a version of a law originally proposed by the eu 's executive , the european commission , demanding that cars sold in the eu emit no more than 120 grams of co2 per kilometer -lrb- g / km -rrb- by 2012 .
penalties for non-compliance should rise to 95 euros -lrb- $ 135.80 -rrb- per g / km for each car sold over the limit by 2015 , and the eu should bring in a target of at least 95 g / km by 2020 , the committee said .
but the french government 's proposal calls for a fine of no more than 80 euros per g / km over the limit and a long-range target " in the range 95-110 g / km . "
moreover , it declares that the law should only apply to the most efficient 60 percent of europe 's new auto fleet when it comes into force in 2012 , with the least efficient cars only coming into the system in 2015 .
the proposal , which would need the backing of the eu 's member states and the european parliament , is now likely to set up a heated political battle as lobbyists on both sides push for a deal before the parliament 's next plenary session on oct .
20-23 .
green groups angered the french government , which currently holds the eu 's rotating presidency , " is giving up any pretence of trying to limit the climate impact of cars , " greenpeace said in a statement wednesday .
the proposal , presented to diplomats tuesday , " totally ignores " the european parliament vote and shows that france is " totally out of touch with the needs of citizens who are desperate to reduce their fuel bills , ” a spokesman for brussels-based group transport and environment told news agency dpa . dw staff -lrb- dm -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?
dw-world.de fuel cells not exciting car makers in germany rising petrol prices and environmental ills are a fine argument in favor of fuel cell cars driven by electric power generated from hydrogen .

with exponentially rising petrol prices , new environmental legislation and already falling sales figures , most of the major auto makers were keen to show off their latest lines of hybrids , electro-cars and fuel savers at the biennial mondial de paris car show .
over 360 marquees from 25 countries are represented at the car expo , which attracted some 1.43 million people at the last show in 2006 .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the bugatti veyron 16.4 grand is on display in paris out for public display at this year 's event will be 90 new models and new green technologies from automakers such as toyota , honda , nissan , general motors , peugeot and citroen .
credit crisis to crunch auto sales but behind the veneer and marketing hype , auto executives are worried about what lies ahead for the industry , with fears the latest credit crunch could hit car sales significantly over the next two to three years .
predictions are already dire .
economic forecaster global insight predicts the usually strong selling month of september could see a double-digit decline in sales figures .
" car sales across western europe will slump in september as consumer confidence evaporates in the face of the financial crisis , tougher credit restrictions and inflationary pressures elsewhere , " global insight said in a report published on its web site wednesday .
the forecaster said the once-generous financing deals used by dealerships to tempt buyers into their lots have effectively been dried up by the credit crisis .
" the problem stems from in-house financing divisions ' ability to offer loans and lease deals .
as the credit crisis has all but frozen inter-bank lending , the ability to package and re-sell the resultant consumer loans has left the system paralyzed , " it said .
france seeks more co2 leeway environmental groups on wednesday reacted with outrage to the french proposal to weaken planned european union laws on co2 car emissions .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : french president nicolas sarkozy 's government 's counter-proposal will ease the burden for carmakers on thursday the european parliament 's environment committee voted through a version of a law originally proposed by the eu 's executive , the european commission , demanding that cars sold in the eu emit no more than 120 grams of co2 per kilometer -lrb- g / km -rrb- by 2012 .
penalties for non-compliance should rise to 95 euros -lrb- $ 135.80 -rrb- per g / km for each car sold over the limit by 2015 , and the eu should bring in a target of at least 95 g / km by 2020 , the committee said .
but the french government 's proposal calls for a fine of no more than 80 euros per g / km over the limit and a long-range target " in the range 95-110 g / km . "
moreover , it declares that the law should only apply to the most efficient 60 percent of europe 's new auto fleet when it comes into force in 2012 , with the least efficient cars only coming into the system in 2015 .
the proposal , which would need the backing of the eu 's member states and the european parliament , is now likely to set up a heated political battle as lobbyists on both sides push for a deal before the parliament 's next plenary session on oct .
20-23 .
green groups angered the french government , which currently holds the eu 's rotating presidency , " is giving up any pretence of trying to limit the climate impact of cars , " greenpeace said in a statement wednesday .
the proposal , presented to diplomats tuesday , " totally ignores " the european parliament vote and shows that france is " totally out of touch with the needs of citizens who are desperate to reduce their fuel bills , ” a spokesman for brussels-based group transport and environment told news agency dpa . dw staff -lrb- dm -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" if we are talking about a european defence industry , we must accept the idea that not everybody is doing the same thing as everybody else , " morin said .
" for example , we could do some work in france and other work elsewhere , and then pool together . "
french president nicolas sarkozy , whose country holds the rotating eu presidency , said wednesday that europe lacked the " appropriate measures to enact its defense policies . "
he said indirectly that europe risked losing political power if it was unable to defend itself .
at the heart of sarkozy 's military agenda is a desire to see europe able to stand alone if need be .
in line with this goal , the defense ministers committed at the meeting to filling key military shortfalls such as a lack of transport aircraft and helicopters , better troop protection and the ability to gather intelligence , including by satellite .
the key decisions made at the deauville meeting are to be finalized in brussels on nov .

integrated european defense manufacturing bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : production of the airbus a400m has been delayed by up to two years but there was growing evidence in deauville that eu leaders were warming to the idea that more could be done together , particularly at a time of economic slowdown .
one such example of cooperation is that concerning the a400m military transport aircraft , the components of which are being built by airbus in six countries : belgium - flaps - britain - flaps and outer wing box - france - nose fuselage and rudder - germany - fuselage - spain - tail - and turkey - ailerons and spoilers .
production has fallen behind , however , and delivery of the a400m 's may take two years longer than originally scheduled , according to reports .
military erasmus a majority of eu countries also backed french plans for an exchange program involving young military officers .
inspired by the erasmus student exchange program , it would see officers from one member state spend some time training in another european country .
the project aims to increase cooperation between military colleges in order to improve interoperability and mould a common european defence culture , morin said .
however , some ministers expressed concern that such a program could turn into a one-way travelling system , whereby officers from poorer member states would want to spend time in some of europe 's best colleges , and fewer officers from richer states would be willing to train in countries such as romania or bulgaria . dpa news agency -lrb- dm -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

germany would send one frigate , said defense minister franz-josef jung . french defense minister herve morin announced that the anti-piracy security operation could begin as soon as next month in the wake of calls from somali president abdullahi yusuf ahmed for the international community to combat rising piracy off the lawless nation 's waters .
" there is very broad european willingness .
many countries want to take part .
ten have clearly given their accord to take part in such a mission , " morin said wednesday , oct .
1 , at the meeting in the french seaside resort of deauville .
" we have given a mandate -lrb- to eu top brass -rrb- to continue the planning for the launch of this operation in the month of november , " he told reporters .
" we will see what means , nato and european , can be added . "
belgium , cyprus , france , germany , lithuania , the netherlands , spain , sweden and possibly britain would be involved in the task force , morin said .
" we have to coordinate between the ships that are in the zone and those we are going to send , " he said , and added that nato countries , particularly the united states , had vessels in the area .
germany has agreed to provide a frigate for the eu naval task force , which will include three frigates , a supply ship and three maritime surveillance ships , defense minister franz-josef jung said at the meeting .
germany to send frigate to somalia bildunterschrift : germany 's " emden " was deployed off somalia as part of operation enduring freedom " i think it 's necessary to counter pirates effectively , " jung told reporters .
" i support a mission that pushes back piracy , secures the seas and ensures free maritime trade . "
piracy is rife and well organized in the region where somalia 's north-eastern tip juts into the indian ocean , preying on a key maritime route leading to the suez canal .
an estimated 30 percent of the world 's oil passes through the territory .
sixty ships have been seized this year alone and somali pirates are currently holding 13 vessels captive with more than 200 sailors .
the pirates operate high-powered speedboats and are heavily armed , sometimes holding ships for weeks until they are released for large ransoms paid by governments or owners .
the somali government was joined in its calls for action by global shipping groups last month which urged the world 's naval powers to do more to stop piracy .
global shipping groups call for action the groups , including the international chamber of shipping , bimco and oil tanker group intercargo , said they were " utterly amazed " governments were unable to secure one of the world 's most important seaways .
they also warned that continued inaction risked causing a repetition of the crisis in the early 1970s when the suez canal was closed and merchant shipping was diverted around the cape of good hope at africa 's southern tip , leading to major consequences for international trade , including higher transport costs and the maintenance of inventories .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : president yusaf warns of consequences for the world somalia 's president yusaf warned in a speech in the capital mogadishu this week that the pirates represented a risk to the whole world . " they -lrb- pirates -rrb- are imposing an embargo on the somali people and the international community because they are blocking movement between the mediterranean and the indian ocean , which affects not only somalia but the whole world , " yusuf told reporters .
" i call on the somali people to fight against the pirates .
i also call on the international community to act quickly on what is happening in somali waters as well as on shore , " he added .
us navy monitor seized arms ship the pirates who seized a belize-flagged freighter with its 21-man crew and 33 soviet-era t-72 battle tanks on board last thursday say they are under 24-hour surveillance from us ships and helicopters .
" we are prepared for any eventuality , " warned pirate spokesman sugule ali by satellite telephone from the ship .
" we are sticking to the demand for $ 20 million .
this is not ransom , but a fine for unlawfully transporting weapons on somali waters , " ali said .
there are 21 ukrainians , russians and latvians in the crew .
the ship 's captain died of an illness on board , according to russian media .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the " faina " is carrying a consignment of army tanks the bahrain-based us navy fifth fleet said several ships and helicopters were in the area to support the destroyer uss howard as it observed its target , now docked at the somali port village of hobyo .
abdikadir musa yusuf , deputy seaports minister for the somali breakaway region of puntland , said , " there are negotiations going on between the pirates and the foreign ships . "
the pentagon said it wanted a peaceful resolution and us warships were there to make sure pirates do not make off with its military cargo .
" but at this point , what we are most concerned about is seeing a peaceful solution to this problem , " pentagon spokesman geoff morrell said , adding that the us navy was not negotiating with the pirates .

us secretary of state condoleeza rice is expected to go to india later this week to sign the agreement with her indian counterpart pranab mukherjee . for the first time in over 30 years , american businesses will now be able to sell nuclear fuel , technology and reactors to nuclear-armed india .
in return , india will allow un inspections of some of its civilian nuclear facilities .
in 1974 , the south asian nation provoked the world ’ s ire when it tested an underground nuclear weapon .
us president bush welcomed the senate ’ s decision and said he “ looked forward to signing the bill into law ” .
the republican senator richard lugar was also jubilant about the decision : “ this is an opportunity for the united states and india to come together in a way that is historically important for the world . ”
a victory achieved at lightning speed in india , leaders from the ruling united progressive alliance also hailed the deal saying it was “ a victory for prime minister manmohan singh ’ s government ” .
abishek manu singhvi , the spokesman for the congress party , marvelled at the “ lightning speed ” through which india had “ passed through all the tests - through the iaea -lsb- international atomic energy agency -rsb- , the house of representatives and senate .

france is the second producer of nuclear energy in the world after the united states .
these deals with the us and france will bring india a long way further to meeting its soaring energy needs , say observers .

“ surrender to us imperialism ” but in india , leaders of the opposition are not so sure about this .
their reaction on thursday was that the government had surrendered to “ us imperialism ” and that the agreement violated india ’ s “ sovereignty and nuclear independence ” .
in the us , critics feared that the deal would allow india to resume atomic weapons testing with impunity , making it a de facto nuclear state without having signed the international nuclear non-proliferation treaty .
“ this is virtually an invitation to india to resume nuclear testing secure in the knowledge that a resumption of testing would not nullify this new nuclear trade agreement .

the city was devastated , and there were enormous casualties among civilians and refugees .
historians have argued about just how many people were killed in the firebombing on the night of feb .
13-14 , 1945 , with estimates ranging from 25,000 to 135,000 .
now , a special commission of a dozen experts , including university professors , archivists and military historians have said that after four years of research , the lower figure is more accurate .
so far , they have confirmed 18,000 deaths and say they have found no reason to assume that the final tally will be significantly higher .
their research is to continue until 2009 .
the team is drawing on archival and official documents , burial records and eye witness reports .
they have ruled out one theory suggesting that the death toll was much higher due to an unknown number of casualties among war refugees .
the authorities kept detailed records of all the victims - both german and foreign , the researchers said . dw staff -lrb- dc -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" if we are talking about a european defence industry , we must accept the idea that not everybody is doing the same thing as everybody else , " morin said .
" for example , we could do some work in france and other work elsewhere , and then pool together . "
french president nicolas sarkozy , whose country holds the rotating eu presidency , said wednesday that europe lacked the " appropriate measures to enact its defense policies . "
he said indirectly that europe risked losing political power if it was unable to defend itself .
at the heart of sarkozy 's military agenda is a desire to see europe able to stand alone if need be .
in line with this goal , the defense ministers committed at the meeting to filling key military shortfalls such as a lack of transport aircraft and helicopters , better troop protection and the ability to gather intelligence , including by satellite .
the key decisions made at the deauville meeting are to be finalized in brussels on nov .

integrated european defense manufacturing bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : production of the airbus a400m has been delayed by up to two years but there was growing evidence in deauville that eu leaders were warming to the idea that more could be done together , particularly at a time of economic slowdown .
one such example of cooperation is that concerning the a400m military transport aircraft , the components of which are being built by airbus in six countries : belgium - flaps - britain - flaps and outer wing box - france - nose fuselage and rudder - germany - fuselage - spain - tail - and turkey - ailerons and spoilers .

military erasmus a majority of eu countries also backed french plans for an exchange program involving young military officers .
inspired by the erasmus student exchange program , it would see officers from one member state spend some time training in another european country .
the project aims to increase cooperation between military colleges in order to improve interoperability and mould a common european defence culture , morin said .
however , some ministers expressed concern that such a program could turn into a one-way travelling system , whereby officers from poorer member states would want to spend time in some of europe 's best colleges , and fewer officers from richer states would be willing to train in countries such as romania or bulgaria . dpa news agency -lrb- dm -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the £ 575m expansion of the tram network , which was approved this year , will see it nearly double in size .
the train line through chorlton , which closed to passengers in 1967 , is being cleared and upgraded to allow trams to take passengers to the suburb .
lines out of the city centre will also be extended to rochdale railway station and droylsden , adding an extra 10 million journeys a year by 2012 .
funding approved the extensions , which will add 20 miles of track , are expected to be complete by 2012 .
the lines currently run from manchester city centre to bury , altrincham and eccles .
cash for a bigger expansion of the network was withdrawn by the government in 2004 over spiralling costs .
but the expansion was finally given the go ahead in may , when transport secretary ruth kelly pledged to put £ 244m towards the £ 575m total cost of the scheme .
the association of greater manchester authorities -lrb- agma -rrb- and the department for transport are jointly funding the scheme .
the chorlton extension will branch off from the altrincham line , with stops at firswood , chorlton-cum-hardy and st werburgh 's road .

the 86-13 vote now paves the way for president george w bush to sign the deal into law .
his administration has pushed for the agreement aggressively over the past three years .
the deal enables american companies to sell nuclear reactors , fuel and technology to india after a ban of more than three decades on such trade .
major shift it also marks a major shift in us foreign policy towards a country where relations in the past have been marked by mutual distrust .
secretary of state condoleezza rice is due to visit india on saturday where she will ink the pact with her indian counterpart , foreign minister pranab mukherjee .
the indian ambassador to the us , ronen sen , who has been working on the deal since it was conceptualised in the summer of 2005 , says it marks the " the highest point " in his career .
mr sen was the secretary of the indian atomic energy commission when the us decided to cut off the fuel supply for a nuclear reactor in the country .
" finally , things have come full circle , " he said , arguing that the deal was not just good for india and the us but also for the wider world .
nuclear power in india india has 14 reactors in commercial operation and nine under construction nuclear power supplies about 3 % of india 's electricity by 2050 , nuclear power is expected to provide 25 % of the country 's electricity india has limited coal and uranium reserves its huge thorium reserves - about 25 % of the world 's total - are expected to fuel its nuclear power programme long-term source : uranium information center indian firms eye nuclear business several prominent indian americans , who had lobbied aggressively for the deal , were jubilant .
" it 's the greatest alliance of the 21st century , " said swadesh chatterjee of the indo-us friendship council .
a north carolina resident , mr chatterjee says he made 69 trips to washington dc in the past three years .
" the indian community is usually very divided but we have shown that when we put our heads together , we can do miracles , " said mr chatterjee .
sanjay puri of the us india political action committee is equally ecstatic .
" this accord will bring a major shift in world 's direction , " he said .
mr puri and his group were instrumental in mobilising support for the deal and organised a gathering of congress members to press for it once it was cleared by the 45-member nuclear suppliers group last month .
' misuse technology ' while the deal can boast of bipartisan support in both the house and the senate , there were dissenting voices .
critics say the deal allows india to expand its nuclear power industry without requiring it to sign the non-proliferation treaty -lrb- npt -rrb- as other nations must .
they also fear it could boost india 's nuclear bomb stockpile by freeing its domestic fuel for weapons .
democrat senator byron dorgan says the us is telling the world that , like india " you can misuse american nuclear technology and secretly develop nuclear weapons , you can build a nuclear arsenal in defiance of the united nation resolution and you will be welcomed as someone exhibiting good behaviour with an agreement with the us " .
mr dorgan tried to introduce an amendment calling for the end of us nuclear trade if india detonates a nuclear device in future but the senate rejected it .
supporters of the deal say it will boost nuclear trade between two countries .
" it also means that up to a quarter of a million jobs could be generated in us once the trade gets going , " says swadesh chatterjee .
in the past three years the deal has gone through major ups and downs and overcame major political opposition in india .
but things looked much brighter for the supporters of the deal when it got approval from the nuclear suppliers group on 6 september .
the nsg green signal opened the door for other bilateral pacts and earlier this week india signed a nuclear deal with france .
russia has also been lobbying hard on behalf of its firms .
however , it 's believed the top firms to benefit from the over a billion dollars ' worth of expected trade would be us companies as it 's the us that has pulled india out of its nuclear isolation .

the 86-13 vote now paves the way for president george w bush to sign the deal into law .
his administration has pushed for the agreement aggressively over the past three years .
the deal enables american companies to sell nuclear reactors , fuel and technology to india after a ban of more than three decades on such trade .
major shift it also marks a major shift in us foreign policy towards a country where relations in the past have been marked by mutual distrust .
secretary of state condoleezza rice is due to visit india on saturday where she will ink the pact with her indian counterpart , foreign minister pranab mukherjee .
the indian ambassador to the us , ronen sen , who has been working on the deal since it was conceptualised in the summer of 2005 , says it marks the " the highest point " in his career .
mr sen was the secretary of the indian atomic energy commission when the us decided to cut off the fuel supply for a nuclear reactor in the country .
" finally , things have come full circle , " he said , arguing that the deal was not just good for india and the us but also for the wider world .
nuclear power in india india has 14 reactors in commercial operation and nine under construction nuclear power supplies about 3 % of india 's electricity by 2050 , nuclear power is expected to provide 25 % of the country 's electricity india has limited coal and uranium reserves its huge thorium reserves - about 25 % of the world 's total - are expected to fuel its nuclear power programme long-term source : uranium information center indian firms eye nuclear business several prominent indian americans , who had lobbied aggressively for the deal , were jubilant .
" it 's the greatest alliance of the 21st century , " said swadesh chatterjee of the indo-us friendship council .
a north carolina resident , mr chatterjee says he made 69 trips to washington dc in the past three years .
" the indian community is usually very divided but we have shown that when we put our heads together , we can do miracles , " said mr chatterjee .
sanjay puri of the us india political action committee is equally ecstatic .
" this accord will bring a major shift in world 's direction , " he said .
mr puri and his group were instrumental in mobilising support for the deal and organised a gathering of congress members to press for it once it was cleared by the 45-member nuclear suppliers group last month .
' misuse technology ' while the deal can boast of bipartisan support in both the house and the senate , there were dissenting voices .
critics say the deal allows india to expand its nuclear power industry without requiring it to sign the non-proliferation treaty -lrb- npt -rrb- as other nations must .
they also fear it could boost india 's nuclear bomb stockpile by freeing its domestic fuel for weapons .
democrat senator byron dorgan says the us is telling the world that , like india " you can misuse american nuclear technology and secretly develop nuclear weapons , you can build a nuclear arsenal in defiance of the united nation resolution and you will be welcomed as someone exhibiting good behaviour with an agreement with the us " .
mr dorgan tried to introduce an amendment calling for the end of us nuclear trade if india detonates a nuclear device in future but the senate rejected it .
supporters of the deal say it will boost nuclear trade between two countries .
" it also means that up to a quarter of a million jobs could be generated in us once the trade gets going , " says swadesh chatterjee .
in the past three years the deal has gone through major ups and downs and overcame major political opposition in india .
but things looked much brighter for the supporters of the deal when it got approval from the nuclear suppliers group on 6 september .
the nsg green signal opened the door for other bilateral pacts and earlier this week india signed a nuclear deal with france .
russia has also been lobbying hard on behalf of its firms .
however , it 's believed the top firms to benefit from the over a billion dollars ' worth of expected trade would be us companies as it 's the us that has pulled india out of its nuclear isolation .

" it 's the greatest alliance of the 21st century , " said swadesh chatterjee of the indo-us friendship council .
a north carolina resident , mr chatterjee says he made 69 trips to washington dc in the past three years .
" the indian community is usually very divided but we have shown that when we put our heads together , we can do miracles , " said mr chatterjee .
sanjay puri of the us india political action committee is equally ecstatic .
" this accord will bring a major shift in world 's direction , " he said .
mr puri and his group were instrumental in mobilising support for the deal and organised a gathering of congress members to press for it once it was cleared by the 45-member nuclear suppliers group last month .
' misuse technology ' while the deal can boast of bipartisan support in both the house and the senate , there were dissenting voices .
critics say the deal allows india to expand its nuclear power industry without requiring it to sign the non-proliferation treaty -lrb- npt -rrb- as other nations must .
they also fear it could boost india 's nuclear bomb stockpile by freeing its domestic fuel for weapons .
democrat senator byron dorgan says the us is telling the world that , like india " you can misuse american nuclear technology and secretly develop nuclear weapons , you can build a nuclear arsenal in defiance of the united nation resolution and you will be welcomed as someone exhibiting good behaviour with an agreement with the us " .
mr dorgan tried to introduce an amendment calling for the end of us nuclear trade if india detonates a nuclear device in future but the senate rejected it .
supporters of the deal say it will boost nuclear trade between two countries .
" it also means that up to a quarter of a million jobs could be generated in us once the trade gets going , " says swadesh chatterjee .
in the past three years the deal has gone through major ups and downs and overcame major political opposition in india .
but things looked much brighter for the supporters of the deal when it got approval from the nuclear suppliers group on 6 september .
the nsg green signal opened the door for other bilateral pacts and earlier this week india signed a nuclear deal with france .
russia has also been lobbying hard on behalf of its firms .
however , it 's believed the top firms to benefit from the over a billion dollars ' worth of expected trade would be us companies as it 's the us that has pulled india out of its nuclear isolation .
