he tells a polish woman the proper time to break the day-long fast , shares a joke in arabic with a visitor and supervises renovations going on in the hall .
before the three-story family home was converted into a mosque in 1991 , warsaw 's muslims gathered for prayers inside the egyptian embassy or rented out a dance hall before its nightly discotheque .

tiny minority expected to grow bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : poland 's islamic minority has deep roots in the country although most estimate poland has some 30,000 muslims - less than 0.1 per cent of the population - their small community is expected to grow .

charif came from damascus to study at university in 1982 , when poland was communist but seen as a cheap country for syrian , iraqi and libyan immigrants .
most of them returned to their homelands after graduation , but charif stayed after he married a polish woman .
those who arrived in the 1970s and 1980s now make up a small percentage of warsaw 's muslims , with many today coming from turkey , syria , pakistan and chechnya .
in the mix are a handful of poles who converted after marrying muslims , and a few who became muslims on their own .
outside warsaw , poland boasts two historic mosques from the 17th and 18th century-built in the villages of bohoniki and kruszyniany , settlements of poland 's first muslims in the 14th century .
the tartars made their home in the poland-lithuania commonwealth and practiced islam freely in exchange for military service .
their communities once numbered some 17,000 people , but today only several families remain as most tatar descendants moved to cities for work .
tatars enjoy more tolerance than those in cities some 2,000 muslim tatars live in poland , said bronislaw talkowski , head of a muslim community organization in kruszyniany .
although the village is largely catholic and conservative , talkowski says there 's more tolerance there than in more cosmopolitan cities .

but muslims remain a tiny minority in a country that 's 96 per cent catholic , and among a people that has rarely lived alongside immigrants .
warsaw does n't have the large immigrant groups of cities like london or paris , and poland during communist times saw more people wanting to leave than hoping for entry .
today the country is slowly becoming a likelier destination for immigrants , especially after it joined the european union in 2004 .

but inside , the mosque serves as the spiritual center for warsaw 's tiny muslim community : many slowly made their homes in an overwhelmingly roman catholic nation , and a few can trace their polish roots back centuries .
prayer services in warsaw on friday can draw up to 300 people .
there are arabic lessons on saturdays , a halal food store next door and an islamic cultural center that offers booklets on islam translated to polish .
imam nezar charif answers the phones , switching between polish and his native syrian dialect , before he leads the evening prayer during ramadan .
he tells a polish woman the proper time to break the day-long fast , shares a joke in arabic with a visitor and supervises renovations going on in the hall .
before the three-story family home was converted into a mosque in 1991 , warsaw 's muslims gathered for prayers inside the egyptian embassy or rented out a dance hall before its nightly discotheque .
now the mosque is so crowded there 's talk of building another downtown to accommodate muslims who work in the city .
tiny minority expected to grow bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : poland 's islamic minority has deep roots in the country although most estimate poland has some 30,000 muslims - less than 0.1 per cent of the population - their small community is expected to grow .
in warsaw , they number between 5,000 and 7,000 , and include businessmen , political refugees and those who came to study in the 1980s and stayed .
charif came from damascus to study at university in 1982 , when poland was communist but seen as a cheap country for syrian , iraqi and libyan immigrants .
most of them returned to their homelands after graduation , but charif stayed after he married a polish woman .
those who arrived in the 1970s and 1980s now make up a small percentage of warsaw 's muslims , with many today coming from turkey , syria , pakistan and chechnya .
in the mix are a handful of poles who converted after marrying muslims , and a few who became muslims on their own .
outside warsaw , poland boasts two historic mosques from the 17th and 18th century-built in the villages of bohoniki and kruszyniany , settlements of poland 's first muslims in the 14th century .
the tartars made their home in the poland-lithuania commonwealth and practiced islam freely in exchange for military service .
their communities once numbered some 17,000 people , but today only several families remain as most tatar descendants moved to cities for work .
tatars enjoy more tolerance than those in cities some 2,000 muslim tatars live in poland , said bronislaw talkowski , head of a muslim community organization in kruszyniany .
although the village is largely catholic and conservative , talkowski says there 's more tolerance there than in more cosmopolitan cities .

" and there 's no animosity between catholics and muslims like you read about in certain places .
that does n't happen here . "
but muslims remain a tiny minority in a country that 's 96 per cent catholic , and among a people that has rarely lived alongside immigrants .
warsaw does n't have the large immigrant groups of cities like london or paris , and poland during communist times saw more people wanting to leave than hoping for entry .
today the country is slowly becoming a likelier destination for immigrants , especially after it joined the european union in 2004 .
but for many poles outside larger cities , foreigners are still a strange sight .
charif says most varsovians are tolerant , and reports only a few isolated incidents that peaked after the september 11 , 2001 terrorist attacks on the united states , but soon tapered off .
harrassment comes from a small percentage of poles women who wear the hijab , or veil , can face more harassment because they look openly muslim , but charif says they report rare incidents that mostly come from elderly or drunk poles .

but even republicans are now going democrat for a far more compelling reason : fear that sarah palin could become president . jim sides , 55 , a californian living in bonn , is a swing voter who cast his ballot for president george w. bush in 2004 .
this time the one single factor driving him to the democratic ticket is the possibility that the republican vice-presidential nominee sarah palin is a heartbeat away from the american presidency .
if john mccain is elected next tuesday , the 72- year-old republican senator from arizona , who has battled skin cancer , would become the oldest us president in history .
“ let ’ s say mccain doesn ’ t make it health-wise - then we ’ d wind up with caribou barbie in the white house , ” sides said , referring to the alaskan governor ’ s bouffant hairdo and the political lightweight impression palin has made on millions of television viewers .
sides , a ceo of meyer sound germany , a division of the us manufacturer of professional loudspeakers , said he had been even leaning towards mccain before palin entered the republican ticket .
feeling betrayed by mccain ’ s choice bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : sarah palin lookalike being parodied on " saturday night live " “ i had a very high regard for john mccain based on my knowledge of his record as senator .
he was an honorable man , a war hero , but after he picked palin , i felt he had betrayed his country , ” he said .
“ i was in a state of pure shock .
leaving someone completely unqualified intellectually in a position to step into the presidency was so irresponsible , ” sides continued .
sides ’ wife lisa , who had also liked mccain , felt that the vietnam veteran ’ s extensive military experience could be valuable in finding a realistic exit strategy out of the morass in iraq .
“ but picking her -lrb- palin -rrb- pushed me over the edge towards barack obama .
mccain made that choice based on trying to win the election rather than having the best interests of our country in mind , ” she said . picking palin alienated expat voters the choice of palin was meant to balance and galvanize the republican ticket with a social conservative who could draw on the extreme , evangelical elements of the party as well as female hillary voters . but the move wound up alienating many of the us expatriates dw-world.de spoke to in the old american settlement of bonn ’ s scenic plittersdorf district on the rhine river , where life revolves around the international school and english-language church . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : us expats meet at stimson memorial chapel in bonn all those interviewed said it was a key , if not the key reason , to vote for barack obama , whether they liked the illinois senator or not .
the expatriates in the former german capital come from all over the map in the united states and reflect diverse political views .
they tend to be better off than their compatriots back home , since many are managers at blue chip us multinational companies .
that puts tax policy , trade and america 's image abroad high on the list of issues that matter to them . jeff nagel , 44 , a top executive at one such multinational , said that the way mccain made his vice-presidential choice reflected the personality differences between the two presidential candidates .
that sealed his decision to vote for obama instead , he said .
choice of vp reflects personality of candidates “ as a businessman , i look at an individual ’ s leadership skills regardless of their experience and position on the issues .
i agree with obama only about half the time , ” said nagel , who had previously voted for president george w. bush and describes himself as a free trader and fiscal conservative , but a moderate on social policy .
“ but look at how he has managed his campaign , taking on the democratic establishment clintons .
look at how he articulates his positions , and his ability to keep a level response through the ups and downs of his campaign , ” he said adding that obama has already shown that he is a thoughtful and effective leader through his choice of six-term delaware senator joe biden , 65 , as his running mate .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : obama 's choice of joe biden -lrb- left -rrb- has been widely praised “ biden is someone who can deliver the experience that obama lacks , but not the electoral votes that he needs to win the presidency .
obama ’ s choice was not based on the short term decision to get into office , but to put together a good team for the long haul in office , ” continued nagel , who declined to name his company since he was expressing his personal views .
many expats like nagel see mccain ’ s public outbursts and unpredictability that his republican handlers call “ maverick ” , in a negative light .
they say that mccain ’ s ‘ shoot first , ask later ’ fighter pilot mentality that might work on the battlefield , is unsuited for the us presidency , which requires a cool head .
concerns about mccain ’ s judgement others have expressed serious concerns about mccain ’ s judgement .
matthew howard , a global engineering manager based in cologne for ford motor company , who has republican leanings and is not convinced of obama , has vacillated so much with his absentee ballot that it is now too late to cast his vote .
“ if mccain had picked -lrb- former massachusetts governor -rrb- mitt romney or any other qualified candidate , i would vote for him in a flash .
picking a running mate was the most important decision of his candidacy and he blew it with palin .
how could he be so dramatically out of touch to pick this woman ? " asked howard , who added that the role of vp today is no longer just a president-in-waiting , but an important team player in the cabinet .
“ if i were back in michigan , i wouldn ’ t be able to sit home on election day .
it ’ d be painful , but i ’ d vote obama , ” said howard , explaining that he generally dislikes democrat fiscal and economic policies . resigned into voting for barack obama bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : expat absentee ballots can make a difference in swing states vera-lynn lewallen , 53 , who was born on a military base in germany and grew up in north carolina , sent in her absentee ballot , but initially thought of abstaining , since she is bitter at the democratic party for casting aside senator hillary clinton in favor of obama .
“ i ’ d rather not vote if i ’ m not happy with the democratic candidate , but now i feel blackmailed by the republicans into voting , because they picked this palin woman , ” she said .
then there is mickie nagel , who unlike her husband , an independent , has been a lifelong republican and even worked on the campaign to re-elect the incumbent president ’ s father , george bush sr. she was opposed to palin enough to cross the line for the first time in this election .
“ i never thought i would vote for a democrat , ” she said .
one ford engineer and mother of two , who asked not to be identified , did vote for mccain out of loyalty to the republican party , but also voiced serious doubts about palin .
she is taking strange comfort in the fact that her absentee vote won ’ t count in her home state . “ michigan is a clear blue state .

but even republicans are now going democrat for a far more compelling reason : fear that sarah palin could become president . jim sides , 55 , a californian living in bonn , is a swing voter who cast his ballot for president george w. bush in 2004 .
this time the one single factor driving him to the democratic ticket is the possibility that the republican vice-presidential nominee sarah palin is a heartbeat away from the american presidency .
if john mccain is elected next tuesday , the 72- year-old republican senator from arizona , who has battled skin cancer , would become the oldest us president in history .
“ let ’ s say mccain doesn ’ t make it health-wise - then we ’ d wind up with caribou barbie in the white house , ” sides said , referring to the alaskan governor ’ s bouffant hairdo and the political lightweight impression palin has made on millions of television viewers .
sides , a ceo of meyer sound germany , a division of the us manufacturer of professional loudspeakers , said he had been even leaning towards mccain before palin entered the republican ticket .
feeling betrayed by mccain ’ s choice bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : sarah palin lookalike being parodied on " saturday night live " “ i had a very high regard for john mccain based on my knowledge of his record as senator .
he was an honorable man , a war hero , but after he picked palin , i felt he had betrayed his country , ” he said .
“ i was in a state of pure shock .
leaving someone completely unqualified intellectually in a position to step into the presidency was so irresponsible , ” sides continued .
sides ’ wife lisa , who had also liked mccain , felt that the vietnam veteran ’ s extensive military experience could be valuable in finding a realistic exit strategy out of the morass in iraq .
“ but picking her -lrb- palin -rrb- pushed me over the edge towards barack obama .
mccain made that choice based on trying to win the election rather than having the best interests of our country in mind , ” she said . picking palin alienated expat voters the choice of palin was meant to balance and galvanize the republican ticket with a social conservative who could draw on the extreme , evangelical elements of the party as well as female hillary voters . but the move wound up alienating many of the us expatriates dw-world.de spoke to in the old american settlement of bonn ’ s scenic plittersdorf district on the rhine river , where life revolves around the international school and english-language church . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : us expats meet at stimson memorial chapel in bonn all those interviewed said it was a key , if not the key reason , to vote for barack obama , whether they liked the illinois senator or not .
the expatriates in the former german capital come from all over the map in the united states and reflect diverse political views .
they tend to be better off than their compatriots back home , since many are managers at blue chip us multinational companies .
that puts tax policy , trade and america 's image abroad high on the list of issues that matter to them . jeff nagel , 44 , a top executive at one such multinational , said that the way mccain made his vice-presidential choice reflected the personality differences between the two presidential candidates .
that sealed his decision to vote for obama instead , he said .
choice of vp reflects personality of candidates “ as a businessman , i look at an individual ’ s leadership skills regardless of their experience and position on the issues .
i agree with obama only about half the time , ” said nagel , who had previously voted for president george w. bush and describes himself as a free trader and fiscal conservative , but a moderate on social policy .
“ but look at how he has managed his campaign , taking on the democratic establishment clintons .
look at how he articulates his positions , and his ability to keep a level response through the ups and downs of his campaign , ” he said adding that obama has already shown that he is a thoughtful and effective leader through his choice of six-term delaware senator joe biden , 65 , as his running mate .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : obama 's choice of joe biden -lrb- left -rrb- has been widely praised “ biden is someone who can deliver the experience that obama lacks , but not the electoral votes that he needs to win the presidency .
obama ’ s choice was not based on the short term decision to get into office , but to put together a good team for the long haul in office , ” continued nagel , who declined to name his company since he was expressing his personal views .
many expats like nagel see mccain ’ s public outbursts and unpredictability that his republican handlers call “ maverick ” , in a negative light .
they say that mccain ’ s ‘ shoot first , ask later ’ fighter pilot mentality that might work on the battlefield , is unsuited for the us presidency , which requires a cool head .
concerns about mccain ’ s judgement others have expressed serious concerns about mccain ’ s judgement .
matthew howard , a global engineering manager based in cologne for ford motor company , who has republican leanings and is not convinced of obama , has vacillated so much with his absentee ballot that it is now too late to cast his vote .
“ if mccain had picked -lrb- former massachusetts governor -rrb- mitt romney or any other qualified candidate , i would vote for him in a flash .
picking a running mate was the most important decision of his candidacy and he blew it with palin .
how could he be so dramatically out of touch to pick this woman ? " asked howard , who added that the role of vp today is no longer just a president-in-waiting , but an important team player in the cabinet .
“ if i were back in michigan , i wouldn ’ t be able to sit home on election day .
it ’ d be painful , but i ’ d vote obama , ” said howard , explaining that he generally dislikes democrat fiscal and economic policies . resigned into voting for barack obama bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : expat absentee ballots can make a difference in swing states vera-lynn lewallen , 53 , who was born on a military base in germany and grew up in north carolina , sent in her absentee ballot , but initially thought of abstaining , since she is bitter at the democratic party for casting aside senator hillary clinton in favor of obama .
“ i ’ d rather not vote if i ’ m not happy with the democratic candidate , but now i feel blackmailed by the republicans into voting , because they picked this palin woman , ” she said .
then there is mickie nagel , who unlike her husband , an independent , has been a lifelong republican and even worked on the campaign to re-elect the incumbent president ’ s father , george bush sr. she was opposed to palin enough to cross the line for the first time in this election .
“ i never thought i would vote for a democrat , ” she said .
one ford engineer and mother of two , who asked not to be identified , did vote for mccain out of loyalty to the republican party , but also voiced serious doubts about palin .

hoffenheim reclaimed the top spot with a win saturday . goals in each half from martin fenin and michael fink gave frankfurt victory after moenchengladbach had taken the lead courtesy of a marco russ own goal . the win lifts frankfurt -lrb- 12 points -rrb- further from the relegation zone , while moenchengladbach stay second to bottom on seven points , one ahead of energie cottbus . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : frankfurt 's three points may prove crucial to avoiding relegation " we have a lot of mental problems - psychological , " moenchengladbach coach hans meyer said after a second defeat after three games in charge .
" the situation is bad , very bad . " in the other bundesliga match on sunday , nov .
2 , borussia dortmund were held to a 1-1 draw by bochum - their sixth of the season - in a disappointing ruhr derby . dortmund stay sixth on 18 points - seven points behind leaders hoffenheim . it was a sixth game without a defeat for dortmund who have only been beaten once this season , but have now drawn six . " the way we played we did n't deserve more than a point , " coach juergen klopp said .
" we have been unbeaten in so many games , but it 's time we won a home game . " hoffenheim back on top bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hoffenheim has scored more goals than any other bundesliga team hoffenheim thrashed karlsruhe 4-1 on saturday to reclaim the top spot .
the win puts rolf rangnick 's side onto to 25 points from 11 games , one more than bayer leverkusen , who had gone top overnight after defeating wolfsburg 2-0 on friday . high-scoring hoffenheim 's winning run continued at their interim home in mannheim , with league top scorer ibisevic taking his tally to 13 and the team moving up to 31 goals . after a 15th-minute opener from ibisevic , karlsruhe bounced back through sebastian freis and the visitors managed to frustrate the home side until obasi struck in the 67th . any hopes of another comeback were then quashed when ibisevic headed his second in the 75th and obasi scored again three minutes later . klose , ribery , podolski score for bayern bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : podolski , klose and ribery who all scored for bayern bayern earned a hard-fought 3-1 victory over lowly bielefeld thanks to goals from miroslav klose , franck ribery and substitute lukas podolski from the penalty spot to go third on 21 points . bayern munich made it a fourth straight league win , but left it relatively late to overcome bielefeld in a one-sided match . coach juergen klinsmann found no place in the starting line-up for podolski despite the injury absence of italy striker luca toni , preferring to start with a five-man midfield and klose as a lone striker . klinsmann insisted it was a tactical decision rather than a lack of confidence in podolski , saying he wanted to test the formation ahead of wednesday 's champions league encounter with fiorentina . it appeared to pay off when klose thumped in a 25th-minute opener against an injury-hit arminia side who had not won in munich for 29 years . klinsmann switched tactics after the break and an armenia goal from the penalty spot , bringing on podolski for bastian schweinsteiger and the move worked when the germany striker set up ribery to score in the 77th minute . podolski then notched the third himself from the penalty spot six minutes from time after a foul on ribery and two minutes after tesche was dismissed for a tackle from behind on the french international . klinsmann had said in a newspaper interview podolski had not done enough to get into the team ahead of klose or toni , but there was praise for the striker after the match . " he brought a lot of movement into the game and went into where it hurt , getting into the penalty area and seeking to finish things off , " he said . however podolski 's future at the club now appears to be in doubt . " you can understand that i will be considering things in the winter break , " the striker said .
" but we have some important games coming up and i do n't want to get involved in speculation . " diego helps werder to huge win bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bremen 's diego , center , as he slots the ball in hamburg slipped two places to fifth after crashing to a 3-0 defeat at lowly hanover who struck in the fifth and 18th minutes through bastian shultz and jan schlaudraff before jiri stajner added a third 11 minutes from time . werder bremen swept to a 5-1 victory over hertha berlin to end a six-game unbeaten series by the visitors . goalkeeper christopher gaeng on his debut was at fault for the first goal in the 14th minute when he missed a diego corner and the ball came off defender gojko kacer to deflect into his own net . diego struck a brilliant second six minutes later when he chested the ball down just inside the area and twisted to volley the ball over the keeper . the game was effectively over when sweden striker markus rosenberg poked the ball between the legs of the unfortunate gaeng from close range three minutes before the break for werder 's third . diego then set up the fourth with a pass to claudio pizarro who slid the ball home in the 59th .
hertha pulled one back with a header from brazilian cicero in the 68th but pizarro headed a fifth five minutes from time . the victory was the first in the league for thomas schaaf 's team after six games in the league and champions league . late victory for schalke schalke 's engelaar was sent off at cottbus for an insulting gesture - tapping his forehead with his index finger to a linesman , leaving schalke to play most of the second half with 10 men . however goals from heikko westermann 10 minutes from time and jefferson farfan in the last minute - at the second attempt after his penalty was saved - gave the blues a late victory . milivoje novakovic scored twice and portugal midfielder petit struck in stoppage time as cologne came away from vfb stuttgart with a 3-1 win . the slovenia striker struck in the 3rd and 61st minutes .
roberto hilbert pulled one back in the 69th but then made a mistake to allow petit to score in the fourth minute of stoppage time . dpa news agency -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de us election -pipe- 02.11.2008 fear of a palin presidency drives us expats to vote for obama großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : alaskan sarah palin -lrb- right -rrb- is known as the " caribou barbie " for her lightweight image the economy , taxes and america 's image are hot-button issues for us expats in germany .
but even republicans are now going democrat for a far more compelling reason : fear that sarah palin could become president . jim sides , 55 , a californian living in bonn , is a swing voter who cast his ballot for president george w. bush in 2004 .
this time the one single factor driving him to the democratic ticket is the possibility that the republican vice-presidential nominee sarah palin is a heartbeat away from the american presidency .
if john mccain is elected next tuesday , the 72- year-old republican senator from arizona , who has battled skin cancer , would become the oldest us president in history .
“ let ’ s say mccain doesn ’ t make it health-wise - then we ’ d wind up with caribou barbie in the white house , ” sides said , referring to the alaskan governor ’ s bouffant hairdo and the political lightweight impression palin has made on millions of television viewers .
sides , a ceo of meyer sound germany , a division of the us manufacturer of professional loudspeakers , said he had been even leaning towards mccain before palin entered the republican ticket .
feeling betrayed by mccain ’ s choice bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : sarah palin lookalike being parodied on " saturday night live " “ i had a very high regard for john mccain based on my knowledge of his record as senator .
he was an honorable man , a war hero , but after he picked palin , i felt he had betrayed his country , ” he said .
“ i was in a state of pure shock .
leaving someone completely unqualified intellectually in a position to step into the presidency was so irresponsible , ” sides continued .
sides ’ wife lisa , who had also liked mccain , felt that the vietnam veteran ’ s extensive military experience could be valuable in finding a realistic exit strategy out of the morass in iraq .
“ but picking her -lrb- palin -rrb- pushed me over the edge towards barack obama .
mccain made that choice based on trying to win the election rather than having the best interests of our country in mind , ” she said . picking palin alienated expat voters the choice of palin was meant to balance and galvanize the republican ticket with a social conservative who could draw on the extreme , evangelical elements of the party as well as female hillary voters . but the move wound up alienating many of the us expatriates dw-world.de spoke to in the old american settlement of bonn ’ s scenic plittersdorf district on the rhine river , where life revolves around the international school and english-language church . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : us expats meet at stimson memorial chapel in bonn all those interviewed said it was a key , if not the key reason , to vote for barack obama , whether they liked the illinois senator or not .
the expatriates in the former german capital come from all over the map in the united states and reflect diverse political views .
they tend to be better off than their compatriots back home , since many are managers at blue chip us multinational companies .
that puts tax policy , trade and america 's image abroad high on the list of issues that matter to them . jeff nagel , 44 , a top executive at one such multinational , said that the way mccain made his vice-presidential choice reflected the personality differences between the two presidential candidates .
that sealed his decision to vote for obama instead , he said .
choice of vp reflects personality of candidates “ as a businessman , i look at an individual ’ s leadership skills regardless of their experience and position on the issues .
i agree with obama only about half the time , ” said nagel , who had previously voted for president george w. bush and describes himself as a free trader and fiscal conservative , but a moderate on social policy .

but even republicans are now going democrat for a far more compelling reason : fear that sarah palin could become president . jim sides , 55 , a californian living in bonn , is a swing voter who cast his ballot for president george w. bush in 2004 .
this time the one single factor driving him to the democratic ticket is the possibility that the republican vice-presidential nominee sarah palin is a heartbeat away from the american presidency .
if john mccain is elected next tuesday , the 72- year-old republican senator from arizona , who has battled skin cancer , would become the oldest us president in history .
“ let ’ s say mccain doesn ’ t make it health-wise - then we ’ d wind up with caribou barbie in the white house , ” sides said , referring to the alaskan governor ’ s bouffant hairdo and the political lightweight impression palin has made on millions of television viewers .
sides , a ceo of meyer sound germany , a division of the us manufacturer of professional loudspeakers , said he had been even leaning towards mccain before palin entered the republican ticket .
feeling betrayed by mccain ’ s choice bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : sarah palin lookalike being parodied on " saturday night live " “ i had a very high regard for john mccain based on my knowledge of his record as senator .
he was an honorable man , a war hero , but after he picked palin , i felt he had betrayed his country , ” he said .
“ i was in a state of pure shock .
leaving someone completely unqualified intellectually in a position to step into the presidency was so irresponsible , ” sides continued .
sides ’ wife lisa , who had also liked mccain , felt that the vietnam veteran ’ s extensive military experience could be valuable in finding a realistic exit strategy out of the morass in iraq .
“ but picking her -lrb- palin -rrb- pushed me over the edge towards barack obama .
mccain made that choice based on trying to win the election rather than having the best interests of our country in mind , ” she said . picking palin alienated expat voters the choice of palin was meant to balance and galvanize the republican ticket with a social conservative who could draw on the extreme , evangelical elements of the party as well as female hillary voters . but the move wound up alienating many of the us expatriates dw-world.de spoke to in the old american settlement of bonn ’ s scenic plittersdorf district on the rhine river , where life revolves around the international school and english-language church . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : us expats meet at stimson memorial chapel in bonn all those interviewed said it was a key , if not the key reason , to vote for barack obama , whether they liked the illinois senator or not .

they tend to be better off than their compatriots back home , since many are managers at blue chip us multinational companies .
that puts tax policy , trade and america 's image abroad high on the list of issues that matter to them . jeff nagel , 44 , a top executive at one such multinational , said that the way mccain made his vice-presidential choice reflected the personality differences between the two presidential candidates .
that sealed his decision to vote for obama instead , he said .
choice of vp reflects personality of candidates “ as a businessman , i look at an individual ’ s leadership skills regardless of their experience and position on the issues .

hoffenheim reclaimed the top spot with a win saturday . goals in each half from martin fenin and michael fink gave frankfurt victory after moenchengladbach had taken the lead courtesy of a marco russ own goal . the win lifts frankfurt -lrb- 12 points -rrb- further from the relegation zone , while moenchengladbach stay second to bottom on seven points , one ahead of energie cottbus . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : frankfurt 's three points may prove crucial to avoiding relegation " we have a lot of mental problems - psychological , " moenchengladbach coach hans meyer said after a second defeat after three games in charge .
" the situation is bad , very bad . " in the other bundesliga match on sunday , nov .
2 , borussia dortmund were held to a 1-1 draw by bochum - their sixth of the season - in a disappointing ruhr derby . dortmund stay sixth on 18 points - seven points behind leaders hoffenheim . it was a sixth game without a defeat for dortmund who have only been beaten once this season , but have now drawn six . " the way we played we did n't deserve more than a point , " coach juergen klopp said .
" we have been unbeaten in so many games , but it 's time we won a home game . " hoffenheim back on top bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hoffenheim has scored more goals than any other bundesliga team hoffenheim thrashed karlsruhe 4-1 on saturday to reclaim the top spot .
the win puts rolf rangnick 's side onto to 25 points from 11 games , one more than bayer leverkusen , who had gone top overnight after defeating wolfsburg 2-0 on friday . high-scoring hoffenheim 's winning run continued at their interim home in mannheim , with league top scorer ibisevic taking his tally to 13 and the team moving up to 31 goals . after a 15th-minute opener from ibisevic , karlsruhe bounced back through sebastian freis and the visitors managed to frustrate the home side until obasi struck in the 67th . any hopes of another comeback were then quashed when ibisevic headed his second in the 75th and obasi scored again three minutes later . klose , ribery , podolski score for bayern bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : podolski , klose and ribery who all scored for bayern bayern earned a hard-fought 3-1 victory over lowly bielefeld thanks to goals from miroslav klose , franck ribery and substitute lukas podolski from the penalty spot to go third on 21 points . bayern munich made it a fourth straight league win , but left it relatively late to overcome bielefeld in a one-sided match . coach juergen klinsmann found no place in the starting line-up for podolski despite the injury absence of italy striker luca toni , preferring to start with a five-man midfield and klose as a lone striker . klinsmann insisted it was a tactical decision rather than a lack of confidence in podolski , saying he wanted to test the formation ahead of wednesday 's champions league encounter with fiorentina . it appeared to pay off when klose thumped in a 25th-minute opener against an injury-hit arminia side who had not won in munich for 29 years . klinsmann switched tactics after the break and an armenia goal from the penalty spot , bringing on podolski for bastian schweinsteiger and the move worked when the germany striker set up ribery to score in the 77th minute . podolski then notched the third himself from the penalty spot six minutes from time after a foul on ribery and two minutes after tesche was dismissed for a tackle from behind on the french international . klinsmann had said in a newspaper interview podolski had not done enough to get into the team ahead of klose or toni , but there was praise for the striker after the match . " he brought a lot of movement into the game and went into where it hurt , getting into the penalty area and seeking to finish things off , " he said . however podolski 's future at the club now appears to be in doubt . " you can understand that i will be considering things in the winter break , " the striker said .
" but we have some important games coming up and i do n't want to get involved in speculation . " diego helps werder to huge win bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bremen 's diego , center , as he slots the ball in hamburg slipped two places to fifth after crashing to a 3-0 defeat at lowly hanover who struck in the fifth and 18th minutes through bastian shultz and jan schlaudraff before jiri stajner added a third 11 minutes from time . werder bremen swept to a 5-1 victory over hertha berlin to end a six-game unbeaten series by the visitors . goalkeeper christopher gaeng on his debut was at fault for the first goal in the 14th minute when he missed a diego corner and the ball came off defender gojko kacer to deflect into his own net . diego struck a brilliant second six minutes later when he chested the ball down just inside the area and twisted to volley the ball over the keeper . the game was effectively over when sweden striker markus rosenberg poked the ball between the legs of the unfortunate gaeng from close range three minutes before the break for werder 's third . diego then set up the fourth with a pass to claudio pizarro who slid the ball home in the 59th .
hertha pulled one back with a header from brazilian cicero in the 68th but pizarro headed a fifth five minutes from time . the victory was the first in the league for thomas schaaf 's team after six games in the league and champions league . late victory for schalke schalke 's engelaar was sent off at cottbus for an insulting gesture - tapping his forehead with his index finger to a linesman , leaving schalke to play most of the second half with 10 men . however goals from heikko westermann 10 minutes from time and jefferson farfan in the last minute - at the second attempt after his penalty was saved - gave the blues a late victory . milivoje novakovic scored twice and portugal midfielder petit struck in stoppage time as cologne came away from vfb stuttgart with a 3-1 win . the slovenia striker struck in the 3rd and 61st minutes .
roberto hilbert pulled one back in the 69th but then made a mistake to allow petit to score in the fourth minute of stoppage time . dpa news agency -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de us election -pipe- 02.11.2008 fear of a palin presidency drives us expats to vote for obama großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : alaskan sarah palin -lrb- right -rrb- is known as the " caribou barbie " for her lightweight image the economy , taxes and america 's image are hot-button issues for us expats in germany .
but even republicans are now going democrat for a far more compelling reason : fear that sarah palin could become president . jim sides , 55 , a californian living in bonn , is a swing voter who cast his ballot for president george w. bush in 2004 .
this time the one single factor driving him to the democratic ticket is the possibility that the republican vice-presidential nominee sarah palin is a heartbeat away from the american presidency .
if john mccain is elected next tuesday , the 72- year-old republican senator from arizona , who has battled skin cancer , would become the oldest us president in history .
“ let ’ s say mccain doesn ’ t make it health-wise - then we ’ d wind up with caribou barbie in the white house , ” sides said , referring to the alaskan governor ’ s bouffant hairdo and the political lightweight impression palin has made on millions of television viewers .
sides , a ceo of meyer sound germany , a division of the us manufacturer of professional loudspeakers , said he had been even leaning towards mccain before palin entered the republican ticket .
feeling betrayed by mccain ’ s choice bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : sarah palin lookalike being parodied on " saturday night live " “ i had a very high regard for john mccain based on my knowledge of his record as senator .
he was an honorable man , a war hero , but after he picked palin , i felt he had betrayed his country , ” he said .
“ i was in a state of pure shock .
leaving someone completely unqualified intellectually in a position to step into the presidency was so irresponsible , ” sides continued .
sides ’ wife lisa , who had also liked mccain , felt that the vietnam veteran ’ s extensive military experience could be valuable in finding a realistic exit strategy out of the morass in iraq .
“ but picking her -lrb- palin -rrb- pushed me over the edge towards barack obama .
mccain made that choice based on trying to win the election rather than having the best interests of our country in mind , ” she said . picking palin alienated expat voters the choice of palin was meant to balance and galvanize the republican ticket with a social conservative who could draw on the extreme , evangelical elements of the party as well as female hillary voters . but the move wound up alienating many of the us expatriates dw-world.de spoke to in the old american settlement of bonn ’ s scenic plittersdorf district on the rhine river , where life revolves around the international school and english-language church . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : us expats meet at stimson memorial chapel in bonn all those interviewed said it was a key , if not the key reason , to vote for barack obama , whether they liked the illinois senator or not .
the expatriates in the former german capital come from all over the map in the united states and reflect diverse political views .
they tend to be better off than their compatriots back home , since many are managers at blue chip us multinational companies .
that puts tax policy , trade and america 's image abroad high on the list of issues that matter to them . jeff nagel , 44 , a top executive at one such multinational , said that the way mccain made his vice-presidential choice reflected the personality differences between the two presidential candidates .
that sealed his decision to vote for obama instead , he said .
choice of vp reflects personality of candidates “ as a businessman , i look at an individual ’ s leadership skills regardless of their experience and position on the issues .
i agree with obama only about half the time , ” said nagel , who had previously voted for president george w. bush and describes himself as a free trader and fiscal conservative , but a moderate on social policy .
“ but look at how he has managed his campaign , taking on the democratic establishment clintons .
look at how he articulates his positions , and his ability to keep a level response through the ups and downs of his campaign , ” he said adding that obama has already shown that he is a thoughtful and effective leader through his choice of six-term delaware senator joe biden , 65 , as his running mate .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : obama 's choice of joe biden -lrb- left -rrb- has been widely praised “ biden is someone who can deliver the experience that obama lacks , but not the electoral votes that he needs to win the presidency .
obama ’ s choice was not based on the short term decision to get into office , but to put together a good team for the long haul in office , ” continued nagel , who declined to name his company since he was expressing his personal views .
many expats like nagel see mccain ’ s public outbursts and unpredictability that his republican handlers call “ maverick ” , in a negative light .
they say that mccain ’ s ‘ shoot first , ask later ’ fighter pilot mentality that might work on the battlefield , is unsuited for the us presidency , which requires a cool head .
concerns about mccain ’ s judgement others have expressed serious concerns about mccain ’ s judgement .
matthew howard , a global engineering manager based in cologne for ford motor company , who has republican leanings and is not convinced of obama , has vacillated so much with his absentee ballot that it is now too late to cast his vote .
“ if mccain had picked -lrb- former massachusetts governor -rrb- mitt romney or any other qualified candidate , i would vote for him in a flash .
picking a running mate was the most important decision of his candidacy and he blew it with palin .
how could he be so dramatically out of touch to pick this woman ? " asked howard , who added that the role of vp today is no longer just a president-in-waiting , but an important team player in the cabinet .
“ if i were back in michigan , i wouldn ’ t be able to sit home on election day .
it ’ d be painful , but i ’ d vote obama , ” said howard , explaining that he generally dislikes democrat fiscal and economic policies . resigned into voting for barack obama bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : expat absentee ballots can make a difference in swing states vera-lynn lewallen , 53 , who was born on a military base in germany and grew up in north carolina , sent in her absentee ballot , but initially thought of abstaining , since she is bitter at the democratic party for casting aside senator hillary clinton in favor of obama .
“ i ’ d rather not vote if i ’ m not happy with the democratic candidate , but now i feel blackmailed by the republicans into voting , because they picked this palin woman , ” she said .
then there is mickie nagel , who unlike her husband , an independent , has been a lifelong republican and even worked on the campaign to re-elect the incumbent president ’ s father , george bush sr. she was opposed to palin enough to cross the line for the first time in this election .
“ i never thought i would vote for a democrat , ” she said .
one ford engineer and mother of two , who asked not to be identified , did vote for mccain out of loyalty to the republican party , but also voiced serious doubts about palin .
she is taking strange comfort in the fact that her absentee vote won ’ t count in her home state . “ michigan is a clear blue state .
obama will win there anyway , ” she said with a sigh of relief . diana fong send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

but even republicans are now going democrat for a far more compelling reason : fear that sarah palin could become president . jim sides , 55 , a californian living in bonn , is a swing voter who cast his ballot for president george w. bush in 2004 .
this time the one single factor driving him to the democratic ticket is the possibility that the republican vice-presidential nominee sarah palin is a heartbeat away from the american presidency .
if john mccain is elected next tuesday , the 72- year-old republican senator from arizona , who has battled skin cancer , would become the oldest us president in history .
“ let ’ s say mccain doesn ’ t make it health-wise - then we ’ d wind up with caribou barbie in the white house , ” sides said , referring to the alaskan governor ’ s bouffant hairdo and the political lightweight impression palin has made on millions of television viewers .
sides , a ceo of meyer sound germany , a division of the us manufacturer of professional loudspeakers , said he had been even leaning towards mccain before palin entered the republican ticket .
feeling betrayed by mccain ’ s choice bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : sarah palin lookalike being parodied on " saturday night live " “ i had a very high regard for john mccain based on my knowledge of his record as senator .
he was an honorable man , a war hero , but after he picked palin , i felt he had betrayed his country , ” he said .
“ i was in a state of pure shock .
leaving someone completely unqualified intellectually in a position to step into the presidency was so irresponsible , ” sides continued .
sides ’ wife lisa , who had also liked mccain , felt that the vietnam veteran ’ s extensive military experience could be valuable in finding a realistic exit strategy out of the morass in iraq .
“ but picking her -lrb- palin -rrb- pushed me over the edge towards barack obama .
mccain made that choice based on trying to win the election rather than having the best interests of our country in mind , ” she said . picking palin alienated expat voters the choice of palin was meant to balance and galvanize the republican ticket with a social conservative who could draw on the extreme , evangelical elements of the party as well as female hillary voters . but the move wound up alienating many of the us expatriates dw-world.de spoke to in the old american settlement of bonn ’ s scenic plittersdorf district on the rhine river , where life revolves around the international school and english-language church . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : us expats meet at stimson memorial chapel in bonn all those interviewed said it was a key , if not the key reason , to vote for barack obama , whether they liked the illinois senator or not .
the expatriates in the former german capital come from all over the map in the united states and reflect diverse political views .
they tend to be better off than their compatriots back home , since many are managers at blue chip us multinational companies .
that puts tax policy , trade and america 's image abroad high on the list of issues that matter to them . jeff nagel , 44 , a top executive at one such multinational , said that the way mccain made his vice-presidential choice reflected the personality differences between the two presidential candidates .
that sealed his decision to vote for obama instead , he said .
choice of vp reflects personality of candidates “ as a businessman , i look at an individual ’ s leadership skills regardless of their experience and position on the issues .
i agree with obama only about half the time , ” said nagel , who had previously voted for president george w. bush and describes himself as a free trader and fiscal conservative , but a moderate on social policy .
“ but look at how he has managed his campaign , taking on the democratic establishment clintons .
look at how he articulates his positions , and his ability to keep a level response through the ups and downs of his campaign , ” he said adding that obama has already shown that he is a thoughtful and effective leader through his choice of six-term delaware senator joe biden , 65 , as his running mate .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : obama 's choice of joe biden -lrb- left -rrb- has been widely praised “ biden is someone who can deliver the experience that obama lacks , but not the electoral votes that he needs to win the presidency .
obama ’ s choice was not based on the short term decision to get into office , but to put together a good team for the long haul in office , ” continued nagel , who declined to name his company since he was expressing his personal views .
many expats like nagel see mccain ’ s public outbursts and unpredictability that his republican handlers call “ maverick ” , in a negative light .
they say that mccain ’ s ‘ shoot first , ask later ’ fighter pilot mentality that might work on the battlefield , is unsuited for the us presidency , which requires a cool head .
concerns about mccain ’ s judgement others have expressed serious concerns about mccain ’ s judgement .
matthew howard , a global engineering manager based in cologne for ford motor company , who has republican leanings and is not convinced of obama , has vacillated so much with his absentee ballot that it is now too late to cast his vote .
“ if mccain had picked -lrb- former massachusetts governor -rrb- mitt romney or any other qualified candidate , i would vote for him in a flash .
picking a running mate was the most important decision of his candidacy and he blew it with palin .
how could he be so dramatically out of touch to pick this woman ? " asked howard , who added that the role of vp today is no longer just a president-in-waiting , but an important team player in the cabinet .
“ if i were back in michigan , i wouldn ’ t be able to sit home on election day .
it ’ d be painful , but i ’ d vote obama , ” said howard , explaining that he generally dislikes democrat fiscal and economic policies . resigned into voting for barack obama bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : expat absentee ballots can make a difference in swing states vera-lynn lewallen , 53 , who was born on a military base in germany and grew up in north carolina , sent in her absentee ballot , but initially thought of abstaining , since she is bitter at the democratic party for casting aside senator hillary clinton in favor of obama .
“ i ’ d rather not vote if i ’ m not happy with the democratic candidate , but now i feel blackmailed by the republicans into voting , because they picked this palin woman , ” she said .
then there is mickie nagel , who unlike her husband , an independent , has been a lifelong republican and even worked on the campaign to re-elect the incumbent president ’ s father , george bush sr. she was opposed to palin enough to cross the line for the first time in this election .
“ i never thought i would vote for a democrat , ” she said .
one ford engineer and mother of two , who asked not to be identified , did vote for mccain out of loyalty to the republican party , but also voiced serious doubts about palin .

but inside , the mosque serves as the spiritual center for warsaw 's tiny muslim community : many slowly made their homes in an overwhelmingly roman catholic nation , and a few can trace their polish roots back centuries .
prayer services in warsaw on friday can draw up to 300 people .
there are arabic lessons on saturdays , a halal food store next door and an islamic cultural center that offers booklets on islam translated to polish .
imam nezar charif answers the phones , switching between polish and his native syrian dialect , before he leads the evening prayer during ramadan .
he tells a polish woman the proper time to break the day-long fast , shares a joke in arabic with a visitor and supervises renovations going on in the hall .
before the three-story family home was converted into a mosque in 1991 , warsaw 's muslims gathered for prayers inside the egyptian embassy or rented out a dance hall before its nightly discotheque .

tiny minority expected to grow bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : poland 's islamic minority has deep roots in the country although most estimate poland has some 30,000 muslims - less than 0.1 per cent of the population - their small community is expected to grow .
in warsaw , they number between 5,000 and 7,000 , and include businessmen , political refugees and those who came to study in the 1980s and stayed .
charif came from damascus to study at university in 1982 , when poland was communist but seen as a cheap country for syrian , iraqi and libyan immigrants .
most of them returned to their homelands after graduation , but charif stayed after he married a polish woman .
those who arrived in the 1970s and 1980s now make up a small percentage of warsaw 's muslims , with many today coming from turkey , syria , pakistan and chechnya .
in the mix are a handful of poles who converted after marrying muslims , and a few who became muslims on their own .
outside warsaw , poland boasts two historic mosques from the 17th and 18th century-built in the villages of bohoniki and kruszyniany , settlements of poland 's first muslims in the 14th century .
the tartars made their home in the poland-lithuania commonwealth and practiced islam freely in exchange for military service .
their communities once numbered some 17,000 people , but today only several families remain as most tatar descendants moved to cities for work .
tatars enjoy more tolerance than those in cities some 2,000 muslim tatars live in poland , said bronislaw talkowski , head of a muslim community organization in kruszyniany .
although the village is largely catholic and conservative , talkowski says there 's more tolerance there than in more cosmopolitan cities .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the wooden mosque in bohoniki " tatars settled kruszyniany at the end of the 17th century ... the locals know the tatars from that time , " talkowski said .
" and there 's no animosity between catholics and muslims like you read about in certain places .
that does n't happen here . "
but muslims remain a tiny minority in a country that 's 96 per cent catholic , and among a people that has rarely lived alongside immigrants .
warsaw does n't have the large immigrant groups of cities like london or paris , and poland during communist times saw more people wanting to leave than hoping for entry .
today the country is slowly becoming a likelier destination for immigrants , especially after it joined the european union in 2004 .
but for many poles outside larger cities , foreigners are still a strange sight .
charif says most varsovians are tolerant , and reports only a few isolated incidents that peaked after the september 11 , 2001 terrorist attacks on the united states , but soon tapered off .
harrassment comes from a small percentage of poles women who wear the hijab , or veil , can face more harassment because they look openly muslim , but charif says they report rare incidents that mostly come from elderly or drunk poles .

before the three-story family home was converted into a mosque in 1991 , warsaw 's muslims gathered for prayers inside the egyptian embassy or rented out a dance hall before its nightly discotheque .
now the mosque is so crowded there 's talk of building another downtown to accommodate muslims who work in the city .
tiny minority expected to grow bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : poland 's islamic minority has deep roots in the country although most estimate poland has some 30,000 muslims - less than 0.1 per cent of the population - their small community is expected to grow .
in warsaw , they number between 5,000 and 7,000 , and include businessmen , political refugees and those who came to study in the 1980s and stayed .
charif came from damascus to study at university in 1982 , when poland was communist but seen as a cheap country for syrian , iraqi and libyan immigrants .
most of them returned to their homelands after graduation , but charif stayed after he married a polish woman .
those who arrived in the 1970s and 1980s now make up a small percentage of warsaw 's muslims , with many today coming from turkey , syria , pakistan and chechnya .
in the mix are a handful of poles who converted after marrying muslims , and a few who became muslims on their own .
outside warsaw , poland boasts two historic mosques from the 17th and 18th century-built in the villages of bohoniki and kruszyniany , settlements of poland 's first muslims in the 14th century .
the tartars made their home in the poland-lithuania commonwealth and practiced islam freely in exchange for military service .
their communities once numbered some 17,000 people , but today only several families remain as most tatar descendants moved to cities for work .
tatars enjoy more tolerance than those in cities some 2,000 muslim tatars live in poland , said bronislaw talkowski , head of a muslim community organization in kruszyniany .
although the village is largely catholic and conservative , talkowski says there 's more tolerance there than in more cosmopolitan cities .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the wooden mosque in bohoniki " tatars settled kruszyniany at the end of the 17th century ... the locals know the tatars from that time , " talkowski said .
" and there 's no animosity between catholics and muslims like you read about in certain places .
that does n't happen here . "
but muslims remain a tiny minority in a country that 's 96 per cent catholic , and among a people that has rarely lived alongside immigrants .
warsaw does n't have the large immigrant groups of cities like london or paris , and poland during communist times saw more people wanting to leave than hoping for entry .
today the country is slowly becoming a likelier destination for immigrants , especially after it joined the european union in 2004 .
but for many poles outside larger cities , foreigners are still a strange sight .
charif says most varsovians are tolerant , and reports only a few isolated incidents that peaked after the september 11 , 2001 terrorist attacks on the united states , but soon tapered off .
harrassment comes from a small percentage of poles women who wear the hijab , or veil , can face more harassment because they look openly muslim , but charif says they report rare incidents that mostly come from elderly or drunk poles .
" they 're rare but they happen , " charif says .
" there are others who feel stress and who feel aggression .
" but our religion says if there are people that want to laugh , you pass by them and make your ears like a tunnel .
it passes from one side and comes out the other . " dpa news agency -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

but even republicans are now going democrat for a far more compelling reason : fear that sarah palin could become president . jim sides , 55 , a californian living in bonn , is a swing voter who cast his ballot for president george w. bush in 2004 .
this time the one single factor driving him to the democratic ticket is the possibility that the republican vice-presidential nominee sarah palin is a heartbeat away from the american presidency .
if john mccain is elected next tuesday , the 72- year-old republican senator from arizona , who has battled skin cancer , would become the oldest us president in history .
“ let ’ s say mccain doesn ’ t make it health-wise - then we ’ d wind up with caribou barbie in the white house , ” sides said , referring to the alaskan governor ’ s bouffant hairdo and the political lightweight impression palin has made on millions of television viewers .
sides , a ceo of meyer sound germany , a division of the us manufacturer of professional loudspeakers , said he had been even leaning towards mccain before palin entered the republican ticket .
feeling betrayed by mccain ’ s choice bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : sarah palin lookalike being parodied on " saturday night live " “ i had a very high regard for john mccain based on my knowledge of his record as senator .
he was an honorable man , a war hero , but after he picked palin , i felt he had betrayed his country , ” he said .
“ i was in a state of pure shock .
leaving someone completely unqualified intellectually in a position to step into the presidency was so irresponsible , ” sides continued .
sides ’ wife lisa , who had also liked mccain , felt that the vietnam veteran ’ s extensive military experience could be valuable in finding a realistic exit strategy out of the morass in iraq .
“ but picking her -lrb- palin -rrb- pushed me over the edge towards barack obama .
mccain made that choice based on trying to win the election rather than having the best interests of our country in mind , ” she said . picking palin alienated expat voters the choice of palin was meant to balance and galvanize the republican ticket with a social conservative who could draw on the extreme , evangelical elements of the party as well as female hillary voters . but the move wound up alienating many of the us expatriates dw-world.de spoke to in the old american settlement of bonn ’ s scenic plittersdorf district on the rhine river , where life revolves around the international school and english-language church . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : us expats meet at stimson memorial chapel in bonn all those interviewed said it was a key , if not the key reason , to vote for barack obama , whether they liked the illinois senator or not .
the expatriates in the former german capital come from all over the map in the united states and reflect diverse political views .
they tend to be better off than their compatriots back home , since many are managers at blue chip us multinational companies .
that puts tax policy , trade and america 's image abroad high on the list of issues that matter to them . jeff nagel , 44 , a top executive at one such multinational , said that the way mccain made his vice-presidential choice reflected the personality differences between the two presidential candidates .
that sealed his decision to vote for obama instead , he said .
choice of vp reflects personality of candidates “ as a businessman , i look at an individual ’ s leadership skills regardless of their experience and position on the issues .
i agree with obama only about half the time , ” said nagel , who had previously voted for president george w. bush and describes himself as a free trader and fiscal conservative , but a moderate on social policy .
“ but look at how he has managed his campaign , taking on the democratic establishment clintons .
look at how he articulates his positions , and his ability to keep a level response through the ups and downs of his campaign , ” he said adding that obama has already shown that he is a thoughtful and effective leader through his choice of six-term delaware senator joe biden , 65 , as his running mate .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : obama 's choice of joe biden -lrb- left -rrb- has been widely praised “ biden is someone who can deliver the experience that obama lacks , but not the electoral votes that he needs to win the presidency .
obama ’ s choice was not based on the short term decision to get into office , but to put together a good team for the long haul in office , ” continued nagel , who declined to name his company since he was expressing his personal views .
many expats like nagel see mccain ’ s public outbursts and unpredictability that his republican handlers call “ maverick ” , in a negative light .
they say that mccain ’ s ‘ shoot first , ask later ’ fighter pilot mentality that might work on the battlefield , is unsuited for the us presidency , which requires a cool head .
concerns about mccain ’ s judgement others have expressed serious concerns about mccain ’ s judgement .
matthew howard , a global engineering manager based in cologne for ford motor company , who has republican leanings and is not convinced of obama , has vacillated so much with his absentee ballot that it is now too late to cast his vote .
“ if mccain had picked -lrb- former massachusetts governor -rrb- mitt romney or any other qualified candidate , i would vote for him in a flash .
picking a running mate was the most important decision of his candidacy and he blew it with palin .
how could he be so dramatically out of touch to pick this woman ? " asked howard , who added that the role of vp today is no longer just a president-in-waiting , but an important team player in the cabinet .
“ if i were back in michigan , i wouldn ’ t be able to sit home on election day .
it ’ d be painful , but i ’ d vote obama , ” said howard , explaining that he generally dislikes democrat fiscal and economic policies . resigned into voting for barack obama bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : expat absentee ballots can make a difference in swing states vera-lynn lewallen , 53 , who was born on a military base in germany and grew up in north carolina , sent in her absentee ballot , but initially thought of abstaining , since she is bitter at the democratic party for casting aside senator hillary clinton in favor of obama .
“ i ’ d rather not vote if i ’ m not happy with the democratic candidate , but now i feel blackmailed by the republicans into voting , because they picked this palin woman , ” she said .
then there is mickie nagel , who unlike her husband , an independent , has been a lifelong republican and even worked on the campaign to re-elect the incumbent president ’ s father , george bush sr. she was opposed to palin enough to cross the line for the first time in this election .
“ i never thought i would vote for a democrat , ” she said .
one ford engineer and mother of two , who asked not to be identified , did vote for mccain out of loyalty to the republican party , but also voiced serious doubts about palin .
she is taking strange comfort in the fact that her absentee vote won ’ t count in her home state . “ michigan is a clear blue state .
obama will win there anyway , ” she said with a sigh of relief . diana fong send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

before the three-story family home was converted into a mosque in 1991 , warsaw 's muslims gathered for prayers inside the egyptian embassy or rented out a dance hall before its nightly discotheque .

tiny minority expected to grow bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : poland 's islamic minority has deep roots in the country although most estimate poland has some 30,000 muslims - less than 0.1 per cent of the population - their small community is expected to grow .

charif came from damascus to study at university in 1982 , when poland was communist but seen as a cheap country for syrian , iraqi and libyan immigrants .
most of them returned to their homelands after graduation , but charif stayed after he married a polish woman .
those who arrived in the 1970s and 1980s now make up a small percentage of warsaw 's muslims , with many today coming from turkey , syria , pakistan and chechnya .
in the mix are a handful of poles who converted after marrying muslims , and a few who became muslims on their own .
outside warsaw , poland boasts two historic mosques from the 17th and 18th century-built in the villages of bohoniki and kruszyniany , settlements of poland 's first muslims in the 14th century .
the tartars made their home in the poland-lithuania commonwealth and practiced islam freely in exchange for military service .
their communities once numbered some 17,000 people , but today only several families remain as most tatar descendants moved to cities for work .
tatars enjoy more tolerance than those in cities some 2,000 muslim tatars live in poland , said bronislaw talkowski , head of a muslim community organization in kruszyniany .
although the village is largely catholic and conservative , talkowski says there 's more tolerance there than in more cosmopolitan cities .

but muslims remain a tiny minority in a country that 's 96 per cent catholic , and among a people that has rarely lived alongside immigrants .
warsaw does n't have the large immigrant groups of cities like london or paris , and poland during communist times saw more people wanting to leave than hoping for entry .

" hundreds of photographs have to be taken and calculated down to the model size . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a model of the vw eos contains just 20 parts in order to simplify the production process , schuco is now using a mobile laser scanner that compiles a 3d image of the vehicle . painstaking process once all the data is ready , it is scaled down to model size with the respective parts .
a model car of the vw eos in a 1/87 scale , for example , consists of 20 parts .
but the fire engine schlingmann hlf 20/16 , which revell offers as a model kit with a 1/24 scale , has exactly 257 parts . it takes revell about a year to measure and to develop the model kit .
but at least the manufacturer does not need to worry about assembly , which is most of the fun . another model car maker , wiking & co . , has a much more complicated production process . fluid plastic heated to a temperature of more than 200 degrees celsius is pressed between two metal parts cut down exactly to one hundredth of a millimeter , according to wiking manager , andreas kroeber .
the parts coming out of the machine are painted individually while the alloys and front grill are covered with metal foil .
race car models bear the same sponsor stickers as the real thing . in a painstaking procedure workers use a magnifying glass and tweezers to assemble the miniature models .
koerber explains that eight millimeter wheels are stuck to an axle as thick as a paper clip . tiny seats are clipped into the interior along the miniscule headlights , windshields , blinker lights and blue warning lights made from transparent plastic .
at last , much like on a real production line in a car factory , the chassis and body are symbolically " married . " dpa news agency -lrb- cat -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

tatars enjoy more tolerance than those in cities some 2,000 muslim tatars live in poland , said bronislaw talkowski , head of a muslim community organization in kruszyniany .
although the village is largely catholic and conservative , talkowski says there 's more tolerance there than in more cosmopolitan cities .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the wooden mosque in bohoniki " tatars settled kruszyniany at the end of the 17th century ... the locals know the tatars from that time , " talkowski said .
" and there 's no animosity between catholics and muslims like you read about in certain places .
that does n't happen here . "
but muslims remain a tiny minority in a country that 's 96 per cent catholic , and among a people that has rarely lived alongside immigrants .
warsaw does n't have the large immigrant groups of cities like london or paris , and poland during communist times saw more people wanting to leave than hoping for entry .
today the country is slowly becoming a likelier destination for immigrants , especially after it joined the european union in 2004 .
but for many poles outside larger cities , foreigners are still a strange sight .
charif says most varsovians are tolerant , and reports only a few isolated incidents that peaked after the september 11 , 2001 terrorist attacks on the united states , but soon tapered off .
harrassment comes from a small percentage of poles women who wear the hijab , or veil , can face more harassment because they look openly muslim , but charif says they report rare incidents that mostly come from elderly or drunk poles .
" they 're rare but they happen , " charif says .
" there are others who feel stress and who feel aggression .
" but our religion says if there are people that want to laugh , you pass by them and make your ears like a tunnel .
it passes from one side and comes out the other . " dpa news agency -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

hertha pulled one back with a header from brazilian cicero in the 68th but pizarro headed a fifth five minutes from time . the victory was the first in the league for thomas schaaf 's team after six games in the league and champions league . late victory for schalke schalke 's engelaar was sent off at cottbus for an insulting gesture - tapping his forehead with his index finger to a linesman , leaving schalke to play most of the second half with 10 men . however goals from heikko westermann 10 minutes from time and jefferson farfan in the last minute - at the second attempt after his penalty was saved - gave the blues a late victory . milivoje novakovic scored twice and portugal midfielder petit struck in stoppage time as cologne came away from vfb stuttgart with a 3-1 win . the slovenia striker struck in the 3rd and 61st minutes .

" diego helps werder to huge win bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bremen 's diego , center , as he slots the ball in hamburg slipped two places to fifth after crashing to a 3-0 defeat at lowly hanover who struck in the fifth and 18th minutes through bastian shultz and jan schlaudraff before jiri stajner added a third 11 minutes from time . werder bremen swept to a 5-1 victory over hertha berlin to end a six-game unbeaten series by the visitors . goalkeeper christopher gaeng on his debut was at fault for the first goal in the 14th minute when he missed a diego corner and the ball came off defender gojko kacer to deflect into his own net . diego struck a brilliant second six minutes later when he chested the ball down just inside the area and twisted to volley the ball over the keeper . the game was effectively over when sweden striker markus rosenberg poked the ball between the legs of the unfortunate gaeng from close range three minutes before the break for werder 's third . diego then set up the fourth with a pass to claudio pizarro who slid the ball home in the 59th .
hertha pulled one back with a header from brazilian cicero in the 68th but pizarro headed a fifth five minutes from time . the victory was the first in the league for thomas schaaf 's team after six games in the league and champions league . late victory for schalke schalke 's engelaar was sent off at cottbus for an insulting gesture - tapping his forehead with his index finger to a linesman , leaving schalke to play most of the second half with 10 men . however goals from heikko westermann 10 minutes from time and jefferson farfan in the last minute - at the second attempt after his penalty was saved - gave the blues a late victory . milivoje novakovic scored twice and portugal midfielder petit struck in stoppage time as cologne came away from vfb stuttgart with a 3-1 win . the slovenia striker struck in the 3rd and 61st minutes .
roberto hilbert pulled one back in the 69th but then made a mistake to allow petit to score in the fourth minute of stoppage time . dpa news agency -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

hoffenheim reclaimed the top spot with a win saturday . goals in each half from martin fenin and michael fink gave frankfurt victory after moenchengladbach had taken the lead courtesy of a marco russ own goal . the win lifts frankfurt -lrb- 12 points -rrb- further from the relegation zone , while moenchengladbach stay second to bottom on seven points , one ahead of energie cottbus . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : frankfurt 's three points may prove crucial to avoiding relegation " we have a lot of mental problems - psychological , " moenchengladbach coach hans meyer said after a second defeat after three games in charge .
" the situation is bad , very bad . " in the other bundesliga match on sunday , nov .
2 , borussia dortmund were held to a 1-1 draw by bochum - their sixth of the season - in a disappointing ruhr derby . dortmund stay sixth on 18 points - seven points behind leaders hoffenheim . it was a sixth game without a defeat for dortmund who have only been beaten once this season , but have now drawn six . " the way we played we did n't deserve more than a point , " coach juergen klopp said .
" we have been unbeaten in so many games , but it 's time we won a home game . " hoffenheim back on top bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hoffenheim has scored more goals than any other bundesliga team hoffenheim thrashed karlsruhe 4-1 on saturday to reclaim the top spot .
the win puts rolf rangnick 's side onto to 25 points from 11 games , one more than bayer leverkusen , who had gone top overnight after defeating wolfsburg 2-0 on friday . high-scoring hoffenheim 's winning run continued at their interim home in mannheim , with league top scorer ibisevic taking his tally to 13 and the team moving up to 31 goals . after a 15th-minute opener from ibisevic , karlsruhe bounced back through sebastian freis and the visitors managed to frustrate the home side until obasi struck in the 67th . any hopes of another comeback were then quashed when ibisevic headed his second in the 75th and obasi scored again three minutes later . klose , ribery , podolski score for bayern bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : podolski , klose and ribery who all scored for bayern bayern earned a hard-fought 3-1 victory over lowly bielefeld thanks to goals from miroslav klose , franck ribery and substitute lukas podolski from the penalty spot to go third on 21 points . bayern munich made it a fourth straight league win , but left it relatively late to overcome bielefeld in a one-sided match . coach juergen klinsmann found no place in the starting line-up for podolski despite the injury absence of italy striker luca toni , preferring to start with a five-man midfield and klose as a lone striker . klinsmann insisted it was a tactical decision rather than a lack of confidence in podolski , saying he wanted to test the formation ahead of wednesday 's champions league encounter with fiorentina . it appeared to pay off when klose thumped in a 25th-minute opener against an injury-hit arminia side who had not won in munich for 29 years . klinsmann switched tactics after the break and an armenia goal from the penalty spot , bringing on podolski for bastian schweinsteiger and the move worked when the germany striker set up ribery to score in the 77th minute . podolski then notched the third himself from the penalty spot six minutes from time after a foul on ribery and two minutes after tesche was dismissed for a tackle from behind on the french international . klinsmann had said in a newspaper interview podolski had not done enough to get into the team ahead of klose or toni , but there was praise for the striker after the match . " he brought a lot of movement into the game and went into where it hurt , getting into the penalty area and seeking to finish things off , " he said . however podolski 's future at the club now appears to be in doubt . " you can understand that i will be considering things in the winter break , " the striker said .
" but we have some important games coming up and i do n't want to get involved in speculation . " diego helps werder to huge win bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bremen 's diego , center , as he slots the ball in hamburg slipped two places to fifth after crashing to a 3-0 defeat at lowly hanover who struck in the fifth and 18th minutes through bastian shultz and jan schlaudraff before jiri stajner added a third 11 minutes from time . werder bremen swept to a 5-1 victory over hertha berlin to end a six-game unbeaten series by the visitors . goalkeeper christopher gaeng on his debut was at fault for the first goal in the 14th minute when he missed a diego corner and the ball came off defender gojko kacer to deflect into his own net . diego struck a brilliant second six minutes later when he chested the ball down just inside the area and twisted to volley the ball over the keeper . the game was effectively over when sweden striker markus rosenberg poked the ball between the legs of the unfortunate gaeng from close range three minutes before the break for werder 's third . diego then set up the fourth with a pass to claudio pizarro who slid the ball home in the 59th .
hertha pulled one back with a header from brazilian cicero in the 68th but pizarro headed a fifth five minutes from time . the victory was the first in the league for thomas schaaf 's team after six games in the league and champions league . late victory for schalke schalke 's engelaar was sent off at cottbus for an insulting gesture - tapping his forehead with his index finger to a linesman , leaving schalke to play most of the second half with 10 men . however goals from heikko westermann 10 minutes from time and jefferson farfan in the last minute - at the second attempt after his penalty was saved - gave the blues a late victory . milivoje novakovic scored twice and portugal midfielder petit struck in stoppage time as cologne came away from vfb stuttgart with a 3-1 win . the slovenia striker struck in the 3rd and 61st minutes .
roberto hilbert pulled one back in the 69th but then made a mistake to allow petit to score in the fourth minute of stoppage time . dpa news agency -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

hoffenheim reclaimed the top spot with a win saturday . goals in each half from martin fenin and michael fink gave frankfurt victory after moenchengladbach had taken the lead courtesy of a marco russ own goal . the win lifts frankfurt -lrb- 12 points -rrb- further from the relegation zone , while moenchengladbach stay second to bottom on seven points , one ahead of energie cottbus . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : frankfurt 's three points may prove crucial to avoiding relegation " we have a lot of mental problems - psychological , " moenchengladbach coach hans meyer said after a second defeat after three games in charge .
" the situation is bad , very bad . " in the other bundesliga match on sunday , nov .
2 , borussia dortmund were held to a 1-1 draw by bochum - their sixth of the season - in a disappointing ruhr derby . dortmund stay sixth on 18 points - seven points behind leaders hoffenheim . it was a sixth game without a defeat for dortmund who have only been beaten once this season , but have now drawn six . " the way we played we did n't deserve more than a point , " coach juergen klopp said .
" we have been unbeaten in so many games , but it 's time we won a home game . " hoffenheim back on top bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hoffenheim has scored more goals than any other bundesliga team hoffenheim thrashed karlsruhe 4-1 on saturday to reclaim the top spot .
the win puts rolf rangnick 's side onto to 25 points from 11 games , one more than bayer leverkusen , who had gone top overnight after defeating wolfsburg 2-0 on friday . high-scoring hoffenheim 's winning run continued at their interim home in mannheim , with league top scorer ibisevic taking his tally to 13 and the team moving up to 31 goals . after a 15th-minute opener from ibisevic , karlsruhe bounced back through sebastian freis and the visitors managed to frustrate the home side until obasi struck in the 67th . any hopes of another comeback were then quashed when ibisevic headed his second in the 75th and obasi scored again three minutes later . klose , ribery , podolski score for bayern bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : podolski , klose and ribery who all scored for bayern bayern earned a hard-fought 3-1 victory over lowly bielefeld thanks to goals from miroslav klose , franck ribery and substitute lukas podolski from the penalty spot to go third on 21 points . bayern munich made it a fourth straight league win , but left it relatively late to overcome bielefeld in a one-sided match . coach juergen klinsmann found no place in the starting line-up for podolski despite the injury absence of italy striker luca toni , preferring to start with a five-man midfield and klose as a lone striker . klinsmann insisted it was a tactical decision rather than a lack of confidence in podolski , saying he wanted to test the formation ahead of wednesday 's champions league encounter with fiorentina . it appeared to pay off when klose thumped in a 25th-minute opener against an injury-hit arminia side who had not won in munich for 29 years . klinsmann switched tactics after the break and an armenia goal from the penalty spot , bringing on podolski for bastian schweinsteiger and the move worked when the germany striker set up ribery to score in the 77th minute . podolski then notched the third himself from the penalty spot six minutes from time after a foul on ribery and two minutes after tesche was dismissed for a tackle from behind on the french international . klinsmann had said in a newspaper interview podolski had not done enough to get into the team ahead of klose or toni , but there was praise for the striker after the match . " he brought a lot of movement into the game and went into where it hurt , getting into the penalty area and seeking to finish things off , " he said . however podolski 's future at the club now appears to be in doubt . " you can understand that i will be considering things in the winter break , " the striker said .
" but we have some important games coming up and i do n't want to get involved in speculation . " diego helps werder to huge win bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bremen 's diego , center , as he slots the ball in hamburg slipped two places to fifth after crashing to a 3-0 defeat at lowly hanover who struck in the fifth and 18th minutes through bastian shultz and jan schlaudraff before jiri stajner added a third 11 minutes from time . werder bremen swept to a 5-1 victory over hertha berlin to end a six-game unbeaten series by the visitors . goalkeeper christopher gaeng on his debut was at fault for the first goal in the 14th minute when he missed a diego corner and the ball came off defender gojko kacer to deflect into his own net . diego struck a brilliant second six minutes later when he chested the ball down just inside the area and twisted to volley the ball over the keeper . the game was effectively over when sweden striker markus rosenberg poked the ball between the legs of the unfortunate gaeng from close range three minutes before the break for werder 's third . diego then set up the fourth with a pass to claudio pizarro who slid the ball home in the 59th .
hertha pulled one back with a header from brazilian cicero in the 68th but pizarro headed a fifth five minutes from time . the victory was the first in the league for thomas schaaf 's team after six games in the league and champions league . late victory for schalke schalke 's engelaar was sent off at cottbus for an insulting gesture - tapping his forehead with his index finger to a linesman , leaving schalke to play most of the second half with 10 men . however goals from heikko westermann 10 minutes from time and jefferson farfan in the last minute - at the second attempt after his penalty was saved - gave the blues a late victory . milivoje novakovic scored twice and portugal midfielder petit struck in stoppage time as cologne came away from vfb stuttgart with a 3-1 win . the slovenia striker struck in the 3rd and 61st minutes .
roberto hilbert pulled one back in the 69th but then made a mistake to allow petit to score in the fourth minute of stoppage time . dpa news agency -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the two countries agreed in nairobi last november that congo 's army would forcibly disarm hutu militias . meanwhile regional presidents could meet in nairobi in the coming week to discuss the crisis , tanzania 's foreign minister said at a joint news conference with the two european ministers . eu envoys call for new political effort an offensive by rebels loyal to general laurent nkunda reached the outskirts of the eastern congo border city of goma last week before nkunda called a ceasefire . hundreds of thousands of people have fled their homes , prompting aid agencies to warn that a catastrophic situation was unfolding . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : kouchner , left , and miliband during a tour of the kibati refugee camp near goma miliband said late saturday it was up to the un to ensure aid reached the tens of thousands of refugees forced to flee the fighting . the bbc later reported un food and medical aid was planned for the estimated 250,000 displaced by the recent fighting . " the ceasefire last wednesday needs to be bolstered .
the crisis , even if averted in the short term , will return without a new , vigorous and united political effort , " miliband and kouchner said in a joint statement . earlier saturday , reports said that the congolese and rwandan presidents had agreed to attend a regional summit aimed at resolving the conflict . miliband says no plans to send british troops the european union 's aid commissioner louis michel , who held talks with both leaders , told the bbc that kabila and kagame had agreed to meet at a summit involving the african union and other african leaders . michel flew into the dr congo on thursday in an attempt to defuse the conflict between tutsi rebels and government forces , which blew up into four days of full-scale fighting earlier this week . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : un troops are overstretched in congo the world 's largest un peacekeeping force is deployed in congo .
but they 've been stretched to the limit by the fighting and the un 's top envoy in dr congo , alan doss , has called for more troops to add to the 17,000 contingent already in the sprawling central african nation . " we are not at the moment looking at sending british troops to join the un force , " miliband was quoted as telling reporters during a visit to a refugee camp in eastern congo . " desperate situation " united nations secretary general ban ki-moon friday urged nkunda to stick to the ceasefire and said the situation was " very threatening . " the ceasefire continued to hold saturday , but fears were growing for the fate of the tens of thousands who fled the rebel advance . the un refugee agency unhcr said the situation was " desperate . "
according to unchr , rebel forces forcibly emptied refugee camps and burned them to the ground during their advance on goma . dw staff -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

but even republicans are now going democrat for a far more compelling reason : fear that sarah palin could become president . jim sides , 55 , a californian living in bonn , is a swing voter who cast his ballot for president george w. bush in 2004 .
this time the one single factor driving him to the democratic ticket is the possibility that the republican vice-presidential nominee sarah palin is a heartbeat away from the american presidency .
if john mccain is elected next tuesday , the 72- year-old republican senator from arizona , who has battled skin cancer , would become the oldest us president in history .
“ let ’ s say mccain doesn ’ t make it health-wise - then we ’ d wind up with caribou barbie in the white house , ” sides said , referring to the alaskan governor ’ s bouffant hairdo and the political lightweight impression palin has made on millions of television viewers .
sides , a ceo of meyer sound germany , a division of the us manufacturer of professional loudspeakers , said he had been even leaning towards mccain before palin entered the republican ticket .
feeling betrayed by mccain ’ s choice bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : sarah palin lookalike being parodied on " saturday night live " “ i had a very high regard for john mccain based on my knowledge of his record as senator .
he was an honorable man , a war hero , but after he picked palin , i felt he had betrayed his country , ” he said .
“ i was in a state of pure shock .
leaving someone completely unqualified intellectually in a position to step into the presidency was so irresponsible , ” sides continued .
sides ’ wife lisa , who had also liked mccain , felt that the vietnam veteran ’ s extensive military experience could be valuable in finding a realistic exit strategy out of the morass in iraq .
“ but picking her -lrb- palin -rrb- pushed me over the edge towards barack obama .
mccain made that choice based on trying to win the election rather than having the best interests of our country in mind , ” she said . picking palin alienated expat voters the choice of palin was meant to balance and galvanize the republican ticket with a social conservative who could draw on the extreme , evangelical elements of the party as well as female hillary voters . but the move wound up alienating many of the us expatriates dw-world.de spoke to in the old american settlement of bonn ’ s scenic plittersdorf district on the rhine river , where life revolves around the international school and english-language church . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : us expats meet at stimson memorial chapel in bonn all those interviewed said it was a key , if not the key reason , to vote for barack obama , whether they liked the illinois senator or not .
the expatriates in the former german capital come from all over the map in the united states and reflect diverse political views .
they tend to be better off than their compatriots back home , since many are managers at blue chip us multinational companies .
that puts tax policy , trade and america 's image abroad high on the list of issues that matter to them . jeff nagel , 44 , a top executive at one such multinational , said that the way mccain made his vice-presidential choice reflected the personality differences between the two presidential candidates .
that sealed his decision to vote for obama instead , he said .
choice of vp reflects personality of candidates “ as a businessman , i look at an individual ’ s leadership skills regardless of their experience and position on the issues .
i agree with obama only about half the time , ” said nagel , who had previously voted for president george w. bush and describes himself as a free trader and fiscal conservative , but a moderate on social policy .
“ but look at how he has managed his campaign , taking on the democratic establishment clintons .
look at how he articulates his positions , and his ability to keep a level response through the ups and downs of his campaign , ” he said adding that obama has already shown that he is a thoughtful and effective leader through his choice of six-term delaware senator joe biden , 65 , as his running mate .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : obama 's choice of joe biden -lrb- left -rrb- has been widely praised “ biden is someone who can deliver the experience that obama lacks , but not the electoral votes that he needs to win the presidency .
obama ’ s choice was not based on the short term decision to get into office , but to put together a good team for the long haul in office , ” continued nagel , who declined to name his company since he was expressing his personal views .
many expats like nagel see mccain ’ s public outbursts and unpredictability that his republican handlers call “ maverick ” , in a negative light .
they say that mccain ’ s ‘ shoot first , ask later ’ fighter pilot mentality that might work on the battlefield , is unsuited for the us presidency , which requires a cool head .
concerns about mccain ’ s judgement others have expressed serious concerns about mccain ’ s judgement .
matthew howard , a global engineering manager based in cologne for ford motor company , who has republican leanings and is not convinced of obama , has vacillated so much with his absentee ballot that it is now too late to cast his vote .
“ if mccain had picked -lrb- former massachusetts governor -rrb- mitt romney or any other qualified candidate , i would vote for him in a flash .
picking a running mate was the most important decision of his candidacy and he blew it with palin .
how could he be so dramatically out of touch to pick this woman ? " asked howard , who added that the role of vp today is no longer just a president-in-waiting , but an important team player in the cabinet .
“ if i were back in michigan , i wouldn ’ t be able to sit home on election day .
it ’ d be painful , but i ’ d vote obama , ” said howard , explaining that he generally dislikes democrat fiscal and economic policies . resigned into voting for barack obama bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : expat absentee ballots can make a difference in swing states vera-lynn lewallen , 53 , who was born on a military base in germany and grew up in north carolina , sent in her absentee ballot , but initially thought of abstaining , since she is bitter at the democratic party for casting aside senator hillary clinton in favor of obama .
“ i ’ d rather not vote if i ’ m not happy with the democratic candidate , but now i feel blackmailed by the republicans into voting , because they picked this palin woman , ” she said .
then there is mickie nagel , who unlike her husband , an independent , has been a lifelong republican and even worked on the campaign to re-elect the incumbent president ’ s father , george bush sr. she was opposed to palin enough to cross the line for the first time in this election .
“ i never thought i would vote for a democrat , ” she said .
one ford engineer and mother of two , who asked not to be identified , did vote for mccain out of loyalty to the republican party , but also voiced serious doubts about palin .

but even republicans are now going democrat for a far more compelling reason : fear that sarah palin could become president . jim sides , 55 , a californian living in bonn , is a swing voter who cast his ballot for president george w. bush in 2004 .
this time the one single factor driving him to the democratic ticket is the possibility that the republican vice-presidential nominee sarah palin is a heartbeat away from the american presidency .
if john mccain is elected next tuesday , the 72- year-old republican senator from arizona , who has battled skin cancer , would become the oldest us president in history .
“ let ’ s say mccain doesn ’ t make it health-wise - then we ’ d wind up with caribou barbie in the white house , ” sides said , referring to the alaskan governor ’ s bouffant hairdo and the political lightweight impression palin has made on millions of television viewers .
sides , a ceo of meyer sound germany , a division of the us manufacturer of professional loudspeakers , said he had been even leaning towards mccain before palin entered the republican ticket .
feeling betrayed by mccain ’ s choice bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : sarah palin lookalike being parodied on " saturday night live " “ i had a very high regard for john mccain based on my knowledge of his record as senator .
he was an honorable man , a war hero , but after he picked palin , i felt he had betrayed his country , ” he said .
“ i was in a state of pure shock .
leaving someone completely unqualified intellectually in a position to step into the presidency was so irresponsible , ” sides continued .
sides ’ wife lisa , who had also liked mccain , felt that the vietnam veteran ’ s extensive military experience could be valuable in finding a realistic exit strategy out of the morass in iraq .
“ but picking her -lrb- palin -rrb- pushed me over the edge towards barack obama .
mccain made that choice based on trying to win the election rather than having the best interests of our country in mind , ” she said . picking palin alienated expat voters the choice of palin was meant to balance and galvanize the republican ticket with a social conservative who could draw on the extreme , evangelical elements of the party as well as female hillary voters . but the move wound up alienating many of the us expatriates dw-world.de spoke to in the old american settlement of bonn ’ s scenic plittersdorf district on the rhine river , where life revolves around the international school and english-language church . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : us expats meet at stimson memorial chapel in bonn all those interviewed said it was a key , if not the key reason , to vote for barack obama , whether they liked the illinois senator or not .
the expatriates in the former german capital come from all over the map in the united states and reflect diverse political views .
they tend to be better off than their compatriots back home , since many are managers at blue chip us multinational companies .
that puts tax policy , trade and america 's image abroad high on the list of issues that matter to them . jeff nagel , 44 , a top executive at one such multinational , said that the way mccain made his vice-presidential choice reflected the personality differences between the two presidential candidates .
that sealed his decision to vote for obama instead , he said .
choice of vp reflects personality of candidates “ as a businessman , i look at an individual ’ s leadership skills regardless of their experience and position on the issues .
i agree with obama only about half the time , ” said nagel , who had previously voted for president george w. bush and describes himself as a free trader and fiscal conservative , but a moderate on social policy .
“ but look at how he has managed his campaign , taking on the democratic establishment clintons .
look at how he articulates his positions , and his ability to keep a level response through the ups and downs of his campaign , ” he said adding that obama has already shown that he is a thoughtful and effective leader through his choice of six-term delaware senator joe biden , 65 , as his running mate .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : obama 's choice of joe biden -lrb- left -rrb- has been widely praised “ biden is someone who can deliver the experience that obama lacks , but not the electoral votes that he needs to win the presidency .
obama ’ s choice was not based on the short term decision to get into office , but to put together a good team for the long haul in office , ” continued nagel , who declined to name his company since he was expressing his personal views .
many expats like nagel see mccain ’ s public outbursts and unpredictability that his republican handlers call “ maverick ” , in a negative light .
they say that mccain ’ s ‘ shoot first , ask later ’ fighter pilot mentality that might work on the battlefield , is unsuited for the us presidency , which requires a cool head .
concerns about mccain ’ s judgement others have expressed serious concerns about mccain ’ s judgement .
matthew howard , a global engineering manager based in cologne for ford motor company , who has republican leanings and is not convinced of obama , has vacillated so much with his absentee ballot that it is now too late to cast his vote .
“ if mccain had picked -lrb- former massachusetts governor -rrb- mitt romney or any other qualified candidate , i would vote for him in a flash .
picking a running mate was the most important decision of his candidacy and he blew it with palin .
how could he be so dramatically out of touch to pick this woman ? " asked howard , who added that the role of vp today is no longer just a president-in-waiting , but an important team player in the cabinet .
“ if i were back in michigan , i wouldn ’ t be able to sit home on election day .
it ’ d be painful , but i ’ d vote obama , ” said howard , explaining that he generally dislikes democrat fiscal and economic policies . resigned into voting for barack obama bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : expat absentee ballots can make a difference in swing states vera-lynn lewallen , 53 , who was born on a military base in germany and grew up in north carolina , sent in her absentee ballot , but initially thought of abstaining , since she is bitter at the democratic party for casting aside senator hillary clinton in favor of obama .
“ i ’ d rather not vote if i ’ m not happy with the democratic candidate , but now i feel blackmailed by the republicans into voting , because they picked this palin woman , ” she said .
then there is mickie nagel , who unlike her husband , an independent , has been a lifelong republican and even worked on the campaign to re-elect the incumbent president ’ s father , george bush sr. she was opposed to palin enough to cross the line for the first time in this election .
“ i never thought i would vote for a democrat , ” she said .
one ford engineer and mother of two , who asked not to be identified , did vote for mccain out of loyalty to the republican party , but also voiced serious doubts about palin .
she is taking strange comfort in the fact that her absentee vote won ’ t count in her home state . “ michigan is a clear blue state .

collectors are anxiously awaiting new products . while car manufacturers like mercedes , bmw , porsche and opel are struggling to cope with an economic downturn , the manufacture of their models in miniature seems to be as popular as ever . in order to keep up with developments in design , model car manufacturers maintain close ties with car makers . " the model car makers in principle manufacture their products based on the same data that is used to assemble body panels and axles , " said daniel stiegler , a spokesman for the model car manufacturer herpa . built from manufacturers ' blueprints carmakers themselves have a keen interest in seeing a model car of their new vehicle on the shelf and normally hand over secret construction plans under strict conditions . the model car manufacturers also tend to be allowed to take a closer look at the prototypes early in the development process . building models of vintage and classic cars , however , is a bit more difficult . " research of the original documentation is difficult , " said udo plichta , a developer at schuco .
" hundreds of photographs have to be taken and calculated down to the model size . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a model of the vw eos contains just 20 parts in order to simplify the production process , schuco is now using a mobile laser scanner that compiles a 3d image of the vehicle . painstaking process once all the data is ready , it is scaled down to model size with the respective parts .

the win puts rolf rangnick 's side onto to 25 points from 11 games , one more than bayer leverkusen , who had gone top overnight after defeating wolfsburg 2-0 on friday . high-scoring hoffenheim 's winning run continued at their interim home in mannheim , with league top scorer ibisevic taking his tally to 13 and the team moving up to 31 goals . after a 15th-minute opener from ibisevic , karlsruhe bounced back through sebastian freis and the visitors managed to frustrate the home side until obasi struck in the 67th . any hopes of another comeback were then quashed when ibisevic headed his second in the 75th and obasi scored again three minutes later . klose , ribery , podolski score for bayern bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : podolski , klose and ribery who all scored for bayern bayern earned a hard-fought 3-1 victory over lowly bielefeld thanks to goals from miroslav klose , franck ribery and substitute lukas podolski from the penalty spot to go third on 21 points . bayern munich made it a fourth straight league win , but left it relatively late to overcome bielefeld in a one-sided match . coach juergen klinsmann found no place in the starting line-up for podolski despite the injury absence of italy striker luca toni , preferring to start with a five-man midfield and klose as a lone striker . klinsmann insisted it was a tactical decision rather than a lack of confidence in podolski , saying he wanted to test the formation ahead of wednesday 's champions league encounter with fiorentina . it appeared to pay off when klose thumped in a 25th-minute opener against an injury-hit arminia side who had not won in munich for 29 years . klinsmann switched tactics after the break and an armenia goal from the penalty spot , bringing on podolski for bastian schweinsteiger and the move worked when the germany striker set up ribery to score in the 77th minute . podolski then notched the third himself from the penalty spot six minutes from time after a foul on ribery and two minutes after tesche was dismissed for a tackle from behind on the french international . klinsmann had said in a newspaper interview podolski had not done enough to get into the team ahead of klose or toni , but there was praise for the striker after the match . " he brought a lot of movement into the game and went into where it hurt , getting into the penalty area and seeking to finish things off , " he said . however podolski 's future at the club now appears to be in doubt .

hertha pulled one back with a header from brazilian cicero in the 68th but pizarro headed a fifth five minutes from time . the victory was the first in the league for thomas schaaf 's team after six games in the league and champions league . late victory for schalke schalke 's engelaar was sent off at cottbus for an insulting gesture - tapping his forehead with his index finger to a linesman , leaving schalke to play most of the second half with 10 men . however goals from heikko westermann 10 minutes from time and jefferson farfan in the last minute - at the second attempt after his penalty was saved - gave the blues a late victory . milivoje novakovic scored twice and portugal midfielder petit struck in stoppage time as cologne came away from vfb stuttgart with a 3-1 win . the slovenia striker struck in the 3rd and 61st minutes .

hoffenheim reclaimed the top spot with a win saturday . goals in each half from martin fenin and michael fink gave frankfurt victory after moenchengladbach had taken the lead courtesy of a marco russ own goal . the win lifts frankfurt -lrb- 12 points -rrb- further from the relegation zone , while moenchengladbach stay second to bottom on seven points , one ahead of energie cottbus . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : frankfurt 's three points may prove crucial to avoiding relegation " we have a lot of mental problems - psychological , " moenchengladbach coach hans meyer said after a second defeat after three games in charge .
" the situation is bad , very bad . " in the other bundesliga match on sunday , nov .
2 , borussia dortmund were held to a 1-1 draw by bochum - their sixth of the season - in a disappointing ruhr derby . dortmund stay sixth on 18 points - seven points behind leaders hoffenheim . it was a sixth game without a defeat for dortmund who have only been beaten once this season , but have now drawn six . " the way we played we did n't deserve more than a point , " coach juergen klopp said .
" we have been unbeaten in so many games , but it 's time we won a home game . " hoffenheim back on top bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hoffenheim has scored more goals than any other bundesliga team hoffenheim thrashed karlsruhe 4-1 on saturday to reclaim the top spot .
the win puts rolf rangnick 's side onto to 25 points from 11 games , one more than bayer leverkusen , who had gone top overnight after defeating wolfsburg 2-0 on friday . high-scoring hoffenheim 's winning run continued at their interim home in mannheim , with league top scorer ibisevic taking his tally to 13 and the team moving up to 31 goals . after a 15th-minute opener from ibisevic , karlsruhe bounced back through sebastian freis and the visitors managed to frustrate the home side until obasi struck in the 67th . any hopes of another comeback were then quashed when ibisevic headed his second in the 75th and obasi scored again three minutes later . klose , ribery , podolski score for bayern bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : podolski , klose and ribery who all scored for bayern bayern earned a hard-fought 3-1 victory over lowly bielefeld thanks to goals from miroslav klose , franck ribery and substitute lukas podolski from the penalty spot to go third on 21 points . bayern munich made it a fourth straight league win , but left it relatively late to overcome bielefeld in a one-sided match . coach juergen klinsmann found no place in the starting line-up for podolski despite the injury absence of italy striker luca toni , preferring to start with a five-man midfield and klose as a lone striker . klinsmann insisted it was a tactical decision rather than a lack of confidence in podolski , saying he wanted to test the formation ahead of wednesday 's champions league encounter with fiorentina . it appeared to pay off when klose thumped in a 25th-minute opener against an injury-hit arminia side who had not won in munich for 29 years . klinsmann switched tactics after the break and an armenia goal from the penalty spot , bringing on podolski for bastian schweinsteiger and the move worked when the germany striker set up ribery to score in the 77th minute . podolski then notched the third himself from the penalty spot six minutes from time after a foul on ribery and two minutes after tesche was dismissed for a tackle from behind on the french international . klinsmann had said in a newspaper interview podolski had not done enough to get into the team ahead of klose or toni , but there was praise for the striker after the match . " he brought a lot of movement into the game and went into where it hurt , getting into the penalty area and seeking to finish things off , " he said . however podolski 's future at the club now appears to be in doubt . " you can understand that i will be considering things in the winter break , " the striker said .
" but we have some important games coming up and i do n't want to get involved in speculation . " diego helps werder to huge win bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bremen 's diego , center , as he slots the ball in hamburg slipped two places to fifth after crashing to a 3-0 defeat at lowly hanover who struck in the fifth and 18th minutes through bastian shultz and jan schlaudraff before jiri stajner added a third 11 minutes from time . werder bremen swept to a 5-1 victory over hertha berlin to end a six-game unbeaten series by the visitors . goalkeeper christopher gaeng on his debut was at fault for the first goal in the 14th minute when he missed a diego corner and the ball came off defender gojko kacer to deflect into his own net . diego struck a brilliant second six minutes later when he chested the ball down just inside the area and twisted to volley the ball over the keeper . the game was effectively over when sweden striker markus rosenberg poked the ball between the legs of the unfortunate gaeng from close range three minutes before the break for werder 's third . diego then set up the fourth with a pass to claudio pizarro who slid the ball home in the 59th .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de auto industry -pipe- 02.11.2008 model car market stays stable despite auto industry downturn großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : miniatures of many vehicles remain in demand though the actual car industry may be suffering a sharp decline in sales , the model car industry appears to be unaffected by the downturn .
collectors are anxiously awaiting new products . while car manufacturers like mercedes , bmw , porsche and opel are struggling to cope with an economic downturn , the manufacture of their models in miniature seems to be as popular as ever . in order to keep up with developments in design , model car manufacturers maintain close ties with car makers . " the model car makers in principle manufacture their products based on the same data that is used to assemble body panels and axles , " said daniel stiegler , a spokesman for the model car manufacturer herpa . built from manufacturers ' blueprints carmakers themselves have a keen interest in seeing a model car of their new vehicle on the shelf and normally hand over secret construction plans under strict conditions . the model car manufacturers also tend to be allowed to take a closer look at the prototypes early in the development process . building models of vintage and classic cars , however , is a bit more difficult . " research of the original documentation is difficult , " said udo plichta , a developer at schuco .
" hundreds of photographs have to be taken and calculated down to the model size . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a model of the vw eos contains just 20 parts in order to simplify the production process , schuco is now using a mobile laser scanner that compiles a 3d image of the vehicle . painstaking process once all the data is ready , it is scaled down to model size with the respective parts .
a model car of the vw eos in a 1/87 scale , for example , consists of 20 parts .
but the fire engine schlingmann hlf 20/16 , which revell offers as a model kit with a 1/24 scale , has exactly 257 parts . it takes revell about a year to measure and to develop the model kit .
but at least the manufacturer does not need to worry about assembly , which is most of the fun . another model car maker , wiking & co . , has a much more complicated production process . fluid plastic heated to a temperature of more than 200 degrees celsius is pressed between two metal parts cut down exactly to one hundredth of a millimeter , according to wiking manager , andreas kroeber .
the parts coming out of the machine are painted individually while the alloys and front grill are covered with metal foil .
race car models bear the same sponsor stickers as the real thing . in a painstaking procedure workers use a magnifying glass and tweezers to assemble the miniature models .
koerber explains that eight millimeter wheels are stuck to an axle as thick as a paper clip . tiny seats are clipped into the interior along the miniscule headlights , windshields , blinker lights and blue warning lights made from transparent plastic .
at last , much like on a real production line in a car factory , the chassis and body are symbolically " married . " dpa news agency -lrb- cat -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" under the current circumstances we will not participate , because we are strong , " said ackermann , whose bank last week reported a third quarter profit in spite of the current economic turmoil . the german bailout package , approved by parliament last month , involves 480 billion euros -lrb- $ 611 billion -rrb- in debt guarantees and funds for injections of capital and purchases of illiquid assets . on saturday , german chancellor angela merkel appealed to banks to take up the government 's offer as quickly as possible .

" we need a stable financial system , " he said in an interview with german public broadcaster zdf .

" compared with several of its peers , deutsche bank has escaped relatively unscathed from the global credit crunch and the financial market crisis . last week the bank said its net profit in the three months to the end of september came in at 414 million euros after taking advantage of new accounting rules that enabled it to reduce its writedowns . a german state bank bayernlb , which reportedly needs 6.4 billion euros in new funds , has asked for help , as has hypo real estate -lrb- hre -rrb- , which nearly collapsed in september . germany 's first big casualty of the current crisis , hre won 50 billion euros in guarantees from the government and german banks in early october .
last week it applied for a cash injection of 15 billion euros from the new federal fund .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de auto industry -pipe- 02.11.2008 model car market stays stable despite auto industry downturn großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : miniatures of many vehicles remain in demand though the actual car industry may be suffering a sharp decline in sales , the model car industry appears to be unaffected by the downturn .
collectors are anxiously awaiting new products . while car manufacturers like mercedes , bmw , porsche and opel are struggling to cope with an economic downturn , the manufacture of their models in miniature seems to be as popular as ever . in order to keep up with developments in design , model car manufacturers maintain close ties with car makers . " the model car makers in principle manufacture their products based on the same data that is used to assemble body panels and axles , " said daniel stiegler , a spokesman for the model car manufacturer herpa . built from manufacturers ' blueprints carmakers themselves have a keen interest in seeing a model car of their new vehicle on the shelf and normally hand over secret construction plans under strict conditions . the model car manufacturers also tend to be allowed to take a closer look at the prototypes early in the development process . building models of vintage and classic cars , however , is a bit more difficult . " research of the original documentation is difficult , " said udo plichta , a developer at schuco .
" hundreds of photographs have to be taken and calculated down to the model size . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a model of the vw eos contains just 20 parts in order to simplify the production process , schuco is now using a mobile laser scanner that compiles a 3d image of the vehicle . painstaking process once all the data is ready , it is scaled down to model size with the respective parts .
a model car of the vw eos in a 1/87 scale , for example , consists of 20 parts .
but the fire engine schlingmann hlf 20/16 , which revell offers as a model kit with a 1/24 scale , has exactly 257 parts . it takes revell about a year to measure and to develop the model kit .
but at least the manufacturer does not need to worry about assembly , which is most of the fun . another model car maker , wiking & co . , has a much more complicated production process . fluid plastic heated to a temperature of more than 200 degrees celsius is pressed between two metal parts cut down exactly to one hundredth of a millimeter , according to wiking manager , andreas kroeber .
the parts coming out of the machine are painted individually while the alloys and front grill are covered with metal foil .
race car models bear the same sponsor stickers as the real thing . in a painstaking procedure workers use a magnifying glass and tweezers to assemble the miniature models .
koerber explains that eight millimeter wheels are stuck to an axle as thick as a paper clip . tiny seats are clipped into the interior along the miniscule headlights , windshields , blinker lights and blue warning lights made from transparent plastic .
at last , much like on a real production line in a car factory , the chassis and body are symbolically " married . " dpa news agency -lrb- cat -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

but even republicans are now going democrat for a far more compelling reason : fear that sarah palin could become president . jim sides , 55 , a californian living in bonn , is a swing voter who cast his ballot for president george w. bush in 2004 .
this time the one single factor driving him to the democratic ticket is the possibility that the republican vice-presidential nominee sarah palin is a heartbeat away from the american presidency .
if john mccain is elected next tuesday , the 72- year-old republican senator from arizona , who has battled skin cancer , would become the oldest us president in history .
“ let ’ s say mccain doesn ’ t make it health-wise - then we ’ d wind up with caribou barbie in the white house , ” sides said , referring to the alaskan governor ’ s bouffant hairdo and the political lightweight impression palin has made on millions of television viewers .
sides , a ceo of meyer sound germany , a division of the us manufacturer of professional loudspeakers , said he had been even leaning towards mccain before palin entered the republican ticket .
feeling betrayed by mccain ’ s choice bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : sarah palin lookalike being parodied on " saturday night live " “ i had a very high regard for john mccain based on my knowledge of his record as senator .
he was an honorable man , a war hero , but after he picked palin , i felt he had betrayed his country , ” he said .
“ i was in a state of pure shock .
leaving someone completely unqualified intellectually in a position to step into the presidency was so irresponsible , ” sides continued .
sides ’ wife lisa , who had also liked mccain , felt that the vietnam veteran ’ s extensive military experience could be valuable in finding a realistic exit strategy out of the morass in iraq .
“ but picking her -lrb- palin -rrb- pushed me over the edge towards barack obama .
mccain made that choice based on trying to win the election rather than having the best interests of our country in mind , ” she said . picking palin alienated expat voters the choice of palin was meant to balance and galvanize the republican ticket with a social conservative who could draw on the extreme , evangelical elements of the party as well as female hillary voters . but the move wound up alienating many of the us expatriates dw-world.de spoke to in the old american settlement of bonn ’ s scenic plittersdorf district on the rhine river , where life revolves around the international school and english-language church . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : us expats meet at stimson memorial chapel in bonn all those interviewed said it was a key , if not the key reason , to vote for barack obama , whether they liked the illinois senator or not .
the expatriates in the former german capital come from all over the map in the united states and reflect diverse political views .
they tend to be better off than their compatriots back home , since many are managers at blue chip us multinational companies .
that puts tax policy , trade and america 's image abroad high on the list of issues that matter to them . jeff nagel , 44 , a top executive at one such multinational , said that the way mccain made his vice-presidential choice reflected the personality differences between the two presidential candidates .
that sealed his decision to vote for obama instead , he said .
choice of vp reflects personality of candidates “ as a businessman , i look at an individual ’ s leadership skills regardless of their experience and position on the issues .
i agree with obama only about half the time , ” said nagel , who had previously voted for president george w. bush and describes himself as a free trader and fiscal conservative , but a moderate on social policy .
“ but look at how he has managed his campaign , taking on the democratic establishment clintons .
look at how he articulates his positions , and his ability to keep a level response through the ups and downs of his campaign , ” he said adding that obama has already shown that he is a thoughtful and effective leader through his choice of six-term delaware senator joe biden , 65 , as his running mate .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : obama 's choice of joe biden -lrb- left -rrb- has been widely praised “ biden is someone who can deliver the experience that obama lacks , but not the electoral votes that he needs to win the presidency .
obama ’ s choice was not based on the short term decision to get into office , but to put together a good team for the long haul in office , ” continued nagel , who declined to name his company since he was expressing his personal views .
many expats like nagel see mccain ’ s public outbursts and unpredictability that his republican handlers call “ maverick ” , in a negative light .
they say that mccain ’ s ‘ shoot first , ask later ’ fighter pilot mentality that might work on the battlefield , is unsuited for the us presidency , which requires a cool head .
concerns about mccain ’ s judgement others have expressed serious concerns about mccain ’ s judgement .
matthew howard , a global engineering manager based in cologne for ford motor company , who has republican leanings and is not convinced of obama , has vacillated so much with his absentee ballot that it is now too late to cast his vote .
“ if mccain had picked -lrb- former massachusetts governor -rrb- mitt romney or any other qualified candidate , i would vote for him in a flash .
picking a running mate was the most important decision of his candidacy and he blew it with palin .
how could he be so dramatically out of touch to pick this woman ? " asked howard , who added that the role of vp today is no longer just a president-in-waiting , but an important team player in the cabinet .
“ if i were back in michigan , i wouldn ’ t be able to sit home on election day .
it ’ d be painful , but i ’ d vote obama , ” said howard , explaining that he generally dislikes democrat fiscal and economic policies . resigned into voting for barack obama bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : expat absentee ballots can make a difference in swing states vera-lynn lewallen , 53 , who was born on a military base in germany and grew up in north carolina , sent in her absentee ballot , but initially thought of abstaining , since she is bitter at the democratic party for casting aside senator hillary clinton in favor of obama .
“ i ’ d rather not vote if i ’ m not happy with the democratic candidate , but now i feel blackmailed by the republicans into voting , because they picked this palin woman , ” she said .
then there is mickie nagel , who unlike her husband , an independent , has been a lifelong republican and even worked on the campaign to re-elect the incumbent president ’ s father , george bush sr. she was opposed to palin enough to cross the line for the first time in this election .
“ i never thought i would vote for a democrat , ” she said .
one ford engineer and mother of two , who asked not to be identified , did vote for mccain out of loyalty to the republican party , but also voiced serious doubts about palin .
she is taking strange comfort in the fact that her absentee vote won ’ t count in her home state . “ michigan is a clear blue state .

hoffenheim reclaimed the top spot with a win saturday . goals in each half from martin fenin and michael fink gave frankfurt victory after moenchengladbach had taken the lead courtesy of a marco russ own goal . the win lifts frankfurt -lrb- 12 points -rrb- further from the relegation zone , while moenchengladbach stay second to bottom on seven points , one ahead of energie cottbus . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : frankfurt 's three points may prove crucial to avoiding relegation " we have a lot of mental problems - psychological , " moenchengladbach coach hans meyer said after a second defeat after three games in charge .
" the situation is bad , very bad . " in the other bundesliga match on sunday , nov .
2 , borussia dortmund were held to a 1-1 draw by bochum - their sixth of the season - in a disappointing ruhr derby . dortmund stay sixth on 18 points - seven points behind leaders hoffenheim . it was a sixth game without a defeat for dortmund who have only been beaten once this season , but have now drawn six . " the way we played we did n't deserve more than a point , " coach juergen klopp said .
" we have been unbeaten in so many games , but it 's time we won a home game . " hoffenheim back on top bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hoffenheim has scored more goals than any other bundesliga team hoffenheim thrashed karlsruhe 4-1 on saturday to reclaim the top spot .
the win puts rolf rangnick 's side onto to 25 points from 11 games , one more than bayer leverkusen , who had gone top overnight after defeating wolfsburg 2-0 on friday . high-scoring hoffenheim 's winning run continued at their interim home in mannheim , with league top scorer ibisevic taking his tally to 13 and the team moving up to 31 goals . after a 15th-minute opener from ibisevic , karlsruhe bounced back through sebastian freis and the visitors managed to frustrate the home side until obasi struck in the 67th . any hopes of another comeback were then quashed when ibisevic headed his second in the 75th and obasi scored again three minutes later . klose , ribery , podolski score for bayern bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : podolski , klose and ribery who all scored for bayern bayern earned a hard-fought 3-1 victory over lowly bielefeld thanks to goals from miroslav klose , franck ribery and substitute lukas podolski from the penalty spot to go third on 21 points . bayern munich made it a fourth straight league win , but left it relatively late to overcome bielefeld in a one-sided match . coach juergen klinsmann found no place in the starting line-up for podolski despite the injury absence of italy striker luca toni , preferring to start with a five-man midfield and klose as a lone striker . klinsmann insisted it was a tactical decision rather than a lack of confidence in podolski , saying he wanted to test the formation ahead of wednesday 's champions league encounter with fiorentina . it appeared to pay off when klose thumped in a 25th-minute opener against an injury-hit arminia side who had not won in munich for 29 years . klinsmann switched tactics after the break and an armenia goal from the penalty spot , bringing on podolski for bastian schweinsteiger and the move worked when the germany striker set up ribery to score in the 77th minute . podolski then notched the third himself from the penalty spot six minutes from time after a foul on ribery and two minutes after tesche was dismissed for a tackle from behind on the french international . klinsmann had said in a newspaper interview podolski had not done enough to get into the team ahead of klose or toni , but there was praise for the striker after the match . " he brought a lot of movement into the game and went into where it hurt , getting into the penalty area and seeking to finish things off , " he said . however podolski 's future at the club now appears to be in doubt . " you can understand that i will be considering things in the winter break , " the striker said .
" but we have some important games coming up and i do n't want to get involved in speculation . " diego helps werder to huge win bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bremen 's diego , center , as he slots the ball in hamburg slipped two places to fifth after crashing to a 3-0 defeat at lowly hanover who struck in the fifth and 18th minutes through bastian shultz and jan schlaudraff before jiri stajner added a third 11 minutes from time . werder bremen swept to a 5-1 victory over hertha berlin to end a six-game unbeaten series by the visitors . goalkeeper christopher gaeng on his debut was at fault for the first goal in the 14th minute when he missed a diego corner and the ball came off defender gojko kacer to deflect into his own net . diego struck a brilliant second six minutes later when he chested the ball down just inside the area and twisted to volley the ball over the keeper . the game was effectively over when sweden striker markus rosenberg poked the ball between the legs of the unfortunate gaeng from close range three minutes before the break for werder 's third . diego then set up the fourth with a pass to claudio pizarro who slid the ball home in the 59th .
hertha pulled one back with a header from brazilian cicero in the 68th but pizarro headed a fifth five minutes from time . the victory was the first in the league for thomas schaaf 's team after six games in the league and champions league . late victory for schalke schalke 's engelaar was sent off at cottbus for an insulting gesture - tapping his forehead with his index finger to a linesman , leaving schalke to play most of the second half with 10 men . however goals from heikko westermann 10 minutes from time and jefferson farfan in the last minute - at the second attempt after his penalty was saved - gave the blues a late victory . milivoje novakovic scored twice and portugal midfielder petit struck in stoppage time as cologne came away from vfb stuttgart with a 3-1 win . the slovenia striker struck in the 3rd and 61st minutes .
roberto hilbert pulled one back in the 69th but then made a mistake to allow petit to score in the fourth minute of stoppage time . dpa news agency -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" hoffenheim back on top bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hoffenheim has scored more goals than any other bundesliga team hoffenheim thrashed karlsruhe 4-1 on saturday to reclaim the top spot .
the win puts rolf rangnick 's side onto to 25 points from 11 games , one more than bayer leverkusen , who had gone top overnight after defeating wolfsburg 2-0 on friday . high-scoring hoffenheim 's winning run continued at their interim home in mannheim , with league top scorer ibisevic taking his tally to 13 and the team moving up to 31 goals . after a 15th-minute opener from ibisevic , karlsruhe bounced back through sebastian freis and the visitors managed to frustrate the home side until obasi struck in the 67th . any hopes of another comeback were then quashed when ibisevic headed his second in the 75th and obasi scored again three minutes later . klose , ribery , podolski score for bayern bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : podolski , klose and ribery who all scored for bayern bayern earned a hard-fought 3-1 victory over lowly bielefeld thanks to goals from miroslav klose , franck ribery and substitute lukas podolski from the penalty spot to go third on 21 points . bayern munich made it a fourth straight league win , but left it relatively late to overcome bielefeld in a one-sided match . coach juergen klinsmann found no place in the starting line-up for podolski despite the injury absence of italy striker luca toni , preferring to start with a five-man midfield and klose as a lone striker . klinsmann insisted it was a tactical decision rather than a lack of confidence in podolski , saying he wanted to test the formation ahead of wednesday 's champions league encounter with fiorentina . it appeared to pay off when klose thumped in a 25th-minute opener against an injury-hit arminia side who had not won in munich for 29 years . klinsmann switched tactics after the break and an armenia goal from the penalty spot , bringing on podolski for bastian schweinsteiger and the move worked when the germany striker set up ribery to score in the 77th minute . podolski then notched the third himself from the penalty spot six minutes from time after a foul on ribery and two minutes after tesche was dismissed for a tackle from behind on the french international . klinsmann had said in a newspaper interview podolski had not done enough to get into the team ahead of klose or toni , but there was praise for the striker after the match . " he brought a lot of movement into the game and went into where it hurt , getting into the penalty area and seeking to finish things off , " he said . however podolski 's future at the club now appears to be in doubt . " you can understand that i will be considering things in the winter break , " the striker said .
" but we have some important games coming up and i do n't want to get involved in speculation . " diego helps werder to huge win bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bremen 's diego , center , as he slots the ball in hamburg slipped two places to fifth after crashing to a 3-0 defeat at lowly hanover who struck in the fifth and 18th minutes through bastian shultz and jan schlaudraff before jiri stajner added a third 11 minutes from time . werder bremen swept to a 5-1 victory over hertha berlin to end a six-game unbeaten series by the visitors . goalkeeper christopher gaeng on his debut was at fault for the first goal in the 14th minute when he missed a diego corner and the ball came off defender gojko kacer to deflect into his own net . diego struck a brilliant second six minutes later when he chested the ball down just inside the area and twisted to volley the ball over the keeper . the game was effectively over when sweden striker markus rosenberg poked the ball between the legs of the unfortunate gaeng from close range three minutes before the break for werder 's third . diego then set up the fourth with a pass to claudio pizarro who slid the ball home in the 59th .
hertha pulled one back with a header from brazilian cicero in the 68th but pizarro headed a fifth five minutes from time . the victory was the first in the league for thomas schaaf 's team after six games in the league and champions league . late victory for schalke schalke 's engelaar was sent off at cottbus for an insulting gesture - tapping his forehead with his index finger to a linesman , leaving schalke to play most of the second half with 10 men . however goals from heikko westermann 10 minutes from time and jefferson farfan in the last minute - at the second attempt after his penalty was saved - gave the blues a late victory . milivoje novakovic scored twice and portugal midfielder petit struck in stoppage time as cologne came away from vfb stuttgart with a 3-1 win . the slovenia striker struck in the 3rd and 61st minutes .

but even republicans are now going democrat for a far more compelling reason : fear that sarah palin could become president . jim sides , 55 , a californian living in bonn , is a swing voter who cast his ballot for president george w. bush in 2004 .
this time the one single factor driving him to the democratic ticket is the possibility that the republican vice-presidential nominee sarah palin is a heartbeat away from the american presidency .
if john mccain is elected next tuesday , the 72- year-old republican senator from arizona , who has battled skin cancer , would become the oldest us president in history .
“ let ’ s say mccain doesn ’ t make it health-wise - then we ’ d wind up with caribou barbie in the white house , ” sides said , referring to the alaskan governor ’ s bouffant hairdo and the political lightweight impression palin has made on millions of television viewers .
sides , a ceo of meyer sound germany , a division of the us manufacturer of professional loudspeakers , said he had been even leaning towards mccain before palin entered the republican ticket .
feeling betrayed by mccain ’ s choice bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : sarah palin lookalike being parodied on " saturday night live " “ i had a very high regard for john mccain based on my knowledge of his record as senator .
he was an honorable man , a war hero , but after he picked palin , i felt he had betrayed his country , ” he said .
“ i was in a state of pure shock .
leaving someone completely unqualified intellectually in a position to step into the presidency was so irresponsible , ” sides continued .
sides ’ wife lisa , who had also liked mccain , felt that the vietnam veteran ’ s extensive military experience could be valuable in finding a realistic exit strategy out of the morass in iraq .
“ but picking her -lrb- palin -rrb- pushed me over the edge towards barack obama .
mccain made that choice based on trying to win the election rather than having the best interests of our country in mind , ” she said . picking palin alienated expat voters the choice of palin was meant to balance and galvanize the republican ticket with a social conservative who could draw on the extreme , evangelical elements of the party as well as female hillary voters . but the move wound up alienating many of the us expatriates dw-world.de spoke to in the old american settlement of bonn ’ s scenic plittersdorf district on the rhine river , where life revolves around the international school and english-language church . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : us expats meet at stimson memorial chapel in bonn all those interviewed said it was a key , if not the key reason , to vote for barack obama , whether they liked the illinois senator or not .
the expatriates in the former german capital come from all over the map in the united states and reflect diverse political views .
they tend to be better off than their compatriots back home , since many are managers at blue chip us multinational companies .
that puts tax policy , trade and america 's image abroad high on the list of issues that matter to them . jeff nagel , 44 , a top executive at one such multinational , said that the way mccain made his vice-presidential choice reflected the personality differences between the two presidential candidates .
that sealed his decision to vote for obama instead , he said .
choice of vp reflects personality of candidates “ as a businessman , i look at an individual ’ s leadership skills regardless of their experience and position on the issues .
i agree with obama only about half the time , ” said nagel , who had previously voted for president george w. bush and describes himself as a free trader and fiscal conservative , but a moderate on social policy .
“ but look at how he has managed his campaign , taking on the democratic establishment clintons .
look at how he articulates his positions , and his ability to keep a level response through the ups and downs of his campaign , ” he said adding that obama has already shown that he is a thoughtful and effective leader through his choice of six-term delaware senator joe biden , 65 , as his running mate .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : obama 's choice of joe biden -lrb- left -rrb- has been widely praised “ biden is someone who can deliver the experience that obama lacks , but not the electoral votes that he needs to win the presidency .
obama ’ s choice was not based on the short term decision to get into office , but to put together a good team for the long haul in office , ” continued nagel , who declined to name his company since he was expressing his personal views .
many expats like nagel see mccain ’ s public outbursts and unpredictability that his republican handlers call “ maverick ” , in a negative light .
they say that mccain ’ s ‘ shoot first , ask later ’ fighter pilot mentality that might work on the battlefield , is unsuited for the us presidency , which requires a cool head .
concerns about mccain ’ s judgement others have expressed serious concerns about mccain ’ s judgement .
matthew howard , a global engineering manager based in cologne for ford motor company , who has republican leanings and is not convinced of obama , has vacillated so much with his absentee ballot that it is now too late to cast his vote .
“ if mccain had picked -lrb- former massachusetts governor -rrb- mitt romney or any other qualified candidate , i would vote for him in a flash .
picking a running mate was the most important decision of his candidacy and he blew it with palin .
how could he be so dramatically out of touch to pick this woman ? " asked howard , who added that the role of vp today is no longer just a president-in-waiting , but an important team player in the cabinet .
“ if i were back in michigan , i wouldn ’ t be able to sit home on election day .
it ’ d be painful , but i ’ d vote obama , ” said howard , explaining that he generally dislikes democrat fiscal and economic policies . resigned into voting for barack obama bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : expat absentee ballots can make a difference in swing states vera-lynn lewallen , 53 , who was born on a military base in germany and grew up in north carolina , sent in her absentee ballot , but initially thought of abstaining , since she is bitter at the democratic party for casting aside senator hillary clinton in favor of obama .
“ i ’ d rather not vote if i ’ m not happy with the democratic candidate , but now i feel blackmailed by the republicans into voting , because they picked this palin woman , ” she said .
then there is mickie nagel , who unlike her husband , an independent , has been a lifelong republican and even worked on the campaign to re-elect the incumbent president ’ s father , george bush sr. she was opposed to palin enough to cross the line for the first time in this election .
“ i never thought i would vote for a democrat , ” she said .
one ford engineer and mother of two , who asked not to be identified , did vote for mccain out of loyalty to the republican party , but also voiced serious doubts about palin .
she is taking strange comfort in the fact that her absentee vote won ’ t count in her home state . “ michigan is a clear blue state .
obama will win there anyway , ” she said with a sigh of relief . diana fong send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

but even republicans are now going democrat for a far more compelling reason : fear that sarah palin could become president . jim sides , 55 , a californian living in bonn , is a swing voter who cast his ballot for president george w. bush in 2004 .
this time the one single factor driving him to the democratic ticket is the possibility that the republican vice-presidential nominee sarah palin is a heartbeat away from the american presidency .
if john mccain is elected next tuesday , the 72- year-old republican senator from arizona , who has battled skin cancer , would become the oldest us president in history .
“ let ’ s say mccain doesn ’ t make it health-wise - then we ’ d wind up with caribou barbie in the white house , ” sides said , referring to the alaskan governor ’ s bouffant hairdo and the political lightweight impression palin has made on millions of television viewers .
sides , a ceo of meyer sound germany , a division of the us manufacturer of professional loudspeakers , said he had been even leaning towards mccain before palin entered the republican ticket .
feeling betrayed by mccain ’ s choice bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : sarah palin lookalike being parodied on " saturday night live " “ i had a very high regard for john mccain based on my knowledge of his record as senator .
he was an honorable man , a war hero , but after he picked palin , i felt he had betrayed his country , ” he said .
“ i was in a state of pure shock .
leaving someone completely unqualified intellectually in a position to step into the presidency was so irresponsible , ” sides continued .
sides ’ wife lisa , who had also liked mccain , felt that the vietnam veteran ’ s extensive military experience could be valuable in finding a realistic exit strategy out of the morass in iraq .
“ but picking her -lrb- palin -rrb- pushed me over the edge towards barack obama .
mccain made that choice based on trying to win the election rather than having the best interests of our country in mind , ” she said . picking palin alienated expat voters the choice of palin was meant to balance and galvanize the republican ticket with a social conservative who could draw on the extreme , evangelical elements of the party as well as female hillary voters . but the move wound up alienating many of the us expatriates dw-world.de spoke to in the old american settlement of bonn ’ s scenic plittersdorf district on the rhine river , where life revolves around the international school and english-language church . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : us expats meet at stimson memorial chapel in bonn all those interviewed said it was a key , if not the key reason , to vote for barack obama , whether they liked the illinois senator or not .
the expatriates in the former german capital come from all over the map in the united states and reflect diverse political views .
they tend to be better off than their compatriots back home , since many are managers at blue chip us multinational companies .
that puts tax policy , trade and america 's image abroad high on the list of issues that matter to them . jeff nagel , 44 , a top executive at one such multinational , said that the way mccain made his vice-presidential choice reflected the personality differences between the two presidential candidates .
that sealed his decision to vote for obama instead , he said .
choice of vp reflects personality of candidates “ as a businessman , i look at an individual ’ s leadership skills regardless of their experience and position on the issues .
i agree with obama only about half the time , ” said nagel , who had previously voted for president george w. bush and describes himself as a free trader and fiscal conservative , but a moderate on social policy .
“ but look at how he has managed his campaign , taking on the democratic establishment clintons .
look at how he articulates his positions , and his ability to keep a level response through the ups and downs of his campaign , ” he said adding that obama has already shown that he is a thoughtful and effective leader through his choice of six-term delaware senator joe biden , 65 , as his running mate .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de us election -pipe- 02.11.2008 fear of a palin presidency drives us expats to vote for obama großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : alaskan sarah palin -lrb- right -rrb- is known as the " caribou barbie " for her lightweight image the economy , taxes and america 's image are hot-button issues for us expats in germany .
but even republicans are now going democrat for a far more compelling reason : fear that sarah palin could become president . jim sides , 55 , a californian living in bonn , is a swing voter who cast his ballot for president george w. bush in 2004 .
this time the one single factor driving him to the democratic ticket is the possibility that the republican vice-presidential nominee sarah palin is a heartbeat away from the american presidency .
if john mccain is elected next tuesday , the 72- year-old republican senator from arizona , who has battled skin cancer , would become the oldest us president in history .
“ let ’ s say mccain doesn ’ t make it health-wise - then we ’ d wind up with caribou barbie in the white house , ” sides said , referring to the alaskan governor ’ s bouffant hairdo and the political lightweight impression palin has made on millions of television viewers .
sides , a ceo of meyer sound germany , a division of the us manufacturer of professional loudspeakers , said he had been even leaning towards mccain before palin entered the republican ticket .
feeling betrayed by mccain ’ s choice bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : sarah palin lookalike being parodied on " saturday night live " “ i had a very high regard for john mccain based on my knowledge of his record as senator .
he was an honorable man , a war hero , but after he picked palin , i felt he had betrayed his country , ” he said .
“ i was in a state of pure shock .
leaving someone completely unqualified intellectually in a position to step into the presidency was so irresponsible , ” sides continued .
sides ’ wife lisa , who had also liked mccain , felt that the vietnam veteran ’ s extensive military experience could be valuable in finding a realistic exit strategy out of the morass in iraq .
“ but picking her -lrb- palin -rrb- pushed me over the edge towards barack obama .
mccain made that choice based on trying to win the election rather than having the best interests of our country in mind , ” she said . picking palin alienated expat voters the choice of palin was meant to balance and galvanize the republican ticket with a social conservative who could draw on the extreme , evangelical elements of the party as well as female hillary voters . but the move wound up alienating many of the us expatriates dw-world.de spoke to in the old american settlement of bonn ’ s scenic plittersdorf district on the rhine river , where life revolves around the international school and english-language church . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : us expats meet at stimson memorial chapel in bonn all those interviewed said it was a key , if not the key reason , to vote for barack obama , whether they liked the illinois senator or not .
the expatriates in the former german capital come from all over the map in the united states and reflect diverse political views .
they tend to be better off than their compatriots back home , since many are managers at blue chip us multinational companies .
that puts tax policy , trade and america 's image abroad high on the list of issues that matter to them . jeff nagel , 44 , a top executive at one such multinational , said that the way mccain made his vice-presidential choice reflected the personality differences between the two presidential candidates .
that sealed his decision to vote for obama instead , he said .
choice of vp reflects personality of candidates “ as a businessman , i look at an individual ’ s leadership skills regardless of their experience and position on the issues .
i agree with obama only about half the time , ” said nagel , who had previously voted for president george w. bush and describes himself as a free trader and fiscal conservative , but a moderate on social policy .
“ but look at how he has managed his campaign , taking on the democratic establishment clintons .
look at how he articulates his positions , and his ability to keep a level response through the ups and downs of his campaign , ” he said adding that obama has already shown that he is a thoughtful and effective leader through his choice of six-term delaware senator joe biden , 65 , as his running mate .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : obama 's choice of joe biden -lrb- left -rrb- has been widely praised “ biden is someone who can deliver the experience that obama lacks , but not the electoral votes that he needs to win the presidency .
obama ’ s choice was not based on the short term decision to get into office , but to put together a good team for the long haul in office , ” continued nagel , who declined to name his company since he was expressing his personal views .
many expats like nagel see mccain ’ s public outbursts and unpredictability that his republican handlers call “ maverick ” , in a negative light .
they say that mccain ’ s ‘ shoot first , ask later ’ fighter pilot mentality that might work on the battlefield , is unsuited for the us presidency , which requires a cool head .
concerns about mccain ’ s judgement others have expressed serious concerns about mccain ’ s judgement .
matthew howard , a global engineering manager based in cologne for ford motor company , who has republican leanings and is not convinced of obama , has vacillated so much with his absentee ballot that it is now too late to cast his vote .
“ if mccain had picked -lrb- former massachusetts governor -rrb- mitt romney or any other qualified candidate , i would vote for him in a flash .
picking a running mate was the most important decision of his candidacy and he blew it with palin .
how could he be so dramatically out of touch to pick this woman ? " asked howard , who added that the role of vp today is no longer just a president-in-waiting , but an important team player in the cabinet .
“ if i were back in michigan , i wouldn ’ t be able to sit home on election day .
it ’ d be painful , but i ’ d vote obama , ” said howard , explaining that he generally dislikes democrat fiscal and economic policies . resigned into voting for barack obama bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : expat absentee ballots can make a difference in swing states vera-lynn lewallen , 53 , who was born on a military base in germany and grew up in north carolina , sent in her absentee ballot , but initially thought of abstaining , since she is bitter at the democratic party for casting aside senator hillary clinton in favor of obama .
“ i ’ d rather not vote if i ’ m not happy with the democratic candidate , but now i feel blackmailed by the republicans into voting , because they picked this palin woman , ” she said .
then there is mickie nagel , who unlike her husband , an independent , has been a lifelong republican and even worked on the campaign to re-elect the incumbent president ’ s father , george bush sr. she was opposed to palin enough to cross the line for the first time in this election .
“ i never thought i would vote for a democrat , ” she said .
one ford engineer and mother of two , who asked not to be identified , did vote for mccain out of loyalty to the republican party , but also voiced serious doubts about palin .
she is taking strange comfort in the fact that her absentee vote won ’ t count in her home state . “ michigan is a clear blue state .
obama will win there anyway , ” she said with a sigh of relief . diana fong send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?
dw-world.de experts : obama presidency likely to disappoint foreign fans as the us presidential election enters its final week , the vast majority of the world is rooting for barack obama .

if john mccain is elected next tuesday , the 72- year-old republican senator from arizona , who has battled skin cancer , would become the oldest us president in history .
“ let ’ s say mccain doesn ’ t make it health-wise - then we ’ d wind up with caribou barbie in the white house , ” sides said , referring to the alaskan governor ’ s bouffant hairdo and the political lightweight impression palin has made on millions of television viewers .

choice of vp reflects personality of candidates “ as a businessman , i look at an individual ’ s leadership skills regardless of their experience and position on the issues .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de us election -pipe- 02.11.2008 fear of a palin presidency drives us expats to vote for obama großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : alaskan sarah palin -lrb- right -rrb- is known as the " caribou barbie " for her lightweight image the economy , taxes and america 's image are hot-button issues for us expats in germany .
but even republicans are now going democrat for a far more compelling reason : fear that sarah palin could become president . jim sides , 55 , a californian living in bonn , is a swing voter who cast his ballot for president george w. bush in 2004 .
this time the one single factor driving him to the democratic ticket is the possibility that the republican vice-presidential nominee sarah palin is a heartbeat away from the american presidency .
if john mccain is elected next tuesday , the 72- year-old republican senator from arizona , who has battled skin cancer , would become the oldest us president in history .
“ let ’ s say mccain doesn ’ t make it health-wise - then we ’ d wind up with caribou barbie in the white house , ” sides said , referring to the alaskan governor ’ s bouffant hairdo and the political lightweight impression palin has made on millions of television viewers .
sides , a ceo of meyer sound germany , a division of the us manufacturer of professional loudspeakers , said he had been even leaning towards mccain before palin entered the republican ticket .
feeling betrayed by mccain ’ s choice bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : sarah palin lookalike being parodied on " saturday night live " “ i had a very high regard for john mccain based on my knowledge of his record as senator .
he was an honorable man , a war hero , but after he picked palin , i felt he had betrayed his country , ” he said .
“ i was in a state of pure shock .
leaving someone completely unqualified intellectually in a position to step into the presidency was so irresponsible , ” sides continued .
sides ’ wife lisa , who had also liked mccain , felt that the vietnam veteran ’ s extensive military experience could be valuable in finding a realistic exit strategy out of the morass in iraq .
“ but picking her -lrb- palin -rrb- pushed me over the edge towards barack obama .
mccain made that choice based on trying to win the election rather than having the best interests of our country in mind , ” she said . picking palin alienated expat voters the choice of palin was meant to balance and galvanize the republican ticket with a social conservative who could draw on the extreme , evangelical elements of the party as well as female hillary voters . but the move wound up alienating many of the us expatriates dw-world.de spoke to in the old american settlement of bonn ’ s scenic plittersdorf district on the rhine river , where life revolves around the international school and english-language church . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : us expats meet at stimson memorial chapel in bonn all those interviewed said it was a key , if not the key reason , to vote for barack obama , whether they liked the illinois senator or not .
the expatriates in the former german capital come from all over the map in the united states and reflect diverse political views .
they tend to be better off than their compatriots back home , since many are managers at blue chip us multinational companies .
that puts tax policy , trade and america 's image abroad high on the list of issues that matter to them . jeff nagel , 44 , a top executive at one such multinational , said that the way mccain made his vice-presidential choice reflected the personality differences between the two presidential candidates .
that sealed his decision to vote for obama instead , he said .
choice of vp reflects personality of candidates “ as a businessman , i look at an individual ’ s leadership skills regardless of their experience and position on the issues .
i agree with obama only about half the time , ” said nagel , who had previously voted for president george w. bush and describes himself as a free trader and fiscal conservative , but a moderate on social policy .
“ but look at how he has managed his campaign , taking on the democratic establishment clintons .
look at how he articulates his positions , and his ability to keep a level response through the ups and downs of his campaign , ” he said adding that obama has already shown that he is a thoughtful and effective leader through his choice of six-term delaware senator joe biden , 65 , as his running mate .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : obama 's choice of joe biden -lrb- left -rrb- has been widely praised “ biden is someone who can deliver the experience that obama lacks , but not the electoral votes that he needs to win the presidency .
obama ’ s choice was not based on the short term decision to get into office , but to put together a good team for the long haul in office , ” continued nagel , who declined to name his company since he was expressing his personal views .
many expats like nagel see mccain ’ s public outbursts and unpredictability that his republican handlers call “ maverick ” , in a negative light .
they say that mccain ’ s ‘ shoot first , ask later ’ fighter pilot mentality that might work on the battlefield , is unsuited for the us presidency , which requires a cool head .
concerns about mccain ’ s judgement others have expressed serious concerns about mccain ’ s judgement .

" the ceasefire last wednesday needs to be bolstered .
the crisis , even if averted in the short term , will return without a new , vigorous and united political effort , " miliband and kouchner said in a joint statement . earlier saturday , reports said that the congolese and rwandan presidents had agreed to attend a regional summit aimed at resolving the conflict . miliband says no plans to send british troops the european union 's aid commissioner louis michel , who held talks with both leaders , told the bbc that kabila and kagame had agreed to meet at a summit involving the african union and other african leaders . michel flew into the dr congo on thursday in an attempt to defuse the conflict between tutsi rebels and government forces , which blew up into four days of full-scale fighting earlier this week . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : un troops are overstretched in congo the world 's largest un peacekeeping force is deployed in congo .
but they 've been stretched to the limit by the fighting and the un 's top envoy in dr congo , alan doss , has called for more troops to add to the 17,000 contingent already in the sprawling central african nation . " we are not at the moment looking at sending british troops to join the un force , " miliband was quoted as telling reporters during a visit to a refugee camp in eastern congo . " desperate situation " united nations secretary general ban ki-moon friday urged nkunda to stick to the ceasefire and said the situation was " very threatening . " the ceasefire continued to hold saturday , but fears were growing for the fate of the tens of thousands who fled the rebel advance . the un refugee agency unhcr said the situation was " desperate .

he tells a polish woman the proper time to break the day-long fast , shares a joke in arabic with a visitor and supervises renovations going on in the hall .
before the three-story family home was converted into a mosque in 1991 , warsaw 's muslims gathered for prayers inside the egyptian embassy or rented out a dance hall before its nightly discotheque .
now the mosque is so crowded there 's talk of building another downtown to accommodate muslims who work in the city .
tiny minority expected to grow bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : poland 's islamic minority has deep roots in the country although most estimate poland has some 30,000 muslims - less than 0.1 per cent of the population - their small community is expected to grow .
in warsaw , they number between 5,000 and 7,000 , and include businessmen , political refugees and those who came to study in the 1980s and stayed .
charif came from damascus to study at university in 1982 , when poland was communist but seen as a cheap country for syrian , iraqi and libyan immigrants .
most of them returned to their homelands after graduation , but charif stayed after he married a polish woman .
those who arrived in the 1970s and 1980s now make up a small percentage of warsaw 's muslims , with many today coming from turkey , syria , pakistan and chechnya .
in the mix are a handful of poles who converted after marrying muslims , and a few who became muslims on their own .
outside warsaw , poland boasts two historic mosques from the 17th and 18th century-built in the villages of bohoniki and kruszyniany , settlements of poland 's first muslims in the 14th century .
the tartars made their home in the poland-lithuania commonwealth and practiced islam freely in exchange for military service .
their communities once numbered some 17,000 people , but today only several families remain as most tatar descendants moved to cities for work .
tatars enjoy more tolerance than those in cities some 2,000 muslim tatars live in poland , said bronislaw talkowski , head of a muslim community organization in kruszyniany .
although the village is largely catholic and conservative , talkowski says there 's more tolerance there than in more cosmopolitan cities .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the wooden mosque in bohoniki " tatars settled kruszyniany at the end of the 17th century ... the locals know the tatars from that time , " talkowski said .
" and there 's no animosity between catholics and muslims like you read about in certain places .
that does n't happen here . "
but muslims remain a tiny minority in a country that 's 96 per cent catholic , and among a people that has rarely lived alongside immigrants .
warsaw does n't have the large immigrant groups of cities like london or paris , and poland during communist times saw more people wanting to leave than hoping for entry .
today the country is slowly becoming a likelier destination for immigrants , especially after it joined the european union in 2004 .
but for many poles outside larger cities , foreigners are still a strange sight .
charif says most varsovians are tolerant , and reports only a few isolated incidents that peaked after the september 11 , 2001 terrorist attacks on the united states , but soon tapered off .
harrassment comes from a small percentage of poles women who wear the hijab , or veil , can face more harassment because they look openly muslim , but charif says they report rare incidents that mostly come from elderly or drunk poles .
" they 're rare but they happen , " charif says .
" there are others who feel stress and who feel aggression .
" but our religion says if there are people that want to laugh , you pass by them and make your ears like a tunnel .
it passes from one side and comes out the other . " dpa news agency -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de us election -pipe- 02.11.2008 fear of a palin presidency drives us expats to vote for obama großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : alaskan sarah palin -lrb- right -rrb- is known as the " caribou barbie " for her lightweight image the economy , taxes and america 's image are hot-button issues for us expats in germany .
but even republicans are now going democrat for a far more compelling reason : fear that sarah palin could become president . jim sides , 55 , a californian living in bonn , is a swing voter who cast his ballot for president george w. bush in 2004 .
this time the one single factor driving him to the democratic ticket is the possibility that the republican vice-presidential nominee sarah palin is a heartbeat away from the american presidency .
if john mccain is elected next tuesday , the 72- year-old republican senator from arizona , who has battled skin cancer , would become the oldest us president in history .
“ let ’ s say mccain doesn ’ t make it health-wise - then we ’ d wind up with caribou barbie in the white house , ” sides said , referring to the alaskan governor ’ s bouffant hairdo and the political lightweight impression palin has made on millions of television viewers .
sides , a ceo of meyer sound germany , a division of the us manufacturer of professional loudspeakers , said he had been even leaning towards mccain before palin entered the republican ticket .
feeling betrayed by mccain ’ s choice bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : sarah palin lookalike being parodied on " saturday night live " “ i had a very high regard for john mccain based on my knowledge of his record as senator .
he was an honorable man , a war hero , but after he picked palin , i felt he had betrayed his country , ” he said .
“ i was in a state of pure shock .
leaving someone completely unqualified intellectually in a position to step into the presidency was so irresponsible , ” sides continued .
sides ’ wife lisa , who had also liked mccain , felt that the vietnam veteran ’ s extensive military experience could be valuable in finding a realistic exit strategy out of the morass in iraq .
“ but picking her -lrb- palin -rrb- pushed me over the edge towards barack obama .
mccain made that choice based on trying to win the election rather than having the best interests of our country in mind , ” she said . picking palin alienated expat voters the choice of palin was meant to balance and galvanize the republican ticket with a social conservative who could draw on the extreme , evangelical elements of the party as well as female hillary voters . but the move wound up alienating many of the us expatriates dw-world.de spoke to in the old american settlement of bonn ’ s scenic plittersdorf district on the rhine river , where life revolves around the international school and english-language church . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : us expats meet at stimson memorial chapel in bonn all those interviewed said it was a key , if not the key reason , to vote for barack obama , whether they liked the illinois senator or not .
the expatriates in the former german capital come from all over the map in the united states and reflect diverse political views .
they tend to be better off than their compatriots back home , since many are managers at blue chip us multinational companies .
that puts tax policy , trade and america 's image abroad high on the list of issues that matter to them . jeff nagel , 44 , a top executive at one such multinational , said that the way mccain made his vice-presidential choice reflected the personality differences between the two presidential candidates .
that sealed his decision to vote for obama instead , he said .
choice of vp reflects personality of candidates “ as a businessman , i look at an individual ’ s leadership skills regardless of their experience and position on the issues .
i agree with obama only about half the time , ” said nagel , who had previously voted for president george w. bush and describes himself as a free trader and fiscal conservative , but a moderate on social policy .
“ but look at how he has managed his campaign , taking on the democratic establishment clintons .
look at how he articulates his positions , and his ability to keep a level response through the ups and downs of his campaign , ” he said adding that obama has already shown that he is a thoughtful and effective leader through his choice of six-term delaware senator joe biden , 65 , as his running mate .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : obama 's choice of joe biden -lrb- left -rrb- has been widely praised “ biden is someone who can deliver the experience that obama lacks , but not the electoral votes that he needs to win the presidency .
obama ’ s choice was not based on the short term decision to get into office , but to put together a good team for the long haul in office , ” continued nagel , who declined to name his company since he was expressing his personal views .
many expats like nagel see mccain ’ s public outbursts and unpredictability that his republican handlers call “ maverick ” , in a negative light .
they say that mccain ’ s ‘ shoot first , ask later ’ fighter pilot mentality that might work on the battlefield , is unsuited for the us presidency , which requires a cool head .
concerns about mccain ’ s judgement others have expressed serious concerns about mccain ’ s judgement .
matthew howard , a global engineering manager based in cologne for ford motor company , who has republican leanings and is not convinced of obama , has vacillated so much with his absentee ballot that it is now too late to cast his vote .
“ if mccain had picked -lrb- former massachusetts governor -rrb- mitt romney or any other qualified candidate , i would vote for him in a flash .
picking a running mate was the most important decision of his candidacy and he blew it with palin .
how could he be so dramatically out of touch to pick this woman ? " asked howard , who added that the role of vp today is no longer just a president-in-waiting , but an important team player in the cabinet .
“ if i were back in michigan , i wouldn ’ t be able to sit home on election day .
it ’ d be painful , but i ’ d vote obama , ” said howard , explaining that he generally dislikes democrat fiscal and economic policies . resigned into voting for barack obama bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : expat absentee ballots can make a difference in swing states vera-lynn lewallen , 53 , who was born on a military base in germany and grew up in north carolina , sent in her absentee ballot , but initially thought of abstaining , since she is bitter at the democratic party for casting aside senator hillary clinton in favor of obama .
“ i ’ d rather not vote if i ’ m not happy with the democratic candidate , but now i feel blackmailed by the republicans into voting , because they picked this palin woman , ” she said .
then there is mickie nagel , who unlike her husband , an independent , has been a lifelong republican and even worked on the campaign to re-elect the incumbent president ’ s father , george bush sr. she was opposed to palin enough to cross the line for the first time in this election .
“ i never thought i would vote for a democrat , ” she said .
one ford engineer and mother of two , who asked not to be identified , did vote for mccain out of loyalty to the republican party , but also voiced serious doubts about palin .
she is taking strange comfort in the fact that her absentee vote won ’ t count in her home state . “ michigan is a clear blue state .
obama will win there anyway , ” she said with a sigh of relief . diana fong send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de us election -pipe- 02.11.2008 fear of a palin presidency drives us expats to vote for obama großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : alaskan sarah palin -lrb- right -rrb- is known as the " caribou barbie " for her lightweight image the economy , taxes and america 's image are hot-button issues for us expats in germany .
but even republicans are now going democrat for a far more compelling reason : fear that sarah palin could become president . jim sides , 55 , a californian living in bonn , is a swing voter who cast his ballot for president george w. bush in 2004 .
this time the one single factor driving him to the democratic ticket is the possibility that the republican vice-presidential nominee sarah palin is a heartbeat away from the american presidency .
if john mccain is elected next tuesday , the 72- year-old republican senator from arizona , who has battled skin cancer , would become the oldest us president in history .
“ let ’ s say mccain doesn ’ t make it health-wise - then we ’ d wind up with caribou barbie in the white house , ” sides said , referring to the alaskan governor ’ s bouffant hairdo and the political lightweight impression palin has made on millions of television viewers .
sides , a ceo of meyer sound germany , a division of the us manufacturer of professional loudspeakers , said he had been even leaning towards mccain before palin entered the republican ticket .
feeling betrayed by mccain ’ s choice bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : sarah palin lookalike being parodied on " saturday night live " “ i had a very high regard for john mccain based on my knowledge of his record as senator .
he was an honorable man , a war hero , but after he picked palin , i felt he had betrayed his country , ” he said .
“ i was in a state of pure shock .
leaving someone completely unqualified intellectually in a position to step into the presidency was so irresponsible , ” sides continued .
sides ’ wife lisa , who had also liked mccain , felt that the vietnam veteran ’ s extensive military experience could be valuable in finding a realistic exit strategy out of the morass in iraq .
“ but picking her -lrb- palin -rrb- pushed me over the edge towards barack obama .
mccain made that choice based on trying to win the election rather than having the best interests of our country in mind , ” she said . picking palin alienated expat voters the choice of palin was meant to balance and galvanize the republican ticket with a social conservative who could draw on the extreme , evangelical elements of the party as well as female hillary voters . but the move wound up alienating many of the us expatriates dw-world.de spoke to in the old american settlement of bonn ’ s scenic plittersdorf district on the rhine river , where life revolves around the international school and english-language church . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : us expats meet at stimson memorial chapel in bonn all those interviewed said it was a key , if not the key reason , to vote for barack obama , whether they liked the illinois senator or not .
the expatriates in the former german capital come from all over the map in the united states and reflect diverse political views .
they tend to be better off than their compatriots back home , since many are managers at blue chip us multinational companies .
that puts tax policy , trade and america 's image abroad high on the list of issues that matter to them . jeff nagel , 44 , a top executive at one such multinational , said that the way mccain made his vice-presidential choice reflected the personality differences between the two presidential candidates .
that sealed his decision to vote for obama instead , he said .
choice of vp reflects personality of candidates “ as a businessman , i look at an individual ’ s leadership skills regardless of their experience and position on the issues .
i agree with obama only about half the time , ” said nagel , who had previously voted for president george w. bush and describes himself as a free trader and fiscal conservative , but a moderate on social policy .
“ but look at how he has managed his campaign , taking on the democratic establishment clintons .
look at how he articulates his positions , and his ability to keep a level response through the ups and downs of his campaign , ” he said adding that obama has already shown that he is a thoughtful and effective leader through his choice of six-term delaware senator joe biden , 65 , as his running mate .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : obama 's choice of joe biden -lrb- left -rrb- has been widely praised “ biden is someone who can deliver the experience that obama lacks , but not the electoral votes that he needs to win the presidency .
obama ’ s choice was not based on the short term decision to get into office , but to put together a good team for the long haul in office , ” continued nagel , who declined to name his company since he was expressing his personal views .
many expats like nagel see mccain ’ s public outbursts and unpredictability that his republican handlers call “ maverick ” , in a negative light .
they say that mccain ’ s ‘ shoot first , ask later ’ fighter pilot mentality that might work on the battlefield , is unsuited for the us presidency , which requires a cool head .

but even republicans are now going democrat for a far more compelling reason : fear that sarah palin could become president . jim sides , 55 , a californian living in bonn , is a swing voter who cast his ballot for president george w. bush in 2004 .
this time the one single factor driving him to the democratic ticket is the possibility that the republican vice-presidential nominee sarah palin is a heartbeat away from the american presidency .
if john mccain is elected next tuesday , the 72- year-old republican senator from arizona , who has battled skin cancer , would become the oldest us president in history .
“ let ’ s say mccain doesn ’ t make it health-wise - then we ’ d wind up with caribou barbie in the white house , ” sides said , referring to the alaskan governor ’ s bouffant hairdo and the political lightweight impression palin has made on millions of television viewers .
sides , a ceo of meyer sound germany , a division of the us manufacturer of professional loudspeakers , said he had been even leaning towards mccain before palin entered the republican ticket .
feeling betrayed by mccain ’ s choice bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : sarah palin lookalike being parodied on " saturday night live " “ i had a very high regard for john mccain based on my knowledge of his record as senator .
he was an honorable man , a war hero , but after he picked palin , i felt he had betrayed his country , ” he said .
“ i was in a state of pure shock .
leaving someone completely unqualified intellectually in a position to step into the presidency was so irresponsible , ” sides continued .
sides ’ wife lisa , who had also liked mccain , felt that the vietnam veteran ’ s extensive military experience could be valuable in finding a realistic exit strategy out of the morass in iraq .
“ but picking her -lrb- palin -rrb- pushed me over the edge towards barack obama .
mccain made that choice based on trying to win the election rather than having the best interests of our country in mind , ” she said . picking palin alienated expat voters the choice of palin was meant to balance and galvanize the republican ticket with a social conservative who could draw on the extreme , evangelical elements of the party as well as female hillary voters . but the move wound up alienating many of the us expatriates dw-world.de spoke to in the old american settlement of bonn ’ s scenic plittersdorf district on the rhine river , where life revolves around the international school and english-language church . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : us expats meet at stimson memorial chapel in bonn all those interviewed said it was a key , if not the key reason , to vote for barack obama , whether they liked the illinois senator or not .
the expatriates in the former german capital come from all over the map in the united states and reflect diverse political views .
they tend to be better off than their compatriots back home , since many are managers at blue chip us multinational companies .
that puts tax policy , trade and america 's image abroad high on the list of issues that matter to them . jeff nagel , 44 , a top executive at one such multinational , said that the way mccain made his vice-presidential choice reflected the personality differences between the two presidential candidates .
that sealed his decision to vote for obama instead , he said .
choice of vp reflects personality of candidates “ as a businessman , i look at an individual ’ s leadership skills regardless of their experience and position on the issues .
i agree with obama only about half the time , ” said nagel , who had previously voted for president george w. bush and describes himself as a free trader and fiscal conservative , but a moderate on social policy .
“ but look at how he has managed his campaign , taking on the democratic establishment clintons .
look at how he articulates his positions , and his ability to keep a level response through the ups and downs of his campaign , ” he said adding that obama has already shown that he is a thoughtful and effective leader through his choice of six-term delaware senator joe biden , 65 , as his running mate .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : obama 's choice of joe biden -lrb- left -rrb- has been widely praised “ biden is someone who can deliver the experience that obama lacks , but not the electoral votes that he needs to win the presidency .
obama ’ s choice was not based on the short term decision to get into office , but to put together a good team for the long haul in office , ” continued nagel , who declined to name his company since he was expressing his personal views .
many expats like nagel see mccain ’ s public outbursts and unpredictability that his republican handlers call “ maverick ” , in a negative light .
they say that mccain ’ s ‘ shoot first , ask later ’ fighter pilot mentality that might work on the battlefield , is unsuited for the us presidency , which requires a cool head .
concerns about mccain ’ s judgement others have expressed serious concerns about mccain ’ s judgement .
matthew howard , a global engineering manager based in cologne for ford motor company , who has republican leanings and is not convinced of obama , has vacillated so much with his absentee ballot that it is now too late to cast his vote .
“ if mccain had picked -lrb- former massachusetts governor -rrb- mitt romney or any other qualified candidate , i would vote for him in a flash .

karen jennings , from unison , said : " i think there are serious questions to ask about whether ambulance crews should sit outside if somebody inside is having a heart attack .
" having said that , if that household has a history of attacking people when they go in , then it does n't do anybody any good if they were just to rush in and put themselves at risk . "
there are an estimated 1,000 attacks a week on health workers and members of the emergency services .
sexual attacks fear of violence has led to all paramedics in london being offered stab-proof vests to wear on duty , and increasingly , there are calls to hand them out to staff nationally .

bbc radio 5live 's donal mcintyre programme has obtained a region-by-region breakdown of those records .
the west of england division , which covers bristol , swindon and gloucester , currently has 312 addresses flagged as " at-risk " .
about half were reported for physical violence and 58 for sexual attacks .

" i was later punched in the face myself .
i required several days off work . "
another paramedic who has more than 20 years service at the north east ambulance nhs trust believes the problem has got worse recently .

how to listen ...
the donal macintyre programme is on radio 5 live on sunday , 2 november at 1900 bst .
listen via the bbc iplayer subscribe to the podcast another way of responding to the problem has been for ambulance services to keep a record of addresses where there have been abuse , threats or attacks .
bbc radio 5live 's donal mcintyre programme has obtained a region-by-region breakdown of those records .
the west of england division , which covers bristol , swindon and gloucester , currently has 312 addresses flagged as " at-risk " .
about half were reported for physical violence and 58 for sexual attacks .
in london , the number is 1,930 , but the service did not specify the reasons why properties were included .

" i was later punched in the face myself .
i required several days off work . "
another paramedic who has more than 20 years service at the north east ambulance nhs trust believes the problem has got worse recently .
" even 10 years ago people would n't dream of verbally abusing you - now with drinking and drug problems it 's much more common , " he said .
behaviour the patients association says flaws in the system could put patients at risk .
spokeswoman vanessa bourne said : " a record like this has to be absolutely accurate and up to date .
if they are not , patient safety and lives may be in danger .
" there are many reasons why a patient 's behaviour puts them on the register , but they may be the patients most in need of care . "

liz kendall of the ambulance service network on the " unacceptable attacks " " having said that , if that household has a history of attacking people when they go in , then it does n't do anybody any good if they were just to rush in and put themselves at risk . "
there are an estimated 1,000 attacks a week on health workers and members of the emergency services .
sexual attacks fear of violence has led to all paramedics in london being offered stab-proof vests to wear on duty , and increasingly , there are calls to hand them out to staff nationally .
how to listen ...
the donal macintyre programme is on radio 5 live on sunday , 2 november at 1900 bst .
listen via the bbc iplayer subscribe to the podcast another way of responding to the problem has been for ambulance services to keep a record of addresses where there have been abuse , threats or attacks .
bbc radio 5live 's donal mcintyre programme has obtained a region-by-region breakdown of those records .
the west of england division , which covers bristol , swindon and gloucester , currently has 312 addresses flagged as " at-risk " .
about half were reported for physical violence and 58 for sexual attacks .
in london , the number is 1,930 , but the service did not specify the reasons why properties were included .
the north west has the most flagged households - 3,071 - but a spokesman pointed out that they made up just 0.10 % of all residential addresses .
andy price , a paramedic in the west midlands , told the programme he was assaulted when responding to a call for an arm injury .

my colleague , while attempting to calm the situation , was punched in the face .
" i was later punched in the face myself .
i required several days off work . "
another paramedic who has more than 20 years service at the north east ambulance nhs trust believes the problem has got worse recently .
" even 10 years ago people would n't dream of verbally abusing you - now with drinking and drug problems it 's much more common , " he said .

spokeswoman vanessa bourne said : " a record like this has to be absolutely accurate and up to date .
if they are not , patient safety and lives may be in danger .
" there are many reasons why a patient 's behaviour puts them on the register , but they may be the patients most in need of care . "
the recent emergency workers -lrb- obstruction -rrb- act 2006 makes it an offence to obstruct or hinder persons who provide emergency services .

staff called to emergencies at these addresses are advised to wait for police before entering the premises .
the patients association says records must be " absolutely accurate " or " patient safety may be in danger " .
unison is calling for the system to be reviewed , saying there are " serious questions " about how it works .
the union says paramedics are faced with a moral dilemma , forced to make a difficult choice between their own safety and that of their patients .
karen jennings , from unison , said : " i think there are serious questions to ask about whether ambulance crews should sit outside if somebody inside is having a heart attack .
please turn on javascript .
media requires javascript to play .
liz kendall of the ambulance service network on the " unacceptable attacks " " having said that , if that household has a history of attacking people when they go in , then it does n't do anybody any good if they were just to rush in and put themselves at risk . "
there are an estimated 1,000 attacks a week on health workers and members of the emergency services .
sexual attacks fear of violence has led to all paramedics in london being offered stab-proof vests to wear on duty , and increasingly , there are calls to hand them out to staff nationally .
how to listen ...
the donal macintyre programme is on radio 5 live on sunday , 2 november at 1900 bst .
listen via the bbc iplayer subscribe to the podcast another way of responding to the problem has been for ambulance services to keep a record of addresses where there have been abuse , threats or attacks .
bbc radio 5live 's donal mcintyre programme has obtained a region-by-region breakdown of those records .
the west of england division , which covers bristol , swindon and gloucester , currently has 312 addresses flagged as " at-risk " .
about half were reported for physical violence and 58 for sexual attacks .
in london , the number is 1,930 , but the service did not specify the reasons why properties were included .
the north west has the most flagged households - 3,071 - but a spokesman pointed out that they made up just 0.10 % of all residential addresses .
andy price , a paramedic in the west midlands , told the programme he was assaulted when responding to a call for an arm injury .
they may be the patients most in need of care vanessa bourne , patients association have your say : what should be done to protect paramedics ?
" when we arrived on the scene it very quickly became apparent that the reason for which we had been called was perhaps erroneous , " he said .
" there was a number of people there - they had all been drinking quite heavily .
my colleague , while attempting to calm the situation , was punched in the face .
" i was later punched in the face myself .
i required several days off work . "
another paramedic who has more than 20 years service at the north east ambulance nhs trust believes the problem has got worse recently .
" even 10 years ago people would n't dream of verbally abusing you - now with drinking and drug problems it 's much more common , " he said .
behaviour the patients association says flaws in the system could put patients at risk .
spokeswoman vanessa bourne said : " a record like this has to be absolutely accurate and up to date .
if they are not , patient safety and lives may be in danger .
" there are many reasons why a patient 's behaviour puts them on the register , but they may be the patients most in need of care . "
the recent emergency workers -lrb- obstruction -rrb- act 2006 makes it an offence to obstruct or hinder persons who provide emergency services .
the donal macintyre programme will be broadcast on bbc radio 5 live at 7pm on sunday 2 november , 2008 or download the programme podcast .

the companies are asking people to " dream the impossible " to help design the first community-designed pc .
a website , wepc.com , has been set up to allow people to share and comment on ideas to " enable a global conversation about the ideal elements of a pc . "
both companies insist the project is not simply cheap talk , saying there is a commitment to building the machine .
" the spark for innovation can come from anywhere , " said intel 's mike hoeffinger .
he added that both companies have joined together " to tap into the creative energy of consumers ... and give people a voice in the design of technology they use every day . "
technology companies have always asked for customer feedback , but this is being billed as a new approach to product design and to customer involvement , says lillian lin , the director of marketing and planning at asus .
" by empowering wepc.com users to play a role in the design process , we expect to deliver cutting-edge community-designed products that address a consumer vision of the dream pc , " said ms lin .
" ghetto blaster laptop " the mission statement for wepc.com is simple : " you dream it .
asus builds it .
intel inside it . "
" your designs , feature ideas and community feedback will be evaluated by asus and could influence the blueprint of an actual notebook pc built by asus with intel inside , " said the website .
" everyone is very aware there is a commitment from everyone involved , " said josh mattison of federated media , which is involved in the marketing campaign .
" if you start a conversation with your customers , the first step is knowing their voices will be heard and incorporating that into those companies ' larger thought processes .
that is absolutely something you can expect to see . "
the community will be divided into what intel has called three " conversation groups " .
they will address three of the most popular consumer pc categories : netbooks , notebooks and gaming notebooks .
wepc.com has urged users to let their imagination run wild .
" there is no limit to creativity , " said mr mattison .
" and there is no forum quite like this for expressing that .
let those ideas flow , whether it 's concerning something purely functional like battery life or something a bit more ' out there ' like a computer needing a haircut every two weeks , " he said .
some of the suggestions for the community-designed pc already include a ghetto blaster laptop with woofers and tweeters and a " happy laptop " that would wake the user up in the morning .
it is unlikely that any consumer-inspired pc will make the market any time soon and it could be well into 2009 before the " dream pc " is turned into reality .

the companies are asking people to " dream the impossible " to help design the first community-designed pc .
a website , wepc.com , has been set up to allow people to share and comment on ideas to " enable a global conversation about the ideal elements of a pc . "
both companies insist the project is not simply cheap talk , saying there is a commitment to building the machine .
" the spark for innovation can come from anywhere , " said intel 's mike hoeffinger .
he added that both companies have joined together " to tap into the creative energy of consumers ... and give people a voice in the design of technology they use every day . "
technology companies have always asked for customer feedback , but this is being billed as a new approach to product design and to customer involvement , says lillian lin , the director of marketing and planning at asus .
" by empowering wepc.com users to play a role in the design process , we expect to deliver cutting-edge community-designed products that address a consumer vision of the dream pc , " said ms lin .
" ghetto blaster laptop " the mission statement for wepc.com is simple : " you dream it .
asus builds it .
intel inside it . "
the companies will also award prizes to some for their creative efforts " your designs , feature ideas and community feedback will be evaluated by asus and could influence the blueprint of an actual notebook pc built by asus with intel inside , " said the website .
" everyone is very aware there is a commitment from everyone involved , " said josh mattison of federated media , which is involved in the marketing campaign .
" if you start a conversation with your customers , the first step is knowing their voices will be heard and incorporating that into those companies ' larger thought processes .
that is absolutely something you can expect to see . "
the community will be divided into what intel has called three " conversation groups " .
they will address three of the most popular consumer pc categories : netbooks , notebooks and gaming notebooks .
wepc.com has urged users to let their imagination run wild .
" there is no limit to creativity , " said mr mattison .
" slickmachines " wants a laptop impervious to water damage " and there is no forum quite like this for expressing that .
let those ideas flow , whether it 's concerning something purely functional like battery life or something a bit more ' out there ' like a computer needing a haircut every two weeks , " he said .
some of the suggestions for the community-designed pc already include a ghetto blaster laptop with woofers and tweeters and a " happy laptop " that would wake the user up in the morning .
it is unlikely that any consumer-inspired pc will make the market any time soon and it could be well into 2009 before the " dream pc " is turned into reality .

the companies are asking people to " dream the impossible " to help design the first community-designed pc .
a website , wepc.com , has been set up to allow people to share and comment on ideas to " enable a global conversation about the ideal elements of a pc . "
both companies insist the project is not simply cheap talk , saying there is a commitment to building the machine .
" the spark for innovation can come from anywhere , " said intel 's mike hoeffinger .
he added that both companies have joined together " to tap into the creative energy of consumers ... and give people a voice in the design of technology they use every day . "
technology companies have always asked for customer feedback , but this is being billed as a new approach to product design and to customer involvement , says lillian lin , the director of marketing and planning at asus .
" by empowering wepc.com users to play a role in the design process , we expect to deliver cutting-edge community-designed products that address a consumer vision of the dream pc , " said ms lin .
" ghetto blaster laptop " the mission statement for wepc.com is simple : " you dream it .
asus builds it .

the companies will also award prizes to some for their creative efforts " your designs , feature ideas and community feedback will be evaluated by asus and could influence the blueprint of an actual notebook pc built by asus with intel inside , " said the website .
" everyone is very aware there is a commitment from everyone involved , " said josh mattison of federated media , which is involved in the marketing campaign .

the prostate is found near the bladder , and helps make and expel semen , but is a common source of cancer .
about 25 % of all new cancers diagnosed in men are prostate cancers with about 10,000 deaths in the uk each year .
prostate cancer cells normally only multiply in the presence of androgens - the male sex hormones .
the main drug treatments for the disease work by blocking their effect .

dr mark matfield , aicr 's scientific adviser , said : " dr edwards ' research will help us understand why our existing treatments do not work and give us vital clues about how we can develop new , effective ways to treat advanced prostate cancer . "

after eight long years , in which america has acted as though it did n't really care about anyone else 's opinions , the white house will bring the united states back into the family of nations again , where it always was under franklin roosevelt , john kennedy and bill clinton .
where diplomacy and not force takes centre stage .
and where international justice , human rights and ending world poverty becomes just as important as defending national security .
obama will bring a welcome new approach to ending the conflict in iraq , a different commitment to fighting terrorism in afghanistan and bringing osama bin laden to justice , and over iran , negotiating not just issuing threats .
and on climate change obama will ensure america takes its responsibilities seriously .
for britain the special relationship will be two way again and not just one way .
obama will mean a healthy new domestic policy , targeting tax cuts on the poor and middle class , not on the rich like george bush and john mccain .
and there will be more funding for education and universal health care for all .
john mccain is stuck in an old , failed past .
barack obama offers much needed hope for the future , of change , inspiring generations , young and old , black and white , that politics really can make a difference , when they had almost given up on it , to make a better world .
all in all , good news for the american people , and great news for britain too . "
" free trade and international security are really crucial issues for the world in which we live " michael howard michael howard on john mccain : " let me say at the outset that i recognise that many good things would flow from an obama presidency .
it would certainly change the perception of the united states in the rest of the world , and after eight years of george w bush that would be a very desirable outcome .
so in many ways i 'd like to be able to support senator obama , but there are two main reasons why i ca n't : the first is to do with free trade .
in the 1930 's it was protectionism , the putting up of barriers to protect the industries of individual countries all over the world , which tipped the world into the worst recession we 've ever seen and ultimately lead to the second world war .
so when senator obama threatens the north atlantic free trade area , and opposes free trade agreements with countries like south korea and columbia , when he adopts this protectionist stance , i really fear for the consequences .
senator mccain on the other hand has consistently championed free trade .
in the primaries when every candidate went to iowa , and all the other candidates said they would subsidise corn to make ethanol , john mccain said ' i wo n't do that , because i think its wrong ' .
when in the primaries everyone went to michigan and all the other candidates said to the car workers of detroit ' we 'll give you your old jobs back ' , john mccain said : ' they ca n't do that , those jobs are gone , i 'll try and get you new jobs , but those jobs are gone . '
he was brave and he was right and by championing free trade he could help save the world , including this country , from the worst consequences of what a global recession might turn into .
just as he was right about free trade , john mccain was also right when it came to reacting to the russian invasion of georgia , he was very strong in his response , barack obama was very ambivalent .
now the world 's a very dangerous place and i think we need an american president who will stand up to people like putin and people like ahmadinejad of iran .
i 'm confident that a president mccain would do that , i 'm not sure a president obama would .
free trade and international security are really crucial issues for the world in which we live .
that 's why i think the election of john mccain would be a better outcome for the world on tuesday . "

in the 1930 's it was protectionism , the putting up of barriers to protect the industries of individual countries all over the world , which tipped the world into the worst recession we 've ever seen and ultimately lead to the second world war .
so when senator obama threatens the north atlantic free trade area , and opposes free trade agreements with countries like south korea and columbia , when he adopts this protectionist stance , i really fear for the consequences .
senator mccain on the other hand has consistently championed free trade .
in the primaries when every candidate went to iowa , and all the other candidates said they would subsidise corn to make ethanol , john mccain said ' i wo n't do that , because i think its wrong ' .
when in the primaries everyone went to michigan and all the other candidates said to the car workers of detroit ' we 'll give you your old jobs back ' , john mccain said : ' they ca n't do that , those jobs are gone , i 'll try and get you new jobs , but those jobs are gone . '
he was brave and he was right and by championing free trade he could help save the world , including this country , from the worst consequences of what a global recession might turn into .
just as he was right about free trade , john mccain was also right when it came to reacting to the russian invasion of georgia , he was very strong in his response , barack obama was very ambivalent .
now the world 's a very dangerous place and i think we need an american president who will stand up to people like putin and people like ahmadinejad of iran .
i 'm confident that a president mccain would do that , i 'm not sure a president obama would .
free trade and international security are really crucial issues for the world in which we live .
that 's why i think the election of john mccain would be a better outcome for the world on tuesday .

barack obama offers much needed hope for the future peter hain peter hain on barack obama : a barack obama win will lift the spirits of the entire world .
after eight long years , in which america has acted as though it did n't really care about anyone else 's opinions , the white house will bring the united states back into the family of nations again , where it always was under franklin roosevelt , john kennedy and bill clinton .
where diplomacy and not force takes centre stage .
and where international justice , human rights and ending world poverty becomes just as important as defending national security .
obama will bring a welcome new approach to ending the conflict in iraq , a different commitment to fighting terrorism in afghanistan and bringing osama bin laden to justice , and over iran , negotiating not just issuing threats .
and on climate change obama will ensure america takes its responsibilities seriously .
for britain the special relationship will be two way again and not just one way .
obama will mean a healthy new domestic policy , targeting tax cuts on the poor and middle class , not on the rich like george bush and john mccain .
and there will be more funding for education and universal health care for all .
john mccain is stuck in an old , failed past .
barack obama offers much needed hope for the future , of change , inspiring generations , young and old , black and white , that politics really can make a difference , when they had almost given up on it , to make a better world .
all in all , good news for the american people , and great news for britain too .
free trade and international security are really crucial issues for the world in which we live michael howard michael howard on john mccain : let me say at the outset that i recognise that many good things would flow from an obama presidency .
it would certainly change the perception of the united states in the rest of the world , and after eight years of george w bush that would be a very desirable outcome .

just as he was right about free trade , john mccain was also right when it came to reacting to the russian invasion of georgia , he was very strong in his response , barack obama was very ambivalent .
now the world 's a very dangerous place and i think we need an american president who will stand up to people like putin and people like ahmadinejad of iran .
i 'm confident that a president mccain would do that , i 'm not sure a president obama would .
free trade and international security are really crucial issues for the world in which we live .
that 's why i think the election of john mccain would be a better outcome for the world on tuesday .

katon dawson chairman of south carolina republican party john mccain has made the case for why we must elect him to be the next president katon dawson on halloween night 1964 , i was eight-years-old when my mother and i drove to the downtown auditorium in south carolina 's capital city of columbia to hear ronald reagan stump for republican presidential nominee sen. barry goldwater of arizona .
forty-four years have passed since then , but voters in south carolina still respond to candidates who run on the conservative reform platform that has been the foundation of republican success .
this year , we are proud to have another republican from arizona carrying our conservative banner - john mccain .
as i 've travelled across south carolina campaigning for republican candidates , i have met activists and supporters who know john mccain very well .
he joined other republican presidential candidates who spent time with us in our homes , businesses and communities during presidential primary talking about the issues most important to voters in this election .
john mccain won our 2008 first-in-the-south republican presidential primary in south carolina on january 19 , 2008 , which catapulted him to the republican nomination for president .
now , we 're less than a day away from the most important election of my lifetime .
voters in south carolina have the chance to elect a man we know well to be the next president .
katon dawson - ' i 'm a small businessman and father of two ' for this reason , thousands of republicans are volunteering across the state .
they are making phone calls , knocking on doors and putting out yard signs because the stakes could n't be higher .
unprecedented voter turn out is expected in south carolina .
during this final push before election day , excitement about the republican ticket here has reached fever pitch .
from summerville to spartanburg , voters in our state strongly support john mccain and sarah palin because they are two leaders who have been guided during this campaign by the principles of our party - limited government , lower taxes , energy independence , a strong national defence and traditional values .
john mccain has made the case for why we must elect him to be the next president .
i 'm a small businessman and father of two and i can tell you that hardworking american families are overtaxed and businesses over-regulated .
in addition to cumbersome taxes and regulations , rising fuel costs are making it increasingly difficult to do business in america .
john mccain is the only candidate in this election with the judgment and experience to lead when people on main street are struggling .
john mccain is a common-sense coalition builder .
he will work hard with democrats and republicans to jumpstart the economy .
john mccain will also cut taxes , rein in government spending and create a business climate that will create jobs .
the choice could n't be clearer .
in this ' change ' election , john mccain and sarah palin will end gridlock and change the way business is done in washington .
i am more confident than ever that we will deliver eight electoral votes to john mccain on tuesday .
i look forward to working hard with activists and supporters in south carolina on election day to turn out every vote we can for the republican ticket .
