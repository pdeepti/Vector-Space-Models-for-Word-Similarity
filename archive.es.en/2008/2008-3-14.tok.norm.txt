his agenda 2010 is still splitting german politics as the spd loses ground . the liberal market reforms gerhard schroeder announced on march 14 , 2003 led to talk of social inequality in germany and the emergence of a new underclass .
nevertheless , unemployment is now down and economic growth is up . while center-left members of his social democratic party praised the measures this week , the spd 's far-left wing , the left party and the labor unions had harsh words for the agenda 2010 . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : schroeder still stand by his agenda 2010 spd party leader kurt beck said thursday in a speech marking the anniversary of the reforms that schroeder 's address five years ago had signalled " the start of major successes in the areas of economy and the labor market . " " now we have to work towards bringing the agenda 's successes to all the people , " said beck , whose popularity is at an all-time low , according to several recent surveys . foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier said there had been no alternative to the far-reaching reforms made to the social and labor systems over the past five years . " we had to choose this policy , knowing that it could lead to pain and loss , " he said . reaganomics from the left the agenda 2010 , which has been compared to reaganomics in the us and thatcherism in britain , aimed to improve economic growth and reduce unemployment by slashing not only income tax but also unemployment benefits and pensions . the move met with approval from the conservative christian democratic and the liberal , free-market free democratic party , but immediately drew resistance from schroeder 's own social democrats .
he 'd been elected in 2002 promising not to cut social benefits . thousands of the spd 's center-left members abandoned the party as a result , though the far-left stayed on , shifting the party 's core .
due to inner-party pressure , schroeder resigned as party chair in february 2004 .
he remained chancellor , however , until 2005 when he was forced to acknowledge defeat and call for early elections , paving the way for christian democratic chancellor angela merkel . schroeder 's massive cuts , particularly to unemployment benefits , led to talk of deepening economic inequality and the emergence of a new underclass . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : cuts to unemployment benefits spurred mass protests the discourse was fuelled when the friedrich ebert foundation , a political foundation closely associated with the spd , published a study in late 2006 indicating that four percent of people in western germany and 20 percent in eastern germany were living in " precarious " economic conditions and felt " left behind " by politicians and society . nevertheless , unemployment sank from 10.6 percent in 2005 - the highest it had been since german reunification - to 8.3 percent in 2007 . schroeder warns against leftward lean former chancellor schroeder on thursday defended his agenda 2010 as being " good and right . "
referring to the fundamental shift to the left that his party has taken , in part due to the controversy surrounding the reforms , he added that " the spd can only achieve a majority if it 's anchored in the middle of society and does n't abandon this position . " franz-juergen weise , chairman of the federal employment office , said in an interview with the friday edition of the leipziger zeitung that the structural reorganization of his agency has resulted in " 18 million euros -lrb- $ 27.75 million -rrb- in savings , solid financing for unemployment insurance -lsb- and -rsb- lower premiums . " in contrast , michael sommer , the head of the federation of german trade unions , commented that the agenda 2010 had widened the economic gap in german society . critique from spd 's biggest rival bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the left party has benefitted from the spd 's popularity drop the bulk of the criticism , however , came from the left .
today , hundreds of thousands of full-time employees " earn less than those who receive hartz iv unemployment benefits , " said spd member ottmar schreiner in zdf . " that was made possible in part by the agenda , " he said . oskar lafontaine , who left the spd in 2005 to found the growing left party , condemned the agenda , saying that " five years of agenda 2010 mean five years of neo-liberal dead-ends and the destruction of social peace and the people 's trust in politics . " the success of lafontaine 's new left party , comprised in part of dissatisfied former spd members , represents a mounting political threat to the spd .

bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : huge crowds boosted profits for the top two leagues the gap could best be highlighted by the number of german clubs left in the quarter-finals of the champions league - just one , schalke 04 who face barcelona in the next round - compared to four from the english premier league .
werder bremen 's exit from the uefa cup on thursday night left just bayern munich and bayer leverkusen to fly the flag in the last eight .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de balkans -pipe- 14.03.2008 serbia struggles in aftermath of kosovo 's independence großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : nationalist sentiment is fueled by economic difficulties serbia shunned western europe for its support of an independent kosovo .
but the eu is its most important trade partner and now the balkan country is feeling the crunch , both economically and politically . according to opinion polls , 70 percent of serbians are in favor of their county joining the european union .
but in the last elections , half of them voted for the nationalist euroskeptic parties . one reason is the west 's support of independence for kosovo .
another is the nationalists ' populist stance .
they want to undo the country 's recent democratic transformation and win the attention of those who have n't profited from the economic upswing . " these people are discontent because the democratic government treated them with arrogance in the past seven years and did n't want to hear about the problems of the people in the middle of the country , " said former foreign minister goran svilanovic . " distinctively neo-liberal politics makes them unhappy , but the majority of them do n't oppose the eu , " he said . long way to go bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : most serbs support eu membership in comparison to the last decade of war and economic embargos , serbs are living in much better circumstances today .
in 2007 , overall production rose by seven percent over the previous year . nevertheless , they are still far away from the central-european standard of living .
the gross national income in serbia is only about $ 5,500 per capita . the loss of the southern province of kosovo this year was another blow to the serbian economy .
the government , which stepped down as a result of the conflict over the eu 's kosovo policy , can no longer implement their plans to boost the economy .
since nearly all of its important trade partners have recognized the new state , the anti-western attitude in serbia is deterring potential investors . " serbia will experience political turbulence this year , which is why a lot of direct foreign investment ca n't be expected , " said belgrade economist sasa djogovic but the foreign companies that are already in serbia wo n't pull out , added djogovic . " that 's especially true of the finance sector , " he said .
" for them , serbia 's transformation market is very lucrative due to the high demand for capital . " unfair bank practices bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " free kosova " is n't bringing more coca-cola to serbia after a decade and a half of poverty , serbs are just starting to purchase new furniture and household appliances - but they have to pay a high price to borrow money .
currently , austrian , greek and italian firms dominate the bank sector . " brussels ' tolerance of the business practices of european banks in serbia is unacceptable , " said political scientist dusan janjic . " raiffeisen bank , credit agricole , societe generale and hvb are representatives of europe here , but for the people of serbia they are plunderers .
they charge the highest interest rates in europe and charge double interest via bogus firms in austria , " he said . on the other hands , the banks are reluctant to approve corporate loans .
the most important employers continue to be large state-run companies and the few trade monopolies .
the state is too weak to confront oligarchies and many of the state-run companies , like oil , end up being sold to russian conglomerates at low prices . alternative strategies " you ca n't really expect serbia to be able to export retail products to the european union , " said djogovic . " we 'll continue to send resources to the industrial nations , but we should also import technologies from these countries in order to become more competitive ourselves .
instead we import mass produced goods , " he said . as an alternative , serbia could explore new markets , or return to forgotten markets , like north africa , suggested the economist . filip slavkovic -lrb- kjb -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" it would have been unthinkable for the summit would have remained silent on this , " sarkozy concluded . global financial markets have been gripped with extreme volatility amid concerns that tight credit conditions are threatening some finance houses and record-breaking runs for the euro , oil and gold . commission chief vows ecb will take action bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : barroso attempted to quell fears over financial instability as fears grew of a recession in the us economy and the knock-on effects on the world 's nerve-wracked financial markets , european commission chief jose manuel barroso tried to instill calm by telling the summit that the european central bank -lrb- ecb -rrb- would take control of the situation should it be required to . " the ecb will do what is necessary to secure financial stability , " barroso said . the eu leaders also broached the subject of action in the fight against climate change during the two-day summit and at the end agreed to wrap up negotiations on ambitious targets to cut energy use and fight global warming by the end of the year . " we committed ourselves to finishing negotiating on this package by the end of this year and by doing this we made a huge step forward , " said slovenian prime minister janez jansa , whose country holds the european union 's rotating presidency .
" we are convinced that the costs of these measures will be much lower than if we do n't act . " eu targets year-end for climate package agreement bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the eu is under pressure to deliver on its climate promises the current plan aims to meet the european union 's over-arching goal to reduce emissions of carbon dioxide - the main gas responsible for global warming - by 20 percent by 2020 , compared to 1990 levels .
eu member states have committed to go to 30 percent if other countries match them . in the upcoming negotiations on the details of meeting those goals , jansa said : " we need to take into account the different positions of the member states and their needs for economic growth . " in another green move , the eu leaders agreed to support the development of environmentally-friendly products by reducing the level of vat on them . the proposal , first made by british prime minister gordon brown , " will start the debate in many member states about how and whether household goods ... can incentivize consumer behavior towards buying energy-efficient and environmentally friendly goods and services , " brown said . environmental vat on eu agenda bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : brown 's " green tax " idea made a cautious appearance under the decision , the eu 's executive body , the european commission , is tasked with " reflecting " on " the best way to support the development of clean products by evoking the question of environmental vat , " sarkozy said . but the proposal is unlikely to lead to concrete measures soon .
vat is a sensitive issue , since much of the eu 's common budget comes from the vat which consumers pay in each member state , and any decisions on changing rates have to be approved unanimously . " people are being persuaded by the argument that we should look at this very carefully , " brown said .
" vat is a uniquely european tax . ...
we made substantial progress in only two days and i believe that over the next few months other countries will join the debate . " despite the support of britain and france - two of the eu 's three largest states - some member states oppose the proposal and could well block it . eu backs club med plan under new name bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : sarkozy 's club med plan will go to a summit in paris the eu also formally backed ambitious french plans for a union for the mediterranean , but watered it down to such an extent that it had to be given a new name . according to a last-minute addition to the draft conclusions of their regular spring council in brussels , the new organization is to be called " barcelona process : union for the mediterranean . " the barcelona process is the name of the eu 's 13-year-old policy which deals with the bloc 's southern neighbors and which many critics say has so far failed to deliver . the original " club med , " as first conceived a year ago by french president nicolas sarkozy , envisaged uniting israelis and syrians , turks and spaniards , italians and libyans , and making them work together on such diverse issues as migration , the environment or the fight against terrorism . but the latest draft of the proposal , brokered by germany earlier this week and submitted to leaders over dinner on thursday , includes all of the eu 's member states and vaguely talks about " projects with an accent on regional cooperation . " concerns over eu funds the downsizing came after eu countries with no borders on the mediterranean expressed skepticism at the proposal , with member states from eastern europe particularly concerned that it would divert precious eu funds away from their region . in friday 's draft conclusions , the european commission , " is invited to present to the council of eu leaders the necessary proposals for defining the modalities of what will be called ' barcelona process : union for the mediterranean " ' in view of a special summit to be convened in paris on july 13 . sarkozy nevertheless welcomed the compromise , pointing out that the new organization will for the first time give a strong voice to middle eastern and north african leaders in the way money in the region is spent . he noted that the new political structure will be co-chaired by an eu member and a non-eu member .
" europe will not turn its back on the mediterranean any more , " sarkozy said late thursday . chinese clampdown on tibet causes eu concern bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : reports suggest a chinese crackdown in lhasa , tibet the eu also took the opportunity provided by the summit to express concern about the violent protests taking place in tibet , with germany and britain among those calling for dialogue and restraint . german foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier called for an end to the conflict by peaceful means while his british counterpart david miliband said european governments would be seeking " clarification about what is actually happening on the ground , " adding that " restraint " and " substantive dialogue " were the only way forward . reports coming out of lhasa , the capital of china 's tibet autonomous region , suggest paramilitary riot police intervened to control protests initiated by buddhist monks on the 49th anniversary of a tibetan uprising against chinese rule that was crushed by troops . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" i specifically support the german automobile industry , " she said , stressing that countries like germany , whose automobile industry makes larger cars , should not be discriminated against when the climate targets and fines are in force . summing up the view of many of his colleagues , bulgarian prime minister sergei stanishev said the eu needed to " strike a balance " in its bid to cut co2 emissions . leaders were also expected to discuss how to make financial markets more transparent in the wake of the recent turmoil and take stock of a number of foreign policy issues , including afghanistan and the middle east . club med 's could open in july bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some are still skeptical where sarkozy 's mediterranean union is headed but much of the attention was being devoted to french plans to create a union between countries with borders on the mediterranean sea . after fierce resistance from berlin , french president nicolas sarkozy scaled the plan down from including only states bordering the mediterranean , with nine new agencies and a bank , to an annual summit of eu and mediterranean countries with a joint presidency and a small secretariat . barroso applauded the idea , saying the new proposal would not divide the eu into northern and southern sections .

but the eu is its most important trade partner and now the balkan country is feeling the crunch , both economically and politically . according to opinion polls , 70 percent of serbians are in favor of their county joining the european union .
but in the last elections , half of them voted for the nationalist euroskeptic parties . one reason is the west 's support of independence for kosovo .
another is the nationalists ' populist stance .
they want to undo the country 's recent democratic transformation and win the attention of those who have n't profited from the economic upswing . " these people are discontent because the democratic government treated them with arrogance in the past seven years and did n't want to hear about the problems of the people in the middle of the country , " said former foreign minister goran svilanovic . " distinctively neo-liberal politics makes them unhappy , but the majority of them do n't oppose the eu , " he said . long way to go bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : most serbs support eu membership in comparison to the last decade of war and economic embargos , serbs are living in much better circumstances today .
in 2007 , overall production rose by seven percent over the previous year . nevertheless , they are still far away from the central-european standard of living .
the gross national income in serbia is only about $ 5,500 per capita . the loss of the southern province of kosovo this year was another blow to the serbian economy .
the government , which stepped down as a result of the conflict over the eu 's kosovo policy , can no longer implement their plans to boost the economy .
since nearly all of its important trade partners have recognized the new state , the anti-western attitude in serbia is deterring potential investors . " serbia will experience political turbulence this year , which is why a lot of direct foreign investment ca n't be expected , " said belgrade economist sasa djogovic but the foreign companies that are already in serbia wo n't pull out , added djogovic .

" unfair bank practices bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " free kosova " is n't bringing more coca-cola to serbia after a decade and a half of poverty , serbs are just starting to purchase new furniture and household appliances - but they have to pay a high price to borrow money .
currently , austrian , greek and italian firms dominate the bank sector . " brussels ' tolerance of the business practices of european banks in serbia is unacceptable , " said political scientist dusan janjic . " raiffeisen bank , credit agricole , societe generale and hvb are representatives of europe here , but for the people of serbia they are plunderers .
they charge the highest interest rates in europe and charge double interest via bogus firms in austria , " he said . on the other hands , the banks are reluctant to approve corporate loans .
the most important employers continue to be large state-run companies and the few trade monopolies .
the state is too weak to confront oligarchies and many of the state-run companies , like oil , end up being sold to russian conglomerates at low prices . alternative strategies " you ca n't really expect serbia to be able to export retail products to the european union , " said djogovic . " we 'll continue to send resources to the industrial nations , but we should also import technologies from these countries in order to become more competitive ourselves .
instead we import mass produced goods , " he said . as an alternative , serbia could explore new markets , or return to forgotten markets , like north africa , suggested the economist . filip slavkovic -lrb- kjb -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

victory for either side could have dramatic effects on the islamic republic 's relations with the west . parliamentary elections ended on friday night in iran after 15 hours following the interior ministry 's decision to extend the voting time five times from 6 p.m. to 11 p.m. local time in response to what was proclaimed to be public demand .
the iranian vote pitted the ruling ultra-conservative faction close to president mahmoud ahmadinejad against reformists close to former president mohammad khatami and a conservative faction headed by former chief nuclear negotiator , ali larijani .
with a total of 4,400 candidates running for 290 seats and with votes being cast manually , the first results from the provinces were expected to be announced by saturday noon , while results for the politically important tehran constituency were not expected before monday .
the first to vote was iran 's supreme leader ayatollah ali khamenei who asked the people to determine their political future by going to the polls .
former iranian president akbar hashemi-rafsanjani voted in the morning and called on the people to vote in order to strengthen the legislature 's power .
ahmadinejad 's rivals urge public to vote bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : rafsanjani is a fierce opponent of ahmadinejad " if you do not vote , then those whom you do not want will get into the parliament again , " said the cleric who is a strong opponent of ahmadinejad .
" the new parliament should definitely increase its supervision -lsb- of the government 's performance -rsb- , " rafsanjani added .
president ahmadinejad cut short his state visit to senegal to be in tehran for the elections .
immediately after arrival , he rushed to the lorzadeh mosque in south-eastern tehran to cast his vote .
" billions of eyes -lsb- in the world -rsb- are focused on us to see how we determine our political destiny by ourselves in these elections , " ahmadinejad said . „ many -lsb- islamic -rsb- countries look for a model country -lsb- to follow -rsb- and have chosen iran as their model , " the president added .
the parliamentary elections are widely regarded as a test for ahmadinejad and an assessment of his performance in the 30 months of his presidency .
failure on economic reforms threatens president bildunterschrift : mahmoud ahmadinejad faces a referendum on his 30-month presidency the main concern for voters is the economy as ahmadinejad has failed to realize his economic reforms .
despite drastically increasing oil prices , inflation - ranging between 20 to 30 percent - is higher than before summer 2005 .
meanwhile , interior minister mostafa poumohammadi told press tv that final results would be announced within three or four days , starting first with the smaller provinces and later the big cities .
the votes in the provinces are counted by hand .
in the capital tehran the counting has for the first time been computerized but there will be manual counting as well for reconfirmation .
claims of high turnout go unconfirmed bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : iranians tend to vote enthusiastically in elections in tehran , witnesses reported that a large number of people had gone to the polling stations in the southern part of the capital early on friday , while in northern tehran people usually prefer to vote in the afternoon .
the elections were being held one week before the persian new year -lsb- march 21 -rsb- and many iranians were still busy with new year shopping and preparations , which might have a major impact on the turnout .
the interior ministry called the turnout so far " magnificent " and state media said that at least 60 percent of the electorate had so far voted .
these turnout claims could not be confirmed by neutral observers . dpa news agency -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de opinion -pipe- 14.03.2008 opinion : islam classes a commendable but long-term project großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the teaching of islam is to be added to germany 's school curricula , but interior minister wolfgang schaeuble admits the country 's 16 states as well as the muslim community have yet to agree on the plan 's finer points . it 's hard to imagine saudi arabia 's interior minister inviting representatives from the country 's immigrant christian community to a " christianity conference " to discuss social values and the constitution .
and then , moreover , taking the opportunity to promote better integration of saudi arabia 's christian minority , ignoring public prejudices and protests against the building of new , strange-looking churches in their neighborhoods to emphasize the principle of religious freedom and call for christianity classes in saudi schools . # b # it 's a wholly unlikely scenario .
and not just in saudi arabia , where christian immigrants from asia suffer extreme religious discrimination , but also in more liberal muslim countries such as turkey .
it therefore seems fair to say that the islam conference initiated by the german interior minister 18 months ago could serve as an inspiration to a number of countries , and not just western ones .
the project 's goals are politically highly relevant .
wolfgang schaeuble hopes that improved dialogue between representatives of the state and the muslim community will help advance the integration of germany 's 3 million muslims , which has been neglected for decades .
he is pinning his hopes on recognition of their religion , combined with the belief that the practice of this religion needs to take place within the framework of the german constitution and system of values .
schaeuble should be given due respect for concentrating his contribution to this very difficult dialogue on the basics - and what 's actually possible .
the real problems are tied up with social integration and are the hardest to solve .
teaching islam in german is widely seen as a necessity .
but the various germans states have yet to agree on what form it might take - and so do muslims .
there is still so much that has yet to be agreed on , as becomes apparent again and again .
the process of dialogue kick-started by the islam conference is important .
but this process will require reserves of patience from everyone involved .

but the eu is its most important trade partner and now the balkan country is feeling the crunch , both economically and politically . according to opinion polls , 70 percent of serbians are in favor of their county joining the european union .
but in the last elections , half of them voted for the nationalist euroskeptic parties . one reason is the west 's support of independence for kosovo .
another is the nationalists ' populist stance .
they want to undo the country 's recent democratic transformation and win the attention of those who have n't profited from the economic upswing . " these people are discontent because the democratic government treated them with arrogance in the past seven years and did n't want to hear about the problems of the people in the middle of the country , " said former foreign minister goran svilanovic . " distinctively neo-liberal politics makes them unhappy , but the majority of them do n't oppose the eu , " he said . long way to go bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : most serbs support eu membership in comparison to the last decade of war and economic embargos , serbs are living in much better circumstances today .
in 2007 , overall production rose by seven percent over the previous year . nevertheless , they are still far away from the central-european standard of living .
the gross national income in serbia is only about $ 5,500 per capita . the loss of the southern province of kosovo this year was another blow to the serbian economy .
the government , which stepped down as a result of the conflict over the eu 's kosovo policy , can no longer implement their plans to boost the economy .
since nearly all of its important trade partners have recognized the new state , the anti-western attitude in serbia is deterring potential investors . " serbia will experience political turbulence this year , which is why a lot of direct foreign investment ca n't be expected , " said belgrade economist sasa djogovic but the foreign companies that are already in serbia wo n't pull out , added djogovic . " that 's especially true of the finance sector , " he said .
" for them , serbia 's transformation market is very lucrative due to the high demand for capital . " unfair bank practices bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " free kosova " is n't bringing more coca-cola to serbia after a decade and a half of poverty , serbs are just starting to purchase new furniture and household appliances - but they have to pay a high price to borrow money .
currently , austrian , greek and italian firms dominate the bank sector . " brussels ' tolerance of the business practices of european banks in serbia is unacceptable , " said political scientist dusan janjic . " raiffeisen bank , credit agricole , societe generale and hvb are representatives of europe here , but for the people of serbia they are plunderers .
they charge the highest interest rates in europe and charge double interest via bogus firms in austria , " he said . on the other hands , the banks are reluctant to approve corporate loans .
the most important employers continue to be large state-run companies and the few trade monopolies .
the state is too weak to confront oligarchies and many of the state-run companies , like oil , end up being sold to russian conglomerates at low prices . alternative strategies " you ca n't really expect serbia to be able to export retail products to the european union , " said djogovic .

realistic replicas of weapons can no longer be carried in public , the german government decided , as they can easily be mistaken for the real thing .
the police union said the new law does n't go far enough . for the second time since 2002 , when a student in erfurt killed sixteen people at his former high school , the german government has tightened its weapons law to align with the un firearms protocol .
the plan cleared its final legislative hurdle on friday , march 14 , when it was approved by the upper house of parliament . germany is imposing a ban on carrying realistic-looking imitation firearms in public , as police could mistake them for real weapons in a crisis situation .
the ban mainly applies to so-called softair guns , which function with pressurized gas and are often modeled on real-life counterparts . the head of the german police union -lrb- gdp -rrb- konrad freiberg criticized the law as insufficient .
it 's a scandal that the german government has excluded a nation-wide weapons registry from its reforms , he said . inherited guns must be disabled bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : realistic weapons are allowed at historical festivals under the law , people can still sell , purchase and possess replica firearms , but they must be transported in a closed container .
switchblades and knives with a blade longer than 12 centimeters -lrb- 4.7 inches -rrb- may also not be carried in public . violators face fines of up to 10,000 euros -lrb- $ 15,600 -rrb- .
exceptions , however , will be made for historical re-enactments . toy weapons that can not be mistaken for real guns are not affected by the law . furthermore , the new weapons law places restrictions on firearms inherited as of april 1 , 2008 .
if the heir can not prove a personal need for the weapon - for example , if he or she is a hunter or a member of a shooting club - it may only be kept if it 's been disabled . dw staff -lrb- kjb -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de politics -pipe- 14.03.2008 five years on , welfare reforms still divide germany 's spd großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : more people have jobs but the verdict is out on whether the reforms cleaned up the economy five years ago , former chancellor schroeder initiated a series of social and labor reforms that divided his party and cost him the chancellery .
his agenda 2010 is still splitting german politics as the spd loses ground . the liberal market reforms gerhard schroeder announced on march 14 , 2003 led to talk of social inequality in germany and the emergence of a new underclass .
nevertheless , unemployment is now down and economic growth is up . while center-left members of his social democratic party praised the measures this week , the spd 's far-left wing , the left party and the labor unions had harsh words for the agenda 2010 . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : schroeder still stand by his agenda 2010 spd party leader kurt beck said thursday in a speech marking the anniversary of the reforms that schroeder 's address five years ago had signalled " the start of major successes in the areas of economy and the labor market . " " now we have to work towards bringing the agenda 's successes to all the people , " said beck , whose popularity is at an all-time low , according to several recent surveys . foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier said there had been no alternative to the far-reaching reforms made to the social and labor systems over the past five years . " we had to choose this policy , knowing that it could lead to pain and loss , " he said . reaganomics from the left the agenda 2010 , which has been compared to reaganomics in the us and thatcherism in britain , aimed to improve economic growth and reduce unemployment by slashing not only income tax but also unemployment benefits and pensions . the move met with approval from the conservative christian democratic and the liberal , free-market free democratic party , but immediately drew resistance from schroeder 's own social democrats .
he 'd been elected in 2002 promising not to cut social benefits . thousands of the spd 's center-left members abandoned the party as a result , though the far-left stayed on , shifting the party 's core .
due to inner-party pressure , schroeder resigned as party chair in february 2004 .
he remained chancellor , however , until 2005 when he was forced to acknowledge defeat and call for early elections , paving the way for christian democratic chancellor angela merkel . schroeder 's massive cuts , particularly to unemployment benefits , led to talk of deepening economic inequality and the emergence of a new underclass . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : cuts to unemployment benefits spurred mass protests the discourse was fuelled when the friedrich ebert foundation , a political foundation closely associated with the spd , published a study in late 2006 indicating that four percent of people in western germany and 20 percent in eastern germany were living in " precarious " economic conditions and felt " left behind " by politicians and society . nevertheless , unemployment sank from 10.6 percent in 2005 - the highest it had been since german reunification - to 8.3 percent in 2007 . schroeder warns against leftward lean former chancellor schroeder on thursday defended his agenda 2010 as being " good and right . "
referring to the fundamental shift to the left that his party has taken , in part due to the controversy surrounding the reforms , he added that " the spd can only achieve a majority if it 's anchored in the middle of society and does n't abandon this position . " franz-juergen weise , chairman of the federal employment office , said in an interview with the friday edition of the leipziger zeitung that the structural reorganization of his agency has resulted in " 18 million euros -lrb- $ 27.75 million -rrb- in savings , solid financing for unemployment insurance -lsb- and -rsb- lower premiums .

his agenda 2010 is still splitting german politics as the spd loses ground . the liberal market reforms gerhard schroeder announced on march 14 , 2003 led to talk of social inequality in germany and the emergence of a new underclass .
nevertheless , unemployment is now down and economic growth is up . while center-left members of his social democratic party praised the measures this week , the spd 's far-left wing , the left party and the labor unions had harsh words for the agenda 2010 . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : schroeder still stand by his agenda 2010 spd party leader kurt beck said thursday in a speech marking the anniversary of the reforms that schroeder 's address five years ago had signalled " the start of major successes in the areas of economy and the labor market . " " now we have to work towards bringing the agenda 's successes to all the people , " said beck , whose popularity is at an all-time low , according to several recent surveys . foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier said there had been no alternative to the far-reaching reforms made to the social and labor systems over the past five years . " we had to choose this policy , knowing that it could lead to pain and loss , " he said . reaganomics from the left the agenda 2010 , which has been compared to reaganomics in the us and thatcherism in britain , aimed to improve economic growth and reduce unemployment by slashing not only income tax but also unemployment benefits and pensions . the move met with approval from the conservative christian democratic and the liberal , free-market free democratic party , but immediately drew resistance from schroeder 's own social democrats .
he 'd been elected in 2002 promising not to cut social benefits . thousands of the spd 's center-left members abandoned the party as a result , though the far-left stayed on , shifting the party 's core .
due to inner-party pressure , schroeder resigned as party chair in february 2004 .
he remained chancellor , however , until 2005 when he was forced to acknowledge defeat and call for early elections , paving the way for christian democratic chancellor angela merkel . schroeder 's massive cuts , particularly to unemployment benefits , led to talk of deepening economic inequality and the emergence of a new underclass . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : cuts to unemployment benefits spurred mass protests the discourse was fuelled when the friedrich ebert foundation , a political foundation closely associated with the spd , published a study in late 2006 indicating that four percent of people in western germany and 20 percent in eastern germany were living in " precarious " economic conditions and felt " left behind " by politicians and society . nevertheless , unemployment sank from 10.6 percent in 2005 - the highest it had been since german reunification - to 8.3 percent in 2007 . schroeder warns against leftward lean former chancellor schroeder on thursday defended his agenda 2010 as being " good and right . "
referring to the fundamental shift to the left that his party has taken , in part due to the controversy surrounding the reforms , he added that " the spd can only achieve a majority if it 's anchored in the middle of society and does n't abandon this position . " franz-juergen weise , chairman of the federal employment office , said in an interview with the friday edition of the leipziger zeitung that the structural reorganization of his agency has resulted in " 18 million euros -lrb- $ 27.75 million -rrb- in savings , solid financing for unemployment insurance -lsb- and -rsb- lower premiums . " in contrast , michael sommer , the head of the federation of german trade unions , commented that the agenda 2010 had widened the economic gap in german society . critique from spd 's biggest rival bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the left party has benefitted from the spd 's popularity drop the bulk of the criticism , however , came from the left .

" it would have been unthinkable for the summit would have remained silent on this , " sarkozy concluded . global financial markets have been gripped with extreme volatility amid concerns that tight credit conditions are threatening some finance houses and record-breaking runs for the euro , oil and gold . commission chief vows ecb will take action bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : barroso attempted to quell fears over financial instability as fears grew of a recession in the us economy and the knock-on effects on the world 's nerve-wracked financial markets , european commission chief jose manuel barroso tried to instill calm by telling the summit that the european central bank -lrb- ecb -rrb- would take control of the situation should it be required to . " the ecb will do what is necessary to secure financial stability , " barroso said . the eu leaders also broached the subject of action in the fight against climate change during the two-day summit and at the end agreed to wrap up negotiations on ambitious targets to cut energy use and fight global warming by the end of the year . " we committed ourselves to finishing negotiating on this package by the end of this year and by doing this we made a huge step forward , " said slovenian prime minister janez jansa , whose country holds the european union 's rotating presidency .
" we are convinced that the costs of these measures will be much lower than if we do n't act .

eu member states have committed to go to 30 percent if other countries match them . in the upcoming negotiations on the details of meeting those goals , jansa said : " we need to take into account the different positions of the member states and their needs for economic growth . " in another green move , the eu leaders agreed to support the development of environmentally-friendly products by reducing the level of vat on them . the proposal , first made by british prime minister gordon brown , " will start the debate in many member states about how and whether household goods ... can incentivize consumer behavior towards buying energy-efficient and environmentally friendly goods and services , " brown said . environmental vat on eu agenda bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : brown 's " green tax " idea made a cautious appearance under the decision , the eu 's executive body , the european commission , is tasked with " reflecting " on " the best way to support the development of clean products by evoking the question of environmental vat , " sarkozy said . but the proposal is unlikely to lead to concrete measures soon .
vat is a sensitive issue , since much of the eu 's common budget comes from the vat which consumers pay in each member state , and any decisions on changing rates have to be approved unanimously . " people are being persuaded by the argument that we should look at this very carefully , " brown said .
" vat is a uniquely european tax . ...

" the barcelona process is the name of the eu 's 13-year-old policy which deals with the bloc 's southern neighbors and which many critics say has so far failed to deliver . the original " club med , " as first conceived a year ago by french president nicolas sarkozy , envisaged uniting israelis and syrians , turks and spaniards , italians and libyans , and making them work together on such diverse issues as migration , the environment or the fight against terrorism . but the latest draft of the proposal , brokered by germany earlier this week and submitted to leaders over dinner on thursday , includes all of the eu 's member states and vaguely talks about " projects with an accent on regional cooperation .

" it would have been unthinkable for the summit would have remained silent on this , " sarkozy concluded . global financial markets have been gripped with extreme volatility amid concerns that tight credit conditions are threatening some finance houses and record-breaking runs for the euro , oil and gold . commission chief vows ecb will take action bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : barroso attempted to quell fears over financial instability as fears grew of a recession in the us economy and the knock-on effects on the world 's nerve-wracked financial markets , european commission chief jose manuel barroso tried to instill calm by telling the summit that the european central bank -lrb- ecb -rrb- would take control of the situation should it be required to . " the ecb will do what is necessary to secure financial stability , " barroso said . the eu leaders also broached the subject of action in the fight against climate change during the two-day summit and at the end agreed to wrap up negotiations on ambitious targets to cut energy use and fight global warming by the end of the year . " we committed ourselves to finishing negotiating on this package by the end of this year and by doing this we made a huge step forward , " said slovenian prime minister janez jansa , whose country holds the european union 's rotating presidency .
" we are convinced that the costs of these measures will be much lower than if we do n't act . " eu targets year-end for climate package agreement bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the eu is under pressure to deliver on its climate promises the current plan aims to meet the european union 's over-arching goal to reduce emissions of carbon dioxide - the main gas responsible for global warming - by 20 percent by 2020 , compared to 1990 levels .
eu member states have committed to go to 30 percent if other countries match them . in the upcoming negotiations on the details of meeting those goals , jansa said : " we need to take into account the different positions of the member states and their needs for economic growth . " in another green move , the eu leaders agreed to support the development of environmentally-friendly products by reducing the level of vat on them . the proposal , first made by british prime minister gordon brown , " will start the debate in many member states about how and whether household goods ... can incentivize consumer behavior towards buying energy-efficient and environmentally friendly goods and services , " brown said . environmental vat on eu agenda bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : brown 's " green tax " idea made a cautious appearance under the decision , the eu 's executive body , the european commission , is tasked with " reflecting " on " the best way to support the development of clean products by evoking the question of environmental vat , " sarkozy said . but the proposal is unlikely to lead to concrete measures soon .
vat is a sensitive issue , since much of the eu 's common budget comes from the vat which consumers pay in each member state , and any decisions on changing rates have to be approved unanimously . " people are being persuaded by the argument that we should look at this very carefully , " brown said .
" vat is a uniquely european tax . ...
we made substantial progress in only two days and i believe that over the next few months other countries will join the debate . " despite the support of britain and france - two of the eu 's three largest states - some member states oppose the proposal and could well block it . eu backs club med plan under new name bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : sarkozy 's club med plan will go to a summit in paris the eu also formally backed ambitious french plans for a union for the mediterranean , but watered it down to such an extent that it had to be given a new name . according to a last-minute addition to the draft conclusions of their regular spring council in brussels , the new organization is to be called " barcelona process : union for the mediterranean . " the barcelona process is the name of the eu 's 13-year-old policy which deals with the bloc 's southern neighbors and which many critics say has so far failed to deliver . the original " club med , " as first conceived a year ago by french president nicolas sarkozy , envisaged uniting israelis and syrians , turks and spaniards , italians and libyans , and making them work together on such diverse issues as migration , the environment or the fight against terrorism . but the latest draft of the proposal , brokered by germany earlier this week and submitted to leaders over dinner on thursday , includes all of the eu 's member states and vaguely talks about " projects with an accent on regional cooperation . " concerns over eu funds the downsizing came after eu countries with no borders on the mediterranean expressed skepticism at the proposal , with member states from eastern europe particularly concerned that it would divert precious eu funds away from their region . in friday 's draft conclusions , the european commission , " is invited to present to the council of eu leaders the necessary proposals for defining the modalities of what will be called ' barcelona process : union for the mediterranean " ' in view of a special summit to be convened in paris on july 13 . sarkozy nevertheless welcomed the compromise , pointing out that the new organization will for the first time give a strong voice to middle eastern and north african leaders in the way money in the region is spent . he noted that the new political structure will be co-chaired by an eu member and a non-eu member .
" europe will not turn its back on the mediterranean any more , " sarkozy said late thursday . chinese clampdown on tibet causes eu concern bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : reports suggest a chinese crackdown in lhasa , tibet the eu also took the opportunity provided by the summit to express concern about the violent protests taking place in tibet , with germany and britain among those calling for dialogue and restraint . german foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier called for an end to the conflict by peaceful means while his british counterpart david miliband said european governments would be seeking " clarification about what is actually happening on the ground , " adding that " restraint " and " substantive dialogue " were the only way forward . reports coming out of lhasa , the capital of china 's tibet autonomous region , suggest paramilitary riot police intervened to control protests initiated by buddhist monks on the 49th anniversary of a tibetan uprising against chinese rule that was crushed by troops . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

victory for either side could have dramatic effects on the islamic republic 's relations with the west . parliamentary elections ended on friday night in iran after 15 hours following the interior ministry 's decision to extend the voting time five times from 6 p.m. to 11 p.m. local time in response to what was proclaimed to be public demand .
the iranian vote pitted the ruling ultra-conservative faction close to president mahmoud ahmadinejad against reformists close to former president mohammad khatami and a conservative faction headed by former chief nuclear negotiator , ali larijani .
with a total of 4,400 candidates running for 290 seats and with votes being cast manually , the first results from the provinces were expected to be announced by saturday noon , while results for the politically important tehran constituency were not expected before monday .
the first to vote was iran 's supreme leader ayatollah ali khamenei who asked the people to determine their political future by going to the polls .
former iranian president akbar hashemi-rafsanjani voted in the morning and called on the people to vote in order to strengthen the legislature 's power .
ahmadinejad 's rivals urge public to vote bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : rafsanjani is a fierce opponent of ahmadinejad " if you do not vote , then those whom you do not want will get into the parliament again , " said the cleric who is a strong opponent of ahmadinejad .
" the new parliament should definitely increase its supervision -lsb- of the government 's performance -rsb- , " rafsanjani added .
president ahmadinejad cut short his state visit to senegal to be in tehran for the elections .
immediately after arrival , he rushed to the lorzadeh mosque in south-eastern tehran to cast his vote .
" billions of eyes -lsb- in the world -rsb- are focused on us to see how we determine our political destiny by ourselves in these elections , " ahmadinejad said . „ many -lsb- islamic -rsb- countries look for a model country -lsb- to follow -rsb- and have chosen iran as their model , " the president added .
the parliamentary elections are widely regarded as a test for ahmadinejad and an assessment of his performance in the 30 months of his presidency .
failure on economic reforms threatens president bildunterschrift : mahmoud ahmadinejad faces a referendum on his 30-month presidency the main concern for voters is the economy as ahmadinejad has failed to realize his economic reforms .
despite drastically increasing oil prices , inflation - ranging between 20 to 30 percent - is higher than before summer 2005 .
meanwhile , interior minister mostafa poumohammadi told press tv that final results would be announced within three or four days , starting first with the smaller provinces and later the big cities .
the votes in the provinces are counted by hand .
in the capital tehran the counting has for the first time been computerized but there will be manual counting as well for reconfirmation .
claims of high turnout go unconfirmed bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : iranians tend to vote enthusiastically in elections in tehran , witnesses reported that a large number of people had gone to the polling stations in the southern part of the capital early on friday , while in northern tehran people usually prefer to vote in the afternoon .
the elections were being held one week before the persian new year -lsb- march 21 -rsb- and many iranians were still busy with new year shopping and preparations , which might have a major impact on the turnout .
the interior ministry called the turnout so far " magnificent " and state media said that at least 60 percent of the electorate had so far voted .
these turnout claims could not be confirmed by neutral observers . dpa news agency -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de politics -pipe- 14.03.2008 five years on , welfare reforms still divide germany 's spd großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : more people have jobs but the verdict is out on whether the reforms cleaned up the economy five years ago , former chancellor schroeder initiated a series of social and labor reforms that divided his party and cost him the chancellery .
his agenda 2010 is still splitting german politics as the spd loses ground . the liberal market reforms gerhard schroeder announced on march 14 , 2003 led to talk of social inequality in germany and the emergence of a new underclass .
nevertheless , unemployment is now down and economic growth is up . while center-left members of his social democratic party praised the measures this week , the spd 's far-left wing , the left party and the labor unions had harsh words for the agenda 2010 . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : schroeder still stand by his agenda 2010 spd party leader kurt beck said thursday in a speech marking the anniversary of the reforms that schroeder 's address five years ago had signalled " the start of major successes in the areas of economy and the labor market . " " now we have to work towards bringing the agenda 's successes to all the people , " said beck , whose popularity is at an all-time low , according to several recent surveys . foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier said there had been no alternative to the far-reaching reforms made to the social and labor systems over the past five years . " we had to choose this policy , knowing that it could lead to pain and loss , " he said . reaganomics from the left the agenda 2010 , which has been compared to reaganomics in the us and thatcherism in britain , aimed to improve economic growth and reduce unemployment by slashing not only income tax but also unemployment benefits and pensions . the move met with approval from the conservative christian democratic and the liberal , free-market free democratic party , but immediately drew resistance from schroeder 's own social democrats .
he 'd been elected in 2002 promising not to cut social benefits . thousands of the spd 's center-left members abandoned the party as a result , though the far-left stayed on , shifting the party 's core .
due to inner-party pressure , schroeder resigned as party chair in february 2004 .
he remained chancellor , however , until 2005 when he was forced to acknowledge defeat and call for early elections , paving the way for christian democratic chancellor angela merkel . schroeder 's massive cuts , particularly to unemployment benefits , led to talk of deepening economic inequality and the emergence of a new underclass . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : cuts to unemployment benefits spurred mass protests the discourse was fuelled when the friedrich ebert foundation , a political foundation closely associated with the spd , published a study in late 2006 indicating that four percent of people in western germany and 20 percent in eastern germany were living in " precarious " economic conditions and felt " left behind " by politicians and society . nevertheless , unemployment sank from 10.6 percent in 2005 - the highest it had been since german reunification - to 8.3 percent in 2007 . schroeder warns against leftward lean former chancellor schroeder on thursday defended his agenda 2010 as being " good and right . "

his agenda 2010 is still splitting german politics as the spd loses ground . the liberal market reforms gerhard schroeder announced on march 14 , 2003 led to talk of social inequality in germany and the emergence of a new underclass .
nevertheless , unemployment is now down and economic growth is up . while center-left members of his social democratic party praised the measures this week , the spd 's far-left wing , the left party and the labor unions had harsh words for the agenda 2010 . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : schroeder still stand by his agenda 2010 spd party leader kurt beck said thursday in a speech marking the anniversary of the reforms that schroeder 's address five years ago had signalled " the start of major successes in the areas of economy and the labor market . " " now we have to work towards bringing the agenda 's successes to all the people , " said beck , whose popularity is at an all-time low , according to several recent surveys . foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier said there had been no alternative to the far-reaching reforms made to the social and labor systems over the past five years . " we had to choose this policy , knowing that it could lead to pain and loss , " he said . reaganomics from the left the agenda 2010 , which has been compared to reaganomics in the us and thatcherism in britain , aimed to improve economic growth and reduce unemployment by slashing not only income tax but also unemployment benefits and pensions . the move met with approval from the conservative christian democratic and the liberal , free-market free democratic party , but immediately drew resistance from schroeder 's own social democrats .
he 'd been elected in 2002 promising not to cut social benefits . thousands of the spd 's center-left members abandoned the party as a result , though the far-left stayed on , shifting the party 's core .
due to inner-party pressure , schroeder resigned as party chair in february 2004 .
he remained chancellor , however , until 2005 when he was forced to acknowledge defeat and call for early elections , paving the way for christian democratic chancellor angela merkel . schroeder 's massive cuts , particularly to unemployment benefits , led to talk of deepening economic inequality and the emergence of a new underclass . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : cuts to unemployment benefits spurred mass protests the discourse was fuelled when the friedrich ebert foundation , a political foundation closely associated with the spd , published a study in late 2006 indicating that four percent of people in western germany and 20 percent in eastern germany were living in " precarious " economic conditions and felt " left behind " by politicians and society . nevertheless , unemployment sank from 10.6 percent in 2005 - the highest it had been since german reunification - to 8.3 percent in 2007 . schroeder warns against leftward lean former chancellor schroeder on thursday defended his agenda 2010 as being " good and right . "
referring to the fundamental shift to the left that his party has taken , in part due to the controversy surrounding the reforms , he added that " the spd can only achieve a majority if it 's anchored in the middle of society and does n't abandon this position . " franz-juergen weise , chairman of the federal employment office , said in an interview with the friday edition of the leipziger zeitung that the structural reorganization of his agency has resulted in " 18 million euros -lrb- $ 27.75 million -rrb- in savings , solid financing for unemployment insurance -lsb- and -rsb- lower premiums .

victory for either side could have dramatic effects on the islamic republic 's relations with the west . parliamentary elections ended on friday night in iran after 15 hours following the interior ministry 's decision to extend the voting time five times from 6 p.m. to 11 p.m. local time in response to what was proclaimed to be public demand .
the iranian vote pitted the ruling ultra-conservative faction close to president mahmoud ahmadinejad against reformists close to former president mohammad khatami and a conservative faction headed by former chief nuclear negotiator , ali larijani .
with a total of 4,400 candidates running for 290 seats and with votes being cast manually , the first results from the provinces were expected to be announced by saturday noon , while results for the politically important tehran constituency were not expected before monday .
the first to vote was iran 's supreme leader ayatollah ali khamenei who asked the people to determine their political future by going to the polls .
former iranian president akbar hashemi-rafsanjani voted in the morning and called on the people to vote in order to strengthen the legislature 's power .
ahmadinejad 's rivals urge public to vote bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : rafsanjani is a fierce opponent of ahmadinejad " if you do not vote , then those whom you do not want will get into the parliament again , " said the cleric who is a strong opponent of ahmadinejad .
" the new parliament should definitely increase its supervision -lsb- of the government 's performance -rsb- , " rafsanjani added .
president ahmadinejad cut short his state visit to senegal to be in tehran for the elections .
immediately after arrival , he rushed to the lorzadeh mosque in south-eastern tehran to cast his vote .
" billions of eyes -lsb- in the world -rsb- are focused on us to see how we determine our political destiny by ourselves in these elections , " ahmadinejad said . „ many -lsb- islamic -rsb- countries look for a model country -lsb- to follow -rsb- and have chosen iran as their model , " the president added .
the parliamentary elections are widely regarded as a test for ahmadinejad and an assessment of his performance in the 30 months of his presidency .
failure on economic reforms threatens president bildunterschrift : mahmoud ahmadinejad faces a referendum on his 30-month presidency the main concern for voters is the economy as ahmadinejad has failed to realize his economic reforms .
despite drastically increasing oil prices , inflation - ranging between 20 to 30 percent - is higher than before summer 2005 .
meanwhile , interior minister mostafa poumohammadi told press tv that final results would be announced within three or four days , starting first with the smaller provinces and later the big cities .
the votes in the provinces are counted by hand .
in the capital tehran the counting has for the first time been computerized but there will be manual counting as well for reconfirmation .
claims of high turnout go unconfirmed bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : iranians tend to vote enthusiastically in elections in tehran , witnesses reported that a large number of people had gone to the polling stations in the southern part of the capital early on friday , while in northern tehran people usually prefer to vote in the afternoon .
the elections were being held one week before the persian new year -lsb- march 21 -rsb- and many iranians were still busy with new year shopping and preparations , which might have a major impact on the turnout .
the interior ministry called the turnout so far " magnificent " and state media said that at least 60 percent of the electorate had so far voted .
these turnout claims could not be confirmed by neutral observers . dpa news agency -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

realistic replicas of weapons can no longer be carried in public , the german government decided , as they can easily be mistaken for the real thing .
the police union said the new law does n't go far enough . for the second time since 2002 , when a student in erfurt killed sixteen people at his former high school , the german government has tightened its weapons law to align with the un firearms protocol .
the plan cleared its final legislative hurdle on friday , march 14 , when it was approved by the upper house of parliament . germany is imposing a ban on carrying realistic-looking imitation firearms in public , as police could mistake them for real weapons in a crisis situation .
the ban mainly applies to so-called softair guns , which function with pressurized gas and are often modeled on real-life counterparts . the head of the german police union -lrb- gdp -rrb- konrad freiberg criticized the law as insufficient .
it 's a scandal that the german government has excluded a nation-wide weapons registry from its reforms , he said . inherited guns must be disabled bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : realistic weapons are allowed at historical festivals under the law , people can still sell , purchase and possess replica firearms , but they must be transported in a closed container .
switchblades and knives with a blade longer than 12 centimeters -lrb- 4.7 inches -rrb- may also not be carried in public . violators face fines of up to 10,000 euros -lrb- $ 15,600 -rrb- .
exceptions , however , will be made for historical re-enactments . toy weapons that can not be mistaken for real guns are not affected by the law . furthermore , the new weapons law places restrictions on firearms inherited as of april 1 , 2008 .
if the heir can not prove a personal need for the weapon - for example , if he or she is a hunter or a member of a shooting club - it may only be kept if it 's been disabled . dw staff -lrb- kjb -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the first to vote was iran 's supreme leader ayatollah ali khamenei who asked the people to determine their political future by going to the polls .

the elections were being held one week before the persian new year -lsb- march 21 -rsb- and many iranians were still busy with new year shopping and preparations , which might have a major impact on the turnout .

" it would have been unthinkable for the summit would have remained silent on this , " sarkozy concluded . global financial markets have been gripped with extreme volatility amid concerns that tight credit conditions are threatening some finance houses and record-breaking runs for the euro , oil and gold . commission chief vows ecb will take action bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : barroso attempted to quell fears over financial instability as fears grew of a recession in the us economy and the knock-on effects on the world 's nerve-wracked financial markets , european commission chief jose manuel barroso tried to instill calm by telling the summit that the european central bank -lrb- ecb -rrb- would take control of the situation should it be required to . " the ecb will do what is necessary to secure financial stability , " barroso said . the eu leaders also broached the subject of action in the fight against climate change during the two-day summit and at the end agreed to wrap up negotiations on ambitious targets to cut energy use and fight global warming by the end of the year . " we committed ourselves to finishing negotiating on this package by the end of this year and by doing this we made a huge step forward , " said slovenian prime minister janez jansa , whose country holds the european union 's rotating presidency .
" we are convinced that the costs of these measures will be much lower than if we do n't act . " eu targets year-end for climate package agreement bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the eu is under pressure to deliver on its climate promises the current plan aims to meet the european union 's over-arching goal to reduce emissions of carbon dioxide - the main gas responsible for global warming - by 20 percent by 2020 , compared to 1990 levels .
eu member states have committed to go to 30 percent if other countries match them . in the upcoming negotiations on the details of meeting those goals , jansa said : " we need to take into account the different positions of the member states and their needs for economic growth . " in another green move , the eu leaders agreed to support the development of environmentally-friendly products by reducing the level of vat on them . the proposal , first made by british prime minister gordon brown , " will start the debate in many member states about how and whether household goods ... can incentivize consumer behavior towards buying energy-efficient and environmentally friendly goods and services , " brown said . environmental vat on eu agenda bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : brown 's " green tax " idea made a cautious appearance under the decision , the eu 's executive body , the european commission , is tasked with " reflecting " on " the best way to support the development of clean products by evoking the question of environmental vat , " sarkozy said . but the proposal is unlikely to lead to concrete measures soon .
vat is a sensitive issue , since much of the eu 's common budget comes from the vat which consumers pay in each member state , and any decisions on changing rates have to be approved unanimously . " people are being persuaded by the argument that we should look at this very carefully , " brown said .
" vat is a uniquely european tax . ...
we made substantial progress in only two days and i believe that over the next few months other countries will join the debate . " despite the support of britain and france - two of the eu 's three largest states - some member states oppose the proposal and could well block it . eu backs club med plan under new name bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : sarkozy 's club med plan will go to a summit in paris the eu also formally backed ambitious french plans for a union for the mediterranean , but watered it down to such an extent that it had to be given a new name . according to a last-minute addition to the draft conclusions of their regular spring council in brussels , the new organization is to be called " barcelona process : union for the mediterranean . " the barcelona process is the name of the eu 's 13-year-old policy which deals with the bloc 's southern neighbors and which many critics say has so far failed to deliver . the original " club med , " as first conceived a year ago by french president nicolas sarkozy , envisaged uniting israelis and syrians , turks and spaniards , italians and libyans , and making them work together on such diverse issues as migration , the environment or the fight against terrorism . but the latest draft of the proposal , brokered by germany earlier this week and submitted to leaders over dinner on thursday , includes all of the eu 's member states and vaguely talks about " projects with an accent on regional cooperation . " concerns over eu funds the downsizing came after eu countries with no borders on the mediterranean expressed skepticism at the proposal , with member states from eastern europe particularly concerned that it would divert precious eu funds away from their region . in friday 's draft conclusions , the european commission , " is invited to present to the council of eu leaders the necessary proposals for defining the modalities of what will be called ' barcelona process : union for the mediterranean " ' in view of a special summit to be convened in paris on july 13 . sarkozy nevertheless welcomed the compromise , pointing out that the new organization will for the first time give a strong voice to middle eastern and north african leaders in the way money in the region is spent . he noted that the new political structure will be co-chaired by an eu member and a non-eu member .
" europe will not turn its back on the mediterranean any more , " sarkozy said late thursday . chinese clampdown on tibet causes eu concern bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : reports suggest a chinese crackdown in lhasa , tibet the eu also took the opportunity provided by the summit to express concern about the violent protests taking place in tibet , with germany and britain among those calling for dialogue and restraint . german foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier called for an end to the conflict by peaceful means while his british counterpart david miliband said european governments would be seeking " clarification about what is actually happening on the ground , " adding that " restraint " and " substantive dialogue " were the only way forward . reports coming out of lhasa , the capital of china 's tibet autonomous region , suggest paramilitary riot police intervened to control protests initiated by buddhist monks on the 49th anniversary of a tibetan uprising against chinese rule that was crushed by troops . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de culture -pipe- 14.03.2008 marx continues to influence 125 years after his death großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : many of karl marx 's theories on politics , society and economics still ring true today friday , march 14 , marks the 125th anniversary of the death of german philosopher and political economist karl marx .
marx is still regarded as hugely influential to the development of 20th century thought . both a scholar and a political activist , marx addressed a wide range of political as well as social issues , and is known for , among other things , his analysis of history .
the interpretations of his theories , particularly those on political economy , have in the course of history generated decades of debate , inspired revolutions and cast him as both devil and deity in political and academic circles . maligned by some , misunderstood by others and celebrated as one of the world 's great thinkers by many more , marx continues to be a divisive and much discussed individual .
while there has been a substantial revival of interest in his theories since the end of the cold war , mainly those which deal with the volatility and shape of capitalism , the question remains as to whether a man who died 125 years ago still has any relevance today . ian hunt , the director of the center for applied philosophy at the flinders university of southern australia , believes that marx and his insights into the capitalist system in particular still have a place in contemporary society . " marx 's thoughts on the exploitative nature of the relationship between capitalist employers and their employees ring true today , " he said .
" the proletariat , or those without property , continues to seek employment from those with property .
control over private investment continues to give the capitalist class decisive influence over government and sufficient control over the supply of labor to ensure that it is sold by employees on terms favorable to the increase of the wealth of employers . " hunt said he believes that marx 's theories on the exploitative nature of the capitalist employment relationship - which skews industrial development toward using up human and natural resources for short-term gain - apply today in the form of climate and energy issues and " the problem of the despotic form of the employer-employee relationship under capitalism . " marx foresaw impact of private dominance bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : marx wrote about the factors which influenced climate change " marx 's analysis of the foundations of a capitalist society raises questions of the justice of the distribution of wealth , and therefore also of income , in capitalist societies , which are even more acute in the modern world than in his own time , " hunt added .
" it also raises questions about the environmental consequences of private dominance of investment that are even more acute today than in the time marx wrote . " simon tormey , the co-director of the center for the study of social and global justice -lrb- cssgj -rrb- at nottingham university , also believes marx was ahead of his time . " the world is pretty much how marx described it 150 years ago , which is quite impressive in itself , " tormey said . " this is to say that we now have a more or less integrated world capitalist system , with a global rich and global poor - as marx predicted .
there is huge exploitation across all societies - the proliferation of sweatshops and export processing zones are all very much in keeping with marx ’ s account . " the peasantry is being systematically wiped out in a global process of dispossession , and of course social democracy , which started as a form of ultra moderate ' marxism , ' marxism-lite if you like , is in retreat in all areas where it once enjoyed hegemony , ” he added . tormey also explained that marx 's theory of class struggle is hugely prevalent in today 's current economic atmosphere . violent class struggle continues off media radar bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : class struggle is evident in often violent industrial action " there are workers there who have been denied trade union representation , who have been denied holiday pay , health care , and other benefits , " he said . " go into any business and you will see owners and workers - the owners can not do without the workers and they want to pay them as little as they can for the most amount of product / output ; the workers want the most they can get . this is class struggle . " the bosses have the laws on their side , the politicians , the state , and the media , " he added . " they are able to contain struggle so that it does n't disrupt society - for the most part . however , beyond the wealthy countries , the picture is very different .
open and violent struggles are commonplace in much of the world ; strikes , lockouts , and beatings of workers in places like china , indonesia , mexico , south africa , and violent peasant conflicts in places like nandigram , india .
look around : class struggle is everywhere and infects almost every human relation . " as well as economics and politics , marx had a great influence on the way people thought about culture .
while not considered to be a pure cultural theorist , marx 's writings on issues such as aesthetics , communication and interpretation contributed in part to a growing cultural studies movement . modern cultural theorists following marx 's ideas " marx 's influence on today 's cultural theorizing derives more from his social theory , which forms a useful context to theorizing culture , and his philosophical ideas in general , including his method of investigation and reasoning , " said johan fornas , director of the advanced cultural studies institute of sweden -lrb- acsis -rrb- .
" he developed some german and hegelian ideas in an exciting and inspiring direction that are still highly relevant for those of us who are engaged in developing cultural theory . " marx has inspired lots of recent thinkers to never cut theoretical concepts loose from experiences of everyday life and instead to understand the importance of situating knowledge in concrete material , embodied and socially organized practices , always interacting with institutionalized networks of power , " he added . despite the continued relevance of a number of marx 's theories , experts are quick to point out that some have little significance in today 's environment while others have been shown to be way off the mark in some cases . prediction of communist world proved wrong bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : even china has diluted its communism in recent times " marx was convinced that communism would replace capitalism but we don ’ t really see much of a communist movement emerging anywhere today , " tormey said . " so the irony might be that at the moment when marx 's ideas are even more relevant , so the attractiveness of marxism -lrb- or more accurately communism -rrb- as a mobilizing ideology seems in decline .
but this of course can change . " marx 's faith in the generation of informed political opposition from worsening material conditions failed to be realized , but that has not made his work irrelevant , hunt said . " his primary work , ' das kapital , ' still stands out as a wonderfully structured and thought through piece of analysis , drawing on the philosophical and economic thought of his time , " he said .
" its condemnation of the specific injustice of the capitalist system has few peers .
so , as long as there are capitalists , marx will remain relevant . " nick amies send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

marx is still regarded as hugely influential to the development of 20th century thought . both a scholar and a political activist , marx addressed a wide range of political as well as social issues , and is known for , among other things , his analysis of history .
the interpretations of his theories , particularly those on political economy , have in the course of history generated decades of debate , inspired revolutions and cast him as both devil and deity in political and academic circles . maligned by some , misunderstood by others and celebrated as one of the world 's great thinkers by many more , marx continues to be a divisive and much discussed individual .
while there has been a substantial revival of interest in his theories since the end of the cold war , mainly those which deal with the volatility and shape of capitalism , the question remains as to whether a man who died 125 years ago still has any relevance today . ian hunt , the director of the center for applied philosophy at the flinders university of southern australia , believes that marx and his insights into the capitalist system in particular still have a place in contemporary society . " marx 's thoughts on the exploitative nature of the relationship between capitalist employers and their employees ring true today , " he said .
" the proletariat , or those without property , continues to seek employment from those with property .
control over private investment continues to give the capitalist class decisive influence over government and sufficient control over the supply of labor to ensure that it is sold by employees on terms favorable to the increase of the wealth of employers . " hunt said he believes that marx 's theories on the exploitative nature of the capitalist employment relationship - which skews industrial development toward using up human and natural resources for short-term gain - apply today in the form of climate and energy issues and " the problem of the despotic form of the employer-employee relationship under capitalism . " marx foresaw impact of private dominance bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : marx wrote about the factors which influenced climate change " marx 's analysis of the foundations of a capitalist society raises questions of the justice of the distribution of wealth , and therefore also of income , in capitalist societies , which are even more acute in the modern world than in his own time , " hunt added .
" it also raises questions about the environmental consequences of private dominance of investment that are even more acute today than in the time marx wrote . " simon tormey , the co-director of the center for the study of social and global justice -lrb- cssgj -rrb- at nottingham university , also believes marx was ahead of his time . " the world is pretty much how marx described it 150 years ago , which is quite impressive in itself , " tormey said . " this is to say that we now have a more or less integrated world capitalist system , with a global rich and global poor - as marx predicted .
there is huge exploitation across all societies - the proliferation of sweatshops and export processing zones are all very much in keeping with marx ’ s account . " the peasantry is being systematically wiped out in a global process of dispossession , and of course social democracy , which started as a form of ultra moderate ' marxism , ' marxism-lite if you like , is in retreat in all areas where it once enjoyed hegemony , ” he added . tormey also explained that marx 's theory of class struggle is hugely prevalent in today 's current economic atmosphere . violent class struggle continues off media radar bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : class struggle is evident in often violent industrial action " there are workers there who have been denied trade union representation , who have been denied holiday pay , health care , and other benefits , " he said . " go into any business and you will see owners and workers - the owners can not do without the workers and they want to pay them as little as they can for the most amount of product / output ; the workers want the most they can get . this is class struggle . " the bosses have the laws on their side , the politicians , the state , and the media , " he added . " they are able to contain struggle so that it does n't disrupt society - for the most part . however , beyond the wealthy countries , the picture is very different .
open and violent struggles are commonplace in much of the world ; strikes , lockouts , and beatings of workers in places like china , indonesia , mexico , south africa , and violent peasant conflicts in places like nandigram , india .
look around : class struggle is everywhere and infects almost every human relation . " as well as economics and politics , marx had a great influence on the way people thought about culture .
while not considered to be a pure cultural theorist , marx 's writings on issues such as aesthetics , communication and interpretation contributed in part to a growing cultural studies movement . modern cultural theorists following marx 's ideas " marx 's influence on today 's cultural theorizing derives more from his social theory , which forms a useful context to theorizing culture , and his philosophical ideas in general , including his method of investigation and reasoning , " said johan fornas , director of the advanced cultural studies institute of sweden -lrb- acsis -rrb- .
" he developed some german and hegelian ideas in an exciting and inspiring direction that are still highly relevant for those of us who are engaged in developing cultural theory . " marx has inspired lots of recent thinkers to never cut theoretical concepts loose from experiences of everyday life and instead to understand the importance of situating knowledge in concrete material , embodied and socially organized practices , always interacting with institutionalized networks of power , " he added . despite the continued relevance of a number of marx 's theories , experts are quick to point out that some have little significance in today 's environment while others have been shown to be way off the mark in some cases . prediction of communist world proved wrong bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : even china has diluted its communism in recent times " marx was convinced that communism would replace capitalism but we don ’ t really see much of a communist movement emerging anywhere today , " tormey said . " so the irony might be that at the moment when marx 's ideas are even more relevant , so the attractiveness of marxism -lrb- or more accurately communism -rrb- as a mobilizing ideology seems in decline .
but this of course can change . " marx 's faith in the generation of informed political opposition from worsening material conditions failed to be realized , but that has not made his work irrelevant , hunt said . " his primary work , ' das kapital , ' still stands out as a wonderfully structured and thought through piece of analysis , drawing on the philosophical and economic thought of his time , " he said .
" its condemnation of the specific injustice of the capitalist system has few peers .
so , as long as there are capitalists , marx will remain relevant . " nick amies send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

they were also due to discuss ways to revive their economies during a summit in brussels . energy security and global warming also featured prominently with eu foreign policy chief javier solana telling the heads of the eu 's 27 member states that climate change had turned from a threat to a reality . climate change is now impacting the conflict in darfur , migration from flood-prone bangladesh and hopes for stability in the middle east , according to a new eu report . european commission president jose manuel barroso said he hoped governments would agree on a common european energy policy . " i think it 's very important also to fulfill the goals on climate change , " he said ahead of the summit .
" one year ago we adopted -lrb- a proposal -rrb- unanimously , now we have to translate this commitment in concrete ways . " the eu executive has recently put forward controversial proposals designed to make energy markets more competitive by splitting up companies which both sell energy to consumers and manage power lines . on climate change , leaders are being asked to cut the bloc 's emissions of the greenhouse gas carbon dioxide -lrb- co2 -rrb- to at least 20 percent below 1990 levels - a legally-binding goal they set themselves a year ago . protecting industry bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel does n't want german carmakers to bear the brunt of the eu goals while they were expected to broadly endorse a commission proposal presented in january , leaders were expected to steer clear of its most controversial aspect : how to share the burden of meeting that target . seen as a champion in the fight against climate change at last summer 's g8 summit , german chancellor angela merkel said she would not allow germany 's car industry to be excessively affected by the bloc 's climate goals . " i specifically support the german automobile industry , " she said , stressing that countries like germany , whose automobile industry makes larger cars , should not be discriminated against when the climate targets and fines are in force . summing up the view of many of his colleagues , bulgarian prime minister sergei stanishev said the eu needed to " strike a balance " in its bid to cut co2 emissions . leaders were also expected to discuss how to make financial markets more transparent in the wake of the recent turmoil and take stock of a number of foreign policy issues , including afghanistan and the middle east . club med 's could open in july bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some are still skeptical where sarkozy 's mediterranean union is headed but much of the attention was being devoted to french plans to create a union between countries with borders on the mediterranean sea . after fierce resistance from berlin , french president nicolas sarkozy scaled the plan down from including only states bordering the mediterranean , with nine new agencies and a bank , to an annual summit of eu and mediterranean countries with a joint presidency and a small secretariat . barroso applauded the idea , saying the new proposal would not divide the eu into northern and southern sections . " we have said from the beginning it was a very good idea to have more commitment of the european union regarding the mediterranean , " he said .
" at the same time , it is important that all member states of the eu are engaged in it .
so it seems now the conditions are there to move forward . " austrian chancellor alfred gusenbauer said the idea " does n't do any harm , " but added : " what matters to us is that it 's not some special grill party for a few member states .

and then , moreover , taking the opportunity to promote better integration of saudi arabia 's christian minority , ignoring public prejudices and protests against the building of new , strange-looking churches in their neighborhoods to emphasize the principle of religious freedom and call for christianity classes in saudi schools .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : rainer sollich it 's a wholly unlikely scenario .
and not just in saudi arabia , where christian immigrants from asia suffer extreme religious discrimination , but also in more liberal muslim countries such as turkey .
it therefore seems fair to say that the islam conference initiated by the german interior minister 18 months ago could serve as an inspiration to a number of countries , and not just western ones .
the project 's goals are politically highly relevant .
wolfgang schaeuble hopes that improved dialogue between representatives of the state and the muslim community will help advance the integration of germany 's 3 million muslims , which has been neglected for decades .
he is pinning his hopes on recognition of their religion , combined with the belief that the practice of this religion needs to take place within the framework of the german constitution and system of values .
schaeuble should be given due respect for concentrating his contribution to this very difficult dialogue on the basics - and what 's actually possible .
the real problems are tied up with social integration and are the hardest to solve .
teaching islam in german is widely seen as a necessity .
but the various germans states have yet to agree on what form it might take - and so do muslims .
there is still so much that has yet to be agreed on , as becomes apparent again and again .
the process of dialogue kick-started by the islam conference is important .
but this process will require reserves of patience from everyone involved .

" it would have been unthinkable for the summit would have remained silent on this , " sarkozy concluded . global financial markets have been gripped with extreme volatility amid concerns that tight credit conditions are threatening some finance houses and record-breaking runs for the euro , oil and gold . commission chief vows ecb will take action bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : barroso attempted to quell fears over financial instability as fears grew of a recession in the us economy and the knock-on effects on the world 's nerve-wracked financial markets , european commission chief jose manuel barroso tried to instill calm by telling the summit that the european central bank -lrb- ecb -rrb- would take control of the situation should it be required to . " the ecb will do what is necessary to secure financial stability , " barroso said . the eu leaders also broached the subject of action in the fight against climate change during the two-day summit and at the end agreed to wrap up negotiations on ambitious targets to cut energy use and fight global warming by the end of the year . " we committed ourselves to finishing negotiating on this package by the end of this year and by doing this we made a huge step forward , " said slovenian prime minister janez jansa , whose country holds the european union 's rotating presidency .
" we are convinced that the costs of these measures will be much lower than if we do n't act . " eu targets year-end for climate package agreement bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the eu is under pressure to deliver on its climate promises the current plan aims to meet the european union 's over-arching goal to reduce emissions of carbon dioxide - the main gas responsible for global warming - by 20 percent by 2020 , compared to 1990 levels .
eu member states have committed to go to 30 percent if other countries match them . in the upcoming negotiations on the details of meeting those goals , jansa said : " we need to take into account the different positions of the member states and their needs for economic growth . " in another green move , the eu leaders agreed to support the development of environmentally-friendly products by reducing the level of vat on them . the proposal , first made by british prime minister gordon brown , " will start the debate in many member states about how and whether household goods ... can incentivize consumer behavior towards buying energy-efficient and environmentally friendly goods and services , " brown said . environmental vat on eu agenda bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : brown 's " green tax " idea made a cautious appearance under the decision , the eu 's executive body , the european commission , is tasked with " reflecting " on " the best way to support the development of clean products by evoking the question of environmental vat , " sarkozy said . but the proposal is unlikely to lead to concrete measures soon .
vat is a sensitive issue , since much of the eu 's common budget comes from the vat which consumers pay in each member state , and any decisions on changing rates have to be approved unanimously . " people are being persuaded by the argument that we should look at this very carefully , " brown said .
" vat is a uniquely european tax . ...
we made substantial progress in only two days and i believe that over the next few months other countries will join the debate . " despite the support of britain and france - two of the eu 's three largest states - some member states oppose the proposal and could well block it . eu backs club med plan under new name bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : sarkozy 's club med plan will go to a summit in paris the eu also formally backed ambitious french plans for a union for the mediterranean , but watered it down to such an extent that it had to be given a new name . according to a last-minute addition to the draft conclusions of their regular spring council in brussels , the new organization is to be called " barcelona process : union for the mediterranean . " the barcelona process is the name of the eu 's 13-year-old policy which deals with the bloc 's southern neighbors and which many critics say has so far failed to deliver . the original " club med , " as first conceived a year ago by french president nicolas sarkozy , envisaged uniting israelis and syrians , turks and spaniards , italians and libyans , and making them work together on such diverse issues as migration , the environment or the fight against terrorism . but the latest draft of the proposal , brokered by germany earlier this week and submitted to leaders over dinner on thursday , includes all of the eu 's member states and vaguely talks about " projects with an accent on regional cooperation . " concerns over eu funds the downsizing came after eu countries with no borders on the mediterranean expressed skepticism at the proposal , with member states from eastern europe particularly concerned that it would divert precious eu funds away from their region . in friday 's draft conclusions , the european commission , " is invited to present to the council of eu leaders the necessary proposals for defining the modalities of what will be called ' barcelona process : union for the mediterranean " ' in view of a special summit to be convened in paris on july 13 . sarkozy nevertheless welcomed the compromise , pointing out that the new organization will for the first time give a strong voice to middle eastern and north african leaders in the way money in the region is spent . he noted that the new political structure will be co-chaired by an eu member and a non-eu member .
" europe will not turn its back on the mediterranean any more , " sarkozy said late thursday . chinese clampdown on tibet causes eu concern bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : reports suggest a chinese crackdown in lhasa , tibet the eu also took the opportunity provided by the summit to express concern about the violent protests taking place in tibet , with germany and britain among those calling for dialogue and restraint . german foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier called for an end to the conflict by peaceful means while his british counterpart david miliband said european governments would be seeking " clarification about what is actually happening on the ground , " adding that " restraint " and " substantive dialogue " were the only way forward . reports coming out of lhasa , the capital of china 's tibet autonomous region , suggest paramilitary riot police intervened to control protests initiated by buddhist monks on the 49th anniversary of a tibetan uprising against chinese rule that was crushed by troops . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" it would have been unthinkable for the summit would have remained silent on this , " sarkozy concluded . global financial markets have been gripped with extreme volatility amid concerns that tight credit conditions are threatening some finance houses and record-breaking runs for the euro , oil and gold . commission chief vows ecb will take action bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : barroso attempted to quell fears over financial instability as fears grew of a recession in the us economy and the knock-on effects on the world 's nerve-wracked financial markets , european commission chief jose manuel barroso tried to instill calm by telling the summit that the european central bank -lrb- ecb -rrb- would take control of the situation should it be required to . " the ecb will do what is necessary to secure financial stability , " barroso said . the eu leaders also broached the subject of action in the fight against climate change during the two-day summit and at the end agreed to wrap up negotiations on ambitious targets to cut energy use and fight global warming by the end of the year . " we committed ourselves to finishing negotiating on this package by the end of this year and by doing this we made a huge step forward , " said slovenian prime minister janez jansa , whose country holds the european union 's rotating presidency .
" we are convinced that the costs of these measures will be much lower than if we do n't act . " eu targets year-end for climate package agreement bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the eu is under pressure to deliver on its climate promises the current plan aims to meet the european union 's over-arching goal to reduce emissions of carbon dioxide - the main gas responsible for global warming - by 20 percent by 2020 , compared to 1990 levels .
eu member states have committed to go to 30 percent if other countries match them . in the upcoming negotiations on the details of meeting those goals , jansa said : " we need to take into account the different positions of the member states and their needs for economic growth . " in another green move , the eu leaders agreed to support the development of environmentally-friendly products by reducing the level of vat on them . the proposal , first made by british prime minister gordon brown , " will start the debate in many member states about how and whether household goods ... can incentivize consumer behavior towards buying energy-efficient and environmentally friendly goods and services , " brown said . environmental vat on eu agenda bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : brown 's " green tax " idea made a cautious appearance under the decision , the eu 's executive body , the european commission , is tasked with " reflecting " on " the best way to support the development of clean products by evoking the question of environmental vat , " sarkozy said . but the proposal is unlikely to lead to concrete measures soon .
vat is a sensitive issue , since much of the eu 's common budget comes from the vat which consumers pay in each member state , and any decisions on changing rates have to be approved unanimously . " people are being persuaded by the argument that we should look at this very carefully , " brown said .
" vat is a uniquely european tax . ...
we made substantial progress in only two days and i believe that over the next few months other countries will join the debate . " despite the support of britain and france - two of the eu 's three largest states - some member states oppose the proposal and could well block it . eu backs club med plan under new name bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : sarkozy 's club med plan will go to a summit in paris the eu also formally backed ambitious french plans for a union for the mediterranean , but watered it down to such an extent that it had to be given a new name . according to a last-minute addition to the draft conclusions of their regular spring council in brussels , the new organization is to be called " barcelona process : union for the mediterranean . " the barcelona process is the name of the eu 's 13-year-old policy which deals with the bloc 's southern neighbors and which many critics say has so far failed to deliver . the original " club med , " as first conceived a year ago by french president nicolas sarkozy , envisaged uniting israelis and syrians , turks and spaniards , italians and libyans , and making them work together on such diverse issues as migration , the environment or the fight against terrorism . but the latest draft of the proposal , brokered by germany earlier this week and submitted to leaders over dinner on thursday , includes all of the eu 's member states and vaguely talks about " projects with an accent on regional cooperation . " concerns over eu funds the downsizing came after eu countries with no borders on the mediterranean expressed skepticism at the proposal , with member states from eastern europe particularly concerned that it would divert precious eu funds away from their region . in friday 's draft conclusions , the european commission , " is invited to present to the council of eu leaders the necessary proposals for defining the modalities of what will be called ' barcelona process : union for the mediterranean " ' in view of a special summit to be convened in paris on july 13 . sarkozy nevertheless welcomed the compromise , pointing out that the new organization will for the first time give a strong voice to middle eastern and north african leaders in the way money in the region is spent . he noted that the new political structure will be co-chaired by an eu member and a non-eu member .
" europe will not turn its back on the mediterranean any more , " sarkozy said late thursday . chinese clampdown on tibet causes eu concern bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : reports suggest a chinese crackdown in lhasa , tibet the eu also took the opportunity provided by the summit to express concern about the violent protests taking place in tibet , with germany and britain among those calling for dialogue and restraint . german foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier called for an end to the conflict by peaceful means while his british counterpart david miliband said european governments would be seeking " clarification about what is actually happening on the ground , " adding that " restraint " and " substantive dialogue " were the only way forward . reports coming out of lhasa , the capital of china 's tibet autonomous region , suggest paramilitary riot police intervened to control protests initiated by buddhist monks on the 49th anniversary of a tibetan uprising against chinese rule that was crushed by troops . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

and then , moreover , taking the opportunity to promote better integration of saudi arabia 's christian minority , ignoring public prejudices and protests against the building of new , strange-looking churches in their neighborhoods to emphasize the principle of religious freedom and call for christianity classes in saudi schools .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : rainer sollich it 's a wholly unlikely scenario .
and not just in saudi arabia , where christian immigrants from asia suffer extreme religious discrimination , but also in more liberal muslim countries such as turkey .
it therefore seems fair to say that the islam conference initiated by the german interior minister 18 months ago could serve as an inspiration to a number of countries , and not just western ones .
the project 's goals are politically highly relevant .
wolfgang schaeuble hopes that improved dialogue between representatives of the state and the muslim community will help advance the integration of germany 's 3 million muslims , which has been neglected for decades .
he is pinning his hopes on recognition of their religion , combined with the belief that the practice of this religion needs to take place within the framework of the german constitution and system of values .
schaeuble should be given due respect for concentrating his contribution to this very difficult dialogue on the basics - and what 's actually possible .
the real problems are tied up with social integration and are the hardest to solve .
teaching islam in german is widely seen as a necessity .
but the various germans states have yet to agree on what form it might take - and so do muslims .
there is still so much that has yet to be agreed on , as becomes apparent again and again .
the process of dialogue kick-started by the islam conference is important .

realistic replicas of weapons can no longer be carried in public , the german government decided , as they can easily be mistaken for the real thing .
the police union said the new law does n't go far enough . for the second time since 2002 , when a student in erfurt killed sixteen people at his former high school , the german government has tightened its weapons law to align with the un firearms protocol .
the plan cleared its final legislative hurdle on friday , march 14 , when it was approved by the upper house of parliament . germany is imposing a ban on carrying realistic-looking imitation firearms in public , as police could mistake them for real weapons in a crisis situation .
the ban mainly applies to so-called softair guns , which function with pressurized gas and are often modeled on real-life counterparts . the head of the german police union -lrb- gdp -rrb- konrad freiberg criticized the law as insufficient .
it 's a scandal that the german government has excluded a nation-wide weapons registry from its reforms , he said . inherited guns must be disabled bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : realistic weapons are allowed at historical festivals under the law , people can still sell , purchase and possess replica firearms , but they must be transported in a closed container .
switchblades and knives with a blade longer than 12 centimeters -lrb- 4.7 inches -rrb- may also not be carried in public . violators face fines of up to 10,000 euros -lrb- $ 15,600 -rrb- .
exceptions , however , will be made for historical re-enactments . toy weapons that can not be mistaken for real guns are not affected by the law . furthermore , the new weapons law places restrictions on firearms inherited as of april 1 , 2008 .
if the heir can not prove a personal need for the weapon - for example , if he or she is a hunter or a member of a shooting club - it may only be kept if it 's been disabled . dw staff -lrb- kjb -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

they were also due to discuss ways to revive their economies during a summit in brussels . energy security and global warming also featured prominently with eu foreign policy chief javier solana telling the heads of the eu 's 27 member states that climate change had turned from a threat to a reality . climate change is now impacting the conflict in darfur , migration from flood-prone bangladesh and hopes for stability in the middle east , according to a new eu report . european commission president jose manuel barroso said he hoped governments would agree on a common european energy policy .

" i specifically support the german automobile industry , " she said , stressing that countries like germany , whose automobile industry makes larger cars , should not be discriminated against when the climate targets and fines are in force . summing up the view of many of his colleagues , bulgarian prime minister sergei stanishev said the eu needed to " strike a balance " in its bid to cut co2 emissions . leaders were also expected to discuss how to make financial markets more transparent in the wake of the recent turmoil and take stock of a number of foreign policy issues , including afghanistan and the middle east . club med 's could open in july bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some are still skeptical where sarkozy 's mediterranean union is headed but much of the attention was being devoted to french plans to create a union between countries with borders on the mediterranean sea . after fierce resistance from berlin , french president nicolas sarkozy scaled the plan down from including only states bordering the mediterranean , with nine new agencies and a bank , to an annual summit of eu and mediterranean countries with a joint presidency and a small secretariat . barroso applauded the idea , saying the new proposal would not divide the eu into northern and southern sections . " we have said from the beginning it was a very good idea to have more commitment of the european union regarding the mediterranean , " he said .
" at the same time , it is important that all member states of the eu are engaged in it .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de eastern europe -pipe- 14.03.2008 bulgaria explores officials ' ties to communist secret service großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bulgarians do n't seem to care much about what 's inside the old secret service files one in six bulgarian officials since 1990 had ties to the secret police during communism , concluded a parliamentary study .
but bulgarians are n't interested in hearing about their politicians ' pasts . the head of the government , four vice-premiers and 25 democratically elected ministers are among those with a connection to the secret service .
current president georgi parvanov worked under the code name gotse ; his predecessor jean videnov was also a special agent . former spies are especially prevalent in the foreign ministry and in diplomatic service .
three former ministers , 13 deputies and even bulgaria 's current nato ambassador were all part of the communist intelligence cadre . an investigative committee commissioned by parliament examined 673 government officials who had served since the fall of the iron curtain in 1990 and found that 108 were linked to communist intelligence . " informal networks that were linked to the repressive communist apparatus … continue to lead to corruption , " sonja schueler from the southeast europe association told deutsche welle .
" personal loyalties determine the decisions that are made and the socio-economic development of the country . " little interest in opened files bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : both parvanov -lrb- right -rrb- and putin had worked for their countries ' secret service the probe was made possible by a new law that is meant to ensure access to the files , but does n't take action against the ex-informants .
they are free to continue working in politics .
the situation is similar in germany , where the government committee responsible for opening the secret service files is only charged with informing the public . " the decision about the consequences is in the hands of those who put the politicians in office , " said andreas schulze , spokesman for the german organization that researches the former east german stasi . nevertheless , public curiosity around the topic is n't particularly strong in bulgaria .
all across central and eastern europe , the younger generation has n't shown much interest in digging up their country 's communist past . a wide variety of reasons come into play - the inability of historians to analyze the communist period objectively , low education levels among the population and the dependence of people 's career success on the system are just a few . older generations also tend to be skeptical of opening the secret files .
the entire soviet bloc was based on a foundation of unofficial informants , which means that plenty of ordinary citizens turned in information about friends , neighbors or acquaintances .
some of them are afraid that the skeletons in their closets will be exposed . close ties to the kgb bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the bulgarian secret service worked closely with the kgb not only are the activities of the secret police considered today to be human rights violations , but some of its elements were unconstitutional even during the communist regime .
the secret service was , for example , not subject to the judicial system but was run directly by the communist party . furthermore , the fact that the bulgarian secret police effectively functioned as an arm of russia 's kgb undermined the country 's raison d 'etat .
not to mention that bulgaria 's foreign intelligence was also involved in operations where blood was spilled . communist east germany 's last secret police chief march wolf wrote that , in the 1950s , his bulgarian and polish counterparts were known for having committed the most murders . former spies make europe uneasy bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bout , nicknamed " merchant of death , " was arrested in thailand this week " the bulgarian intelligence service was the one in the former east bloc that worked most closely together with the kgb , " said german journalist and crime expert juergen roth . top-ranking bulgarian politicians ' contacts to the kgb are seen in brussels as a potential security risk , particularly when sensitive topics like eu and nato are on the table .
bulgaria became a member of the european union on jan .
1 , 2007 . the old ties have come into the limelight this week for another reason : russian arms trader victor bout , who supposedly had excellent contacts to the soviet and later to the russian secret service , had delivered a load of weapons worth several hundred million dollars to bulgaria just before he was arrested on march 6 . dw staff -lrb- kjb -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de international relations -pipe- 14.03.2008 iran feels let down by europe , expert says großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : iranian voters can choose from two conservative factions and one reformist group as iranians vote in parliamentary polls friday , march 14 , dw 's chief correspondent and mideast expert peter philipp , currently in tehran , writes about his impressions on europe and germany 's waning clout in the country . hours before iran votes in its eighth parliamentary elections , gholam-ali addad-adel said the elections have nothing to do with the united states .
washington is attempting to divide the people and to make the parliament independent , the president of the iranian parliament said , adding that the us would not succeed . other conservative politicians have launched a campaign against reform-minded parliamentarian noureddine pir mouazaem because he gave the voice of america an interview regarding the elections .
but it 's not just the supposed attempts of the " great satan " to make contact with liberal forces in iran that are under fire - even germany has received a tongue-lashing . herbert honsowitz , the german ambassador in tehran was massively attacked in the media and in public statements because he met with the head of the reform movement , mohamed-reza khatami and allegedly listened to his complaints about the poor foreign policy " performance . " honsowitz , an old hand at iranian and middle east issues , did n't make a fuss about the criticism because he pointed out that he had also spoken with conservative politicians .
that was enough for a renewed salvo from the conservatives .
honsowitz , it was said , also met with former president khatami on the eve of the last round of un sanctions passed against iran .
that was accepted as proof that germany , which is almost considered part of the enemy camp , and the reformers were working together on crafting an anti-iran policy . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : dw 's peter philipp said europe has to brace for bad times with iran of course , these events took place in the run-up to the elections , and the criticism was probably partly campaigning rhetoric .
but it still ca n't just be pushed aside and ignored because it touches a sore point among iranians : if there 's one thing that iranians of every color react sensitively to it 's foreign interference in their affairs or even a suspicion of such intervention . it 's a feeling that stems from the country 's history as iran repeatedly was the playing field where foreign powers wielded their influence .
even 29 years after the " islamic revolution " - which made the country independent from such things - the ghost of foreign influence still haunts iranians .
that goes so far as to not tolerate foreign criticism about flaws in the country with the reminder , " this or that may not be good , but we 've done it ourselves . " you do n't need long to find proof of such behavior .
washington 's call for regime change in tehran , is an example .
the us approach in the nuclear row is another .
in the latter , disappointment and , to a certain extent , anger about the behavior of europeans - and particularly that of germany - play a role . many iranians feel a traditional kinship with germany .
for many of them , germany has been a role model in many aspects .
in recent times , such respect is increasingly mixed with surprise , bafflement and also anger about berlin 's stance in the nuclear dispute and on sanctions against iran . it 's the kind of position the iranians are used to from the united states , but surely not germany ?
a businessman , just back from a visit to germany , said bitterly that the germans should not be surprised that iran may one day repair its ties to the us but would not forget the " betrayal " of the germans so easily .
disappointment in friendship hurts more than " straightforward and open enmity . " it 's not just the germans but the europeans in general who need to prepare for bad times with iran .
politically , they 've let down iran and they will be punished for it with contempt .
today , the russian ambassador is the most important foreign diplomat in teheran . and if politics does n't work , business is bound to suffer as well .
china , japan and south korea together - and not the eu - already make up iran 's most important trading partner . peter philipp , currently in iran -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de balkans -pipe- 14.03.2008 serbia struggles in aftermath of kosovo 's independence großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : nationalist sentiment is fueled by economic difficulties serbia shunned western europe for its support of an independent kosovo .
but the eu is its most important trade partner and now the balkan country is feeling the crunch , both economically and politically . according to opinion polls , 70 percent of serbians are in favor of their county joining the european union .
but in the last elections , half of them voted for the nationalist euroskeptic parties . one reason is the west 's support of independence for kosovo .
another is the nationalists ' populist stance .
they want to undo the country 's recent democratic transformation and win the attention of those who have n't profited from the economic upswing . " these people are discontent because the democratic government treated them with arrogance in the past seven years and did n't want to hear about the problems of the people in the middle of the country , " said former foreign minister goran svilanovic . " distinctively neo-liberal politics makes them unhappy , but the majority of them do n't oppose the eu , " he said . long way to go bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : most serbs support eu membership in comparison to the last decade of war and economic embargos , serbs are living in much better circumstances today .
in 2007 , overall production rose by seven percent over the previous year . nevertheless , they are still far away from the central-european standard of living .
the gross national income in serbia is only about $ 5,500 per capita . the loss of the southern province of kosovo this year was another blow to the serbian economy .
the government , which stepped down as a result of the conflict over the eu 's kosovo policy , can no longer implement their plans to boost the economy .
since nearly all of its important trade partners have recognized the new state , the anti-western attitude in serbia is deterring potential investors . " serbia will experience political turbulence this year , which is why a lot of direct foreign investment ca n't be expected , " said belgrade economist sasa djogovic but the foreign companies that are already in serbia wo n't pull out , added djogovic . " that 's especially true of the finance sector , " he said .
" for them , serbia 's transformation market is very lucrative due to the high demand for capital . " unfair bank practices bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " free kosova " is n't bringing more coca-cola to serbia after a decade and a half of poverty , serbs are just starting to purchase new furniture and household appliances - but they have to pay a high price to borrow money .
currently , austrian , greek and italian firms dominate the bank sector . " brussels ' tolerance of the business practices of european banks in serbia is unacceptable , " said political scientist dusan janjic . " raiffeisen bank , credit agricole , societe generale and hvb are representatives of europe here , but for the people of serbia they are plunderers .
they charge the highest interest rates in europe and charge double interest via bogus firms in austria , " he said . on the other hands , the banks are reluctant to approve corporate loans .
the most important employers continue to be large state-run companies and the few trade monopolies .
the state is too weak to confront oligarchies and many of the state-run companies , like oil , end up being sold to russian conglomerates at low prices . alternative strategies " you ca n't really expect serbia to be able to export retail products to the european union , " said djogovic . " we 'll continue to send resources to the industrial nations , but we should also import technologies from these countries in order to become more competitive ourselves .
instead we import mass produced goods , " he said . as an alternative , serbia could explore new markets , or return to forgotten markets , like north africa , suggested the economist . filip slavkovic -lrb- kjb -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

they were also due to discuss ways to revive their economies during a summit in brussels . energy security and global warming also featured prominently with eu foreign policy chief javier solana telling the heads of the eu 's 27 member states that climate change had turned from a threat to a reality . climate change is now impacting the conflict in darfur , migration from flood-prone bangladesh and hopes for stability in the middle east , according to a new eu report . european commission president jose manuel barroso said he hoped governments would agree on a common european energy policy .

" i specifically support the german automobile industry , " she said , stressing that countries like germany , whose automobile industry makes larger cars , should not be discriminated against when the climate targets and fines are in force . summing up the view of many of his colleagues , bulgarian prime minister sergei stanishev said the eu needed to " strike a balance " in its bid to cut co2 emissions . leaders were also expected to discuss how to make financial markets more transparent in the wake of the recent turmoil and take stock of a number of foreign policy issues , including afghanistan and the middle east . club med 's could open in july bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some are still skeptical where sarkozy 's mediterranean union is headed but much of the attention was being devoted to french plans to create a union between countries with borders on the mediterranean sea . after fierce resistance from berlin , french president nicolas sarkozy scaled the plan down from including only states bordering the mediterranean , with nine new agencies and a bank , to an annual summit of eu and mediterranean countries with a joint presidency and a small secretariat . barroso applauded the idea , saying the new proposal would not divide the eu into northern and southern sections . " we have said from the beginning it was a very good idea to have more commitment of the european union regarding the mediterranean , " he said .
" at the same time , it is important that all member states of the eu are engaged in it .
so it seems now the conditions are there to move forward . " austrian chancellor alfred gusenbauer said the idea " does n't do any harm , " but added : " what matters to us is that it 's not some special grill party for a few member states .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de culture -pipe- 14.03.2008 marx continues to influence 125 years after his death großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : many of karl marx 's theories on politics , society and economics still ring true today friday , march 14 , marks the 125th anniversary of the death of german philosopher and political economist karl marx .
marx is still regarded as hugely influential to the development of 20th century thought . both a scholar and a political activist , marx addressed a wide range of political as well as social issues , and is known for , among other things , his analysis of history .
the interpretations of his theories , particularly those on political economy , have in the course of history generated decades of debate , inspired revolutions and cast him as both devil and deity in political and academic circles . maligned by some , misunderstood by others and celebrated as one of the world 's great thinkers by many more , marx continues to be a divisive and much discussed individual .
while there has been a substantial revival of interest in his theories since the end of the cold war , mainly those which deal with the volatility and shape of capitalism , the question remains as to whether a man who died 125 years ago still has any relevance today . ian hunt , the director of the center for applied philosophy at the flinders university of southern australia , believes that marx and his insights into the capitalist system in particular still have a place in contemporary society . " marx 's thoughts on the exploitative nature of the relationship between capitalist employers and their employees ring true today , " he said .
" the proletariat , or those without property , continues to seek employment from those with property .
control over private investment continues to give the capitalist class decisive influence over government and sufficient control over the supply of labor to ensure that it is sold by employees on terms favorable to the increase of the wealth of employers . " hunt said he believes that marx 's theories on the exploitative nature of the capitalist employment relationship - which skews industrial development toward using up human and natural resources for short-term gain - apply today in the form of climate and energy issues and " the problem of the despotic form of the employer-employee relationship under capitalism . " marx foresaw impact of private dominance bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : marx wrote about the factors which influenced climate change " marx 's analysis of the foundations of a capitalist society raises questions of the justice of the distribution of wealth , and therefore also of income , in capitalist societies , which are even more acute in the modern world than in his own time , " hunt added .
" it also raises questions about the environmental consequences of private dominance of investment that are even more acute today than in the time marx wrote . " simon tormey , the co-director of the center for the study of social and global justice -lrb- cssgj -rrb- at nottingham university , also believes marx was ahead of his time . " the world is pretty much how marx described it 150 years ago , which is quite impressive in itself , " tormey said . " this is to say that we now have a more or less integrated world capitalist system , with a global rich and global poor - as marx predicted .
there is huge exploitation across all societies - the proliferation of sweatshops and export processing zones are all very much in keeping with marx ’ s account . " the peasantry is being systematically wiped out in a global process of dispossession , and of course social democracy , which started as a form of ultra moderate ' marxism , ' marxism-lite if you like , is in retreat in all areas where it once enjoyed hegemony , ” he added . tormey also explained that marx 's theory of class struggle is hugely prevalent in today 's current economic atmosphere . violent class struggle continues off media radar bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : class struggle is evident in often violent industrial action " there are workers there who have been denied trade union representation , who have been denied holiday pay , health care , and other benefits , " he said . " go into any business and you will see owners and workers - the owners can not do without the workers and they want to pay them as little as they can for the most amount of product / output ; the workers want the most they can get . this is class struggle . " the bosses have the laws on their side , the politicians , the state , and the media , " he added . " they are able to contain struggle so that it does n't disrupt society - for the most part . however , beyond the wealthy countries , the picture is very different .
open and violent struggles are commonplace in much of the world ; strikes , lockouts , and beatings of workers in places like china , indonesia , mexico , south africa , and violent peasant conflicts in places like nandigram , india .
look around : class struggle is everywhere and infects almost every human relation . " as well as economics and politics , marx had a great influence on the way people thought about culture .
while not considered to be a pure cultural theorist , marx 's writings on issues such as aesthetics , communication and interpretation contributed in part to a growing cultural studies movement . modern cultural theorists following marx 's ideas " marx 's influence on today 's cultural theorizing derives more from his social theory , which forms a useful context to theorizing culture , and his philosophical ideas in general , including his method of investigation and reasoning , " said johan fornas , director of the advanced cultural studies institute of sweden -lrb- acsis -rrb- .
" he developed some german and hegelian ideas in an exciting and inspiring direction that are still highly relevant for those of us who are engaged in developing cultural theory . " marx has inspired lots of recent thinkers to never cut theoretical concepts loose from experiences of everyday life and instead to understand the importance of situating knowledge in concrete material , embodied and socially organized practices , always interacting with institutionalized networks of power , " he added . despite the continued relevance of a number of marx 's theories , experts are quick to point out that some have little significance in today 's environment while others have been shown to be way off the mark in some cases . prediction of communist world proved wrong bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : even china has diluted its communism in recent times " marx was convinced that communism would replace capitalism but we don ’ t really see much of a communist movement emerging anywhere today , " tormey said . " so the irony might be that at the moment when marx 's ideas are even more relevant , so the attractiveness of marxism -lrb- or more accurately communism -rrb- as a mobilizing ideology seems in decline .
but this of course can change . " marx 's faith in the generation of informed political opposition from worsening material conditions failed to be realized , but that has not made his work irrelevant , hunt said . " his primary work , ' das kapital , ' still stands out as a wonderfully structured and thought through piece of analysis , drawing on the philosophical and economic thought of his time , " he said .
" its condemnation of the specific injustice of the capitalist system has few peers .
so , as long as there are capitalists , marx will remain relevant . " nick amies send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

victory for either side could have dramatic effects on the islamic republic 's relations with the west . parliamentary elections ended on friday night in iran after 15 hours following the interior ministry 's decision to extend the voting time five times from 6 p.m. to 11 p.m. local time in response to what was proclaimed to be public demand .
the iranian vote pitted the ruling ultra-conservative faction close to president mahmoud ahmadinejad against reformists close to former president mohammad khatami and a conservative faction headed by former chief nuclear negotiator , ali larijani .
with a total of 4,400 candidates running for 290 seats and with votes being cast manually , the first results from the provinces were expected to be announced by saturday noon , while results for the politically important tehran constituency were not expected before monday .
the first to vote was iran 's supreme leader ayatollah ali khamenei who asked the people to determine their political future by going to the polls .
former iranian president akbar hashemi-rafsanjani voted in the morning and called on the people to vote in order to strengthen the legislature 's power .
ahmadinejad 's rivals urge public to vote bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : rafsanjani is a fierce opponent of ahmadinejad " if you do not vote , then those whom you do not want will get into the parliament again , " said the cleric who is a strong opponent of ahmadinejad .
" the new parliament should definitely increase its supervision -lsb- of the government 's performance -rsb- , " rafsanjani added .

" it would have been unthinkable for the summit would have remained silent on this , " sarkozy concluded . global financial markets have been gripped with extreme volatility amid concerns that tight credit conditions are threatening some finance houses and record-breaking runs for the euro , oil and gold . commission chief vows ecb will take action bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : barroso attempted to quell fears over financial instability as fears grew of a recession in the us economy and the knock-on effects on the world 's nerve-wracked financial markets , european commission chief jose manuel barroso tried to instill calm by telling the summit that the european central bank -lrb- ecb -rrb- would take control of the situation should it be required to . " the ecb will do what is necessary to secure financial stability , " barroso said . the eu leaders also broached the subject of action in the fight against climate change during the two-day summit and at the end agreed to wrap up negotiations on ambitious targets to cut energy use and fight global warming by the end of the year . " we committed ourselves to finishing negotiating on this package by the end of this year and by doing this we made a huge step forward , " said slovenian prime minister janez jansa , whose country holds the european union 's rotating presidency .
" we are convinced that the costs of these measures will be much lower than if we do n't act . " eu targets year-end for climate package agreement bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the eu is under pressure to deliver on its climate promises the current plan aims to meet the european union 's over-arching goal to reduce emissions of carbon dioxide - the main gas responsible for global warming - by 20 percent by 2020 , compared to 1990 levels .
eu member states have committed to go to 30 percent if other countries match them . in the upcoming negotiations on the details of meeting those goals , jansa said : " we need to take into account the different positions of the member states and their needs for economic growth . " in another green move , the eu leaders agreed to support the development of environmentally-friendly products by reducing the level of vat on them . the proposal , first made by british prime minister gordon brown , " will start the debate in many member states about how and whether household goods ... can incentivize consumer behavior towards buying energy-efficient and environmentally friendly goods and services , " brown said . environmental vat on eu agenda bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : brown 's " green tax " idea made a cautious appearance under the decision , the eu 's executive body , the european commission , is tasked with " reflecting " on " the best way to support the development of clean products by evoking the question of environmental vat , " sarkozy said . but the proposal is unlikely to lead to concrete measures soon .
vat is a sensitive issue , since much of the eu 's common budget comes from the vat which consumers pay in each member state , and any decisions on changing rates have to be approved unanimously . " people are being persuaded by the argument that we should look at this very carefully , " brown said .
" vat is a uniquely european tax . ...
we made substantial progress in only two days and i believe that over the next few months other countries will join the debate . " despite the support of britain and france - two of the eu 's three largest states - some member states oppose the proposal and could well block it . eu backs club med plan under new name bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : sarkozy 's club med plan will go to a summit in paris the eu also formally backed ambitious french plans for a union for the mediterranean , but watered it down to such an extent that it had to be given a new name . according to a last-minute addition to the draft conclusions of their regular spring council in brussels , the new organization is to be called " barcelona process : union for the mediterranean . " the barcelona process is the name of the eu 's 13-year-old policy which deals with the bloc 's southern neighbors and which many critics say has so far failed to deliver . the original " club med , " as first conceived a year ago by french president nicolas sarkozy , envisaged uniting israelis and syrians , turks and spaniards , italians and libyans , and making them work together on such diverse issues as migration , the environment or the fight against terrorism . but the latest draft of the proposal , brokered by germany earlier this week and submitted to leaders over dinner on thursday , includes all of the eu 's member states and vaguely talks about " projects with an accent on regional cooperation . " concerns over eu funds the downsizing came after eu countries with no borders on the mediterranean expressed skepticism at the proposal , with member states from eastern europe particularly concerned that it would divert precious eu funds away from their region . in friday 's draft conclusions , the european commission , " is invited to present to the council of eu leaders the necessary proposals for defining the modalities of what will be called ' barcelona process : union for the mediterranean " ' in view of a special summit to be convened in paris on july 13 . sarkozy nevertheless welcomed the compromise , pointing out that the new organization will for the first time give a strong voice to middle eastern and north african leaders in the way money in the region is spent . he noted that the new political structure will be co-chaired by an eu member and a non-eu member .
" europe will not turn its back on the mediterranean any more , " sarkozy said late thursday . chinese clampdown on tibet causes eu concern bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : reports suggest a chinese crackdown in lhasa , tibet the eu also took the opportunity provided by the summit to express concern about the violent protests taking place in tibet , with germany and britain among those calling for dialogue and restraint . german foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier called for an end to the conflict by peaceful means while his british counterpart david miliband said european governments would be seeking " clarification about what is actually happening on the ground , " adding that " restraint " and " substantive dialogue " were the only way forward . reports coming out of lhasa , the capital of china 's tibet autonomous region , suggest paramilitary riot police intervened to control protests initiated by buddhist monks on the 49th anniversary of a tibetan uprising against chinese rule that was crushed by troops . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" it would have been unthinkable for the summit would have remained silent on this , " sarkozy concluded . global financial markets have been gripped with extreme volatility amid concerns that tight credit conditions are threatening some finance houses and record-breaking runs for the euro , oil and gold . commission chief vows ecb will take action bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : barroso attempted to quell fears over financial instability as fears grew of a recession in the us economy and the knock-on effects on the world 's nerve-wracked financial markets , european commission chief jose manuel barroso tried to instill calm by telling the summit that the european central bank -lrb- ecb -rrb- would take control of the situation should it be required to . " the ecb will do what is necessary to secure financial stability , " barroso said . the eu leaders also broached the subject of action in the fight against climate change during the two-day summit and at the end agreed to wrap up negotiations on ambitious targets to cut energy use and fight global warming by the end of the year . " we committed ourselves to finishing negotiating on this package by the end of this year and by doing this we made a huge step forward , " said slovenian prime minister janez jansa , whose country holds the european union 's rotating presidency .
" we are convinced that the costs of these measures will be much lower than if we do n't act . " eu targets year-end for climate package agreement bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the eu is under pressure to deliver on its climate promises the current plan aims to meet the european union 's over-arching goal to reduce emissions of carbon dioxide - the main gas responsible for global warming - by 20 percent by 2020 , compared to 1990 levels .
eu member states have committed to go to 30 percent if other countries match them . in the upcoming negotiations on the details of meeting those goals , jansa said : " we need to take into account the different positions of the member states and their needs for economic growth . " in another green move , the eu leaders agreed to support the development of environmentally-friendly products by reducing the level of vat on them . the proposal , first made by british prime minister gordon brown , " will start the debate in many member states about how and whether household goods ... can incentivize consumer behavior towards buying energy-efficient and environmentally friendly goods and services , " brown said . environmental vat on eu agenda bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : brown 's " green tax " idea made a cautious appearance under the decision , the eu 's executive body , the european commission , is tasked with " reflecting " on " the best way to support the development of clean products by evoking the question of environmental vat , " sarkozy said . but the proposal is unlikely to lead to concrete measures soon .
vat is a sensitive issue , since much of the eu 's common budget comes from the vat which consumers pay in each member state , and any decisions on changing rates have to be approved unanimously . " people are being persuaded by the argument that we should look at this very carefully , " brown said .
" vat is a uniquely european tax . ...
we made substantial progress in only two days and i believe that over the next few months other countries will join the debate . " despite the support of britain and france - two of the eu 's three largest states - some member states oppose the proposal and could well block it . eu backs club med plan under new name bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : sarkozy 's club med plan will go to a summit in paris the eu also formally backed ambitious french plans for a union for the mediterranean , but watered it down to such an extent that it had to be given a new name . according to a last-minute addition to the draft conclusions of their regular spring council in brussels , the new organization is to be called " barcelona process : union for the mediterranean . " the barcelona process is the name of the eu 's 13-year-old policy which deals with the bloc 's southern neighbors and which many critics say has so far failed to deliver . the original " club med , " as first conceived a year ago by french president nicolas sarkozy , envisaged uniting israelis and syrians , turks and spaniards , italians and libyans , and making them work together on such diverse issues as migration , the environment or the fight against terrorism . but the latest draft of the proposal , brokered by germany earlier this week and submitted to leaders over dinner on thursday , includes all of the eu 's member states and vaguely talks about " projects with an accent on regional cooperation .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de culture -pipe- 14.03.2008 marx continues to influence 125 years after his death großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : many of karl marx 's theories on politics , society and economics still ring true today friday , march 14 , marks the 125th anniversary of the death of german philosopher and political economist karl marx .
marx is still regarded as hugely influential to the development of 20th century thought . both a scholar and a political activist , marx addressed a wide range of political as well as social issues , and is known for , among other things , his analysis of history .
the interpretations of his theories , particularly those on political economy , have in the course of history generated decades of debate , inspired revolutions and cast him as both devil and deity in political and academic circles . maligned by some , misunderstood by others and celebrated as one of the world 's great thinkers by many more , marx continues to be a divisive and much discussed individual .
while there has been a substantial revival of interest in his theories since the end of the cold war , mainly those which deal with the volatility and shape of capitalism , the question remains as to whether a man who died 125 years ago still has any relevance today . ian hunt , the director of the center for applied philosophy at the flinders university of southern australia , believes that marx and his insights into the capitalist system in particular still have a place in contemporary society . " marx 's thoughts on the exploitative nature of the relationship between capitalist employers and their employees ring true today , " he said .
" the proletariat , or those without property , continues to seek employment from those with property .
control over private investment continues to give the capitalist class decisive influence over government and sufficient control over the supply of labor to ensure that it is sold by employees on terms favorable to the increase of the wealth of employers . " hunt said he believes that marx 's theories on the exploitative nature of the capitalist employment relationship - which skews industrial development toward using up human and natural resources for short-term gain - apply today in the form of climate and energy issues and " the problem of the despotic form of the employer-employee relationship under capitalism . " marx foresaw impact of private dominance bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : marx wrote about the factors which influenced climate change " marx 's analysis of the foundations of a capitalist society raises questions of the justice of the distribution of wealth , and therefore also of income , in capitalist societies , which are even more acute in the modern world than in his own time , " hunt added .
" it also raises questions about the environmental consequences of private dominance of investment that are even more acute today than in the time marx wrote . " simon tormey , the co-director of the center for the study of social and global justice -lrb- cssgj -rrb- at nottingham university , also believes marx was ahead of his time . " the world is pretty much how marx described it 150 years ago , which is quite impressive in itself , " tormey said . " this is to say that we now have a more or less integrated world capitalist system , with a global rich and global poor - as marx predicted .
there is huge exploitation across all societies - the proliferation of sweatshops and export processing zones are all very much in keeping with marx ’ s account . " the peasantry is being systematically wiped out in a global process of dispossession , and of course social democracy , which started as a form of ultra moderate ' marxism , ' marxism-lite if you like , is in retreat in all areas where it once enjoyed hegemony , ” he added . tormey also explained that marx 's theory of class struggle is hugely prevalent in today 's current economic atmosphere . violent class struggle continues off media radar bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : class struggle is evident in often violent industrial action " there are workers there who have been denied trade union representation , who have been denied holiday pay , health care , and other benefits , " he said . " go into any business and you will see owners and workers - the owners can not do without the workers and they want to pay them as little as they can for the most amount of product / output ; the workers want the most they can get . this is class struggle . " the bosses have the laws on their side , the politicians , the state , and the media , " he added . " they are able to contain struggle so that it does n't disrupt society - for the most part . however , beyond the wealthy countries , the picture is very different .
open and violent struggles are commonplace in much of the world ; strikes , lockouts , and beatings of workers in places like china , indonesia , mexico , south africa , and violent peasant conflicts in places like nandigram , india .
look around : class struggle is everywhere and infects almost every human relation . " as well as economics and politics , marx had a great influence on the way people thought about culture .
while not considered to be a pure cultural theorist , marx 's writings on issues such as aesthetics , communication and interpretation contributed in part to a growing cultural studies movement . modern cultural theorists following marx 's ideas " marx 's influence on today 's cultural theorizing derives more from his social theory , which forms a useful context to theorizing culture , and his philosophical ideas in general , including his method of investigation and reasoning , " said johan fornas , director of the advanced cultural studies institute of sweden -lrb- acsis -rrb- .
" he developed some german and hegelian ideas in an exciting and inspiring direction that are still highly relevant for those of us who are engaged in developing cultural theory . " marx has inspired lots of recent thinkers to never cut theoretical concepts loose from experiences of everyday life and instead to understand the importance of situating knowledge in concrete material , embodied and socially organized practices , always interacting with institutionalized networks of power , " he added . despite the continued relevance of a number of marx 's theories , experts are quick to point out that some have little significance in today 's environment while others have been shown to be way off the mark in some cases . prediction of communist world proved wrong bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : even china has diluted its communism in recent times " marx was convinced that communism would replace capitalism but we don ’ t really see much of a communist movement emerging anywhere today , " tormey said . " so the irony might be that at the moment when marx 's ideas are even more relevant , so the attractiveness of marxism -lrb- or more accurately communism -rrb- as a mobilizing ideology seems in decline .
but this of course can change . " marx 's faith in the generation of informed political opposition from worsening material conditions failed to be realized , but that has not made his work irrelevant , hunt said . " his primary work , ' das kapital , ' still stands out as a wonderfully structured and thought through piece of analysis , drawing on the philosophical and economic thought of his time , " he said .
" its condemnation of the specific injustice of the capitalist system has few peers .
so , as long as there are capitalists , marx will remain relevant . " nick amies send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de culture -pipe- 14.03.2008 marx continues to influence 125 years after his death großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : many of karl marx 's theories on politics , society and economics still ring true today friday , march 14 , marks the 125th anniversary of the death of german philosopher and political economist karl marx .
marx is still regarded as hugely influential to the development of 20th century thought . both a scholar and a political activist , marx addressed a wide range of political as well as social issues , and is known for , among other things , his analysis of history .
the interpretations of his theories , particularly those on political economy , have in the course of history generated decades of debate , inspired revolutions and cast him as both devil and deity in political and academic circles . maligned by some , misunderstood by others and celebrated as one of the world 's great thinkers by many more , marx continues to be a divisive and much discussed individual .
while there has been a substantial revival of interest in his theories since the end of the cold war , mainly those which deal with the volatility and shape of capitalism , the question remains as to whether a man who died 125 years ago still has any relevance today . ian hunt , the director of the center for applied philosophy at the flinders university of southern australia , believes that marx and his insights into the capitalist system in particular still have a place in contemporary society . " marx 's thoughts on the exploitative nature of the relationship between capitalist employers and their employees ring true today , " he said .
" the proletariat , or those without property , continues to seek employment from those with property .
control over private investment continues to give the capitalist class decisive influence over government and sufficient control over the supply of labor to ensure that it is sold by employees on terms favorable to the increase of the wealth of employers . " hunt said he believes that marx 's theories on the exploitative nature of the capitalist employment relationship - which skews industrial development toward using up human and natural resources for short-term gain - apply today in the form of climate and energy issues and " the problem of the despotic form of the employer-employee relationship under capitalism . " marx foresaw impact of private dominance bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : marx wrote about the factors which influenced climate change " marx 's analysis of the foundations of a capitalist society raises questions of the justice of the distribution of wealth , and therefore also of income , in capitalist societies , which are even more acute in the modern world than in his own time , " hunt added .
" it also raises questions about the environmental consequences of private dominance of investment that are even more acute today than in the time marx wrote . " simon tormey , the co-director of the center for the study of social and global justice -lrb- cssgj -rrb- at nottingham university , also believes marx was ahead of his time . " the world is pretty much how marx described it 150 years ago , which is quite impressive in itself , " tormey said . " this is to say that we now have a more or less integrated world capitalist system , with a global rich and global poor - as marx predicted .
there is huge exploitation across all societies - the proliferation of sweatshops and export processing zones are all very much in keeping with marx ’ s account . " the peasantry is being systematically wiped out in a global process of dispossession , and of course social democracy , which started as a form of ultra moderate ' marxism , ' marxism-lite if you like , is in retreat in all areas where it once enjoyed hegemony , ” he added . tormey also explained that marx 's theory of class struggle is hugely prevalent in today 's current economic atmosphere . violent class struggle continues off media radar bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : class struggle is evident in often violent industrial action " there are workers there who have been denied trade union representation , who have been denied holiday pay , health care , and other benefits , " he said . " go into any business and you will see owners and workers - the owners can not do without the workers and they want to pay them as little as they can for the most amount of product / output ; the workers want the most they can get . this is class struggle . " the bosses have the laws on their side , the politicians , the state , and the media , " he added . " they are able to contain struggle so that it does n't disrupt society - for the most part . however , beyond the wealthy countries , the picture is very different .
open and violent struggles are commonplace in much of the world ; strikes , lockouts , and beatings of workers in places like china , indonesia , mexico , south africa , and violent peasant conflicts in places like nandigram , india .
look around : class struggle is everywhere and infects almost every human relation . " as well as economics and politics , marx had a great influence on the way people thought about culture .
while not considered to be a pure cultural theorist , marx 's writings on issues such as aesthetics , communication and interpretation contributed in part to a growing cultural studies movement . modern cultural theorists following marx 's ideas " marx 's influence on today 's cultural theorizing derives more from his social theory , which forms a useful context to theorizing culture , and his philosophical ideas in general , including his method of investigation and reasoning , " said johan fornas , director of the advanced cultural studies institute of sweden -lrb- acsis -rrb- .
" he developed some german and hegelian ideas in an exciting and inspiring direction that are still highly relevant for those of us who are engaged in developing cultural theory . " marx has inspired lots of recent thinkers to never cut theoretical concepts loose from experiences of everyday life and instead to understand the importance of situating knowledge in concrete material , embodied and socially organized practices , always interacting with institutionalized networks of power , " he added . despite the continued relevance of a number of marx 's theories , experts are quick to point out that some have little significance in today 's environment while others have been shown to be way off the mark in some cases . prediction of communist world proved wrong bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : even china has diluted its communism in recent times " marx was convinced that communism would replace capitalism but we don ’ t really see much of a communist movement emerging anywhere today , " tormey said . " so the irony might be that at the moment when marx 's ideas are even more relevant , so the attractiveness of marxism -lrb- or more accurately communism -rrb- as a mobilizing ideology seems in decline .
but this of course can change . " marx 's faith in the generation of informed political opposition from worsening material conditions failed to be realized , but that has not made his work irrelevant , hunt said . " his primary work , ' das kapital , ' still stands out as a wonderfully structured and thought through piece of analysis , drawing on the philosophical and economic thought of his time , " he said .
" its condemnation of the specific injustice of the capitalist system has few peers .
so , as long as there are capitalists , marx will remain relevant . " nick amies send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" marx foresaw impact of private dominance bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : marx wrote about the factors which influenced climate change " marx 's analysis of the foundations of a capitalist society raises questions of the justice of the distribution of wealth , and therefore also of income , in capitalist societies , which are even more acute in the modern world than in his own time , " hunt added .
" it also raises questions about the environmental consequences of private dominance of investment that are even more acute today than in the time marx wrote . " simon tormey , the co-director of the center for the study of social and global justice -lrb- cssgj -rrb- at nottingham university , also believes marx was ahead of his time . " the world is pretty much how marx described it 150 years ago , which is quite impressive in itself , " tormey said . " this is to say that we now have a more or less integrated world capitalist system , with a global rich and global poor - as marx predicted .
there is huge exploitation across all societies - the proliferation of sweatshops and export processing zones are all very much in keeping with marx ’ s account . " the peasantry is being systematically wiped out in a global process of dispossession , and of course social democracy , which started as a form of ultra moderate ' marxism , ' marxism-lite if you like , is in retreat in all areas where it once enjoyed hegemony , ” he added . tormey also explained that marx 's theory of class struggle is hugely prevalent in today 's current economic atmosphere . violent class struggle continues off media radar bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : class struggle is evident in often violent industrial action " there are workers there who have been denied trade union representation , who have been denied holiday pay , health care , and other benefits , " he said . " go into any business and you will see owners and workers - the owners can not do without the workers and they want to pay them as little as they can for the most amount of product / output ; the workers want the most they can get . this is class struggle . " the bosses have the laws on their side , the politicians , the state , and the media , " he added . " they are able to contain struggle so that it does n't disrupt society - for the most part . however , beyond the wealthy countries , the picture is very different .
open and violent struggles are commonplace in much of the world ; strikes , lockouts , and beatings of workers in places like china , indonesia , mexico , south africa , and violent peasant conflicts in places like nandigram , india .
look around : class struggle is everywhere and infects almost every human relation . " as well as economics and politics , marx had a great influence on the way people thought about culture .
while not considered to be a pure cultural theorist , marx 's writings on issues such as aesthetics , communication and interpretation contributed in part to a growing cultural studies movement . modern cultural theorists following marx 's ideas " marx 's influence on today 's cultural theorizing derives more from his social theory , which forms a useful context to theorizing culture , and his philosophical ideas in general , including his method of investigation and reasoning , " said johan fornas , director of the advanced cultural studies institute of sweden -lrb- acsis -rrb- .
" he developed some german and hegelian ideas in an exciting and inspiring direction that are still highly relevant for those of us who are engaged in developing cultural theory . " marx has inspired lots of recent thinkers to never cut theoretical concepts loose from experiences of everyday life and instead to understand the importance of situating knowledge in concrete material , embodied and socially organized practices , always interacting with institutionalized networks of power , " he added . despite the continued relevance of a number of marx 's theories , experts are quick to point out that some have little significance in today 's environment while others have been shown to be way off the mark in some cases . prediction of communist world proved wrong bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : even china has diluted its communism in recent times " marx was convinced that communism would replace capitalism but we don ’ t really see much of a communist movement emerging anywhere today , " tormey said . " so the irony might be that at the moment when marx 's ideas are even more relevant , so the attractiveness of marxism -lrb- or more accurately communism -rrb- as a mobilizing ideology seems in decline .
but this of course can change . " marx 's faith in the generation of informed political opposition from worsening material conditions failed to be realized , but that has not made his work irrelevant , hunt said . " his primary work , ' das kapital , ' still stands out as a wonderfully structured and thought through piece of analysis , drawing on the philosophical and economic thought of his time , " he said .
" its condemnation of the specific injustice of the capitalist system has few peers .
so , as long as there are capitalists , marx will remain relevant . " nick amies send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

but bulgarians are n't interested in hearing about their politicians ' pasts . the head of the government , four vice-premiers and 25 democratically elected ministers are among those with a connection to the secret service .
current president georgi parvanov worked under the code name gotse ; his predecessor jean videnov was also a special agent . former spies are especially prevalent in the foreign ministry and in diplomatic service .
three former ministers , 13 deputies and even bulgaria 's current nato ambassador were all part of the communist intelligence cadre . an investigative committee commissioned by parliament examined 673 government officials who had served since the fall of the iron curtain in 1990 and found that 108 were linked to communist intelligence . " informal networks that were linked to the repressive communist apparatus … continue to lead to corruption , " sonja schueler from the southeast europe association told deutsche welle .
" personal loyalties determine the decisions that are made and the socio-economic development of the country . " little interest in opened files bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : both parvanov -lrb- right -rrb- and putin had worked for their countries ' secret service the probe was made possible by a new law that is meant to ensure access to the files , but does n't take action against the ex-informants .
they are free to continue working in politics .
the situation is similar in germany , where the government committee responsible for opening the secret service files is only charged with informing the public . " the decision about the consequences is in the hands of those who put the politicians in office , " said andreas schulze , spokesman for the german organization that researches the former east german stasi . nevertheless , public curiosity around the topic is n't particularly strong in bulgaria .
all across central and eastern europe , the younger generation has n't shown much interest in digging up their country 's communist past . a wide variety of reasons come into play - the inability of historians to analyze the communist period objectively , low education levels among the population and the dependence of people 's career success on the system are just a few . older generations also tend to be skeptical of opening the secret files .
the entire soviet bloc was based on a foundation of unofficial informants , which means that plenty of ordinary citizens turned in information about friends , neighbors or acquaintances .
some of them are afraid that the skeletons in their closets will be exposed . close ties to the kgb bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the bulgarian secret service worked closely with the kgb not only are the activities of the secret police considered today to be human rights violations , but some of its elements were unconstitutional even during the communist regime .
the secret service was , for example , not subject to the judicial system but was run directly by the communist party . furthermore , the fact that the bulgarian secret police effectively functioned as an arm of russia 's kgb undermined the country 's raison d 'etat .
not to mention that bulgaria 's foreign intelligence was also involved in operations where blood was spilled . communist east germany 's last secret police chief march wolf wrote that , in the 1950s , his bulgarian and polish counterparts were known for having committed the most murders . former spies make europe uneasy bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bout , nicknamed " merchant of death , " was arrested in thailand this week " the bulgarian intelligence service was the one in the former east bloc that worked most closely together with the kgb , " said german journalist and crime expert juergen roth . top-ranking bulgarian politicians ' contacts to the kgb are seen in brussels as a potential security risk , particularly when sensitive topics like eu and nato are on the table .

they were also due to discuss ways to revive their economies during a summit in brussels . energy security and global warming also featured prominently with eu foreign policy chief javier solana telling the heads of the eu 's 27 member states that climate change had turned from a threat to a reality . climate change is now impacting the conflict in darfur , migration from flood-prone bangladesh and hopes for stability in the middle east , according to a new eu report . european commission president jose manuel barroso said he hoped governments would agree on a common european energy policy . " i think it 's very important also to fulfill the goals on climate change , " he said ahead of the summit .
" one year ago we adopted -lrb- a proposal -rrb- unanimously , now we have to translate this commitment in concrete ways . " the eu executive has recently put forward controversial proposals designed to make energy markets more competitive by splitting up companies which both sell energy to consumers and manage power lines . on climate change , leaders are being asked to cut the bloc 's emissions of the greenhouse gas carbon dioxide -lrb- co2 -rrb- to at least 20 percent below 1990 levels - a legally-binding goal they set themselves a year ago . protecting industry bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel does n't want german carmakers to bear the brunt of the eu goals while they were expected to broadly endorse a commission proposal presented in january , leaders were expected to steer clear of its most controversial aspect : how to share the burden of meeting that target . seen as a champion in the fight against climate change at last summer 's g8 summit , german chancellor angela merkel said she would not allow germany 's car industry to be excessively affected by the bloc 's climate goals . " i specifically support the german automobile industry , " she said , stressing that countries like germany , whose automobile industry makes larger cars , should not be discriminated against when the climate targets and fines are in force . summing up the view of many of his colleagues , bulgarian prime minister sergei stanishev said the eu needed to " strike a balance " in its bid to cut co2 emissions . leaders were also expected to discuss how to make financial markets more transparent in the wake of the recent turmoil and take stock of a number of foreign policy issues , including afghanistan and the middle east . club med 's could open in july bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some are still skeptical where sarkozy 's mediterranean union is headed but much of the attention was being devoted to french plans to create a union between countries with borders on the mediterranean sea . after fierce resistance from berlin , french president nicolas sarkozy scaled the plan down from including only states bordering the mediterranean , with nine new agencies and a bank , to an annual summit of eu and mediterranean countries with a joint presidency and a small secretariat . barroso applauded the idea , saying the new proposal would not divide the eu into northern and southern sections . " we have said from the beginning it was a very good idea to have more commitment of the european union regarding the mediterranean , " he said .
" at the same time , it is important that all member states of the eu are engaged in it .
so it seems now the conditions are there to move forward . " austrian chancellor alfred gusenbauer said the idea " does n't do any harm , " but added : " what matters to us is that it 's not some special grill party for a few member states .

" i specifically support the german automobile industry , " she said , stressing that countries like germany , whose automobile industry makes larger cars , should not be discriminated against when the climate targets and fines are in force . summing up the view of many of his colleagues , bulgarian prime minister sergei stanishev said the eu needed to " strike a balance " in its bid to cut co2 emissions . leaders were also expected to discuss how to make financial markets more transparent in the wake of the recent turmoil and take stock of a number of foreign policy issues , including afghanistan and the middle east . club med 's could open in july bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some are still skeptical where sarkozy 's mediterranean union is headed but much of the attention was being devoted to french plans to create a union between countries with borders on the mediterranean sea . after fierce resistance from berlin , french president nicolas sarkozy scaled the plan down from including only states bordering the mediterranean , with nine new agencies and a bank , to an annual summit of eu and mediterranean countries with a joint presidency and a small secretariat . barroso applauded the idea , saying the new proposal would not divide the eu into northern and southern sections . " we have said from the beginning it was a very good idea to have more commitment of the european union regarding the mediterranean , " he said .
" at the same time , it is important that all member states of the eu are engaged in it .
so it seems now the conditions are there to move forward . " austrian chancellor alfred gusenbauer said the idea " does n't do any harm , " but added : " what matters to us is that it 's not some special grill party for a few member states . " the union for the mediterranean is expected to be formally launched in july , when france takes over the rotating presidency of the eu from slovenia . dw staff -lrb- sms -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

and not just in saudi arabia , where christian immigrants from asia suffer extreme religious discrimination , but also in more liberal muslim countries such as turkey .
it therefore seems fair to say that the islam conference initiated by the german interior minister 18 months ago could serve as an inspiration to a number of countries , and not just western ones .

wolfgang schaeuble hopes that improved dialogue between representatives of the state and the muslim community will help advance the integration of germany 's 3 million muslims , which has been neglected for decades .
he is pinning his hopes on recognition of their religion , combined with the belief that the practice of this religion needs to take place within the framework of the german constitution and system of values .
schaeuble should be given due respect for concentrating his contribution to this very difficult dialogue on the basics - and what 's actually possible .
the real problems are tied up with social integration and are the hardest to solve .
teaching islam in german is widely seen as a necessity .

and not just in saudi arabia , where christian immigrants from asia suffer extreme religious discrimination , but also in more liberal muslim countries such as turkey .

wolfgang schaeuble hopes that improved dialogue between representatives of the state and the muslim community will help advance the integration of germany 's 3 million muslims , which has been neglected for decades .

schaeuble should be given due respect for concentrating his contribution to this very difficult dialogue on the basics - and what 's actually possible .
the real problems are tied up with social integration and are the hardest to solve .
teaching islam in german is widely seen as a necessity .

there is still so much that has yet to be agreed on , as becomes apparent again and again .
the process of dialogue kick-started by the islam conference is important .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de balkans -pipe- 14.03.2008 serbia struggles in aftermath of kosovo 's independence großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : nationalist sentiment is fueled by economic difficulties serbia shunned western europe for its support of an independent kosovo .
but the eu is its most important trade partner and now the balkan country is feeling the crunch , both economically and politically . according to opinion polls , 70 percent of serbians are in favor of their county joining the european union .
but in the last elections , half of them voted for the nationalist euroskeptic parties . one reason is the west 's support of independence for kosovo .
another is the nationalists ' populist stance .
they want to undo the country 's recent democratic transformation and win the attention of those who have n't profited from the economic upswing . " these people are discontent because the democratic government treated them with arrogance in the past seven years and did n't want to hear about the problems of the people in the middle of the country , " said former foreign minister goran svilanovic . " distinctively neo-liberal politics makes them unhappy , but the majority of them do n't oppose the eu , " he said . long way to go bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : most serbs support eu membership in comparison to the last decade of war and economic embargos , serbs are living in much better circumstances today .
in 2007 , overall production rose by seven percent over the previous year . nevertheless , they are still far away from the central-european standard of living .
the gross national income in serbia is only about $ 5,500 per capita . the loss of the southern province of kosovo this year was another blow to the serbian economy .
the government , which stepped down as a result of the conflict over the eu 's kosovo policy , can no longer implement their plans to boost the economy .
since nearly all of its important trade partners have recognized the new state , the anti-western attitude in serbia is deterring potential investors . " serbia will experience political turbulence this year , which is why a lot of direct foreign investment ca n't be expected , " said belgrade economist sasa djogovic but the foreign companies that are already in serbia wo n't pull out , added djogovic . " that 's especially true of the finance sector , " he said .
" for them , serbia 's transformation market is very lucrative due to the high demand for capital . " unfair bank practices bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " free kosova " is n't bringing more coca-cola to serbia after a decade and a half of poverty , serbs are just starting to purchase new furniture and household appliances - but they have to pay a high price to borrow money .
currently , austrian , greek and italian firms dominate the bank sector . " brussels ' tolerance of the business practices of european banks in serbia is unacceptable , " said political scientist dusan janjic . " raiffeisen bank , credit agricole , societe generale and hvb are representatives of europe here , but for the people of serbia they are plunderers .
they charge the highest interest rates in europe and charge double interest via bogus firms in austria , " he said . on the other hands , the banks are reluctant to approve corporate loans .
the most important employers continue to be large state-run companies and the few trade monopolies .
the state is too weak to confront oligarchies and many of the state-run companies , like oil , end up being sold to russian conglomerates at low prices . alternative strategies " you ca n't really expect serbia to be able to export retail products to the european union , " said djogovic . " we 'll continue to send resources to the industrial nations , but we should also import technologies from these countries in order to become more competitive ourselves .
instead we import mass produced goods , " he said . as an alternative , serbia could explore new markets , or return to forgotten markets , like north africa , suggested the economist . filip slavkovic -lrb- kjb -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

but the eu is its most important trade partner and now the balkan country is feeling the crunch , both economically and politically . according to opinion polls , 70 percent of serbians are in favor of their county joining the european union .
but in the last elections , half of them voted for the nationalist euroskeptic parties . one reason is the west 's support of independence for kosovo .
another is the nationalists ' populist stance .
they want to undo the country 's recent democratic transformation and win the attention of those who have n't profited from the economic upswing . " these people are discontent because the democratic government treated them with arrogance in the past seven years and did n't want to hear about the problems of the people in the middle of the country , " said former foreign minister goran svilanovic .

in 2007 , overall production rose by seven percent over the previous year . nevertheless , they are still far away from the central-european standard of living .
the gross national income in serbia is only about $ 5,500 per capita . the loss of the southern province of kosovo this year was another blow to the serbian economy .
the government , which stepped down as a result of the conflict over the eu 's kosovo policy , can no longer implement their plans to boost the economy .
since nearly all of its important trade partners have recognized the new state , the anti-western attitude in serbia is deterring potential investors . " serbia will experience political turbulence this year , which is why a lot of direct foreign investment ca n't be expected , " said belgrade economist sasa djogovic but the foreign companies that are already in serbia wo n't pull out , added djogovic .

the most important employers continue to be large state-run companies and the few trade monopolies .
the state is too weak to confront oligarchies and many of the state-run companies , like oil , end up being sold to russian conglomerates at low prices . alternative strategies " you ca n't really expect serbia to be able to export retail products to the european union , " said djogovic . " we 'll continue to send resources to the industrial nations , but we should also import technologies from these countries in order to become more competitive ourselves .

they want to undo the country 's recent democratic transformation and win the attention of those who have n't profited from the economic upswing . " these people are discontent because the democratic government treated them with arrogance in the past seven years and did n't want to hear about the problems of the people in the middle of the country , " said former foreign minister goran svilanovic . " distinctively neo-liberal politics makes them unhappy , but the majority of them do n't oppose the eu , " he said . long way to go bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : most serbs support eu membership in comparison to the last decade of war and economic embargos , serbs are living in much better circumstances today .
in 2007 , overall production rose by seven percent over the previous year . nevertheless , they are still far away from the central-european standard of living .
the gross national income in serbia is only about $ 5,500 per capita . the loss of the southern province of kosovo this year was another blow to the serbian economy .
the government , which stepped down as a result of the conflict over the eu 's kosovo policy , can no longer implement their plans to boost the economy .
since nearly all of its important trade partners have recognized the new state , the anti-western attitude in serbia is deterring potential investors . " serbia will experience political turbulence this year , which is why a lot of direct foreign investment ca n't be expected , " said belgrade economist sasa djogovic but the foreign companies that are already in serbia wo n't pull out , added djogovic . " that 's especially true of the finance sector , " he said .
" for them , serbia 's transformation market is very lucrative due to the high demand for capital . " unfair bank practices bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " free kosova " is n't bringing more coca-cola to serbia after a decade and a half of poverty , serbs are just starting to purchase new furniture and household appliances - but they have to pay a high price to borrow money .
currently , austrian , greek and italian firms dominate the bank sector . " brussels ' tolerance of the business practices of european banks in serbia is unacceptable , " said political scientist dusan janjic . " raiffeisen bank , credit agricole , societe generale and hvb are representatives of europe here , but for the people of serbia they are plunderers .
they charge the highest interest rates in europe and charge double interest via bogus firms in austria , " he said . on the other hands , the banks are reluctant to approve corporate loans .
the most important employers continue to be large state-run companies and the few trade monopolies .
the state is too weak to confront oligarchies and many of the state-run companies , like oil , end up being sold to russian conglomerates at low prices . alternative strategies " you ca n't really expect serbia to be able to export retail products to the european union , " said djogovic . " we 'll continue to send resources to the industrial nations , but we should also import technologies from these countries in order to become more competitive ourselves .
instead we import mass produced goods , " he said . as an alternative , serbia could explore new markets , or return to forgotten markets , like north africa , suggested the economist . filip slavkovic -lrb- kjb -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

realistic replicas of weapons can no longer be carried in public , the german government decided , as they can easily be mistaken for the real thing .
the police union said the new law does n't go far enough . for the second time since 2002 , when a student in erfurt killed sixteen people at his former high school , the german government has tightened its weapons law to align with the un firearms protocol .
the plan cleared its final legislative hurdle on friday , march 14 , when it was approved by the upper house of parliament . germany is imposing a ban on carrying realistic-looking imitation firearms in public , as police could mistake them for real weapons in a crisis situation .
the ban mainly applies to so-called softair guns , which function with pressurized gas and are often modeled on real-life counterparts . the head of the german police union -lrb- gdp -rrb- konrad freiberg criticized the law as insufficient .
it 's a scandal that the german government has excluded a nation-wide weapons registry from its reforms , he said . inherited guns must be disabled bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : realistic weapons are allowed at historical festivals under the law , people can still sell , purchase and possess replica firearms , but they must be transported in a closed container .
switchblades and knives with a blade longer than 12 centimeters -lrb- 4.7 inches -rrb- may also not be carried in public . violators face fines of up to 10,000 euros -lrb- $ 15,600 -rrb- .
exceptions , however , will be made for historical re-enactments . toy weapons that can not be mistaken for real guns are not affected by the law . furthermore , the new weapons law places restrictions on firearms inherited as of april 1 , 2008 .

victory for either side could have dramatic effects on the islamic republic 's relations with the west . parliamentary elections ended on friday night in iran after 15 hours following the interior ministry 's decision to extend the voting time five times from 6 p.m. to 11 p.m. local time in response to what was proclaimed to be public demand .

with a total of 4,400 candidates running for 290 seats and with votes being cast manually , the first results from the provinces were expected to be announced by saturday noon , while results for the politically important tehran constituency were not expected before monday .
the first to vote was iran 's supreme leader ayatollah ali khamenei who asked the people to determine their political future by going to the polls .
former iranian president akbar hashemi-rafsanjani voted in the morning and called on the people to vote in order to strengthen the legislature 's power .

president ahmadinejad cut short his state visit to senegal to be in tehran for the elections .
immediately after arrival , he rushed to the lorzadeh mosque in south-eastern tehran to cast his vote .
" billions of eyes -lsb- in the world -rsb- are focused on us to see how we determine our political destiny by ourselves in these elections , " ahmadinejad said . „ many -lsb- islamic -rsb- countries look for a model country -lsb- to follow -rsb- and have chosen iran as their model , " the president added .

meanwhile , interior minister mostafa poumohammadi told press tv that final results would be announced within three or four days , starting first with the smaller provinces and later the big cities .
the votes in the provinces are counted by hand .

the elections were being held one week before the persian new year -lsb- march 21 -rsb- and many iranians were still busy with new year shopping and preparations , which might have a major impact on the turnout .

" it would have been unthinkable for the summit would have remained silent on this , " sarkozy concluded . global financial markets have been gripped with extreme volatility amid concerns that tight credit conditions are threatening some finance houses and record-breaking runs for the euro , oil and gold . commission chief vows ecb will take action bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : barroso attempted to quell fears over financial instability as fears grew of a recession in the us economy and the knock-on effects on the world 's nerve-wracked financial markets , european commission chief jose manuel barroso tried to instill calm by telling the summit that the european central bank -lrb- ecb -rrb- would take control of the situation should it be required to . " the ecb will do what is necessary to secure financial stability , " barroso said . the eu leaders also broached the subject of action in the fight against climate change during the two-day summit and at the end agreed to wrap up negotiations on ambitious targets to cut energy use and fight global warming by the end of the year . " we committed ourselves to finishing negotiating on this package by the end of this year and by doing this we made a huge step forward , " said slovenian prime minister janez jansa , whose country holds the european union 's rotating presidency .
" we are convinced that the costs of these measures will be much lower than if we do n't act .

eu member states have committed to go to 30 percent if other countries match them . in the upcoming negotiations on the details of meeting those goals , jansa said : " we need to take into account the different positions of the member states and their needs for economic growth . " in another green move , the eu leaders agreed to support the development of environmentally-friendly products by reducing the level of vat on them . the proposal , first made by british prime minister gordon brown , " will start the debate in many member states about how and whether household goods ... can incentivize consumer behavior towards buying energy-efficient and environmentally friendly goods and services , " brown said . environmental vat on eu agenda bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : brown 's " green tax " idea made a cautious appearance under the decision , the eu 's executive body , the european commission , is tasked with " reflecting " on " the best way to support the development of clean products by evoking the question of environmental vat , " sarkozy said . but the proposal is unlikely to lead to concrete measures soon .
vat is a sensitive issue , since much of the eu 's common budget comes from the vat which consumers pay in each member state , and any decisions on changing rates have to be approved unanimously . " people are being persuaded by the argument that we should look at this very carefully , " brown said .
" vat is a uniquely european tax . ...
we made substantial progress in only two days and i believe that over the next few months other countries will join the debate .

" the barcelona process is the name of the eu 's 13-year-old policy which deals with the bloc 's southern neighbors and which many critics say has so far failed to deliver . the original " club med , " as first conceived a year ago by french president nicolas sarkozy , envisaged uniting israelis and syrians , turks and spaniards , italians and libyans , and making them work together on such diverse issues as migration , the environment or the fight against terrorism . but the latest draft of the proposal , brokered by germany earlier this week and submitted to leaders over dinner on thursday , includes all of the eu 's member states and vaguely talks about " projects with an accent on regional cooperation . " concerns over eu funds the downsizing came after eu countries with no borders on the mediterranean expressed skepticism at the proposal , with member states from eastern europe particularly concerned that it would divert precious eu funds away from their region . in friday 's draft conclusions , the european commission , " is invited to present to the council of eu leaders the necessary proposals for defining the modalities of what will be called ' barcelona process : union for the mediterranean " ' in view of a special summit to be convened in paris on july 13 . sarkozy nevertheless welcomed the compromise , pointing out that the new organization will for the first time give a strong voice to middle eastern and north african leaders in the way money in the region is spent . he noted that the new political structure will be co-chaired by an eu member and a non-eu member .

the iranian vote pitted the ruling ultra-conservative faction close to president mahmoud ahmadinejad against reformists close to former president mohammad khatami and a conservative faction headed by former chief nuclear negotiator , ali larijani .
with a total of 4,400 candidates running for 290 seats and with votes being cast manually , the first results from the provinces were expected to be announced by saturday noon , while results for the politically important tehran constituency were not expected before monday .
the first to vote was iran 's supreme leader ayatollah ali khamenei who asked the people to determine their political future by going to the polls .

ahmadinejad 's rivals urge public to vote bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : rafsanjani is a fierce opponent of ahmadinejad " if you do not vote , then those whom you do not want will get into the parliament again , " said the cleric who is a strong opponent of ahmadinejad .
" the new parliament should definitely increase its supervision -lsb- of the government 's performance -rsb- , " rafsanjani added .
president ahmadinejad cut short his state visit to senegal to be in tehran for the elections .
immediately after arrival , he rushed to the lorzadeh mosque in south-eastern tehran to cast his vote .
" billions of eyes -lsb- in the world -rsb- are focused on us to see how we determine our political destiny by ourselves in these elections , " ahmadinejad said . „ many -lsb- islamic -rsb- countries look for a model country -lsb- to follow -rsb- and have chosen iran as their model , " the president added .
the parliamentary elections are widely regarded as a test for ahmadinejad and an assessment of his performance in the 30 months of his presidency .
failure on economic reforms threatens president bildunterschrift : mahmoud ahmadinejad faces a referendum on his 30-month presidency the main concern for voters is the economy as ahmadinejad has failed to realize his economic reforms .
despite drastically increasing oil prices , inflation - ranging between 20 to 30 percent - is higher than before summer 2005 .
meanwhile , interior minister mostafa poumohammadi told press tv that final results would be announced within three or four days , starting first with the smaller provinces and later the big cities .
the votes in the provinces are counted by hand .
in the capital tehran the counting has for the first time been computerized but there will be manual counting as well for reconfirmation .
claims of high turnout go unconfirmed bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : iranians tend to vote enthusiastically in elections in tehran , witnesses reported that a large number of people had gone to the polling stations in the southern part of the capital early on friday , while in northern tehran people usually prefer to vote in the afternoon .
the elections were being held one week before the persian new year -lsb- march 21 -rsb- and many iranians were still busy with new year shopping and preparations , which might have a major impact on the turnout .
the interior ministry called the turnout so far " magnificent " and state media said that at least 60 percent of the electorate had so far voted .
these turnout claims could not be confirmed by neutral observers . dpa news agency -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

and then , moreover , taking the opportunity to promote better integration of saudi arabia 's christian minority , ignoring public prejudices and protests against the building of new , strange-looking churches in their neighborhoods to emphasize the principle of religious freedom and call for christianity classes in saudi schools . # b # it 's a wholly unlikely scenario .
and not just in saudi arabia , where christian immigrants from asia suffer extreme religious discrimination , but also in more liberal muslim countries such as turkey .
it therefore seems fair to say that the islam conference initiated by the german interior minister 18 months ago could serve as an inspiration to a number of countries , and not just western ones .
the project 's goals are politically highly relevant .
wolfgang schaeuble hopes that improved dialogue between representatives of the state and the muslim community will help advance the integration of germany 's 3 million muslims , which has been neglected for decades .
he is pinning his hopes on recognition of their religion , combined with the belief that the practice of this religion needs to take place within the framework of the german constitution and system of values .
schaeuble should be given due respect for concentrating his contribution to this very difficult dialogue on the basics - and what 's actually possible .
the real problems are tied up with social integration and are the hardest to solve .
teaching islam in german is widely seen as a necessity .
but the various germans states have yet to agree on what form it might take - and so do muslims .
there is still so much that has yet to be agreed on , as becomes apparent again and again .
the process of dialogue kick-started by the islam conference is important .
but this process will require reserves of patience from everyone involved .

with a total of 4,400 candidates running for 290 seats and with votes being cast manually , the first results from the provinces were expected to be announced by saturday noon , while results for the politically important tehran constituency were not expected before monday .
the first to vote was iran 's supreme leader ayatollah ali khamenei who asked the people to determine their political future by going to the polls .
former iranian president akbar hashemi-rafsanjani voted in the morning and called on the people to vote in order to strengthen the legislature 's power .
ahmadinejad 's rivals urge public to vote bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : rafsanjani is a fierce opponent of ahmadinejad " if you do not vote , then those whom you do not want will get into the parliament again , " said the cleric who is a strong opponent of ahmadinejad .
" the new parliament should definitely increase its supervision -lsb- of the government 's performance -rsb- , " rafsanjani added .
president ahmadinejad cut short his state visit to senegal to be in tehran for the elections .
immediately after arrival , he rushed to the lorzadeh mosque in south-eastern tehran to cast his vote .
" billions of eyes -lsb- in the world -rsb- are focused on us to see how we determine our political destiny by ourselves in these elections , " ahmadinejad said . „ many -lsb- islamic -rsb- countries look for a model country -lsb- to follow -rsb- and have chosen iran as their model , " the president added .
the parliamentary elections are widely regarded as a test for ahmadinejad and an assessment of his performance in the 30 months of his presidency .
failure on economic reforms threatens president bildunterschrift : mahmoud ahmadinejad faces a referendum on his 30-month presidency the main concern for voters is the economy as ahmadinejad has failed to realize his economic reforms .
despite drastically increasing oil prices , inflation - ranging between 20 to 30 percent - is higher than before summer 2005 .
meanwhile , interior minister mostafa poumohammadi told press tv that final results would be announced within three or four days , starting first with the smaller provinces and later the big cities .
the votes in the provinces are counted by hand .
in the capital tehran the counting has for the first time been computerized but there will be manual counting as well for reconfirmation .
claims of high turnout go unconfirmed bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : iranians tend to vote enthusiastically in elections in tehran , witnesses reported that a large number of people had gone to the polling stations in the southern part of the capital early on friday , while in northern tehran people usually prefer to vote in the afternoon .
the elections were being held one week before the persian new year -lsb- march 21 -rsb- and many iranians were still busy with new year shopping and preparations , which might have a major impact on the turnout .
the interior ministry called the turnout so far " magnificent " and state media said that at least 60 percent of the electorate had so far voted .
these turnout claims could not be confirmed by neutral observers . dpa news agency -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

his agenda 2010 is still splitting german politics as the spd loses ground . the liberal market reforms gerhard schroeder announced on march 14 , 2003 led to talk of social inequality in germany and the emergence of a new underclass .
nevertheless , unemployment is now down and economic growth is up . while center-left members of his social democratic party praised the measures this week , the spd 's far-left wing , the left party and the labor unions had harsh words for the agenda 2010 . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : schroeder still stand by his agenda 2010 spd party leader kurt beck said thursday in a speech marking the anniversary of the reforms that schroeder 's address five years ago had signalled " the start of major successes in the areas of economy and the labor market . " " now we have to work towards bringing the agenda 's successes to all the people , " said beck , whose popularity is at an all-time low , according to several recent surveys . foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier said there had been no alternative to the far-reaching reforms made to the social and labor systems over the past five years . " we had to choose this policy , knowing that it could lead to pain and loss , " he said . reaganomics from the left the agenda 2010 , which has been compared to reaganomics in the us and thatcherism in britain , aimed to improve economic growth and reduce unemployment by slashing not only income tax but also unemployment benefits and pensions . the move met with approval from the conservative christian democratic and the liberal , free-market free democratic party , but immediately drew resistance from schroeder 's own social democrats .
he 'd been elected in 2002 promising not to cut social benefits . thousands of the spd 's center-left members abandoned the party as a result , though the far-left stayed on , shifting the party 's core .
due to inner-party pressure , schroeder resigned as party chair in february 2004 .
he remained chancellor , however , until 2005 when he was forced to acknowledge defeat and call for early elections , paving the way for christian democratic chancellor angela merkel . schroeder 's massive cuts , particularly to unemployment benefits , led to talk of deepening economic inequality and the emergence of a new underclass . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : cuts to unemployment benefits spurred mass protests the discourse was fuelled when the friedrich ebert foundation , a political foundation closely associated with the spd , published a study in late 2006 indicating that four percent of people in western germany and 20 percent in eastern germany were living in " precarious " economic conditions and felt " left behind " by politicians and society . nevertheless , unemployment sank from 10.6 percent in 2005 - the highest it had been since german reunification - to 8.3 percent in 2007 . schroeder warns against leftward lean former chancellor schroeder on thursday defended his agenda 2010 as being " good and right . "
referring to the fundamental shift to the left that his party has taken , in part due to the controversy surrounding the reforms , he added that " the spd can only achieve a majority if it 's anchored in the middle of society and does n't abandon this position . " franz-juergen weise , chairman of the federal employment office , said in an interview with the friday edition of the leipziger zeitung that the structural reorganization of his agency has resulted in " 18 million euros -lrb- $ 27.75 million -rrb- in savings , solid financing for unemployment insurance -lsb- and -rsb- lower premiums . " in contrast , michael sommer , the head of the federation of german trade unions , commented that the agenda 2010 had widened the economic gap in german society . critique from spd 's biggest rival bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the left party has benefitted from the spd 's popularity drop the bulk of the criticism , however , came from the left .
today , hundreds of thousands of full-time employees " earn less than those who receive hartz iv unemployment benefits , " said spd member ottmar schreiner in zdf . " that was made possible in part by the agenda , " he said . oskar lafontaine , who left the spd in 2005 to found the growing left party , condemned the agenda , saying that " five years of agenda 2010 mean five years of neo-liberal dead-ends and the destruction of social peace and the people 's trust in politics . " the success of lafontaine 's new left party , comprised in part of dissatisfied former spd members , represents a mounting political threat to the spd .

but bulgarians are n't interested in hearing about their politicians ' pasts . the head of the government , four vice-premiers and 25 democratically elected ministers are among those with a connection to the secret service .
current president georgi parvanov worked under the code name gotse ; his predecessor jean videnov was also a special agent . former spies are especially prevalent in the foreign ministry and in diplomatic service .
three former ministers , 13 deputies and even bulgaria 's current nato ambassador were all part of the communist intelligence cadre . an investigative committee commissioned by parliament examined 673 government officials who had served since the fall of the iron curtain in 1990 and found that 108 were linked to communist intelligence . " informal networks that were linked to the repressive communist apparatus … continue to lead to corruption , " sonja schueler from the southeast europe association told deutsche welle .
" personal loyalties determine the decisions that are made and the socio-economic development of the country . " little interest in opened files bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : both parvanov -lrb- right -rrb- and putin had worked for their countries ' secret service the probe was made possible by a new law that is meant to ensure access to the files , but does n't take action against the ex-informants .
they are free to continue working in politics .
the situation is similar in germany , where the government committee responsible for opening the secret service files is only charged with informing the public . " the decision about the consequences is in the hands of those who put the politicians in office , " said andreas schulze , spokesman for the german organization that researches the former east german stasi . nevertheless , public curiosity around the topic is n't particularly strong in bulgaria .
all across central and eastern europe , the younger generation has n't shown much interest in digging up their country 's communist past . a wide variety of reasons come into play - the inability of historians to analyze the communist period objectively , low education levels among the population and the dependence of people 's career success on the system are just a few . older generations also tend to be skeptical of opening the secret files .
the entire soviet bloc was based on a foundation of unofficial informants , which means that plenty of ordinary citizens turned in information about friends , neighbors or acquaintances .
some of them are afraid that the skeletons in their closets will be exposed . close ties to the kgb bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the bulgarian secret service worked closely with the kgb not only are the activities of the secret police considered today to be human rights violations , but some of its elements were unconstitutional even during the communist regime .

the 36 teams of germany 's top two divisions , boosted by revenue from the sixth successive season of increased crowd figures , also managed to reduce their liabilities by more than 10 percent from 662.5 to under 600 million euros .
all 18 bundesliga clubs recorded profits after tax as did 12 second division clubs , according to figures released by the german soccer league -lrb- dfl -rrb- on thursday .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : seifert was full of praise for the bundesliga 's performance the dfl also announced that german clubs benefited from a combined extra income of around 50 million euros from the 2006 world cup in germany but stressed that overall strength in the top two divisions was decisive in the record numbers .
the dfl praised the economic direction that german clubs were taking .
" it was an exceptional year .
as a market and as organization , we are in better shape than ever before , " dfl business manager christian seifert told reporters .
" our place among europe 's top leagues is secure for the midterm . "
debt-ridden euro rivals hold advantage on the field one problem faced by the league , according to the dfl , was a competitive disadvantage on the field .
many rival european clubs , awash in debt , spent far more of their budget on players .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : huge crowds boosted profits for the top two leagues the gap could best be highlighted by the number of german clubs left in the quarter-finals of the champions league - just one , schalke 04 who face barcelona in the next round - compared to four from the english premier league .
werder bremen 's exit from the uefa cup on thursday night left just bayern munich and bayer leverkusen to fly the flag in the last eight .
the dfl report also showed that nearly 35,000 people are now employed in professional soccer in germany , 700 more than a year ago .

the 36 teams of germany 's top two divisions , boosted by revenue from the sixth successive season of increased crowd figures , also managed to reduce their liabilities by more than 10 percent from 662.5 to under 600 million euros .
all 18 bundesliga clubs recorded profits after tax as did 12 second division clubs , according to figures released by the german soccer league -lrb- dfl -rrb- on thursday .

" it was an exceptional year .
as a market and as organization , we are in better shape than ever before , " dfl business manager christian seifert told reporters .
" our place among europe 's top leagues is secure for the midterm . "

many rival european clubs , awash in debt , spent far more of their budget on players .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : huge crowds boosted profits for the top two leagues the gap could best be highlighted by the number of german clubs left in the quarter-finals of the champions league - just one , schalke 04 who face barcelona in the next round - compared to four from the english premier league .
werder bremen 's exit from the uefa cup on thursday night left just bayern munich and bayer leverkusen to fly the flag in the last eight .
the dfl report also showed that nearly 35,000 people are now employed in professional soccer in germany , 700 more than a year ago .
it also showed that of the record 16.3 million spectators who attended games in the 2006/2007 season , the proportion of female fans increased from 21 to 23 percent . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

but the eu is its most important trade partner and now the balkan country is feeling the crunch , both economically and politically . according to opinion polls , 70 percent of serbians are in favor of their county joining the european union .
but in the last elections , half of them voted for the nationalist euroskeptic parties . one reason is the west 's support of independence for kosovo .
another is the nationalists ' populist stance .
they want to undo the country 's recent democratic transformation and win the attention of those who have n't profited from the economic upswing . " these people are discontent because the democratic government treated them with arrogance in the past seven years and did n't want to hear about the problems of the people in the middle of the country , " said former foreign minister goran svilanovic . " distinctively neo-liberal politics makes them unhappy , but the majority of them do n't oppose the eu , " he said . long way to go bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : most serbs support eu membership in comparison to the last decade of war and economic embargos , serbs are living in much better circumstances today .

the gross national income in serbia is only about $ 5,500 per capita . the loss of the southern province of kosovo this year was another blow to the serbian economy .
the government , which stepped down as a result of the conflict over the eu 's kosovo policy , can no longer implement their plans to boost the economy .
since nearly all of its important trade partners have recognized the new state , the anti-western attitude in serbia is deterring potential investors .

currently , austrian , greek and italian firms dominate the bank sector . " brussels ' tolerance of the business practices of european banks in serbia is unacceptable , " said political scientist dusan janjic . " raiffeisen bank , credit agricole , societe generale and hvb are representatives of europe here , but for the people of serbia they are plunderers .
they charge the highest interest rates in europe and charge double interest via bogus firms in austria , " he said . on the other hands , the banks are reluctant to approve corporate loans .
the most important employers continue to be large state-run companies and the few trade monopolies .
the state is too weak to confront oligarchies and many of the state-run companies , like oil , end up being sold to russian conglomerates at low prices . alternative strategies " you ca n't really expect serbia to be able to export retail products to the european union , " said djogovic . " we 'll continue to send resources to the industrial nations , but we should also import technologies from these countries in order to become more competitive ourselves .
instead we import mass produced goods , " he said . as an alternative , serbia could explore new markets , or return to forgotten markets , like north africa , suggested the economist . filip slavkovic -lrb- kjb -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

but bulgarians are n't interested in hearing about their politicians ' pasts . the head of the government , four vice-premiers and 25 democratically elected ministers are among those with a connection to the secret service .
current president georgi parvanov worked under the code name gotse ; his predecessor jean videnov was also a special agent . former spies are especially prevalent in the foreign ministry and in diplomatic service .
three former ministers , 13 deputies and even bulgaria 's current nato ambassador were all part of the communist intelligence cadre . an investigative committee commissioned by parliament examined 673 government officials who had served since the fall of the iron curtain in 1990 and found that 108 were linked to communist intelligence . " informal networks that were linked to the repressive communist apparatus … continue to lead to corruption , " sonja schueler from the southeast europe association told deutsche welle .
" personal loyalties determine the decisions that are made and the socio-economic development of the country . " little interest in opened files bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : both parvanov -lrb- right -rrb- and putin had worked for their countries ' secret service the probe was made possible by a new law that is meant to ensure access to the files , but does n't take action against the ex-informants .
they are free to continue working in politics .
the situation is similar in germany , where the government committee responsible for opening the secret service files is only charged with informing the public . " the decision about the consequences is in the hands of those who put the politicians in office , " said andreas schulze , spokesman for the german organization that researches the former east german stasi . nevertheless , public curiosity around the topic is n't particularly strong in bulgaria .
all across central and eastern europe , the younger generation has n't shown much interest in digging up their country 's communist past . a wide variety of reasons come into play - the inability of historians to analyze the communist period objectively , low education levels among the population and the dependence of people 's career success on the system are just a few . older generations also tend to be skeptical of opening the secret files .
the entire soviet bloc was based on a foundation of unofficial informants , which means that plenty of ordinary citizens turned in information about friends , neighbors or acquaintances .
some of them are afraid that the skeletons in their closets will be exposed . close ties to the kgb bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the bulgarian secret service worked closely with the kgb not only are the activities of the secret police considered today to be human rights violations , but some of its elements were unconstitutional even during the communist regime .
the secret service was , for example , not subject to the judicial system but was run directly by the communist party . furthermore , the fact that the bulgarian secret police effectively functioned as an arm of russia 's kgb undermined the country 's raison d 'etat .
not to mention that bulgaria 's foreign intelligence was also involved in operations where blood was spilled . communist east germany 's last secret police chief march wolf wrote that , in the 1950s , his bulgarian and polish counterparts were known for having committed the most murders . former spies make europe uneasy bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bout , nicknamed " merchant of death , " was arrested in thailand this week " the bulgarian intelligence service was the one in the former east bloc that worked most closely together with the kgb , " said german journalist and crime expert juergen roth . top-ranking bulgarian politicians ' contacts to the kgb are seen in brussels as a potential security risk , particularly when sensitive topics like eu and nato are on the table .
bulgaria became a member of the european union on jan .
1 , 2007 . the old ties have come into the limelight this week for another reason : russian arms trader victor bout , who supposedly had excellent contacts to the soviet and later to the russian secret service , had delivered a load of weapons worth several hundred million dollars to bulgaria just before he was arrested on march 6 . dw staff -lrb- kjb -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

they were also due to discuss ways to revive their economies during a summit in brussels . energy security and global warming also featured prominently with eu foreign policy chief javier solana telling the heads of the eu 's 27 member states that climate change had turned from a threat to a reality . climate change is now impacting the conflict in darfur , migration from flood-prone bangladesh and hopes for stability in the middle east , according to a new eu report . european commission president jose manuel barroso said he hoped governments would agree on a common european energy policy . " i think it 's very important also to fulfill the goals on climate change , " he said ahead of the summit .
" one year ago we adopted -lrb- a proposal -rrb- unanimously , now we have to translate this commitment in concrete ways . " the eu executive has recently put forward controversial proposals designed to make energy markets more competitive by splitting up companies which both sell energy to consumers and manage power lines . on climate change , leaders are being asked to cut the bloc 's emissions of the greenhouse gas carbon dioxide -lrb- co2 -rrb- to at least 20 percent below 1990 levels - a legally-binding goal they set themselves a year ago . protecting industry bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel does n't want german carmakers to bear the brunt of the eu goals while they were expected to broadly endorse a commission proposal presented in january , leaders were expected to steer clear of its most controversial aspect : how to share the burden of meeting that target . seen as a champion in the fight against climate change at last summer 's g8 summit , german chancellor angela merkel said she would not allow germany 's car industry to be excessively affected by the bloc 's climate goals . " i specifically support the german automobile industry , " she said , stressing that countries like germany , whose automobile industry makes larger cars , should not be discriminated against when the climate targets and fines are in force . summing up the view of many of his colleagues , bulgarian prime minister sergei stanishev said the eu needed to " strike a balance " in its bid to cut co2 emissions . leaders were also expected to discuss how to make financial markets more transparent in the wake of the recent turmoil and take stock of a number of foreign policy issues , including afghanistan and the middle east . club med 's could open in july bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some are still skeptical where sarkozy 's mediterranean union is headed but much of the attention was being devoted to french plans to create a union between countries with borders on the mediterranean sea . after fierce resistance from berlin , french president nicolas sarkozy scaled the plan down from including only states bordering the mediterranean , with nine new agencies and a bank , to an annual summit of eu and mediterranean countries with a joint presidency and a small secretariat . barroso applauded the idea , saying the new proposal would not divide the eu into northern and southern sections . " we have said from the beginning it was a very good idea to have more commitment of the european union regarding the mediterranean , " he said .
" at the same time , it is important that all member states of the eu are engaged in it .
so it seems now the conditions are there to move forward . " austrian chancellor alfred gusenbauer said the idea " does n't do any harm , " but added : " what matters to us is that it 's not some special grill party for a few member states .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de culture -pipe- 14.03.2008 marx continues to influence 125 years after his death großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : many of karl marx 's theories on politics , society and economics still ring true today friday , march 14 , marks the 125th anniversary of the death of german philosopher and political economist karl marx .
marx is still regarded as hugely influential to the development of 20th century thought . both a scholar and a political activist , marx addressed a wide range of political as well as social issues , and is known for , among other things , his analysis of history .
the interpretations of his theories , particularly those on political economy , have in the course of history generated decades of debate , inspired revolutions and cast him as both devil and deity in political and academic circles . maligned by some , misunderstood by others and celebrated as one of the world 's great thinkers by many more , marx continues to be a divisive and much discussed individual .
while there has been a substantial revival of interest in his theories since the end of the cold war , mainly those which deal with the volatility and shape of capitalism , the question remains as to whether a man who died 125 years ago still has any relevance today . ian hunt , the director of the center for applied philosophy at the flinders university of southern australia , believes that marx and his insights into the capitalist system in particular still have a place in contemporary society . " marx 's thoughts on the exploitative nature of the relationship between capitalist employers and their employees ring true today , " he said .
" the proletariat , or those without property , continues to seek employment from those with property .
control over private investment continues to give the capitalist class decisive influence over government and sufficient control over the supply of labor to ensure that it is sold by employees on terms favorable to the increase of the wealth of employers . " hunt said he believes that marx 's theories on the exploitative nature of the capitalist employment relationship - which skews industrial development toward using up human and natural resources for short-term gain - apply today in the form of climate and energy issues and " the problem of the despotic form of the employer-employee relationship under capitalism . " marx foresaw impact of private dominance bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : marx wrote about the factors which influenced climate change " marx 's analysis of the foundations of a capitalist society raises questions of the justice of the distribution of wealth , and therefore also of income , in capitalist societies , which are even more acute in the modern world than in his own time , " hunt added .
" it also raises questions about the environmental consequences of private dominance of investment that are even more acute today than in the time marx wrote . " simon tormey , the co-director of the center for the study of social and global justice -lrb- cssgj -rrb- at nottingham university , also believes marx was ahead of his time . " the world is pretty much how marx described it 150 years ago , which is quite impressive in itself , " tormey said . " this is to say that we now have a more or less integrated world capitalist system , with a global rich and global poor - as marx predicted .
there is huge exploitation across all societies - the proliferation of sweatshops and export processing zones are all very much in keeping with marx ’ s account . " the peasantry is being systematically wiped out in a global process of dispossession , and of course social democracy , which started as a form of ultra moderate ' marxism , ' marxism-lite if you like , is in retreat in all areas where it once enjoyed hegemony , ” he added . tormey also explained that marx 's theory of class struggle is hugely prevalent in today 's current economic atmosphere . violent class struggle continues off media radar bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : class struggle is evident in often violent industrial action " there are workers there who have been denied trade union representation , who have been denied holiday pay , health care , and other benefits , " he said . " go into any business and you will see owners and workers - the owners can not do without the workers and they want to pay them as little as they can for the most amount of product / output ; the workers want the most they can get . this is class struggle . " the bosses have the laws on their side , the politicians , the state , and the media , " he added . " they are able to contain struggle so that it does n't disrupt society - for the most part . however , beyond the wealthy countries , the picture is very different .
open and violent struggles are commonplace in much of the world ; strikes , lockouts , and beatings of workers in places like china , indonesia , mexico , south africa , and violent peasant conflicts in places like nandigram , india .
look around : class struggle is everywhere and infects almost every human relation . " as well as economics and politics , marx had a great influence on the way people thought about culture .
while not considered to be a pure cultural theorist , marx 's writings on issues such as aesthetics , communication and interpretation contributed in part to a growing cultural studies movement . modern cultural theorists following marx 's ideas " marx 's influence on today 's cultural theorizing derives more from his social theory , which forms a useful context to theorizing culture , and his philosophical ideas in general , including his method of investigation and reasoning , " said johan fornas , director of the advanced cultural studies institute of sweden -lrb- acsis -rrb- .
" he developed some german and hegelian ideas in an exciting and inspiring direction that are still highly relevant for those of us who are engaged in developing cultural theory . " marx has inspired lots of recent thinkers to never cut theoretical concepts loose from experiences of everyday life and instead to understand the importance of situating knowledge in concrete material , embodied and socially organized practices , always interacting with institutionalized networks of power , " he added . despite the continued relevance of a number of marx 's theories , experts are quick to point out that some have little significance in today 's environment while others have been shown to be way off the mark in some cases . prediction of communist world proved wrong bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : even china has diluted its communism in recent times " marx was convinced that communism would replace capitalism but we don ’ t really see much of a communist movement emerging anywhere today , " tormey said . " so the irony might be that at the moment when marx 's ideas are even more relevant , so the attractiveness of marxism -lrb- or more accurately communism -rrb- as a mobilizing ideology seems in decline .
but this of course can change . " marx 's faith in the generation of informed political opposition from worsening material conditions failed to be realized , but that has not made his work irrelevant , hunt said . " his primary work , ' das kapital , ' still stands out as a wonderfully structured and thought through piece of analysis , drawing on the philosophical and economic thought of his time , " he said .
" its condemnation of the specific injustice of the capitalist system has few peers .
so , as long as there are capitalists , marx will remain relevant . " nick amies send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

marx is still regarded as hugely influential to the development of 20th century thought . both a scholar and a political activist , marx addressed a wide range of political as well as social issues , and is known for , among other things , his analysis of history .
the interpretations of his theories , particularly those on political economy , have in the course of history generated decades of debate , inspired revolutions and cast him as both devil and deity in political and academic circles . maligned by some , misunderstood by others and celebrated as one of the world 's great thinkers by many more , marx continues to be a divisive and much discussed individual .
while there has been a substantial revival of interest in his theories since the end of the cold war , mainly those which deal with the volatility and shape of capitalism , the question remains as to whether a man who died 125 years ago still has any relevance today . ian hunt , the director of the center for applied philosophy at the flinders university of southern australia , believes that marx and his insights into the capitalist system in particular still have a place in contemporary society . " marx 's thoughts on the exploitative nature of the relationship between capitalist employers and their employees ring true today , " he said .
" the proletariat , or those without property , continues to seek employment from those with property .
control over private investment continues to give the capitalist class decisive influence over government and sufficient control over the supply of labor to ensure that it is sold by employees on terms favorable to the increase of the wealth of employers . " hunt said he believes that marx 's theories on the exploitative nature of the capitalist employment relationship - which skews industrial development toward using up human and natural resources for short-term gain - apply today in the form of climate and energy issues and " the problem of the despotic form of the employer-employee relationship under capitalism . " marx foresaw impact of private dominance bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : marx wrote about the factors which influenced climate change " marx 's analysis of the foundations of a capitalist society raises questions of the justice of the distribution of wealth , and therefore also of income , in capitalist societies , which are even more acute in the modern world than in his own time , " hunt added .
" it also raises questions about the environmental consequences of private dominance of investment that are even more acute today than in the time marx wrote . " simon tormey , the co-director of the center for the study of social and global justice -lrb- cssgj -rrb- at nottingham university , also believes marx was ahead of his time . " the world is pretty much how marx described it 150 years ago , which is quite impressive in itself , " tormey said . " this is to say that we now have a more or less integrated world capitalist system , with a global rich and global poor - as marx predicted .
there is huge exploitation across all societies - the proliferation of sweatshops and export processing zones are all very much in keeping with marx ’ s account . " the peasantry is being systematically wiped out in a global process of dispossession , and of course social democracy , which started as a form of ultra moderate ' marxism , ' marxism-lite if you like , is in retreat in all areas where it once enjoyed hegemony , ” he added . tormey also explained that marx 's theory of class struggle is hugely prevalent in today 's current economic atmosphere . violent class struggle continues off media radar bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : class struggle is evident in often violent industrial action " there are workers there who have been denied trade union representation , who have been denied holiday pay , health care , and other benefits , " he said . " go into any business and you will see owners and workers - the owners can not do without the workers and they want to pay them as little as they can for the most amount of product / output ; the workers want the most they can get . this is class struggle . " the bosses have the laws on their side , the politicians , the state , and the media , " he added . " they are able to contain struggle so that it does n't disrupt society - for the most part . however , beyond the wealthy countries , the picture is very different .

marx is still regarded as hugely influential to the development of 20th century thought . both a scholar and a political activist , marx addressed a wide range of political as well as social issues , and is known for , among other things , his analysis of history .
the interpretations of his theories , particularly those on political economy , have in the course of history generated decades of debate , inspired revolutions and cast him as both devil and deity in political and academic circles . maligned by some , misunderstood by others and celebrated as one of the world 's great thinkers by many more , marx continues to be a divisive and much discussed individual .
while there has been a substantial revival of interest in his theories since the end of the cold war , mainly those which deal with the volatility and shape of capitalism , the question remains as to whether a man who died 125 years ago still has any relevance today . ian hunt , the director of the center for applied philosophy at the flinders university of southern australia , believes that marx and his insights into the capitalist system in particular still have a place in contemporary society . " marx 's thoughts on the exploitative nature of the relationship between capitalist employers and their employees ring true today , " he said .
" the proletariat , or those without property , continues to seek employment from those with property .
control over private investment continues to give the capitalist class decisive influence over government and sufficient control over the supply of labor to ensure that it is sold by employees on terms favorable to the increase of the wealth of employers . " hunt said he believes that marx 's theories on the exploitative nature of the capitalist employment relationship - which skews industrial development toward using up human and natural resources for short-term gain - apply today in the form of climate and energy issues and " the problem of the despotic form of the employer-employee relationship under capitalism . " marx foresaw impact of private dominance bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : marx wrote about the factors which influenced climate change " marx 's analysis of the foundations of a capitalist society raises questions of the justice of the distribution of wealth , and therefore also of income , in capitalist societies , which are even more acute in the modern world than in his own time , " hunt added .
" it also raises questions about the environmental consequences of private dominance of investment that are even more acute today than in the time marx wrote . " simon tormey , the co-director of the center for the study of social and global justice -lrb- cssgj -rrb- at nottingham university , also believes marx was ahead of his time . " the world is pretty much how marx described it 150 years ago , which is quite impressive in itself , " tormey said . " this is to say that we now have a more or less integrated world capitalist system , with a global rich and global poor - as marx predicted .
there is huge exploitation across all societies - the proliferation of sweatshops and export processing zones are all very much in keeping with marx ’ s account . " the peasantry is being systematically wiped out in a global process of dispossession , and of course social democracy , which started as a form of ultra moderate ' marxism , ' marxism-lite if you like , is in retreat in all areas where it once enjoyed hegemony , ” he added . tormey also explained that marx 's theory of class struggle is hugely prevalent in today 's current economic atmosphere . violent class struggle continues off media radar bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : class struggle is evident in often violent industrial action " there are workers there who have been denied trade union representation , who have been denied holiday pay , health care , and other benefits , " he said . " go into any business and you will see owners and workers - the owners can not do without the workers and they want to pay them as little as they can for the most amount of product / output ; the workers want the most they can get . this is class struggle . " the bosses have the laws on their side , the politicians , the state , and the media , " he added . " they are able to contain struggle so that it does n't disrupt society - for the most part . however , beyond the wealthy countries , the picture is very different .
open and violent struggles are commonplace in much of the world ; strikes , lockouts , and beatings of workers in places like china , indonesia , mexico , south africa , and violent peasant conflicts in places like nandigram , india .
look around : class struggle is everywhere and infects almost every human relation . " as well as economics and politics , marx had a great influence on the way people thought about culture .
while not considered to be a pure cultural theorist , marx 's writings on issues such as aesthetics , communication and interpretation contributed in part to a growing cultural studies movement . modern cultural theorists following marx 's ideas " marx 's influence on today 's cultural theorizing derives more from his social theory , which forms a useful context to theorizing culture , and his philosophical ideas in general , including his method of investigation and reasoning , " said johan fornas , director of the advanced cultural studies institute of sweden -lrb- acsis -rrb- .
" he developed some german and hegelian ideas in an exciting and inspiring direction that are still highly relevant for those of us who are engaged in developing cultural theory . " marx has inspired lots of recent thinkers to never cut theoretical concepts loose from experiences of everyday life and instead to understand the importance of situating knowledge in concrete material , embodied and socially organized practices , always interacting with institutionalized networks of power , " he added . despite the continued relevance of a number of marx 's theories , experts are quick to point out that some have little significance in today 's environment while others have been shown to be way off the mark in some cases . prediction of communist world proved wrong bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : even china has diluted its communism in recent times " marx was convinced that communism would replace capitalism but we don ’ t really see much of a communist movement emerging anywhere today , " tormey said . " so the irony might be that at the moment when marx 's ideas are even more relevant , so the attractiveness of marxism -lrb- or more accurately communism -rrb- as a mobilizing ideology seems in decline .
but this of course can change . " marx 's faith in the generation of informed political opposition from worsening material conditions failed to be realized , but that has not made his work irrelevant , hunt said . " his primary work , ' das kapital , ' still stands out as a wonderfully structured and thought through piece of analysis , drawing on the philosophical and economic thought of his time , " he said .
" its condemnation of the specific injustice of the capitalist system has few peers .
so , as long as there are capitalists , marx will remain relevant . " nick amies send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" it would have been unthinkable for the summit would have remained silent on this , " sarkozy concluded . global financial markets have been gripped with extreme volatility amid concerns that tight credit conditions are threatening some finance houses and record-breaking runs for the euro , oil and gold . commission chief vows ecb will take action bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : barroso attempted to quell fears over financial instability as fears grew of a recession in the us economy and the knock-on effects on the world 's nerve-wracked financial markets , european commission chief jose manuel barroso tried to instill calm by telling the summit that the european central bank -lrb- ecb -rrb- would take control of the situation should it be required to . " the ecb will do what is necessary to secure financial stability , " barroso said . the eu leaders also broached the subject of action in the fight against climate change during the two-day summit and at the end agreed to wrap up negotiations on ambitious targets to cut energy use and fight global warming by the end of the year . " we committed ourselves to finishing negotiating on this package by the end of this year and by doing this we made a huge step forward , " said slovenian prime minister janez jansa , whose country holds the european union 's rotating presidency .
" we are convinced that the costs of these measures will be much lower than if we do n't act . " eu targets year-end for climate package agreement bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the eu is under pressure to deliver on its climate promises the current plan aims to meet the european union 's over-arching goal to reduce emissions of carbon dioxide - the main gas responsible for global warming - by 20 percent by 2020 , compared to 1990 levels .
eu member states have committed to go to 30 percent if other countries match them . in the upcoming negotiations on the details of meeting those goals , jansa said : " we need to take into account the different positions of the member states and their needs for economic growth . " in another green move , the eu leaders agreed to support the development of environmentally-friendly products by reducing the level of vat on them . the proposal , first made by british prime minister gordon brown , " will start the debate in many member states about how and whether household goods ... can incentivize consumer behavior towards buying energy-efficient and environmentally friendly goods and services , " brown said . environmental vat on eu agenda bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : brown 's " green tax " idea made a cautious appearance under the decision , the eu 's executive body , the european commission , is tasked with " reflecting " on " the best way to support the development of clean products by evoking the question of environmental vat , " sarkozy said . but the proposal is unlikely to lead to concrete measures soon .
vat is a sensitive issue , since much of the eu 's common budget comes from the vat which consumers pay in each member state , and any decisions on changing rates have to be approved unanimously . " people are being persuaded by the argument that we should look at this very carefully , " brown said .
" vat is a uniquely european tax . ...
we made substantial progress in only two days and i believe that over the next few months other countries will join the debate . " despite the support of britain and france - two of the eu 's three largest states - some member states oppose the proposal and could well block it . eu backs club med plan under new name bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : sarkozy 's club med plan will go to a summit in paris the eu also formally backed ambitious french plans for a union for the mediterranean , but watered it down to such an extent that it had to be given a new name . according to a last-minute addition to the draft conclusions of their regular spring council in brussels , the new organization is to be called " barcelona process : union for the mediterranean . " the barcelona process is the name of the eu 's 13-year-old policy which deals with the bloc 's southern neighbors and which many critics say has so far failed to deliver . the original " club med , " as first conceived a year ago by french president nicolas sarkozy , envisaged uniting israelis and syrians , turks and spaniards , italians and libyans , and making them work together on such diverse issues as migration , the environment or the fight against terrorism . but the latest draft of the proposal , brokered by germany earlier this week and submitted to leaders over dinner on thursday , includes all of the eu 's member states and vaguely talks about " projects with an accent on regional cooperation . " concerns over eu funds the downsizing came after eu countries with no borders on the mediterranean expressed skepticism at the proposal , with member states from eastern europe particularly concerned that it would divert precious eu funds away from their region . in friday 's draft conclusions , the european commission , " is invited to present to the council of eu leaders the necessary proposals for defining the modalities of what will be called ' barcelona process : union for the mediterranean " ' in view of a special summit to be convened in paris on july 13 . sarkozy nevertheless welcomed the compromise , pointing out that the new organization will for the first time give a strong voice to middle eastern and north african leaders in the way money in the region is spent . he noted that the new political structure will be co-chaired by an eu member and a non-eu member .
" europe will not turn its back on the mediterranean any more , " sarkozy said late thursday . chinese clampdown on tibet causes eu concern bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : reports suggest a chinese crackdown in lhasa , tibet the eu also took the opportunity provided by the summit to express concern about the violent protests taking place in tibet , with germany and britain among those calling for dialogue and restraint . german foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier called for an end to the conflict by peaceful means while his british counterpart david miliband said european governments would be seeking " clarification about what is actually happening on the ground , " adding that " restraint " and " substantive dialogue " were the only way forward . reports coming out of lhasa , the capital of china 's tibet autonomous region , suggest paramilitary riot police intervened to control protests initiated by buddhist monks on the 49th anniversary of a tibetan uprising against chinese rule that was crushed by troops . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

eu member states have committed to go to 30 percent if other countries match them . in the upcoming negotiations on the details of meeting those goals , jansa said : " we need to take into account the different positions of the member states and their needs for economic growth . " in another green move , the eu leaders agreed to support the development of environmentally-friendly products by reducing the level of vat on them . the proposal , first made by british prime minister gordon brown , " will start the debate in many member states about how and whether household goods ... can incentivize consumer behavior towards buying energy-efficient and environmentally friendly goods and services , " brown said . environmental vat on eu agenda bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : brown 's " green tax " idea made a cautious appearance under the decision , the eu 's executive body , the european commission , is tasked with " reflecting " on " the best way to support the development of clean products by evoking the question of environmental vat , " sarkozy said . but the proposal is unlikely to lead to concrete measures soon .

realistic replicas of weapons can no longer be carried in public , the german government decided , as they can easily be mistaken for the real thing .
the police union said the new law does n't go far enough . for the second time since 2002 , when a student in erfurt killed sixteen people at his former high school , the german government has tightened its weapons law to align with the un firearms protocol .
the plan cleared its final legislative hurdle on friday , march 14 , when it was approved by the upper house of parliament . germany is imposing a ban on carrying realistic-looking imitation firearms in public , as police could mistake them for real weapons in a crisis situation .
the ban mainly applies to so-called softair guns , which function with pressurized gas and are often modeled on real-life counterparts . the head of the german police union -lrb- gdp -rrb- konrad freiberg criticized the law as insufficient .
it 's a scandal that the german government has excluded a nation-wide weapons registry from its reforms , he said . inherited guns must be disabled bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : realistic weapons are allowed at historical festivals under the law , people can still sell , purchase and possess replica firearms , but they must be transported in a closed container .
switchblades and knives with a blade longer than 12 centimeters -lrb- 4.7 inches -rrb- may also not be carried in public . violators face fines of up to 10,000 euros -lrb- $ 15,600 -rrb- .
exceptions , however , will be made for historical re-enactments . toy weapons that can not be mistaken for real guns are not affected by the law . furthermore , the new weapons law places restrictions on firearms inherited as of april 1 , 2008 .
if the heir can not prove a personal need for the weapon - for example , if he or she is a hunter or a member of a shooting club - it may only be kept if it 's been disabled . dw staff -lrb- kjb -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

his agenda 2010 is still splitting german politics as the spd loses ground . the liberal market reforms gerhard schroeder announced on march 14 , 2003 led to talk of social inequality in germany and the emergence of a new underclass .
nevertheless , unemployment is now down and economic growth is up . while center-left members of his social democratic party praised the measures this week , the spd 's far-left wing , the left party and the labor unions had harsh words for the agenda 2010 . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : schroeder still stand by his agenda 2010 spd party leader kurt beck said thursday in a speech marking the anniversary of the reforms that schroeder 's address five years ago had signalled " the start of major successes in the areas of economy and the labor market . " " now we have to work towards bringing the agenda 's successes to all the people , " said beck , whose popularity is at an all-time low , according to several recent surveys . foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier said there had been no alternative to the far-reaching reforms made to the social and labor systems over the past five years . " we had to choose this policy , knowing that it could lead to pain and loss , " he said . reaganomics from the left the agenda 2010 , which has been compared to reaganomics in the us and thatcherism in britain , aimed to improve economic growth and reduce unemployment by slashing not only income tax but also unemployment benefits and pensions . the move met with approval from the conservative christian democratic and the liberal , free-market free democratic party , but immediately drew resistance from schroeder 's own social democrats .
he 'd been elected in 2002 promising not to cut social benefits . thousands of the spd 's center-left members abandoned the party as a result , though the far-left stayed on , shifting the party 's core .
due to inner-party pressure , schroeder resigned as party chair in february 2004 .
he remained chancellor , however , until 2005 when he was forced to acknowledge defeat and call for early elections , paving the way for christian democratic chancellor angela merkel . schroeder 's massive cuts , particularly to unemployment benefits , led to talk of deepening economic inequality and the emergence of a new underclass . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : cuts to unemployment benefits spurred mass protests the discourse was fuelled when the friedrich ebert foundation , a political foundation closely associated with the spd , published a study in late 2006 indicating that four percent of people in western germany and 20 percent in eastern germany were living in " precarious " economic conditions and felt " left behind " by politicians and society . nevertheless , unemployment sank from 10.6 percent in 2005 - the highest it had been since german reunification - to 8.3 percent in 2007 . schroeder warns against leftward lean former chancellor schroeder on thursday defended his agenda 2010 as being " good and right . "
referring to the fundamental shift to the left that his party has taken , in part due to the controversy surrounding the reforms , he added that " the spd can only achieve a majority if it 's anchored in the middle of society and does n't abandon this position . " franz-juergen weise , chairman of the federal employment office , said in an interview with the friday edition of the leipziger zeitung that the structural reorganization of his agency has resulted in " 18 million euros -lrb- $ 27.75 million -rrb- in savings , solid financing for unemployment insurance -lsb- and -rsb- lower premiums . " in contrast , michael sommer , the head of the federation of german trade unions , commented that the agenda 2010 had widened the economic gap in german society . critique from spd 's biggest rival bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the left party has benefitted from the spd 's popularity drop the bulk of the criticism , however , came from the left .
today , hundreds of thousands of full-time employees " earn less than those who receive hartz iv unemployment benefits , " said spd member ottmar schreiner in zdf . " that was made possible in part by the agenda , " he said . oskar lafontaine , who left the spd in 2005 to found the growing left party , condemned the agenda , saying that " five years of agenda 2010 mean five years of neo-liberal dead-ends and the destruction of social peace and the people 's trust in politics . " the success of lafontaine 's new left party , comprised in part of dissatisfied former spd members , represents a mounting political threat to the spd .

and then , moreover , taking the opportunity to promote better integration of saudi arabia 's christian minority , ignoring public prejudices and protests against the building of new , strange-looking churches in their neighborhoods to emphasize the principle of religious freedom and call for christianity classes in saudi schools . # b # it 's a wholly unlikely scenario .
and not just in saudi arabia , where christian immigrants from asia suffer extreme religious discrimination , but also in more liberal muslim countries such as turkey .
it therefore seems fair to say that the islam conference initiated by the german interior minister 18 months ago could serve as an inspiration to a number of countries , and not just western ones .
the project 's goals are politically highly relevant .
wolfgang schaeuble hopes that improved dialogue between representatives of the state and the muslim community will help advance the integration of germany 's 3 million muslims , which has been neglected for decades .
he is pinning his hopes on recognition of their religion , combined with the belief that the practice of this religion needs to take place within the framework of the german constitution and system of values .
schaeuble should be given due respect for concentrating his contribution to this very difficult dialogue on the basics - and what 's actually possible .
the real problems are tied up with social integration and are the hardest to solve .
teaching islam in german is widely seen as a necessity .
but the various germans states have yet to agree on what form it might take - and so do muslims .
there is still so much that has yet to be agreed on , as becomes apparent again and again .
the process of dialogue kick-started by the islam conference is important .
but this process will require reserves of patience from everyone involved .

they were also due to discuss ways to revive their economies during a summit in brussels . energy security and global warming also featured prominently with eu foreign policy chief javier solana telling the heads of the eu 's 27 member states that climate change had turned from a threat to a reality . climate change is now impacting the conflict in darfur , migration from flood-prone bangladesh and hopes for stability in the middle east , according to a new eu report . european commission president jose manuel barroso said he hoped governments would agree on a common european energy policy . " i think it 's very important also to fulfill the goals on climate change , " he said ahead of the summit .
" one year ago we adopted -lrb- a proposal -rrb- unanimously , now we have to translate this commitment in concrete ways . " the eu executive has recently put forward controversial proposals designed to make energy markets more competitive by splitting up companies which both sell energy to consumers and manage power lines . on climate change , leaders are being asked to cut the bloc 's emissions of the greenhouse gas carbon dioxide -lrb- co2 -rrb- to at least 20 percent below 1990 levels - a legally-binding goal they set themselves a year ago . protecting industry bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel does n't want german carmakers to bear the brunt of the eu goals while they were expected to broadly endorse a commission proposal presented in january , leaders were expected to steer clear of its most controversial aspect : how to share the burden of meeting that target . seen as a champion in the fight against climate change at last summer 's g8 summit , german chancellor angela merkel said she would not allow germany 's car industry to be excessively affected by the bloc 's climate goals . " i specifically support the german automobile industry , " she said , stressing that countries like germany , whose automobile industry makes larger cars , should not be discriminated against when the climate targets and fines are in force . summing up the view of many of his colleagues , bulgarian prime minister sergei stanishev said the eu needed to " strike a balance " in its bid to cut co2 emissions . leaders were also expected to discuss how to make financial markets more transparent in the wake of the recent turmoil and take stock of a number of foreign policy issues , including afghanistan and the middle east . club med 's could open in july bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some are still skeptical where sarkozy 's mediterranean union is headed but much of the attention was being devoted to french plans to create a union between countries with borders on the mediterranean sea . after fierce resistance from berlin , french president nicolas sarkozy scaled the plan down from including only states bordering the mediterranean , with nine new agencies and a bank , to an annual summit of eu and mediterranean countries with a joint presidency and a small secretariat . barroso applauded the idea , saying the new proposal would not divide the eu into northern and southern sections . " we have said from the beginning it was a very good idea to have more commitment of the european union regarding the mediterranean , " he said .
" at the same time , it is important that all member states of the eu are engaged in it .
so it seems now the conditions are there to move forward . " austrian chancellor alfred gusenbauer said the idea " does n't do any harm , " but added : " what matters to us is that it 's not some special grill party for a few member states .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de culture -pipe- 14.03.2008 marx continues to influence 125 years after his death großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : many of karl marx 's theories on politics , society and economics still ring true today friday , march 14 , marks the 125th anniversary of the death of german philosopher and political economist karl marx .
marx is still regarded as hugely influential to the development of 20th century thought . both a scholar and a political activist , marx addressed a wide range of political as well as social issues , and is known for , among other things , his analysis of history .
the interpretations of his theories , particularly those on political economy , have in the course of history generated decades of debate , inspired revolutions and cast him as both devil and deity in political and academic circles . maligned by some , misunderstood by others and celebrated as one of the world 's great thinkers by many more , marx continues to be a divisive and much discussed individual .
while there has been a substantial revival of interest in his theories since the end of the cold war , mainly those which deal with the volatility and shape of capitalism , the question remains as to whether a man who died 125 years ago still has any relevance today . ian hunt , the director of the center for applied philosophy at the flinders university of southern australia , believes that marx and his insights into the capitalist system in particular still have a place in contemporary society . " marx 's thoughts on the exploitative nature of the relationship between capitalist employers and their employees ring true today , " he said .
" the proletariat , or those without property , continues to seek employment from those with property .
control over private investment continues to give the capitalist class decisive influence over government and sufficient control over the supply of labor to ensure that it is sold by employees on terms favorable to the increase of the wealth of employers . " hunt said he believes that marx 's theories on the exploitative nature of the capitalist employment relationship - which skews industrial development toward using up human and natural resources for short-term gain - apply today in the form of climate and energy issues and " the problem of the despotic form of the employer-employee relationship under capitalism . " marx foresaw impact of private dominance bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : marx wrote about the factors which influenced climate change " marx 's analysis of the foundations of a capitalist society raises questions of the justice of the distribution of wealth , and therefore also of income , in capitalist societies , which are even more acute in the modern world than in his own time , " hunt added .
" it also raises questions about the environmental consequences of private dominance of investment that are even more acute today than in the time marx wrote . " simon tormey , the co-director of the center for the study of social and global justice -lrb- cssgj -rrb- at nottingham university , also believes marx was ahead of his time . " the world is pretty much how marx described it 150 years ago , which is quite impressive in itself , " tormey said . " this is to say that we now have a more or less integrated world capitalist system , with a global rich and global poor - as marx predicted .
there is huge exploitation across all societies - the proliferation of sweatshops and export processing zones are all very much in keeping with marx ’ s account . " the peasantry is being systematically wiped out in a global process of dispossession , and of course social democracy , which started as a form of ultra moderate ' marxism , ' marxism-lite if you like , is in retreat in all areas where it once enjoyed hegemony , ” he added . tormey also explained that marx 's theory of class struggle is hugely prevalent in today 's current economic atmosphere . violent class struggle continues off media radar bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : class struggle is evident in often violent industrial action " there are workers there who have been denied trade union representation , who have been denied holiday pay , health care , and other benefits , " he said . " go into any business and you will see owners and workers - the owners can not do without the workers and they want to pay them as little as they can for the most amount of product / output ; the workers want the most they can get . this is class struggle . " the bosses have the laws on their side , the politicians , the state , and the media , " he added . " they are able to contain struggle so that it does n't disrupt society - for the most part . however , beyond the wealthy countries , the picture is very different .
open and violent struggles are commonplace in much of the world ; strikes , lockouts , and beatings of workers in places like china , indonesia , mexico , south africa , and violent peasant conflicts in places like nandigram , india .
look around : class struggle is everywhere and infects almost every human relation . " as well as economics and politics , marx had a great influence on the way people thought about culture .
while not considered to be a pure cultural theorist , marx 's writings on issues such as aesthetics , communication and interpretation contributed in part to a growing cultural studies movement . modern cultural theorists following marx 's ideas " marx 's influence on today 's cultural theorizing derives more from his social theory , which forms a useful context to theorizing culture , and his philosophical ideas in general , including his method of investigation and reasoning , " said johan fornas , director of the advanced cultural studies institute of sweden -lrb- acsis -rrb- .
" he developed some german and hegelian ideas in an exciting and inspiring direction that are still highly relevant for those of us who are engaged in developing cultural theory . " marx has inspired lots of recent thinkers to never cut theoretical concepts loose from experiences of everyday life and instead to understand the importance of situating knowledge in concrete material , embodied and socially organized practices , always interacting with institutionalized networks of power , " he added . despite the continued relevance of a number of marx 's theories , experts are quick to point out that some have little significance in today 's environment while others have been shown to be way off the mark in some cases . prediction of communist world proved wrong bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : even china has diluted its communism in recent times " marx was convinced that communism would replace capitalism but we don ’ t really see much of a communist movement emerging anywhere today , " tormey said . " so the irony might be that at the moment when marx 's ideas are even more relevant , so the attractiveness of marxism -lrb- or more accurately communism -rrb- as a mobilizing ideology seems in decline .
but this of course can change . " marx 's faith in the generation of informed political opposition from worsening material conditions failed to be realized , but that has not made his work irrelevant , hunt said . " his primary work , ' das kapital , ' still stands out as a wonderfully structured and thought through piece of analysis , drawing on the philosophical and economic thought of his time , " he said .
" its condemnation of the specific injustice of the capitalist system has few peers .
so , as long as there are capitalists , marx will remain relevant . " nick amies send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de eastern europe -pipe- 14.03.2008 bulgaria explores officials ' ties to communist secret service großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bulgarians do n't seem to care much about what 's inside the old secret service files one in six bulgarian officials since 1990 had ties to the secret police during communism , concluded a parliamentary study .
but bulgarians are n't interested in hearing about their politicians ' pasts . the head of the government , four vice-premiers and 25 democratically elected ministers are among those with a connection to the secret service .
current president georgi parvanov worked under the code name gotse ; his predecessor jean videnov was also a special agent . former spies are especially prevalent in the foreign ministry and in diplomatic service .
three former ministers , 13 deputies and even bulgaria 's current nato ambassador were all part of the communist intelligence cadre . an investigative committee commissioned by parliament examined 673 government officials who had served since the fall of the iron curtain in 1990 and found that 108 were linked to communist intelligence . " informal networks that were linked to the repressive communist apparatus … continue to lead to corruption , " sonja schueler from the southeast europe association told deutsche welle .
" personal loyalties determine the decisions that are made and the socio-economic development of the country . " little interest in opened files bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : both parvanov -lrb- right -rrb- and putin had worked for their countries ' secret service the probe was made possible by a new law that is meant to ensure access to the files , but does n't take action against the ex-informants .
they are free to continue working in politics .
the situation is similar in germany , where the government committee responsible for opening the secret service files is only charged with informing the public . " the decision about the consequences is in the hands of those who put the politicians in office , " said andreas schulze , spokesman for the german organization that researches the former east german stasi . nevertheless , public curiosity around the topic is n't particularly strong in bulgaria .
all across central and eastern europe , the younger generation has n't shown much interest in digging up their country 's communist past . a wide variety of reasons come into play - the inability of historians to analyze the communist period objectively , low education levels among the population and the dependence of people 's career success on the system are just a few . older generations also tend to be skeptical of opening the secret files .
the entire soviet bloc was based on a foundation of unofficial informants , which means that plenty of ordinary citizens turned in information about friends , neighbors or acquaintances .
some of them are afraid that the skeletons in their closets will be exposed . close ties to the kgb bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the bulgarian secret service worked closely with the kgb not only are the activities of the secret police considered today to be human rights violations , but some of its elements were unconstitutional even during the communist regime .
the secret service was , for example , not subject to the judicial system but was run directly by the communist party . furthermore , the fact that the bulgarian secret police effectively functioned as an arm of russia 's kgb undermined the country 's raison d 'etat .
not to mention that bulgaria 's foreign intelligence was also involved in operations where blood was spilled . communist east germany 's last secret police chief march wolf wrote that , in the 1950s , his bulgarian and polish counterparts were known for having committed the most murders . former spies make europe uneasy bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bout , nicknamed " merchant of death , " was arrested in thailand this week " the bulgarian intelligence service was the one in the former east bloc that worked most closely together with the kgb , " said german journalist and crime expert juergen roth . top-ranking bulgarian politicians ' contacts to the kgb are seen in brussels as a potential security risk , particularly when sensitive topics like eu and nato are on the table .
bulgaria became a member of the european union on jan .
1 , 2007 . the old ties have come into the limelight this week for another reason : russian arms trader victor bout , who supposedly had excellent contacts to the soviet and later to the russian secret service , had delivered a load of weapons worth several hundred million dollars to bulgaria just before he was arrested on march 6 . dw staff -lrb- kjb -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

washington is attempting to divide the people and to make the parliament independent , the president of the iranian parliament said , adding that the us would not succeed . other conservative politicians have launched a campaign against reform-minded parliamentarian noureddine pir mouazaem because he gave the voice of america an interview regarding the elections .
but it 's not just the supposed attempts of the " great satan " to make contact with liberal forces in iran that are under fire - even germany has received a tongue-lashing . herbert honsowitz , the german ambassador in tehran was massively attacked in the media and in public statements because he met with the head of the reform movement , mohamed-reza khatami and allegedly listened to his complaints about the poor foreign policy " performance . " honsowitz , an old hand at iranian and middle east issues , did n't make a fuss about the criticism because he pointed out that he had also spoken with conservative politicians .
that was enough for a renewed salvo from the conservatives .
honsowitz , it was said , also met with former president khatami on the eve of the last round of un sanctions passed against iran .
that was accepted as proof that germany , which is almost considered part of the enemy camp , and the reformers were working together on crafting an anti-iran policy . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : dw 's peter philipp said europe has to brace for bad times with iran of course , these events took place in the run-up to the elections , and the criticism was probably partly campaigning rhetoric .
but it still ca n't just be pushed aside and ignored because it touches a sore point among iranians : if there 's one thing that iranians of every color react sensitively to it 's foreign interference in their affairs or even a suspicion of such intervention . it 's a feeling that stems from the country 's history as iran repeatedly was the playing field where foreign powers wielded their influence .
even 29 years after the " islamic revolution " - which made the country independent from such things - the ghost of foreign influence still haunts iranians .
that goes so far as to not tolerate foreign criticism about flaws in the country with the reminder , " this or that may not be good , but we 've done it ourselves . " you do n't need long to find proof of such behavior .
washington 's call for regime change in tehran , is an example .
the us approach in the nuclear row is another .
in the latter , disappointment and , to a certain extent , anger about the behavior of europeans - and particularly that of germany - play a role . many iranians feel a traditional kinship with germany .
for many of them , germany has been a role model in many aspects .
in recent times , such respect is increasingly mixed with surprise , bafflement and also anger about berlin 's stance in the nuclear dispute and on sanctions against iran . it 's the kind of position the iranians are used to from the united states , but surely not germany ?
a businessman , just back from a visit to germany , said bitterly that the germans should not be surprised that iran may one day repair its ties to the us but would not forget the " betrayal " of the germans so easily .
disappointment in friendship hurts more than " straightforward and open enmity . " it 's not just the germans but the europeans in general who need to prepare for bad times with iran .
politically , they 've let down iran and they will be punished for it with contempt .
today , the russian ambassador is the most important foreign diplomat in teheran . and if politics does n't work , business is bound to suffer as well .
china , japan and south korea together - and not the eu - already make up iran 's most important trading partner . peter philipp , currently in iran -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de culture -pipe- 14.03.2008 marx continues to influence 125 years after his death großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : many of karl marx 's theories on politics , society and economics still ring true today friday , march 14 , marks the 125th anniversary of the death of german philosopher and political economist karl marx .
marx is still regarded as hugely influential to the development of 20th century thought . both a scholar and a political activist , marx addressed a wide range of political as well as social issues , and is known for , among other things , his analysis of history .
the interpretations of his theories , particularly those on political economy , have in the course of history generated decades of debate , inspired revolutions and cast him as both devil and deity in political and academic circles . maligned by some , misunderstood by others and celebrated as one of the world 's great thinkers by many more , marx continues to be a divisive and much discussed individual .
while there has been a substantial revival of interest in his theories since the end of the cold war , mainly those which deal with the volatility and shape of capitalism , the question remains as to whether a man who died 125 years ago still has any relevance today . ian hunt , the director of the center for applied philosophy at the flinders university of southern australia , believes that marx and his insights into the capitalist system in particular still have a place in contemporary society . " marx 's thoughts on the exploitative nature of the relationship between capitalist employers and their employees ring true today , " he said .
" the proletariat , or those without property , continues to seek employment from those with property .
control over private investment continues to give the capitalist class decisive influence over government and sufficient control over the supply of labor to ensure that it is sold by employees on terms favorable to the increase of the wealth of employers . " hunt said he believes that marx 's theories on the exploitative nature of the capitalist employment relationship - which skews industrial development toward using up human and natural resources for short-term gain - apply today in the form of climate and energy issues and " the problem of the despotic form of the employer-employee relationship under capitalism . " marx foresaw impact of private dominance bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : marx wrote about the factors which influenced climate change " marx 's analysis of the foundations of a capitalist society raises questions of the justice of the distribution of wealth , and therefore also of income , in capitalist societies , which are even more acute in the modern world than in his own time , " hunt added .
" it also raises questions about the environmental consequences of private dominance of investment that are even more acute today than in the time marx wrote . " simon tormey , the co-director of the center for the study of social and global justice -lrb- cssgj -rrb- at nottingham university , also believes marx was ahead of his time . " the world is pretty much how marx described it 150 years ago , which is quite impressive in itself , " tormey said . " this is to say that we now have a more or less integrated world capitalist system , with a global rich and global poor - as marx predicted .
there is huge exploitation across all societies - the proliferation of sweatshops and export processing zones are all very much in keeping with marx ’ s account . " the peasantry is being systematically wiped out in a global process of dispossession , and of course social democracy , which started as a form of ultra moderate ' marxism , ' marxism-lite if you like , is in retreat in all areas where it once enjoyed hegemony , ” he added . tormey also explained that marx 's theory of class struggle is hugely prevalent in today 's current economic atmosphere . violent class struggle continues off media radar bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : class struggle is evident in often violent industrial action " there are workers there who have been denied trade union representation , who have been denied holiday pay , health care , and other benefits , " he said . " go into any business and you will see owners and workers - the owners can not do without the workers and they want to pay them as little as they can for the most amount of product / output ; the workers want the most they can get . this is class struggle . " the bosses have the laws on their side , the politicians , the state , and the media , " he added . " they are able to contain struggle so that it does n't disrupt society - for the most part . however , beyond the wealthy countries , the picture is very different .
open and violent struggles are commonplace in much of the world ; strikes , lockouts , and beatings of workers in places like china , indonesia , mexico , south africa , and violent peasant conflicts in places like nandigram , india .
look around : class struggle is everywhere and infects almost every human relation . " as well as economics and politics , marx had a great influence on the way people thought about culture .
while not considered to be a pure cultural theorist , marx 's writings on issues such as aesthetics , communication and interpretation contributed in part to a growing cultural studies movement . modern cultural theorists following marx 's ideas " marx 's influence on today 's cultural theorizing derives more from his social theory , which forms a useful context to theorizing culture , and his philosophical ideas in general , including his method of investigation and reasoning , " said johan fornas , director of the advanced cultural studies institute of sweden -lrb- acsis -rrb- .
" he developed some german and hegelian ideas in an exciting and inspiring direction that are still highly relevant for those of us who are engaged in developing cultural theory . " marx has inspired lots of recent thinkers to never cut theoretical concepts loose from experiences of everyday life and instead to understand the importance of situating knowledge in concrete material , embodied and socially organized practices , always interacting with institutionalized networks of power , " he added . despite the continued relevance of a number of marx 's theories , experts are quick to point out that some have little significance in today 's environment while others have been shown to be way off the mark in some cases . prediction of communist world proved wrong bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : even china has diluted its communism in recent times " marx was convinced that communism would replace capitalism but we don ’ t really see much of a communist movement emerging anywhere today , " tormey said . " so the irony might be that at the moment when marx 's ideas are even more relevant , so the attractiveness of marxism -lrb- or more accurately communism -rrb- as a mobilizing ideology seems in decline .
but this of course can change . " marx 's faith in the generation of informed political opposition from worsening material conditions failed to be realized , but that has not made his work irrelevant , hunt said . " his primary work , ' das kapital , ' still stands out as a wonderfully structured and thought through piece of analysis , drawing on the philosophical and economic thought of his time , " he said .
" its condemnation of the specific injustice of the capitalist system has few peers .
so , as long as there are capitalists , marx will remain relevant . " nick amies send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

marx is still regarded as hugely influential to the development of 20th century thought . both a scholar and a political activist , marx addressed a wide range of political as well as social issues , and is known for , among other things , his analysis of history .
the interpretations of his theories , particularly those on political economy , have in the course of history generated decades of debate , inspired revolutions and cast him as both devil and deity in political and academic circles . maligned by some , misunderstood by others and celebrated as one of the world 's great thinkers by many more , marx continues to be a divisive and much discussed individual .
while there has been a substantial revival of interest in his theories since the end of the cold war , mainly those which deal with the volatility and shape of capitalism , the question remains as to whether a man who died 125 years ago still has any relevance today . ian hunt , the director of the center for applied philosophy at the flinders university of southern australia , believes that marx and his insights into the capitalist system in particular still have a place in contemporary society . " marx 's thoughts on the exploitative nature of the relationship between capitalist employers and their employees ring true today , " he said .
" the proletariat , or those without property , continues to seek employment from those with property .
control over private investment continues to give the capitalist class decisive influence over government and sufficient control over the supply of labor to ensure that it is sold by employees on terms favorable to the increase of the wealth of employers . " hunt said he believes that marx 's theories on the exploitative nature of the capitalist employment relationship - which skews industrial development toward using up human and natural resources for short-term gain - apply today in the form of climate and energy issues and " the problem of the despotic form of the employer-employee relationship under capitalism . " marx foresaw impact of private dominance bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : marx wrote about the factors which influenced climate change " marx 's analysis of the foundations of a capitalist society raises questions of the justice of the distribution of wealth , and therefore also of income , in capitalist societies , which are even more acute in the modern world than in his own time , " hunt added .
" it also raises questions about the environmental consequences of private dominance of investment that are even more acute today than in the time marx wrote . " simon tormey , the co-director of the center for the study of social and global justice -lrb- cssgj -rrb- at nottingham university , also believes marx was ahead of his time . " the world is pretty much how marx described it 150 years ago , which is quite impressive in itself , " tormey said . " this is to say that we now have a more or less integrated world capitalist system , with a global rich and global poor - as marx predicted .
there is huge exploitation across all societies - the proliferation of sweatshops and export processing zones are all very much in keeping with marx ’ s account . " the peasantry is being systematically wiped out in a global process of dispossession , and of course social democracy , which started as a form of ultra moderate ' marxism , ' marxism-lite if you like , is in retreat in all areas where it once enjoyed hegemony , ” he added . tormey also explained that marx 's theory of class struggle is hugely prevalent in today 's current economic atmosphere . violent class struggle continues off media radar bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : class struggle is evident in often violent industrial action " there are workers there who have been denied trade union representation , who have been denied holiday pay , health care , and other benefits , " he said .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de eastern europe -pipe- 14.03.2008 bulgaria explores officials ' ties to communist secret service großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bulgarians do n't seem to care much about what 's inside the old secret service files one in six bulgarian officials since 1990 had ties to the secret police during communism , concluded a parliamentary study .
but bulgarians are n't interested in hearing about their politicians ' pasts . the head of the government , four vice-premiers and 25 democratically elected ministers are among those with a connection to the secret service .
current president georgi parvanov worked under the code name gotse ; his predecessor jean videnov was also a special agent . former spies are especially prevalent in the foreign ministry and in diplomatic service .
three former ministers , 13 deputies and even bulgaria 's current nato ambassador were all part of the communist intelligence cadre . an investigative committee commissioned by parliament examined 673 government officials who had served since the fall of the iron curtain in 1990 and found that 108 were linked to communist intelligence . " informal networks that were linked to the repressive communist apparatus … continue to lead to corruption , " sonja schueler from the southeast europe association told deutsche welle .
" personal loyalties determine the decisions that are made and the socio-economic development of the country . " little interest in opened files bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : both parvanov -lrb- right -rrb- and putin had worked for their countries ' secret service the probe was made possible by a new law that is meant to ensure access to the files , but does n't take action against the ex-informants .
they are free to continue working in politics .
the situation is similar in germany , where the government committee responsible for opening the secret service files is only charged with informing the public . " the decision about the consequences is in the hands of those who put the politicians in office , " said andreas schulze , spokesman for the german organization that researches the former east german stasi . nevertheless , public curiosity around the topic is n't particularly strong in bulgaria .
all across central and eastern europe , the younger generation has n't shown much interest in digging up their country 's communist past . a wide variety of reasons come into play - the inability of historians to analyze the communist period objectively , low education levels among the population and the dependence of people 's career success on the system are just a few . older generations also tend to be skeptical of opening the secret files .
the entire soviet bloc was based on a foundation of unofficial informants , which means that plenty of ordinary citizens turned in information about friends , neighbors or acquaintances .
some of them are afraid that the skeletons in their closets will be exposed . close ties to the kgb bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the bulgarian secret service worked closely with the kgb not only are the activities of the secret police considered today to be human rights violations , but some of its elements were unconstitutional even during the communist regime .
the secret service was , for example , not subject to the judicial system but was run directly by the communist party . furthermore , the fact that the bulgarian secret police effectively functioned as an arm of russia 's kgb undermined the country 's raison d 'etat .
not to mention that bulgaria 's foreign intelligence was also involved in operations where blood was spilled . communist east germany 's last secret police chief march wolf wrote that , in the 1950s , his bulgarian and polish counterparts were known for having committed the most murders . former spies make europe uneasy bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bout , nicknamed " merchant of death , " was arrested in thailand this week " the bulgarian intelligence service was the one in the former east bloc that worked most closely together with the kgb , " said german journalist and crime expert juergen roth . top-ranking bulgarian politicians ' contacts to the kgb are seen in brussels as a potential security risk , particularly when sensitive topics like eu and nato are on the table .
bulgaria became a member of the european union on jan .
1 , 2007 . the old ties have come into the limelight this week for another reason : russian arms trader victor bout , who supposedly had excellent contacts to the soviet and later to the russian secret service , had delivered a load of weapons worth several hundred million dollars to bulgaria just before he was arrested on march 6 . dw staff -lrb- kjb -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de politics -pipe- 14.03.2008 five years on , welfare reforms still divide germany 's spd großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : more people have jobs but the verdict is out on whether the reforms cleaned up the economy five years ago , former chancellor schroeder initiated a series of social and labor reforms that divided his party and cost him the chancellery .
his agenda 2010 is still splitting german politics as the spd loses ground . the liberal market reforms gerhard schroeder announced on march 14 , 2003 led to talk of social inequality in germany and the emergence of a new underclass .
nevertheless , unemployment is now down and economic growth is up . while center-left members of his social democratic party praised the measures this week , the spd 's far-left wing , the left party and the labor unions had harsh words for the agenda 2010 . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : schroeder still stand by his agenda 2010 spd party leader kurt beck said thursday in a speech marking the anniversary of the reforms that schroeder 's address five years ago had signalled " the start of major successes in the areas of economy and the labor market . " " now we have to work towards bringing the agenda 's successes to all the people , " said beck , whose popularity is at an all-time low , according to several recent surveys . foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier said there had been no alternative to the far-reaching reforms made to the social and labor systems over the past five years . " we had to choose this policy , knowing that it could lead to pain and loss , " he said . reaganomics from the left the agenda 2010 , which has been compared to reaganomics in the us and thatcherism in britain , aimed to improve economic growth and reduce unemployment by slashing not only income tax but also unemployment benefits and pensions . the move met with approval from the conservative christian democratic and the liberal , free-market free democratic party , but immediately drew resistance from schroeder 's own social democrats .
he 'd been elected in 2002 promising not to cut social benefits . thousands of the spd 's center-left members abandoned the party as a result , though the far-left stayed on , shifting the party 's core .
due to inner-party pressure , schroeder resigned as party chair in february 2004 .
he remained chancellor , however , until 2005 when he was forced to acknowledge defeat and call for early elections , paving the way for christian democratic chancellor angela merkel . schroeder 's massive cuts , particularly to unemployment benefits , led to talk of deepening economic inequality and the emergence of a new underclass . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : cuts to unemployment benefits spurred mass protests the discourse was fuelled when the friedrich ebert foundation , a political foundation closely associated with the spd , published a study in late 2006 indicating that four percent of people in western germany and 20 percent in eastern germany were living in " precarious " economic conditions and felt " left behind " by politicians and society . nevertheless , unemployment sank from 10.6 percent in 2005 - the highest it had been since german reunification - to 8.3 percent in 2007 . schroeder warns against leftward lean former chancellor schroeder on thursday defended his agenda 2010 as being " good and right . "
referring to the fundamental shift to the left that his party has taken , in part due to the controversy surrounding the reforms , he added that " the spd can only achieve a majority if it 's anchored in the middle of society and does n't abandon this position . " franz-juergen weise , chairman of the federal employment office , said in an interview with the friday edition of the leipziger zeitung that the structural reorganization of his agency has resulted in " 18 million euros -lrb- $ 27.75 million -rrb- in savings , solid financing for unemployment insurance -lsb- and -rsb- lower premiums . " in contrast , michael sommer , the head of the federation of german trade unions , commented that the agenda 2010 had widened the economic gap in german society . critique from spd 's biggest rival bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the left party has benefitted from the spd 's popularity drop the bulk of the criticism , however , came from the left .
today , hundreds of thousands of full-time employees " earn less than those who receive hartz iv unemployment benefits , " said spd member ottmar schreiner in zdf . " that was made possible in part by the agenda , " he said . oskar lafontaine , who left the spd in 2005 to found the growing left party , condemned the agenda , saying that " five years of agenda 2010 mean five years of neo-liberal dead-ends and the destruction of social peace and the people 's trust in politics . " the success of lafontaine 's new left party , comprised in part of dissatisfied former spd members , represents a mounting political threat to the spd .
it currently has 53 seats in the federal parliament and is represented in 10 of germany 's 16 state parliaments . dw staff -lrb- kjb -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de international relations -pipe- 14.03.2008 iran feels let down by europe , expert says großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : iranian voters can choose from two conservative factions and one reformist group as iranians vote in parliamentary polls friday , march 14 , dw 's chief correspondent and mideast expert peter philipp , currently in tehran , writes about his impressions on europe and germany 's waning clout in the country . hours before iran votes in its eighth parliamentary elections , gholam-ali addad-adel said the elections have nothing to do with the united states .
washington is attempting to divide the people and to make the parliament independent , the president of the iranian parliament said , adding that the us would not succeed . other conservative politicians have launched a campaign against reform-minded parliamentarian noureddine pir mouazaem because he gave the voice of america an interview regarding the elections .
but it 's not just the supposed attempts of the " great satan " to make contact with liberal forces in iran that are under fire - even germany has received a tongue-lashing . herbert honsowitz , the german ambassador in tehran was massively attacked in the media and in public statements because he met with the head of the reform movement , mohamed-reza khatami and allegedly listened to his complaints about the poor foreign policy " performance . " honsowitz , an old hand at iranian and middle east issues , did n't make a fuss about the criticism because he pointed out that he had also spoken with conservative politicians .
that was enough for a renewed salvo from the conservatives .
honsowitz , it was said , also met with former president khatami on the eve of the last round of un sanctions passed against iran .
that was accepted as proof that germany , which is almost considered part of the enemy camp , and the reformers were working together on crafting an anti-iran policy . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : dw 's peter philipp said europe has to brace for bad times with iran of course , these events took place in the run-up to the elections , and the criticism was probably partly campaigning rhetoric .
but it still ca n't just be pushed aside and ignored because it touches a sore point among iranians : if there 's one thing that iranians of every color react sensitively to it 's foreign interference in their affairs or even a suspicion of such intervention . it 's a feeling that stems from the country 's history as iran repeatedly was the playing field where foreign powers wielded their influence .
even 29 years after the " islamic revolution " - which made the country independent from such things - the ghost of foreign influence still haunts iranians .
that goes so far as to not tolerate foreign criticism about flaws in the country with the reminder , " this or that may not be good , but we 've done it ourselves . " you do n't need long to find proof of such behavior .
washington 's call for regime change in tehran , is an example .
the us approach in the nuclear row is another .
in the latter , disappointment and , to a certain extent , anger about the behavior of europeans - and particularly that of germany - play a role . many iranians feel a traditional kinship with germany .
for many of them , germany has been a role model in many aspects .
in recent times , such respect is increasingly mixed with surprise , bafflement and also anger about berlin 's stance in the nuclear dispute and on sanctions against iran . it 's the kind of position the iranians are used to from the united states , but surely not germany ?
a businessman , just back from a visit to germany , said bitterly that the germans should not be surprised that iran may one day repair its ties to the us but would not forget the " betrayal " of the germans so easily .
disappointment in friendship hurts more than " straightforward and open enmity . " it 's not just the germans but the europeans in general who need to prepare for bad times with iran .
politically , they 've let down iran and they will be punished for it with contempt .
today , the russian ambassador is the most important foreign diplomat in teheran . and if politics does n't work , business is bound to suffer as well .
china , japan and south korea together - and not the eu - already make up iran 's most important trading partner . peter philipp , currently in iran -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

victory for either side could have dramatic effects on the islamic republic 's relations with the west . parliamentary elections ended on friday night in iran after 15 hours following the interior ministry 's decision to extend the voting time five times from 6 p.m. to 11 p.m. local time in response to what was proclaimed to be public demand .
the iranian vote pitted the ruling ultra-conservative faction close to president mahmoud ahmadinejad against reformists close to former president mohammad khatami and a conservative faction headed by former chief nuclear negotiator , ali larijani .
with a total of 4,400 candidates running for 290 seats and with votes being cast manually , the first results from the provinces were expected to be announced by saturday noon , while results for the politically important tehran constituency were not expected before monday .
the first to vote was iran 's supreme leader ayatollah ali khamenei who asked the people to determine their political future by going to the polls .
former iranian president akbar hashemi-rafsanjani voted in the morning and called on the people to vote in order to strengthen the legislature 's power .
ahmadinejad 's rivals urge public to vote bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : rafsanjani is a fierce opponent of ahmadinejad " if you do not vote , then those whom you do not want will get into the parliament again , " said the cleric who is a strong opponent of ahmadinejad .
" the new parliament should definitely increase its supervision -lsb- of the government 's performance -rsb- , " rafsanjani added .
president ahmadinejad cut short his state visit to senegal to be in tehran for the elections .
immediately after arrival , he rushed to the lorzadeh mosque in south-eastern tehran to cast his vote .
" billions of eyes -lsb- in the world -rsb- are focused on us to see how we determine our political destiny by ourselves in these elections , " ahmadinejad said . „ many -lsb- islamic -rsb- countries look for a model country -lsb- to follow -rsb- and have chosen iran as their model , " the president added .
the parliamentary elections are widely regarded as a test for ahmadinejad and an assessment of his performance in the 30 months of his presidency .
failure on economic reforms threatens president bildunterschrift : mahmoud ahmadinejad faces a referendum on his 30-month presidency the main concern for voters is the economy as ahmadinejad has failed to realize his economic reforms .
despite drastically increasing oil prices , inflation - ranging between 20 to 30 percent - is higher than before summer 2005 .
meanwhile , interior minister mostafa poumohammadi told press tv that final results would be announced within three or four days , starting first with the smaller provinces and later the big cities .
the votes in the provinces are counted by hand .
in the capital tehran the counting has for the first time been computerized but there will be manual counting as well for reconfirmation .
claims of high turnout go unconfirmed bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : iranians tend to vote enthusiastically in elections in tehran , witnesses reported that a large number of people had gone to the polling stations in the southern part of the capital early on friday , while in northern tehran people usually prefer to vote in the afternoon .
the elections were being held one week before the persian new year -lsb- march 21 -rsb- and many iranians were still busy with new year shopping and preparations , which might have a major impact on the turnout .
the interior ministry called the turnout so far " magnificent " and state media said that at least 60 percent of the electorate had so far voted .
these turnout claims could not be confirmed by neutral observers . dpa news agency -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

victory for either side could have dramatic effects on the islamic republic 's relations with the west . parliamentary elections ended on friday night in iran after 15 hours following the interior ministry 's decision to extend the voting time five times from 6 p.m. to 11 p.m. local time in response to what was proclaimed to be public demand .
the iranian vote pitted the ruling ultra-conservative faction close to president mahmoud ahmadinejad against reformists close to former president mohammad khatami and a conservative faction headed by former chief nuclear negotiator , ali larijani .
with a total of 4,400 candidates running for 290 seats and with votes being cast manually , the first results from the provinces were expected to be announced by saturday noon , while results for the politically important tehran constituency were not expected before monday .
the first to vote was iran 's supreme leader ayatollah ali khamenei who asked the people to determine their political future by going to the polls .
former iranian president akbar hashemi-rafsanjani voted in the morning and called on the people to vote in order to strengthen the legislature 's power .
ahmadinejad 's rivals urge public to vote bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : rafsanjani is a fierce opponent of ahmadinejad " if you do not vote , then those whom you do not want will get into the parliament again , " said the cleric who is a strong opponent of ahmadinejad .
" the new parliament should definitely increase its supervision -lsb- of the government 's performance -rsb- , " rafsanjani added .
president ahmadinejad cut short his state visit to senegal to be in tehran for the elections .
immediately after arrival , he rushed to the lorzadeh mosque in south-eastern tehran to cast his vote .
" billions of eyes -lsb- in the world -rsb- are focused on us to see how we determine our political destiny by ourselves in these elections , " ahmadinejad said . „ many -lsb- islamic -rsb- countries look for a model country -lsb- to follow -rsb- and have chosen iran as their model , " the president added .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de culture -pipe- 14.03.2008 marx continues to influence 125 years after his death großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : many of karl marx 's theories on politics , society and economics still ring true today friday , march 14 , marks the 125th anniversary of the death of german philosopher and political economist karl marx .
marx is still regarded as hugely influential to the development of 20th century thought . both a scholar and a political activist , marx addressed a wide range of political as well as social issues , and is known for , among other things , his analysis of history .
the interpretations of his theories , particularly those on political economy , have in the course of history generated decades of debate , inspired revolutions and cast him as both devil and deity in political and academic circles . maligned by some , misunderstood by others and celebrated as one of the world 's great thinkers by many more , marx continues to be a divisive and much discussed individual .
while there has been a substantial revival of interest in his theories since the end of the cold war , mainly those which deal with the volatility and shape of capitalism , the question remains as to whether a man who died 125 years ago still has any relevance today . ian hunt , the director of the center for applied philosophy at the flinders university of southern australia , believes that marx and his insights into the capitalist system in particular still have a place in contemporary society . " marx 's thoughts on the exploitative nature of the relationship between capitalist employers and their employees ring true today , " he said .
" the proletariat , or those without property , continues to seek employment from those with property .
control over private investment continues to give the capitalist class decisive influence over government and sufficient control over the supply of labor to ensure that it is sold by employees on terms favorable to the increase of the wealth of employers . " hunt said he believes that marx 's theories on the exploitative nature of the capitalist employment relationship - which skews industrial development toward using up human and natural resources for short-term gain - apply today in the form of climate and energy issues and " the problem of the despotic form of the employer-employee relationship under capitalism . " marx foresaw impact of private dominance bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : marx wrote about the factors which influenced climate change " marx 's analysis of the foundations of a capitalist society raises questions of the justice of the distribution of wealth , and therefore also of income , in capitalist societies , which are even more acute in the modern world than in his own time , " hunt added .
" it also raises questions about the environmental consequences of private dominance of investment that are even more acute today than in the time marx wrote . " simon tormey , the co-director of the center for the study of social and global justice -lrb- cssgj -rrb- at nottingham university , also believes marx was ahead of his time . " the world is pretty much how marx described it 150 years ago , which is quite impressive in itself , " tormey said . " this is to say that we now have a more or less integrated world capitalist system , with a global rich and global poor - as marx predicted .
there is huge exploitation across all societies - the proliferation of sweatshops and export processing zones are all very much in keeping with marx ’ s account . " the peasantry is being systematically wiped out in a global process of dispossession , and of course social democracy , which started as a form of ultra moderate ' marxism , ' marxism-lite if you like , is in retreat in all areas where it once enjoyed hegemony , ” he added . tormey also explained that marx 's theory of class struggle is hugely prevalent in today 's current economic atmosphere . violent class struggle continues off media radar bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : class struggle is evident in often violent industrial action " there are workers there who have been denied trade union representation , who have been denied holiday pay , health care , and other benefits , " he said . " go into any business and you will see owners and workers - the owners can not do without the workers and they want to pay them as little as they can for the most amount of product / output ; the workers want the most they can get . this is class struggle . " the bosses have the laws on their side , the politicians , the state , and the media , " he added . " they are able to contain struggle so that it does n't disrupt society - for the most part . however , beyond the wealthy countries , the picture is very different .
open and violent struggles are commonplace in much of the world ; strikes , lockouts , and beatings of workers in places like china , indonesia , mexico , south africa , and violent peasant conflicts in places like nandigram , india .
look around : class struggle is everywhere and infects almost every human relation . " as well as economics and politics , marx had a great influence on the way people thought about culture .
while not considered to be a pure cultural theorist , marx 's writings on issues such as aesthetics , communication and interpretation contributed in part to a growing cultural studies movement . modern cultural theorists following marx 's ideas " marx 's influence on today 's cultural theorizing derives more from his social theory , which forms a useful context to theorizing culture , and his philosophical ideas in general , including his method of investigation and reasoning , " said johan fornas , director of the advanced cultural studies institute of sweden -lrb- acsis -rrb- .
" he developed some german and hegelian ideas in an exciting and inspiring direction that are still highly relevant for those of us who are engaged in developing cultural theory . " marx has inspired lots of recent thinkers to never cut theoretical concepts loose from experiences of everyday life and instead to understand the importance of situating knowledge in concrete material , embodied and socially organized practices , always interacting with institutionalized networks of power , " he added . despite the continued relevance of a number of marx 's theories , experts are quick to point out that some have little significance in today 's environment while others have been shown to be way off the mark in some cases . prediction of communist world proved wrong bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : even china has diluted its communism in recent times " marx was convinced that communism would replace capitalism but we don ’ t really see much of a communist movement emerging anywhere today , " tormey said . " so the irony might be that at the moment when marx 's ideas are even more relevant , so the attractiveness of marxism -lrb- or more accurately communism -rrb- as a mobilizing ideology seems in decline .
but this of course can change . " marx 's faith in the generation of informed political opposition from worsening material conditions failed to be realized , but that has not made his work irrelevant , hunt said . " his primary work , ' das kapital , ' still stands out as a wonderfully structured and thought through piece of analysis , drawing on the philosophical and economic thought of his time , " he said .
" its condemnation of the specific injustice of the capitalist system has few peers .
so , as long as there are capitalists , marx will remain relevant . " nick amies send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

and then , moreover , taking the opportunity to promote better integration of saudi arabia 's christian minority , ignoring public prejudices and protests against the building of new , strange-looking churches in their neighborhoods to emphasize the principle of religious freedom and call for christianity classes in saudi schools .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : rainer sollich it 's a wholly unlikely scenario .
and not just in saudi arabia , where christian immigrants from asia suffer extreme religious discrimination , but also in more liberal muslim countries such as turkey .
it therefore seems fair to say that the islam conference initiated by the german interior minister 18 months ago could serve as an inspiration to a number of countries , and not just western ones .
the project 's goals are politically highly relevant .
wolfgang schaeuble hopes that improved dialogue between representatives of the state and the muslim community will help advance the integration of germany 's 3 million muslims , which has been neglected for decades .
he is pinning his hopes on recognition of their religion , combined with the belief that the practice of this religion needs to take place within the framework of the german constitution and system of values .
schaeuble should be given due respect for concentrating his contribution to this very difficult dialogue on the basics - and what 's actually possible .
the real problems are tied up with social integration and are the hardest to solve .
teaching islam in german is widely seen as a necessity .
but the various germans states have yet to agree on what form it might take - and so do muslims .
there is still so much that has yet to be agreed on , as becomes apparent again and again .
the process of dialogue kick-started by the islam conference is important .

wolfgang schaeuble hopes that improved dialogue between representatives of the state and the muslim community will help advance the integration of germany 's 3 million muslims , which has been neglected for decades .
he is pinning his hopes on recognition of their religion , combined with the belief that the practice of this religion needs to take place within the framework of the german constitution and system of values .
schaeuble should be given due respect for concentrating his contribution to this very difficult dialogue on the basics - and what 's actually possible .
the real problems are tied up with social integration and are the hardest to solve .
teaching islam in german is widely seen as a necessity .
but the various germans states have yet to agree on what form it might take - and so do muslims .
there is still so much that has yet to be agreed on , as becomes apparent again and again .
the process of dialogue kick-started by the islam conference is important .
but this process will require reserves of patience from everyone involved .

but the eu is its most important trade partner and now the balkan country is feeling the crunch , both economically and politically . according to opinion polls , 70 percent of serbians are in favor of their county joining the european union .
but in the last elections , half of them voted for the nationalist euroskeptic parties . one reason is the west 's support of independence for kosovo .
another is the nationalists ' populist stance .
they want to undo the country 's recent democratic transformation and win the attention of those who have n't profited from the economic upswing . " these people are discontent because the democratic government treated them with arrogance in the past seven years and did n't want to hear about the problems of the people in the middle of the country , " said former foreign minister goran svilanovic . " distinctively neo-liberal politics makes them unhappy , but the majority of them do n't oppose the eu , " he said . long way to go bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : most serbs support eu membership in comparison to the last decade of war and economic embargos , serbs are living in much better circumstances today .
in 2007 , overall production rose by seven percent over the previous year . nevertheless , they are still far away from the central-european standard of living .
the gross national income in serbia is only about $ 5,500 per capita . the loss of the southern province of kosovo this year was another blow to the serbian economy .
the government , which stepped down as a result of the conflict over the eu 's kosovo policy , can no longer implement their plans to boost the economy .
since nearly all of its important trade partners have recognized the new state , the anti-western attitude in serbia is deterring potential investors . " serbia will experience political turbulence this year , which is why a lot of direct foreign investment ca n't be expected , " said belgrade economist sasa djogovic but the foreign companies that are already in serbia wo n't pull out , added djogovic . " that 's especially true of the finance sector , " he said .
" for them , serbia 's transformation market is very lucrative due to the high demand for capital . " unfair bank practices bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " free kosova " is n't bringing more coca-cola to serbia after a decade and a half of poverty , serbs are just starting to purchase new furniture and household appliances - but they have to pay a high price to borrow money .
currently , austrian , greek and italian firms dominate the bank sector . " brussels ' tolerance of the business practices of european banks in serbia is unacceptable , " said political scientist dusan janjic . " raiffeisen bank , credit agricole , societe generale and hvb are representatives of europe here , but for the people of serbia they are plunderers .
they charge the highest interest rates in europe and charge double interest via bogus firms in austria , " he said . on the other hands , the banks are reluctant to approve corporate loans .
the most important employers continue to be large state-run companies and the few trade monopolies .
the state is too weak to confront oligarchies and many of the state-run companies , like oil , end up being sold to russian conglomerates at low prices . alternative strategies " you ca n't really expect serbia to be able to export retail products to the european union , " said djogovic . " we 'll continue to send resources to the industrial nations , but we should also import technologies from these countries in order to become more competitive ourselves .
instead we import mass produced goods , " he said . as an alternative , serbia could explore new markets , or return to forgotten markets , like north africa , suggested the economist . filip slavkovic -lrb- kjb -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" it would have been unthinkable for the summit would have remained silent on this , " sarkozy concluded . global financial markets have been gripped with extreme volatility amid concerns that tight credit conditions are threatening some finance houses and record-breaking runs for the euro , oil and gold . commission chief vows ecb will take action bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : barroso attempted to quell fears over financial instability as fears grew of a recession in the us economy and the knock-on effects on the world 's nerve-wracked financial markets , european commission chief jose manuel barroso tried to instill calm by telling the summit that the european central bank -lrb- ecb -rrb- would take control of the situation should it be required to . " the ecb will do what is necessary to secure financial stability , " barroso said . the eu leaders also broached the subject of action in the fight against climate change during the two-day summit and at the end agreed to wrap up negotiations on ambitious targets to cut energy use and fight global warming by the end of the year . " we committed ourselves to finishing negotiating on this package by the end of this year and by doing this we made a huge step forward , " said slovenian prime minister janez jansa , whose country holds the european union 's rotating presidency .
" we are convinced that the costs of these measures will be much lower than if we do n't act . " eu targets year-end for climate package agreement bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the eu is under pressure to deliver on its climate promises the current plan aims to meet the european union 's over-arching goal to reduce emissions of carbon dioxide - the main gas responsible for global warming - by 20 percent by 2020 , compared to 1990 levels .

" it would have been unthinkable for the summit would have remained silent on this , " sarkozy concluded . global financial markets have been gripped with extreme volatility amid concerns that tight credit conditions are threatening some finance houses and record-breaking runs for the euro , oil and gold . commission chief vows ecb will take action bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : barroso attempted to quell fears over financial instability as fears grew of a recession in the us economy and the knock-on effects on the world 's nerve-wracked financial markets , european commission chief jose manuel barroso tried to instill calm by telling the summit that the european central bank -lrb- ecb -rrb- would take control of the situation should it be required to . " the ecb will do what is necessary to secure financial stability , " barroso said . the eu leaders also broached the subject of action in the fight against climate change during the two-day summit and at the end agreed to wrap up negotiations on ambitious targets to cut energy use and fight global warming by the end of the year . " we committed ourselves to finishing negotiating on this package by the end of this year and by doing this we made a huge step forward , " said slovenian prime minister janez jansa , whose country holds the european union 's rotating presidency .
" we are convinced that the costs of these measures will be much lower than if we do n't act . " eu targets year-end for climate package agreement bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the eu is under pressure to deliver on its climate promises the current plan aims to meet the european union 's over-arching goal to reduce emissions of carbon dioxide - the main gas responsible for global warming - by 20 percent by 2020 , compared to 1990 levels .
eu member states have committed to go to 30 percent if other countries match them . in the upcoming negotiations on the details of meeting those goals , jansa said : " we need to take into account the different positions of the member states and their needs for economic growth . " in another green move , the eu leaders agreed to support the development of environmentally-friendly products by reducing the level of vat on them . the proposal , first made by british prime minister gordon brown , " will start the debate in many member states about how and whether household goods ... can incentivize consumer behavior towards buying energy-efficient and environmentally friendly goods and services , " brown said . environmental vat on eu agenda bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : brown 's " green tax " idea made a cautious appearance under the decision , the eu 's executive body , the european commission , is tasked with " reflecting " on " the best way to support the development of clean products by evoking the question of environmental vat , " sarkozy said . but the proposal is unlikely to lead to concrete measures soon .
vat is a sensitive issue , since much of the eu 's common budget comes from the vat which consumers pay in each member state , and any decisions on changing rates have to be approved unanimously . " people are being persuaded by the argument that we should look at this very carefully , " brown said .
" vat is a uniquely european tax . ...
we made substantial progress in only two days and i believe that over the next few months other countries will join the debate .

realistic replicas of weapons can no longer be carried in public , the german government decided , as they can easily be mistaken for the real thing .
the police union said the new law does n't go far enough . for the second time since 2002 , when a student in erfurt killed sixteen people at his former high school , the german government has tightened its weapons law to align with the un firearms protocol .
the plan cleared its final legislative hurdle on friday , march 14 , when it was approved by the upper house of parliament . germany is imposing a ban on carrying realistic-looking imitation firearms in public , as police could mistake them for real weapons in a crisis situation .
the ban mainly applies to so-called softair guns , which function with pressurized gas and are often modeled on real-life counterparts . the head of the german police union -lrb- gdp -rrb- konrad freiberg criticized the law as insufficient .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de culture -pipe- 14.03.2008 marx continues to influence 125 years after his death großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : many of karl marx 's theories on politics , society and economics still ring true today friday , march 14 , marks the 125th anniversary of the death of german philosopher and political economist karl marx .
marx is still regarded as hugely influential to the development of 20th century thought . both a scholar and a political activist , marx addressed a wide range of political as well as social issues , and is known for , among other things , his analysis of history .
the interpretations of his theories , particularly those on political economy , have in the course of history generated decades of debate , inspired revolutions and cast him as both devil and deity in political and academic circles . maligned by some , misunderstood by others and celebrated as one of the world 's great thinkers by many more , marx continues to be a divisive and much discussed individual .
while there has been a substantial revival of interest in his theories since the end of the cold war , mainly those which deal with the volatility and shape of capitalism , the question remains as to whether a man who died 125 years ago still has any relevance today . ian hunt , the director of the center for applied philosophy at the flinders university of southern australia , believes that marx and his insights into the capitalist system in particular still have a place in contemporary society . " marx 's thoughts on the exploitative nature of the relationship between capitalist employers and their employees ring true today , " he said .
" the proletariat , or those without property , continues to seek employment from those with property .
control over private investment continues to give the capitalist class decisive influence over government and sufficient control over the supply of labor to ensure that it is sold by employees on terms favorable to the increase of the wealth of employers . " hunt said he believes that marx 's theories on the exploitative nature of the capitalist employment relationship - which skews industrial development toward using up human and natural resources for short-term gain - apply today in the form of climate and energy issues and " the problem of the despotic form of the employer-employee relationship under capitalism . " marx foresaw impact of private dominance bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : marx wrote about the factors which influenced climate change " marx 's analysis of the foundations of a capitalist society raises questions of the justice of the distribution of wealth , and therefore also of income , in capitalist societies , which are even more acute in the modern world than in his own time , " hunt added .
" it also raises questions about the environmental consequences of private dominance of investment that are even more acute today than in the time marx wrote . " simon tormey , the co-director of the center for the study of social and global justice -lrb- cssgj -rrb- at nottingham university , also believes marx was ahead of his time . " the world is pretty much how marx described it 150 years ago , which is quite impressive in itself , " tormey said . " this is to say that we now have a more or less integrated world capitalist system , with a global rich and global poor - as marx predicted .
there is huge exploitation across all societies - the proliferation of sweatshops and export processing zones are all very much in keeping with marx ’ s account . " the peasantry is being systematically wiped out in a global process of dispossession , and of course social democracy , which started as a form of ultra moderate ' marxism , ' marxism-lite if you like , is in retreat in all areas where it once enjoyed hegemony , ” he added . tormey also explained that marx 's theory of class struggle is hugely prevalent in today 's current economic atmosphere . violent class struggle continues off media radar bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : class struggle is evident in often violent industrial action " there are workers there who have been denied trade union representation , who have been denied holiday pay , health care , and other benefits , " he said . " go into any business and you will see owners and workers - the owners can not do without the workers and they want to pay them as little as they can for the most amount of product / output ; the workers want the most they can get . this is class struggle . " the bosses have the laws on their side , the politicians , the state , and the media , " he added . " they are able to contain struggle so that it does n't disrupt society - for the most part . however , beyond the wealthy countries , the picture is very different .
open and violent struggles are commonplace in much of the world ; strikes , lockouts , and beatings of workers in places like china , indonesia , mexico , south africa , and violent peasant conflicts in places like nandigram , india .
look around : class struggle is everywhere and infects almost every human relation . " as well as economics and politics , marx had a great influence on the way people thought about culture .
while not considered to be a pure cultural theorist , marx 's writings on issues such as aesthetics , communication and interpretation contributed in part to a growing cultural studies movement . modern cultural theorists following marx 's ideas " marx 's influence on today 's cultural theorizing derives more from his social theory , which forms a useful context to theorizing culture , and his philosophical ideas in general , including his method of investigation and reasoning , " said johan fornas , director of the advanced cultural studies institute of sweden -lrb- acsis -rrb- .
" he developed some german and hegelian ideas in an exciting and inspiring direction that are still highly relevant for those of us who are engaged in developing cultural theory . " marx has inspired lots of recent thinkers to never cut theoretical concepts loose from experiences of everyday life and instead to understand the importance of situating knowledge in concrete material , embodied and socially organized practices , always interacting with institutionalized networks of power , " he added . despite the continued relevance of a number of marx 's theories , experts are quick to point out that some have little significance in today 's environment while others have been shown to be way off the mark in some cases . prediction of communist world proved wrong bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : even china has diluted its communism in recent times " marx was convinced that communism would replace capitalism but we don ’ t really see much of a communist movement emerging anywhere today , " tormey said . " so the irony might be that at the moment when marx 's ideas are even more relevant , so the attractiveness of marxism -lrb- or more accurately communism -rrb- as a mobilizing ideology seems in decline .
but this of course can change . " marx 's faith in the generation of informed political opposition from worsening material conditions failed to be realized , but that has not made his work irrelevant , hunt said . " his primary work , ' das kapital , ' still stands out as a wonderfully structured and thought through piece of analysis , drawing on the philosophical and economic thought of his time , " he said .
" its condemnation of the specific injustice of the capitalist system has few peers .
so , as long as there are capitalists , marx will remain relevant . " nick amies send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de culture -pipe- 14.03.2008 marx continues to influence 125 years after his death großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : many of karl marx 's theories on politics , society and economics still ring true today friday , march 14 , marks the 125th anniversary of the death of german philosopher and political economist karl marx .
marx is still regarded as hugely influential to the development of 20th century thought . both a scholar and a political activist , marx addressed a wide range of political as well as social issues , and is known for , among other things , his analysis of history .
the interpretations of his theories , particularly those on political economy , have in the course of history generated decades of debate , inspired revolutions and cast him as both devil and deity in political and academic circles . maligned by some , misunderstood by others and celebrated as one of the world 's great thinkers by many more , marx continues to be a divisive and much discussed individual .
while there has been a substantial revival of interest in his theories since the end of the cold war , mainly those which deal with the volatility and shape of capitalism , the question remains as to whether a man who died 125 years ago still has any relevance today . ian hunt , the director of the center for applied philosophy at the flinders university of southern australia , believes that marx and his insights into the capitalist system in particular still have a place in contemporary society . " marx 's thoughts on the exploitative nature of the relationship between capitalist employers and their employees ring true today , " he said .
" the proletariat , or those without property , continues to seek employment from those with property .
control over private investment continues to give the capitalist class decisive influence over government and sufficient control over the supply of labor to ensure that it is sold by employees on terms favorable to the increase of the wealth of employers . " hunt said he believes that marx 's theories on the exploitative nature of the capitalist employment relationship - which skews industrial development toward using up human and natural resources for short-term gain - apply today in the form of climate and energy issues and " the problem of the despotic form of the employer-employee relationship under capitalism . " marx foresaw impact of private dominance bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : marx wrote about the factors which influenced climate change " marx 's analysis of the foundations of a capitalist society raises questions of the justice of the distribution of wealth , and therefore also of income , in capitalist societies , which are even more acute in the modern world than in his own time , " hunt added .
" it also raises questions about the environmental consequences of private dominance of investment that are even more acute today than in the time marx wrote . " simon tormey , the co-director of the center for the study of social and global justice -lrb- cssgj -rrb- at nottingham university , also believes marx was ahead of his time . " the world is pretty much how marx described it 150 years ago , which is quite impressive in itself , " tormey said . " this is to say that we now have a more or less integrated world capitalist system , with a global rich and global poor - as marx predicted .
there is huge exploitation across all societies - the proliferation of sweatshops and export processing zones are all very much in keeping with marx ’ s account . " the peasantry is being systematically wiped out in a global process of dispossession , and of course social democracy , which started as a form of ultra moderate ' marxism , ' marxism-lite if you like , is in retreat in all areas where it once enjoyed hegemony , ” he added . tormey also explained that marx 's theory of class struggle is hugely prevalent in today 's current economic atmosphere . violent class struggle continues off media radar bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : class struggle is evident in often violent industrial action " there are workers there who have been denied trade union representation , who have been denied holiday pay , health care , and other benefits , " he said . " go into any business and you will see owners and workers - the owners can not do without the workers and they want to pay them as little as they can for the most amount of product / output ; the workers want the most they can get . this is class struggle . " the bosses have the laws on their side , the politicians , the state , and the media , " he added . " they are able to contain struggle so that it does n't disrupt society - for the most part . however , beyond the wealthy countries , the picture is very different .
open and violent struggles are commonplace in much of the world ; strikes , lockouts , and beatings of workers in places like china , indonesia , mexico , south africa , and violent peasant conflicts in places like nandigram , india .
look around : class struggle is everywhere and infects almost every human relation . " as well as economics and politics , marx had a great influence on the way people thought about culture .
while not considered to be a pure cultural theorist , marx 's writings on issues such as aesthetics , communication and interpretation contributed in part to a growing cultural studies movement . modern cultural theorists following marx 's ideas " marx 's influence on today 's cultural theorizing derives more from his social theory , which forms a useful context to theorizing culture , and his philosophical ideas in general , including his method of investigation and reasoning , " said johan fornas , director of the advanced cultural studies institute of sweden -lrb- acsis -rrb- .
" he developed some german and hegelian ideas in an exciting and inspiring direction that are still highly relevant for those of us who are engaged in developing cultural theory . " marx has inspired lots of recent thinkers to never cut theoretical concepts loose from experiences of everyday life and instead to understand the importance of situating knowledge in concrete material , embodied and socially organized practices , always interacting with institutionalized networks of power , " he added . despite the continued relevance of a number of marx 's theories , experts are quick to point out that some have little significance in today 's environment while others have been shown to be way off the mark in some cases . prediction of communist world proved wrong bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : even china has diluted its communism in recent times " marx was convinced that communism would replace capitalism but we don ’ t really see much of a communist movement emerging anywhere today , " tormey said . " so the irony might be that at the moment when marx 's ideas are even more relevant , so the attractiveness of marxism -lrb- or more accurately communism -rrb- as a mobilizing ideology seems in decline .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de culture -pipe- 14.03.2008 marx continues to influence 125 years after his death großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : many of karl marx 's theories on politics , society and economics still ring true today friday , march 14 , marks the 125th anniversary of the death of german philosopher and political economist karl marx .
marx is still regarded as hugely influential to the development of 20th century thought . both a scholar and a political activist , marx addressed a wide range of political as well as social issues , and is known for , among other things , his analysis of history .
the interpretations of his theories , particularly those on political economy , have in the course of history generated decades of debate , inspired revolutions and cast him as both devil and deity in political and academic circles . maligned by some , misunderstood by others and celebrated as one of the world 's great thinkers by many more , marx continues to be a divisive and much discussed individual .
while there has been a substantial revival of interest in his theories since the end of the cold war , mainly those which deal with the volatility and shape of capitalism , the question remains as to whether a man who died 125 years ago still has any relevance today . ian hunt , the director of the center for applied philosophy at the flinders university of southern australia , believes that marx and his insights into the capitalist system in particular still have a place in contemporary society . " marx 's thoughts on the exploitative nature of the relationship between capitalist employers and their employees ring true today , " he said .
" the proletariat , or those without property , continues to seek employment from those with property .
control over private investment continues to give the capitalist class decisive influence over government and sufficient control over the supply of labor to ensure that it is sold by employees on terms favorable to the increase of the wealth of employers . " hunt said he believes that marx 's theories on the exploitative nature of the capitalist employment relationship - which skews industrial development toward using up human and natural resources for short-term gain - apply today in the form of climate and energy issues and " the problem of the despotic form of the employer-employee relationship under capitalism . " marx foresaw impact of private dominance bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : marx wrote about the factors which influenced climate change " marx 's analysis of the foundations of a capitalist society raises questions of the justice of the distribution of wealth , and therefore also of income , in capitalist societies , which are even more acute in the modern world than in his own time , " hunt added .
" it also raises questions about the environmental consequences of private dominance of investment that are even more acute today than in the time marx wrote . " simon tormey , the co-director of the center for the study of social and global justice -lrb- cssgj -rrb- at nottingham university , also believes marx was ahead of his time . " the world is pretty much how marx described it 150 years ago , which is quite impressive in itself , " tormey said . " this is to say that we now have a more or less integrated world capitalist system , with a global rich and global poor - as marx predicted .
there is huge exploitation across all societies - the proliferation of sweatshops and export processing zones are all very much in keeping with marx ’ s account . " the peasantry is being systematically wiped out in a global process of dispossession , and of course social democracy , which started as a form of ultra moderate ' marxism , ' marxism-lite if you like , is in retreat in all areas where it once enjoyed hegemony , ” he added . tormey also explained that marx 's theory of class struggle is hugely prevalent in today 's current economic atmosphere . violent class struggle continues off media radar bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : class struggle is evident in often violent industrial action " there are workers there who have been denied trade union representation , who have been denied holiday pay , health care , and other benefits , " he said . " go into any business and you will see owners and workers - the owners can not do without the workers and they want to pay them as little as they can for the most amount of product / output ; the workers want the most they can get . this is class struggle . " the bosses have the laws on their side , the politicians , the state , and the media , " he added . " they are able to contain struggle so that it does n't disrupt society - for the most part . however , beyond the wealthy countries , the picture is very different .
open and violent struggles are commonplace in much of the world ; strikes , lockouts , and beatings of workers in places like china , indonesia , mexico , south africa , and violent peasant conflicts in places like nandigram , india .
look around : class struggle is everywhere and infects almost every human relation . " as well as economics and politics , marx had a great influence on the way people thought about culture .
while not considered to be a pure cultural theorist , marx 's writings on issues such as aesthetics , communication and interpretation contributed in part to a growing cultural studies movement . modern cultural theorists following marx 's ideas " marx 's influence on today 's cultural theorizing derives more from his social theory , which forms a useful context to theorizing culture , and his philosophical ideas in general , including his method of investigation and reasoning , " said johan fornas , director of the advanced cultural studies institute of sweden -lrb- acsis -rrb- .
" he developed some german and hegelian ideas in an exciting and inspiring direction that are still highly relevant for those of us who are engaged in developing cultural theory . " marx has inspired lots of recent thinkers to never cut theoretical concepts loose from experiences of everyday life and instead to understand the importance of situating knowledge in concrete material , embodied and socially organized practices , always interacting with institutionalized networks of power , " he added . despite the continued relevance of a number of marx 's theories , experts are quick to point out that some have little significance in today 's environment while others have been shown to be way off the mark in some cases . prediction of communist world proved wrong bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : even china has diluted its communism in recent times " marx was convinced that communism would replace capitalism but we don ’ t really see much of a communist movement emerging anywhere today , " tormey said . " so the irony might be that at the moment when marx 's ideas are even more relevant , so the attractiveness of marxism -lrb- or more accurately communism -rrb- as a mobilizing ideology seems in decline .
but this of course can change . " marx 's faith in the generation of informed political opposition from worsening material conditions failed to be realized , but that has not made his work irrelevant , hunt said . " his primary work , ' das kapital , ' still stands out as a wonderfully structured and thought through piece of analysis , drawing on the philosophical and economic thought of his time , " he said .
" its condemnation of the specific injustice of the capitalist system has few peers .
so , as long as there are capitalists , marx will remain relevant . " nick amies send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

victory for either side could have dramatic effects on the islamic republic 's relations with the west . parliamentary elections ended on friday night in iran after 15 hours following the interior ministry 's decision to extend the voting time five times from 6 p.m. to 11 p.m. local time in response to what was proclaimed to be public demand .
the iranian vote pitted the ruling ultra-conservative faction close to president mahmoud ahmadinejad against reformists close to former president mohammad khatami and a conservative faction headed by former chief nuclear negotiator , ali larijani .
with a total of 4,400 candidates running for 290 seats and with votes being cast manually , the first results from the provinces were expected to be announced by saturday noon , while results for the politically important tehran constituency were not expected before monday .
the first to vote was iran 's supreme leader ayatollah ali khamenei who asked the people to determine their political future by going to the polls .
former iranian president akbar hashemi-rafsanjani voted in the morning and called on the people to vote in order to strengthen the legislature 's power .
ahmadinejad 's rivals urge public to vote bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : rafsanjani is a fierce opponent of ahmadinejad " if you do not vote , then those whom you do not want will get into the parliament again , " said the cleric who is a strong opponent of ahmadinejad .
" the new parliament should definitely increase its supervision -lsb- of the government 's performance -rsb- , " rafsanjani added .
president ahmadinejad cut short his state visit to senegal to be in tehran for the elections .
immediately after arrival , he rushed to the lorzadeh mosque in south-eastern tehran to cast his vote .
" billions of eyes -lsb- in the world -rsb- are focused on us to see how we determine our political destiny by ourselves in these elections , " ahmadinejad said . „ many -lsb- islamic -rsb- countries look for a model country -lsb- to follow -rsb- and have chosen iran as their model , " the president added .
the parliamentary elections are widely regarded as a test for ahmadinejad and an assessment of his performance in the 30 months of his presidency .
failure on economic reforms threatens president bildunterschrift : mahmoud ahmadinejad faces a referendum on his 30-month presidency the main concern for voters is the economy as ahmadinejad has failed to realize his economic reforms .
despite drastically increasing oil prices , inflation - ranging between 20 to 30 percent - is higher than before summer 2005 .
meanwhile , interior minister mostafa poumohammadi told press tv that final results would be announced within three or four days , starting first with the smaller provinces and later the big cities .
the votes in the provinces are counted by hand .
in the capital tehran the counting has for the first time been computerized but there will be manual counting as well for reconfirmation .
claims of high turnout go unconfirmed bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : iranians tend to vote enthusiastically in elections in tehran , witnesses reported that a large number of people had gone to the polling stations in the southern part of the capital early on friday , while in northern tehran people usually prefer to vote in the afternoon .
the elections were being held one week before the persian new year -lsb- march 21 -rsb- and many iranians were still busy with new year shopping and preparations , which might have a major impact on the turnout .
the interior ministry called the turnout so far " magnificent " and state media said that at least 60 percent of the electorate had so far voted .
these turnout claims could not be confirmed by neutral observers . dpa news agency -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

realistic replicas of weapons can no longer be carried in public , the german government decided , as they can easily be mistaken for the real thing .
the police union said the new law does n't go far enough . for the second time since 2002 , when a student in erfurt killed sixteen people at his former high school , the german government has tightened its weapons law to align with the un firearms protocol .
the plan cleared its final legislative hurdle on friday , march 14 , when it was approved by the upper house of parliament . germany is imposing a ban on carrying realistic-looking imitation firearms in public , as police could mistake them for real weapons in a crisis situation .
the ban mainly applies to so-called softair guns , which function with pressurized gas and are often modeled on real-life counterparts . the head of the german police union -lrb- gdp -rrb- konrad freiberg criticized the law as insufficient .
it 's a scandal that the german government has excluded a nation-wide weapons registry from its reforms , he said . inherited guns must be disabled bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : realistic weapons are allowed at historical festivals under the law , people can still sell , purchase and possess replica firearms , but they must be transported in a closed container .
switchblades and knives with a blade longer than 12 centimeters -lrb- 4.7 inches -rrb- may also not be carried in public . violators face fines of up to 10,000 euros -lrb- $ 15,600 -rrb- .
exceptions , however , will be made for historical re-enactments . toy weapons that can not be mistaken for real guns are not affected by the law . furthermore , the new weapons law places restrictions on firearms inherited as of april 1 , 2008 .
if the heir can not prove a personal need for the weapon - for example , if he or she is a hunter or a member of a shooting club - it may only be kept if it 's been disabled . dw staff -lrb- kjb -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

his agenda 2010 is still splitting german politics as the spd loses ground . the liberal market reforms gerhard schroeder announced on march 14 , 2003 led to talk of social inequality in germany and the emergence of a new underclass .
nevertheless , unemployment is now down and economic growth is up . while center-left members of his social democratic party praised the measures this week , the spd 's far-left wing , the left party and the labor unions had harsh words for the agenda 2010 . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : schroeder still stand by his agenda 2010 spd party leader kurt beck said thursday in a speech marking the anniversary of the reforms that schroeder 's address five years ago had signalled " the start of major successes in the areas of economy and the labor market . " " now we have to work towards bringing the agenda 's successes to all the people , " said beck , whose popularity is at an all-time low , according to several recent surveys . foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier said there had been no alternative to the far-reaching reforms made to the social and labor systems over the past five years . " we had to choose this policy , knowing that it could lead to pain and loss , " he said . reaganomics from the left the agenda 2010 , which has been compared to reaganomics in the us and thatcherism in britain , aimed to improve economic growth and reduce unemployment by slashing not only income tax but also unemployment benefits and pensions . the move met with approval from the conservative christian democratic and the liberal , free-market free democratic party , but immediately drew resistance from schroeder 's own social democrats .
he 'd been elected in 2002 promising not to cut social benefits . thousands of the spd 's center-left members abandoned the party as a result , though the far-left stayed on , shifting the party 's core .
due to inner-party pressure , schroeder resigned as party chair in february 2004 .
he remained chancellor , however , until 2005 when he was forced to acknowledge defeat and call for early elections , paving the way for christian democratic chancellor angela merkel . schroeder 's massive cuts , particularly to unemployment benefits , led to talk of deepening economic inequality and the emergence of a new underclass . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : cuts to unemployment benefits spurred mass protests the discourse was fuelled when the friedrich ebert foundation , a political foundation closely associated with the spd , published a study in late 2006 indicating that four percent of people in western germany and 20 percent in eastern germany were living in " precarious " economic conditions and felt " left behind " by politicians and society . nevertheless , unemployment sank from 10.6 percent in 2005 - the highest it had been since german reunification - to 8.3 percent in 2007 . schroeder warns against leftward lean former chancellor schroeder on thursday defended his agenda 2010 as being " good and right . "
referring to the fundamental shift to the left that his party has taken , in part due to the controversy surrounding the reforms , he added that " the spd can only achieve a majority if it 's anchored in the middle of society and does n't abandon this position . " franz-juergen weise , chairman of the federal employment office , said in an interview with the friday edition of the leipziger zeitung that the structural reorganization of his agency has resulted in " 18 million euros -lrb- $ 27.75 million -rrb- in savings , solid financing for unemployment insurance -lsb- and -rsb- lower premiums . " in contrast , michael sommer , the head of the federation of german trade unions , commented that the agenda 2010 had widened the economic gap in german society . critique from spd 's biggest rival bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the left party has benefitted from the spd 's popularity drop the bulk of the criticism , however , came from the left .
today , hundreds of thousands of full-time employees " earn less than those who receive hartz iv unemployment benefits , " said spd member ottmar schreiner in zdf . " that was made possible in part by the agenda , " he said . oskar lafontaine , who left the spd in 2005 to found the growing left party , condemned the agenda , saying that " five years of agenda 2010 mean five years of neo-liberal dead-ends and the destruction of social peace and the people 's trust in politics . " the success of lafontaine 's new left party , comprised in part of dissatisfied former spd members , represents a mounting political threat to the spd .

victory for either side could have dramatic effects on the islamic republic 's relations with the west . parliamentary elections ended on friday night in iran after 15 hours following the interior ministry 's decision to extend the voting time five times from 6 p.m. to 11 p.m. local time in response to what was proclaimed to be public demand .
the iranian vote pitted the ruling ultra-conservative faction close to president mahmoud ahmadinejad against reformists close to former president mohammad khatami and a conservative faction headed by former chief nuclear negotiator , ali larijani .
with a total of 4,400 candidates running for 290 seats and with votes being cast manually , the first results from the provinces were expected to be announced by saturday noon , while results for the politically important tehran constituency were not expected before monday .
the first to vote was iran 's supreme leader ayatollah ali khamenei who asked the people to determine their political future by going to the polls .
former iranian president akbar hashemi-rafsanjani voted in the morning and called on the people to vote in order to strengthen the legislature 's power .
ahmadinejad 's rivals urge public to vote bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : rafsanjani is a fierce opponent of ahmadinejad " if you do not vote , then those whom you do not want will get into the parliament again , " said the cleric who is a strong opponent of ahmadinejad .
" the new parliament should definitely increase its supervision -lsb- of the government 's performance -rsb- , " rafsanjani added .
president ahmadinejad cut short his state visit to senegal to be in tehran for the elections .
immediately after arrival , he rushed to the lorzadeh mosque in south-eastern tehran to cast his vote .
" billions of eyes -lsb- in the world -rsb- are focused on us to see how we determine our political destiny by ourselves in these elections , " ahmadinejad said . „ many -lsb- islamic -rsb- countries look for a model country -lsb- to follow -rsb- and have chosen iran as their model , " the president added .

but bulgarians are n't interested in hearing about their politicians ' pasts . the head of the government , four vice-premiers and 25 democratically elected ministers are among those with a connection to the secret service .
current president georgi parvanov worked under the code name gotse ; his predecessor jean videnov was also a special agent . former spies are especially prevalent in the foreign ministry and in diplomatic service .
three former ministers , 13 deputies and even bulgaria 's current nato ambassador were all part of the communist intelligence cadre . an investigative committee commissioned by parliament examined 673 government officials who had served since the fall of the iron curtain in 1990 and found that 108 were linked to communist intelligence . " informal networks that were linked to the repressive communist apparatus … continue to lead to corruption , " sonja schueler from the southeast europe association told deutsche welle .

they are free to continue working in politics .
the situation is similar in germany , where the government committee responsible for opening the secret service files is only charged with informing the public . " the decision about the consequences is in the hands of those who put the politicians in office , " said andreas schulze , spokesman for the german organization that researches the former east german stasi . nevertheless , public curiosity around the topic is n't particularly strong in bulgaria .
all across central and eastern europe , the younger generation has n't shown much interest in digging up their country 's communist past . a wide variety of reasons come into play - the inability of historians to analyze the communist period objectively , low education levels among the population and the dependence of people 's career success on the system are just a few . older generations also tend to be skeptical of opening the secret files .
the entire soviet bloc was based on a foundation of unofficial informants , which means that plenty of ordinary citizens turned in information about friends , neighbors or acquaintances .
some of them are afraid that the skeletons in their closets will be exposed . close ties to the kgb bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the bulgarian secret service worked closely with the kgb not only are the activities of the secret police considered today to be human rights violations , but some of its elements were unconstitutional even during the communist regime .
the secret service was , for example , not subject to the judicial system but was run directly by the communist party . furthermore , the fact that the bulgarian secret police effectively functioned as an arm of russia 's kgb undermined the country 's raison d 'etat .
not to mention that bulgaria 's foreign intelligence was also involved in operations where blood was spilled . communist east germany 's last secret police chief march wolf wrote that , in the 1950s , his bulgarian and polish counterparts were known for having committed the most murders . former spies make europe uneasy bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bout , nicknamed " merchant of death , " was arrested in thailand this week " the bulgarian intelligence service was the one in the former east bloc that worked most closely together with the kgb , " said german journalist and crime expert juergen roth . top-ranking bulgarian politicians ' contacts to the kgb are seen in brussels as a potential security risk , particularly when sensitive topics like eu and nato are on the table .

but bulgarians are n't interested in hearing about their politicians ' pasts . the head of the government , four vice-premiers and 25 democratically elected ministers are among those with a connection to the secret service .
current president georgi parvanov worked under the code name gotse ; his predecessor jean videnov was also a special agent . former spies are especially prevalent in the foreign ministry and in diplomatic service .
three former ministers , 13 deputies and even bulgaria 's current nato ambassador were all part of the communist intelligence cadre . an investigative committee commissioned by parliament examined 673 government officials who had served since the fall of the iron curtain in 1990 and found that 108 were linked to communist intelligence . " informal networks that were linked to the repressive communist apparatus … continue to lead to corruption , " sonja schueler from the southeast europe association told deutsche welle .
" personal loyalties determine the decisions that are made and the socio-economic development of the country . " little interest in opened files bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : both parvanov -lrb- right -rrb- and putin had worked for their countries ' secret service the probe was made possible by a new law that is meant to ensure access to the files , but does n't take action against the ex-informants .
they are free to continue working in politics .
the situation is similar in germany , where the government committee responsible for opening the secret service files is only charged with informing the public . " the decision about the consequences is in the hands of those who put the politicians in office , " said andreas schulze , spokesman for the german organization that researches the former east german stasi . nevertheless , public curiosity around the topic is n't particularly strong in bulgaria .
all across central and eastern europe , the younger generation has n't shown much interest in digging up their country 's communist past . a wide variety of reasons come into play - the inability of historians to analyze the communist period objectively , low education levels among the population and the dependence of people 's career success on the system are just a few . older generations also tend to be skeptical of opening the secret files .
the entire soviet bloc was based on a foundation of unofficial informants , which means that plenty of ordinary citizens turned in information about friends , neighbors or acquaintances .
some of them are afraid that the skeletons in their closets will be exposed . close ties to the kgb bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the bulgarian secret service worked closely with the kgb not only are the activities of the secret police considered today to be human rights violations , but some of its elements were unconstitutional even during the communist regime .
the secret service was , for example , not subject to the judicial system but was run directly by the communist party . furthermore , the fact that the bulgarian secret police effectively functioned as an arm of russia 's kgb undermined the country 's raison d 'etat .
not to mention that bulgaria 's foreign intelligence was also involved in operations where blood was spilled . communist east germany 's last secret police chief march wolf wrote that , in the 1950s , his bulgarian and polish counterparts were known for having committed the most murders . former spies make europe uneasy bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bout , nicknamed " merchant of death , " was arrested in thailand this week " the bulgarian intelligence service was the one in the former east bloc that worked most closely together with the kgb , " said german journalist and crime expert juergen roth . top-ranking bulgarian politicians ' contacts to the kgb are seen in brussels as a potential security risk , particularly when sensitive topics like eu and nato are on the table .
bulgaria became a member of the european union on jan .

washington is attempting to divide the people and to make the parliament independent , the president of the iranian parliament said , adding that the us would not succeed . other conservative politicians have launched a campaign against reform-minded parliamentarian noureddine pir mouazaem because he gave the voice of america an interview regarding the elections .
but it 's not just the supposed attempts of the " great satan " to make contact with liberal forces in iran that are under fire - even germany has received a tongue-lashing . herbert honsowitz , the german ambassador in tehran was massively attacked in the media and in public statements because he met with the head of the reform movement , mohamed-reza khatami and allegedly listened to his complaints about the poor foreign policy " performance . " honsowitz , an old hand at iranian and middle east issues , did n't make a fuss about the criticism because he pointed out that he had also spoken with conservative politicians .
that was enough for a renewed salvo from the conservatives .
honsowitz , it was said , also met with former president khatami on the eve of the last round of un sanctions passed against iran .
that was accepted as proof that germany , which is almost considered part of the enemy camp , and the reformers were working together on crafting an anti-iran policy . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : dw 's peter philipp said europe has to brace for bad times with iran of course , these events took place in the run-up to the elections , and the criticism was probably partly campaigning rhetoric .
but it still ca n't just be pushed aside and ignored because it touches a sore point among iranians : if there 's one thing that iranians of every color react sensitively to it 's foreign interference in their affairs or even a suspicion of such intervention . it 's a feeling that stems from the country 's history as iran repeatedly was the playing field where foreign powers wielded their influence .
even 29 years after the " islamic revolution " - which made the country independent from such things - the ghost of foreign influence still haunts iranians .
that goes so far as to not tolerate foreign criticism about flaws in the country with the reminder , " this or that may not be good , but we 've done it ourselves . " you do n't need long to find proof of such behavior .

the us approach in the nuclear row is another .
in the latter , disappointment and , to a certain extent , anger about the behavior of europeans - and particularly that of germany - play a role . many iranians feel a traditional kinship with germany .
for many of them , germany has been a role model in many aspects .
in recent times , such respect is increasingly mixed with surprise , bafflement and also anger about berlin 's stance in the nuclear dispute and on sanctions against iran . it 's the kind of position the iranians are used to from the united states , but surely not germany ?
a businessman , just back from a visit to germany , said bitterly that the germans should not be surprised that iran may one day repair its ties to the us but would not forget the " betrayal " of the germans so easily .

" honsowitz , an old hand at iranian and middle east issues , did n't make a fuss about the criticism because he pointed out that he had also spoken with conservative politicians .
that was enough for a renewed salvo from the conservatives .
honsowitz , it was said , also met with former president khatami on the eve of the last round of un sanctions passed against iran .
that was accepted as proof that germany , which is almost considered part of the enemy camp , and the reformers were working together on crafting an anti-iran policy . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : dw 's peter philipp said europe has to brace for bad times with iran of course , these events took place in the run-up to the elections , and the criticism was probably partly campaigning rhetoric .
but it still ca n't just be pushed aside and ignored because it touches a sore point among iranians : if there 's one thing that iranians of every color react sensitively to it 's foreign interference in their affairs or even a suspicion of such intervention . it 's a feeling that stems from the country 's history as iran repeatedly was the playing field where foreign powers wielded their influence .
even 29 years after the " islamic revolution " - which made the country independent from such things - the ghost of foreign influence still haunts iranians .
that goes so far as to not tolerate foreign criticism about flaws in the country with the reminder , " this or that may not be good , but we 've done it ourselves . " you do n't need long to find proof of such behavior .
washington 's call for regime change in tehran , is an example .
the us approach in the nuclear row is another .
in the latter , disappointment and , to a certain extent , anger about the behavior of europeans - and particularly that of germany - play a role . many iranians feel a traditional kinship with germany .
for many of them , germany has been a role model in many aspects .
in recent times , such respect is increasingly mixed with surprise , bafflement and also anger about berlin 's stance in the nuclear dispute and on sanctions against iran . it 's the kind of position the iranians are used to from the united states , but surely not germany ?
a businessman , just back from a visit to germany , said bitterly that the germans should not be surprised that iran may one day repair its ties to the us but would not forget the " betrayal " of the germans so easily .
disappointment in friendship hurts more than " straightforward and open enmity . " it 's not just the germans but the europeans in general who need to prepare for bad times with iran .
politically , they 've let down iran and they will be punished for it with contempt .
today , the russian ambassador is the most important foreign diplomat in teheran . and if politics does n't work , business is bound to suffer as well .
china , japan and south korea together - and not the eu - already make up iran 's most important trading partner . peter philipp , currently in iran -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de politics -pipe- 14.03.2008 five years on , welfare reforms still divide germany 's spd großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : more people have jobs but the verdict is out on whether the reforms cleaned up the economy five years ago , former chancellor schroeder initiated a series of social and labor reforms that divided his party and cost him the chancellery .
his agenda 2010 is still splitting german politics as the spd loses ground . the liberal market reforms gerhard schroeder announced on march 14 , 2003 led to talk of social inequality in germany and the emergence of a new underclass .
nevertheless , unemployment is now down and economic growth is up . while center-left members of his social democratic party praised the measures this week , the spd 's far-left wing , the left party and the labor unions had harsh words for the agenda 2010 . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : schroeder still stand by his agenda 2010 spd party leader kurt beck said thursday in a speech marking the anniversary of the reforms that schroeder 's address five years ago had signalled " the start of major successes in the areas of economy and the labor market . " " now we have to work towards bringing the agenda 's successes to all the people , " said beck , whose popularity is at an all-time low , according to several recent surveys . foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier said there had been no alternative to the far-reaching reforms made to the social and labor systems over the past five years . " we had to choose this policy , knowing that it could lead to pain and loss , " he said . reaganomics from the left the agenda 2010 , which has been compared to reaganomics in the us and thatcherism in britain , aimed to improve economic growth and reduce unemployment by slashing not only income tax but also unemployment benefits and pensions . the move met with approval from the conservative christian democratic and the liberal , free-market free democratic party , but immediately drew resistance from schroeder 's own social democrats .
he 'd been elected in 2002 promising not to cut social benefits . thousands of the spd 's center-left members abandoned the party as a result , though the far-left stayed on , shifting the party 's core .
due to inner-party pressure , schroeder resigned as party chair in february 2004 .
he remained chancellor , however , until 2005 when he was forced to acknowledge defeat and call for early elections , paving the way for christian democratic chancellor angela merkel . schroeder 's massive cuts , particularly to unemployment benefits , led to talk of deepening economic inequality and the emergence of a new underclass . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : cuts to unemployment benefits spurred mass protests the discourse was fuelled when the friedrich ebert foundation , a political foundation closely associated with the spd , published a study in late 2006 indicating that four percent of people in western germany and 20 percent in eastern germany were living in " precarious " economic conditions and felt " left behind " by politicians and society . nevertheless , unemployment sank from 10.6 percent in 2005 - the highest it had been since german reunification - to 8.3 percent in 2007 . schroeder warns against leftward lean former chancellor schroeder on thursday defended his agenda 2010 as being " good and right . "
referring to the fundamental shift to the left that his party has taken , in part due to the controversy surrounding the reforms , he added that " the spd can only achieve a majority if it 's anchored in the middle of society and does n't abandon this position . " franz-juergen weise , chairman of the federal employment office , said in an interview with the friday edition of the leipziger zeitung that the structural reorganization of his agency has resulted in " 18 million euros -lrb- $ 27.75 million -rrb- in savings , solid financing for unemployment insurance -lsb- and -rsb- lower premiums . " in contrast , michael sommer , the head of the federation of german trade unions , commented that the agenda 2010 had widened the economic gap in german society . critique from spd 's biggest rival bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the left party has benefitted from the spd 's popularity drop the bulk of the criticism , however , came from the left .
today , hundreds of thousands of full-time employees " earn less than those who receive hartz iv unemployment benefits , " said spd member ottmar schreiner in zdf . " that was made possible in part by the agenda , " he said . oskar lafontaine , who left the spd in 2005 to found the growing left party , condemned the agenda , saying that " five years of agenda 2010 mean five years of neo-liberal dead-ends and the destruction of social peace and the people 's trust in politics . " the success of lafontaine 's new left party , comprised in part of dissatisfied former spd members , represents a mounting political threat to the spd .

his agenda 2010 is still splitting german politics as the spd loses ground . the liberal market reforms gerhard schroeder announced on march 14 , 2003 led to talk of social inequality in germany and the emergence of a new underclass .
nevertheless , unemployment is now down and economic growth is up . while center-left members of his social democratic party praised the measures this week , the spd 's far-left wing , the left party and the labor unions had harsh words for the agenda 2010 . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : schroeder still stand by his agenda 2010 spd party leader kurt beck said thursday in a speech marking the anniversary of the reforms that schroeder 's address five years ago had signalled " the start of major successes in the areas of economy and the labor market . " " now we have to work towards bringing the agenda 's successes to all the people , " said beck , whose popularity is at an all-time low , according to several recent surveys . foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier said there had been no alternative to the far-reaching reforms made to the social and labor systems over the past five years . " we had to choose this policy , knowing that it could lead to pain and loss , " he said . reaganomics from the left the agenda 2010 , which has been compared to reaganomics in the us and thatcherism in britain , aimed to improve economic growth and reduce unemployment by slashing not only income tax but also unemployment benefits and pensions . the move met with approval from the conservative christian democratic and the liberal , free-market free democratic party , but immediately drew resistance from schroeder 's own social democrats .
he 'd been elected in 2002 promising not to cut social benefits . thousands of the spd 's center-left members abandoned the party as a result , though the far-left stayed on , shifting the party 's core .
due to inner-party pressure , schroeder resigned as party chair in february 2004 .
he remained chancellor , however , until 2005 when he was forced to acknowledge defeat and call for early elections , paving the way for christian democratic chancellor angela merkel . schroeder 's massive cuts , particularly to unemployment benefits , led to talk of deepening economic inequality and the emergence of a new underclass . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : cuts to unemployment benefits spurred mass protests the discourse was fuelled when the friedrich ebert foundation , a political foundation closely associated with the spd , published a study in late 2006 indicating that four percent of people in western germany and 20 percent in eastern germany were living in " precarious " economic conditions and felt " left behind " by politicians and society . nevertheless , unemployment sank from 10.6 percent in 2005 - the highest it had been since german reunification - to 8.3 percent in 2007 . schroeder warns against leftward lean former chancellor schroeder on thursday defended his agenda 2010 as being " good and right .

and then , moreover , taking the opportunity to promote better integration of saudi arabia 's christian minority , ignoring public prejudices and protests against the building of new , strange-looking churches in their neighborhoods to emphasize the principle of religious freedom and call for christianity classes in saudi schools . # b # it 's a wholly unlikely scenario .
and not just in saudi arabia , where christian immigrants from asia suffer extreme religious discrimination , but also in more liberal muslim countries such as turkey .

wolfgang schaeuble hopes that improved dialogue between representatives of the state and the muslim community will help advance the integration of germany 's 3 million muslims , which has been neglected for decades .

schaeuble should be given due respect for concentrating his contribution to this very difficult dialogue on the basics - and what 's actually possible .
the real problems are tied up with social integration and are the hardest to solve .
teaching islam in german is widely seen as a necessity .
but the various germans states have yet to agree on what form it might take - and so do muslims .
there is still so much that has yet to be agreed on , as becomes apparent again and again .

victory for either side could have dramatic effects on the islamic republic 's relations with the west . parliamentary elections ended on friday night in iran after 15 hours following the interior ministry 's decision to extend the voting time five times from 6 p.m. to 11 p.m. local time in response to what was proclaimed to be public demand .
the iranian vote pitted the ruling ultra-conservative faction close to president mahmoud ahmadinejad against reformists close to former president mohammad khatami and a conservative faction headed by former chief nuclear negotiator , ali larijani .
with a total of 4,400 candidates running for 290 seats and with votes being cast manually , the first results from the provinces were expected to be announced by saturday noon , while results for the politically important tehran constituency were not expected before monday .
the first to vote was iran 's supreme leader ayatollah ali khamenei who asked the people to determine their political future by going to the polls .
former iranian president akbar hashemi-rafsanjani voted in the morning and called on the people to vote in order to strengthen the legislature 's power .
ahmadinejad 's rivals urge public to vote bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : rafsanjani is a fierce opponent of ahmadinejad " if you do not vote , then those whom you do not want will get into the parliament again , " said the cleric who is a strong opponent of ahmadinejad .
" the new parliament should definitely increase its supervision -lsb- of the government 's performance -rsb- , " rafsanjani added .
president ahmadinejad cut short his state visit to senegal to be in tehran for the elections .
immediately after arrival , he rushed to the lorzadeh mosque in south-eastern tehran to cast his vote .
" billions of eyes -lsb- in the world -rsb- are focused on us to see how we determine our political destiny by ourselves in these elections , " ahmadinejad said . „ many -lsb- islamic -rsb- countries look for a model country -lsb- to follow -rsb- and have chosen iran as their model , " the president added .
the parliamentary elections are widely regarded as a test for ahmadinejad and an assessment of his performance in the 30 months of his presidency .
failure on economic reforms threatens president bildunterschrift : mahmoud ahmadinejad faces a referendum on his 30-month presidency the main concern for voters is the economy as ahmadinejad has failed to realize his economic reforms .
despite drastically increasing oil prices , inflation - ranging between 20 to 30 percent - is higher than before summer 2005 .
meanwhile , interior minister mostafa poumohammadi told press tv that final results would be announced within three or four days , starting first with the smaller provinces and later the big cities .
the votes in the provinces are counted by hand .
in the capital tehran the counting has for the first time been computerized but there will be manual counting as well for reconfirmation .
claims of high turnout go unconfirmed bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : iranians tend to vote enthusiastically in elections in tehran , witnesses reported that a large number of people had gone to the polling stations in the southern part of the capital early on friday , while in northern tehran people usually prefer to vote in the afternoon .
the elections were being held one week before the persian new year -lsb- march 21 -rsb- and many iranians were still busy with new year shopping and preparations , which might have a major impact on the turnout .
the interior ministry called the turnout so far " magnificent " and state media said that at least 60 percent of the electorate had so far voted .
these turnout claims could not be confirmed by neutral observers . dpa news agency -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de culture -pipe- 14.03.2008 marx continues to influence 125 years after his death großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : many of karl marx 's theories on politics , society and economics still ring true today friday , march 14 , marks the 125th anniversary of the death of german philosopher and political economist karl marx .
marx is still regarded as hugely influential to the development of 20th century thought . both a scholar and a political activist , marx addressed a wide range of political as well as social issues , and is known for , among other things , his analysis of history .
the interpretations of his theories , particularly those on political economy , have in the course of history generated decades of debate , inspired revolutions and cast him as both devil and deity in political and academic circles . maligned by some , misunderstood by others and celebrated as one of the world 's great thinkers by many more , marx continues to be a divisive and much discussed individual .
while there has been a substantial revival of interest in his theories since the end of the cold war , mainly those which deal with the volatility and shape of capitalism , the question remains as to whether a man who died 125 years ago still has any relevance today . ian hunt , the director of the center for applied philosophy at the flinders university of southern australia , believes that marx and his insights into the capitalist system in particular still have a place in contemporary society . " marx 's thoughts on the exploitative nature of the relationship between capitalist employers and their employees ring true today , " he said .
" the proletariat , or those without property , continues to seek employment from those with property .
control over private investment continues to give the capitalist class decisive influence over government and sufficient control over the supply of labor to ensure that it is sold by employees on terms favorable to the increase of the wealth of employers . " hunt said he believes that marx 's theories on the exploitative nature of the capitalist employment relationship - which skews industrial development toward using up human and natural resources for short-term gain - apply today in the form of climate and energy issues and " the problem of the despotic form of the employer-employee relationship under capitalism . " marx foresaw impact of private dominance bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : marx wrote about the factors which influenced climate change " marx 's analysis of the foundations of a capitalist society raises questions of the justice of the distribution of wealth , and therefore also of income , in capitalist societies , which are even more acute in the modern world than in his own time , " hunt added .
" it also raises questions about the environmental consequences of private dominance of investment that are even more acute today than in the time marx wrote . " simon tormey , the co-director of the center for the study of social and global justice -lrb- cssgj -rrb- at nottingham university , also believes marx was ahead of his time . " the world is pretty much how marx described it 150 years ago , which is quite impressive in itself , " tormey said . " this is to say that we now have a more or less integrated world capitalist system , with a global rich and global poor - as marx predicted .
there is huge exploitation across all societies - the proliferation of sweatshops and export processing zones are all very much in keeping with marx ’ s account . " the peasantry is being systematically wiped out in a global process of dispossession , and of course social democracy , which started as a form of ultra moderate ' marxism , ' marxism-lite if you like , is in retreat in all areas where it once enjoyed hegemony , ” he added . tormey also explained that marx 's theory of class struggle is hugely prevalent in today 's current economic atmosphere . violent class struggle continues off media radar bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : class struggle is evident in often violent industrial action " there are workers there who have been denied trade union representation , who have been denied holiday pay , health care , and other benefits , " he said . " go into any business and you will see owners and workers - the owners can not do without the workers and they want to pay them as little as they can for the most amount of product / output ; the workers want the most they can get . this is class struggle . " the bosses have the laws on their side , the politicians , the state , and the media , " he added . " they are able to contain struggle so that it does n't disrupt society - for the most part . however , beyond the wealthy countries , the picture is very different .
open and violent struggles are commonplace in much of the world ; strikes , lockouts , and beatings of workers in places like china , indonesia , mexico , south africa , and violent peasant conflicts in places like nandigram , india .
look around : class struggle is everywhere and infects almost every human relation . " as well as economics and politics , marx had a great influence on the way people thought about culture .
while not considered to be a pure cultural theorist , marx 's writings on issues such as aesthetics , communication and interpretation contributed in part to a growing cultural studies movement . modern cultural theorists following marx 's ideas " marx 's influence on today 's cultural theorizing derives more from his social theory , which forms a useful context to theorizing culture , and his philosophical ideas in general , including his method of investigation and reasoning , " said johan fornas , director of the advanced cultural studies institute of sweden -lrb- acsis -rrb- .
" he developed some german and hegelian ideas in an exciting and inspiring direction that are still highly relevant for those of us who are engaged in developing cultural theory . " marx has inspired lots of recent thinkers to never cut theoretical concepts loose from experiences of everyday life and instead to understand the importance of situating knowledge in concrete material , embodied and socially organized practices , always interacting with institutionalized networks of power , " he added . despite the continued relevance of a number of marx 's theories , experts are quick to point out that some have little significance in today 's environment while others have been shown to be way off the mark in some cases . prediction of communist world proved wrong bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : even china has diluted its communism in recent times " marx was convinced that communism would replace capitalism but we don ’ t really see much of a communist movement emerging anywhere today , " tormey said . " so the irony might be that at the moment when marx 's ideas are even more relevant , so the attractiveness of marxism -lrb- or more accurately communism -rrb- as a mobilizing ideology seems in decline .
but this of course can change . " marx 's faith in the generation of informed political opposition from worsening material conditions failed to be realized , but that has not made his work irrelevant , hunt said . " his primary work , ' das kapital , ' still stands out as a wonderfully structured and thought through piece of analysis , drawing on the philosophical and economic thought of his time , " he said .
" its condemnation of the specific injustice of the capitalist system has few peers .
so , as long as there are capitalists , marx will remain relevant . " nick amies send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

realistic replicas of weapons can no longer be carried in public , the german government decided , as they can easily be mistaken for the real thing .
the police union said the new law does n't go far enough . for the second time since 2002 , when a student in erfurt killed sixteen people at his former high school , the german government has tightened its weapons law to align with the un firearms protocol .
the plan cleared its final legislative hurdle on friday , march 14 , when it was approved by the upper house of parliament . germany is imposing a ban on carrying realistic-looking imitation firearms in public , as police could mistake them for real weapons in a crisis situation .
the ban mainly applies to so-called softair guns , which function with pressurized gas and are often modeled on real-life counterparts . the head of the german police union -lrb- gdp -rrb- konrad freiberg criticized the law as insufficient .
it 's a scandal that the german government has excluded a nation-wide weapons registry from its reforms , he said . inherited guns must be disabled bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : realistic weapons are allowed at historical festivals under the law , people can still sell , purchase and possess replica firearms , but they must be transported in a closed container .
switchblades and knives with a blade longer than 12 centimeters -lrb- 4.7 inches -rrb- may also not be carried in public . violators face fines of up to 10,000 euros -lrb- $ 15,600 -rrb- .
exceptions , however , will be made for historical re-enactments . toy weapons that can not be mistaken for real guns are not affected by the law . furthermore , the new weapons law places restrictions on firearms inherited as of april 1 , 2008 .
if the heir can not prove a personal need for the weapon - for example , if he or she is a hunter or a member of a shooting club - it may only be kept if it 's been disabled . dw staff -lrb- kjb -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the ban mainly applies to so-called softair guns , which function with pressurized gas and are often modeled on real-life counterparts . the head of the german police union -lrb- gdp -rrb- konrad freiberg criticized the law as insufficient .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de culture -pipe- 14.03.2008 marx continues to influence 125 years after his death großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : many of karl marx 's theories on politics , society and economics still ring true today friday , march 14 , marks the 125th anniversary of the death of german philosopher and political economist karl marx .
marx is still regarded as hugely influential to the development of 20th century thought . both a scholar and a political activist , marx addressed a wide range of political as well as social issues , and is known for , among other things , his analysis of history .
the interpretations of his theories , particularly those on political economy , have in the course of history generated decades of debate , inspired revolutions and cast him as both devil and deity in political and academic circles . maligned by some , misunderstood by others and celebrated as one of the world 's great thinkers by many more , marx continues to be a divisive and much discussed individual .
while there has been a substantial revival of interest in his theories since the end of the cold war , mainly those which deal with the volatility and shape of capitalism , the question remains as to whether a man who died 125 years ago still has any relevance today . ian hunt , the director of the center for applied philosophy at the flinders university of southern australia , believes that marx and his insights into the capitalist system in particular still have a place in contemporary society . " marx 's thoughts on the exploitative nature of the relationship between capitalist employers and their employees ring true today , " he said .
" the proletariat , or those without property , continues to seek employment from those with property .
control over private investment continues to give the capitalist class decisive influence over government and sufficient control over the supply of labor to ensure that it is sold by employees on terms favorable to the increase of the wealth of employers . " hunt said he believes that marx 's theories on the exploitative nature of the capitalist employment relationship - which skews industrial development toward using up human and natural resources for short-term gain - apply today in the form of climate and energy issues and " the problem of the despotic form of the employer-employee relationship under capitalism . " marx foresaw impact of private dominance bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : marx wrote about the factors which influenced climate change " marx 's analysis of the foundations of a capitalist society raises questions of the justice of the distribution of wealth , and therefore also of income , in capitalist societies , which are even more acute in the modern world than in his own time , " hunt added .
" it also raises questions about the environmental consequences of private dominance of investment that are even more acute today than in the time marx wrote . " simon tormey , the co-director of the center for the study of social and global justice -lrb- cssgj -rrb- at nottingham university , also believes marx was ahead of his time . " the world is pretty much how marx described it 150 years ago , which is quite impressive in itself , " tormey said .

marx is still regarded as hugely influential to the development of 20th century thought . both a scholar and a political activist , marx addressed a wide range of political as well as social issues , and is known for , among other things , his analysis of history .
the interpretations of his theories , particularly those on political economy , have in the course of history generated decades of debate , inspired revolutions and cast him as both devil and deity in political and academic circles . maligned by some , misunderstood by others and celebrated as one of the world 's great thinkers by many more , marx continues to be a divisive and much discussed individual .
while there has been a substantial revival of interest in his theories since the end of the cold war , mainly those which deal with the volatility and shape of capitalism , the question remains as to whether a man who died 125 years ago still has any relevance today . ian hunt , the director of the center for applied philosophy at the flinders university of southern australia , believes that marx and his insights into the capitalist system in particular still have a place in contemporary society . " marx 's thoughts on the exploitative nature of the relationship between capitalist employers and their employees ring true today , " he said .
" the proletariat , or those without property , continues to seek employment from those with property .
control over private investment continues to give the capitalist class decisive influence over government and sufficient control over the supply of labor to ensure that it is sold by employees on terms favorable to the increase of the wealth of employers . " hunt said he believes that marx 's theories on the exploitative nature of the capitalist employment relationship - which skews industrial development toward using up human and natural resources for short-term gain - apply today in the form of climate and energy issues and " the problem of the despotic form of the employer-employee relationship under capitalism . " marx foresaw impact of private dominance bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : marx wrote about the factors which influenced climate change " marx 's analysis of the foundations of a capitalist society raises questions of the justice of the distribution of wealth , and therefore also of income , in capitalist societies , which are even more acute in the modern world than in his own time , " hunt added .
" it also raises questions about the environmental consequences of private dominance of investment that are even more acute today than in the time marx wrote . " simon tormey , the co-director of the center for the study of social and global justice -lrb- cssgj -rrb- at nottingham university , also believes marx was ahead of his time . " the world is pretty much how marx described it 150 years ago , which is quite impressive in itself , " tormey said . " this is to say that we now have a more or less integrated world capitalist system , with a global rich and global poor - as marx predicted .
there is huge exploitation across all societies - the proliferation of sweatshops and export processing zones are all very much in keeping with marx ’ s account .

marx is still regarded as hugely influential to the development of 20th century thought . both a scholar and a political activist , marx addressed a wide range of political as well as social issues , and is known for , among other things , his analysis of history .
the interpretations of his theories , particularly those on political economy , have in the course of history generated decades of debate , inspired revolutions and cast him as both devil and deity in political and academic circles . maligned by some , misunderstood by others and celebrated as one of the world 's great thinkers by many more , marx continues to be a divisive and much discussed individual .
while there has been a substantial revival of interest in his theories since the end of the cold war , mainly those which deal with the volatility and shape of capitalism , the question remains as to whether a man who died 125 years ago still has any relevance today . ian hunt , the director of the center for applied philosophy at the flinders university of southern australia , believes that marx and his insights into the capitalist system in particular still have a place in contemporary society . " marx 's thoughts on the exploitative nature of the relationship between capitalist employers and their employees ring true today , " he said .
" the proletariat , or those without property , continues to seek employment from those with property .
control over private investment continues to give the capitalist class decisive influence over government and sufficient control over the supply of labor to ensure that it is sold by employees on terms favorable to the increase of the wealth of employers . " hunt said he believes that marx 's theories on the exploitative nature of the capitalist employment relationship - which skews industrial development toward using up human and natural resources for short-term gain - apply today in the form of climate and energy issues and " the problem of the despotic form of the employer-employee relationship under capitalism . " marx foresaw impact of private dominance bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : marx wrote about the factors which influenced climate change " marx 's analysis of the foundations of a capitalist society raises questions of the justice of the distribution of wealth , and therefore also of income , in capitalist societies , which are even more acute in the modern world than in his own time , " hunt added .
" it also raises questions about the environmental consequences of private dominance of investment that are even more acute today than in the time marx wrote . " simon tormey , the co-director of the center for the study of social and global justice -lrb- cssgj -rrb- at nottingham university , also believes marx was ahead of his time . " the world is pretty much how marx described it 150 years ago , which is quite impressive in itself , " tormey said . " this is to say that we now have a more or less integrated world capitalist system , with a global rich and global poor - as marx predicted .
there is huge exploitation across all societies - the proliferation of sweatshops and export processing zones are all very much in keeping with marx ’ s account . " the peasantry is being systematically wiped out in a global process of dispossession , and of course social democracy , which started as a form of ultra moderate ' marxism , ' marxism-lite if you like , is in retreat in all areas where it once enjoyed hegemony , ” he added . tormey also explained that marx 's theory of class struggle is hugely prevalent in today 's current economic atmosphere . violent class struggle continues off media radar bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : class struggle is evident in often violent industrial action " there are workers there who have been denied trade union representation , who have been denied holiday pay , health care , and other benefits , " he said . " go into any business and you will see owners and workers - the owners can not do without the workers and they want to pay them as little as they can for the most amount of product / output ; the workers want the most they can get . this is class struggle . " the bosses have the laws on their side , the politicians , the state , and the media , " he added . " they are able to contain struggle so that it does n't disrupt society - for the most part . however , beyond the wealthy countries , the picture is very different .
open and violent struggles are commonplace in much of the world ; strikes , lockouts , and beatings of workers in places like china , indonesia , mexico , south africa , and violent peasant conflicts in places like nandigram , india .
look around : class struggle is everywhere and infects almost every human relation . " as well as economics and politics , marx had a great influence on the way people thought about culture .
while not considered to be a pure cultural theorist , marx 's writings on issues such as aesthetics , communication and interpretation contributed in part to a growing cultural studies movement . modern cultural theorists following marx 's ideas " marx 's influence on today 's cultural theorizing derives more from his social theory , which forms a useful context to theorizing culture , and his philosophical ideas in general , including his method of investigation and reasoning , " said johan fornas , director of the advanced cultural studies institute of sweden -lrb- acsis -rrb- .
" he developed some german and hegelian ideas in an exciting and inspiring direction that are still highly relevant for those of us who are engaged in developing cultural theory . " marx has inspired lots of recent thinkers to never cut theoretical concepts loose from experiences of everyday life and instead to understand the importance of situating knowledge in concrete material , embodied and socially organized practices , always interacting with institutionalized networks of power , " he added . despite the continued relevance of a number of marx 's theories , experts are quick to point out that some have little significance in today 's environment while others have been shown to be way off the mark in some cases . prediction of communist world proved wrong bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : even china has diluted its communism in recent times " marx was convinced that communism would replace capitalism but we don ’ t really see much of a communist movement emerging anywhere today , " tormey said . " so the irony might be that at the moment when marx 's ideas are even more relevant , so the attractiveness of marxism -lrb- or more accurately communism -rrb- as a mobilizing ideology seems in decline .
but this of course can change . " marx 's faith in the generation of informed political opposition from worsening material conditions failed to be realized , but that has not made his work irrelevant , hunt said . " his primary work , ' das kapital , ' still stands out as a wonderfully structured and thought through piece of analysis , drawing on the philosophical and economic thought of his time , " he said .
" its condemnation of the specific injustice of the capitalist system has few peers .
so , as long as there are capitalists , marx will remain relevant . " nick amies send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" it would have been unthinkable for the summit would have remained silent on this , " sarkozy concluded . global financial markets have been gripped with extreme volatility amid concerns that tight credit conditions are threatening some finance houses and record-breaking runs for the euro , oil and gold . commission chief vows ecb will take action bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : barroso attempted to quell fears over financial instability as fears grew of a recession in the us economy and the knock-on effects on the world 's nerve-wracked financial markets , european commission chief jose manuel barroso tried to instill calm by telling the summit that the european central bank -lrb- ecb -rrb- would take control of the situation should it be required to . " the ecb will do what is necessary to secure financial stability , " barroso said . the eu leaders also broached the subject of action in the fight against climate change during the two-day summit and at the end agreed to wrap up negotiations on ambitious targets to cut energy use and fight global warming by the end of the year . " we committed ourselves to finishing negotiating on this package by the end of this year and by doing this we made a huge step forward , " said slovenian prime minister janez jansa , whose country holds the european union 's rotating presidency .
" we are convinced that the costs of these measures will be much lower than if we do n't act . " eu targets year-end for climate package agreement bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the eu is under pressure to deliver on its climate promises the current plan aims to meet the european union 's over-arching goal to reduce emissions of carbon dioxide - the main gas responsible for global warming - by 20 percent by 2020 , compared to 1990 levels .
eu member states have committed to go to 30 percent if other countries match them . in the upcoming negotiations on the details of meeting those goals , jansa said : " we need to take into account the different positions of the member states and their needs for economic growth . " in another green move , the eu leaders agreed to support the development of environmentally-friendly products by reducing the level of vat on them . the proposal , first made by british prime minister gordon brown , " will start the debate in many member states about how and whether household goods ... can incentivize consumer behavior towards buying energy-efficient and environmentally friendly goods and services , " brown said . environmental vat on eu agenda bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : brown 's " green tax " idea made a cautious appearance under the decision , the eu 's executive body , the european commission , is tasked with " reflecting " on " the best way to support the development of clean products by evoking the question of environmental vat , " sarkozy said . but the proposal is unlikely to lead to concrete measures soon .
vat is a sensitive issue , since much of the eu 's common budget comes from the vat which consumers pay in each member state , and any decisions on changing rates have to be approved unanimously . " people are being persuaded by the argument that we should look at this very carefully , " brown said .
" vat is a uniquely european tax . ...
we made substantial progress in only two days and i believe that over the next few months other countries will join the debate . " despite the support of britain and france - two of the eu 's three largest states - some member states oppose the proposal and could well block it . eu backs club med plan under new name bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : sarkozy 's club med plan will go to a summit in paris the eu also formally backed ambitious french plans for a union for the mediterranean , but watered it down to such an extent that it had to be given a new name . according to a last-minute addition to the draft conclusions of their regular spring council in brussels , the new organization is to be called " barcelona process : union for the mediterranean . " the barcelona process is the name of the eu 's 13-year-old policy which deals with the bloc 's southern neighbors and which many critics say has so far failed to deliver . the original " club med , " as first conceived a year ago by french president nicolas sarkozy , envisaged uniting israelis and syrians , turks and spaniards , italians and libyans , and making them work together on such diverse issues as migration , the environment or the fight against terrorism . but the latest draft of the proposal , brokered by germany earlier this week and submitted to leaders over dinner on thursday , includes all of the eu 's member states and vaguely talks about " projects with an accent on regional cooperation . " concerns over eu funds the downsizing came after eu countries with no borders on the mediterranean expressed skepticism at the proposal , with member states from eastern europe particularly concerned that it would divert precious eu funds away from their region . in friday 's draft conclusions , the european commission , " is invited to present to the council of eu leaders the necessary proposals for defining the modalities of what will be called ' barcelona process : union for the mediterranean " ' in view of a special summit to be convened in paris on july 13 . sarkozy nevertheless welcomed the compromise , pointing out that the new organization will for the first time give a strong voice to middle eastern and north african leaders in the way money in the region is spent . he noted that the new political structure will be co-chaired by an eu member and a non-eu member .
" europe will not turn its back on the mediterranean any more , " sarkozy said late thursday . chinese clampdown on tibet causes eu concern bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : reports suggest a chinese crackdown in lhasa , tibet the eu also took the opportunity provided by the summit to express concern about the violent protests taking place in tibet , with germany and britain among those calling for dialogue and restraint . german foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier called for an end to the conflict by peaceful means while his british counterpart david miliband said european governments would be seeking " clarification about what is actually happening on the ground , " adding that " restraint " and " substantive dialogue " were the only way forward . reports coming out of lhasa , the capital of china 's tibet autonomous region , suggest paramilitary riot police intervened to control protests initiated by buddhist monks on the 49th anniversary of a tibetan uprising against chinese rule that was crushed by troops . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" it would have been unthinkable for the summit would have remained silent on this , " sarkozy concluded . global financial markets have been gripped with extreme volatility amid concerns that tight credit conditions are threatening some finance houses and record-breaking runs for the euro , oil and gold . commission chief vows ecb will take action bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : barroso attempted to quell fears over financial instability as fears grew of a recession in the us economy and the knock-on effects on the world 's nerve-wracked financial markets , european commission chief jose manuel barroso tried to instill calm by telling the summit that the european central bank -lrb- ecb -rrb- would take control of the situation should it be required to . " the ecb will do what is necessary to secure financial stability , " barroso said . the eu leaders also broached the subject of action in the fight against climate change during the two-day summit and at the end agreed to wrap up negotiations on ambitious targets to cut energy use and fight global warming by the end of the year . " we committed ourselves to finishing negotiating on this package by the end of this year and by doing this we made a huge step forward , " said slovenian prime minister janez jansa , whose country holds the european union 's rotating presidency .
" we are convinced that the costs of these measures will be much lower than if we do n't act .

eu member states have committed to go to 30 percent if other countries match them . in the upcoming negotiations on the details of meeting those goals , jansa said : " we need to take into account the different positions of the member states and their needs for economic growth . " in another green move , the eu leaders agreed to support the development of environmentally-friendly products by reducing the level of vat on them . the proposal , first made by british prime minister gordon brown , " will start the debate in many member states about how and whether household goods ... can incentivize consumer behavior towards buying energy-efficient and environmentally friendly goods and services , " brown said . environmental vat on eu agenda bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : brown 's " green tax " idea made a cautious appearance under the decision , the eu 's executive body , the european commission , is tasked with " reflecting " on " the best way to support the development of clean products by evoking the question of environmental vat , " sarkozy said . but the proposal is unlikely to lead to concrete measures soon .
vat is a sensitive issue , since much of the eu 's common budget comes from the vat which consumers pay in each member state , and any decisions on changing rates have to be approved unanimously . " people are being persuaded by the argument that we should look at this very carefully , " brown said .
" vat is a uniquely european tax . ...

" the barcelona process is the name of the eu 's 13-year-old policy which deals with the bloc 's southern neighbors and which many critics say has so far failed to deliver . the original " club med , " as first conceived a year ago by french president nicolas sarkozy , envisaged uniting israelis and syrians , turks and spaniards , italians and libyans , and making them work together on such diverse issues as migration , the environment or the fight against terrorism . but the latest draft of the proposal , brokered by germany earlier this week and submitted to leaders over dinner on thursday , includes all of the eu 's member states and vaguely talks about " projects with an accent on regional cooperation .

but bulgarians are n't interested in hearing about their politicians ' pasts . the head of the government , four vice-premiers and 25 democratically elected ministers are among those with a connection to the secret service .
current president georgi parvanov worked under the code name gotse ; his predecessor jean videnov was also a special agent . former spies are especially prevalent in the foreign ministry and in diplomatic service .
three former ministers , 13 deputies and even bulgaria 's current nato ambassador were all part of the communist intelligence cadre . an investigative committee commissioned by parliament examined 673 government officials who had served since the fall of the iron curtain in 1990 and found that 108 were linked to communist intelligence . " informal networks that were linked to the repressive communist apparatus … continue to lead to corruption , " sonja schueler from the southeast europe association told deutsche welle .
" personal loyalties determine the decisions that are made and the socio-economic development of the country .

the 36 teams of germany 's top two divisions , boosted by revenue from the sixth successive season of increased crowd figures , also managed to reduce their liabilities by more than 10 percent from 662.5 to under 600 million euros .
all 18 bundesliga clubs recorded profits after tax as did 12 second division clubs , according to figures released by the german soccer league -lrb- dfl -rrb- on thursday .

the dfl praised the economic direction that german clubs were taking .
" it was an exceptional year .
as a market and as organization , we are in better shape than ever before , " dfl business manager christian seifert told reporters .
" our place among europe 's top leagues is secure for the midterm . "
debt-ridden euro rivals hold advantage on the field one problem faced by the league , according to the dfl , was a competitive disadvantage on the field .
many rival european clubs , awash in debt , spent far more of their budget on players .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : huge crowds boosted profits for the top two leagues the gap could best be highlighted by the number of german clubs left in the quarter-finals of the champions league - just one , schalke 04 who face barcelona in the next round - compared to four from the english premier league .
werder bremen 's exit from the uefa cup on thursday night left just bayern munich and bayer leverkusen to fly the flag in the last eight .
the dfl report also showed that nearly 35,000 people are now employed in professional soccer in germany , 700 more than a year ago .
it also showed that of the record 16.3 million spectators who attended games in the 2006/2007 season , the proportion of female fans increased from 21 to 23 percent . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the temple on the periphery of the sacsayhuaman fortress includes 11 rooms thought to have held mummies and idols .
the discovery at the famous spot overlooking the incan capital of cuzco includes ancient roadway and irrigation systems , said the team of experts .
researchers are still waiting for carbon dating tests to verify the age of the ruins .
the find was made in the archeologically rich region of southern peru that includes the famed machu picchu ruins .
sequence made of stones and adobe , the temple is said to measure 2,700 sq ft -lrb- 250 sq m -rrb- and includes an area in the shape of a chacana , an incan religious symbol .
" it 's from both the inca and pre-inca cultures , it has a sequence , " washington camacho , director of the sacsayhuaman archaeological park , told ap news agency .
" the incas entered and changed the form of the temple , as it initially had a more rustic architecture . "
the inca empire flourished along the western edge of south america during the 1400s , prior to the arrival of the spanish in the next century .
the archaeologists believe the apparent irrigation system they have found was built by the ayarmaca , who occupied the region between 900 to 1200 .
researchers said they had been lucky to find the temple , as part of it was destroyed nearly a century ago by dynamite blasts at a nearby rock quarry .
the team 's excavations began last summer and are expected to continue for another five years .

the temple on the periphery of the sacsayhuaman fortress includes 11 rooms thought to have held mummies and idols .
the discovery at the famous spot overlooking the incan capital of cuzco includes ancient roadway and irrigation systems , said the team of experts .
researchers are still waiting for carbon dating tests to verify the age of the ruins .
the find was made in the archeologically rich region of southern peru that includes the famed machu picchu ruins .

" the incas entered and changed the form of the temple , as it initially had a more rustic architecture . "
the inca empire flourished along the western edge of south america during the 1400s , prior to the arrival of the spanish in the next century .
the archaeologists believe the apparent irrigation system they have found was built by the ayarmaca , who occupied the region between 900 to 1200 .
researchers said they had been lucky to find the temple , as part of it was destroyed nearly a century ago by dynamite blasts at a nearby rock quarry .

sir ronald waterhouse said it was a " remarkable " decision by the welsh assembly government .
helen mary jones , chair of the assembly children 's committee , said the most vulnerable young were being let down .
but children 's minister jane hutt insisted services provided by local authorities can be just as independent .
campaigners have argued for more than a decade that local authorities should not be responsible for investigating complaints by children in their care .
that view was also backed by the first children 's commissioner for wales peter clarke , and an assembly committee . "
i simply do n't know why they have done this and i find it remarkable " sir ronald waterhouse plaid am ms jones said she was " profoundly disappointed " by the move .
" of course it 's not me and the committee that they 're letting down , it is the most vulnerable children in this country .
they deserve better , " she said .
the assembly government has set up an independent advisory board as well what is being called a " national advocacy and advice service " .
however , while the advocacy service promises to be a national single point of contact for children and young people in wales , it will also be referring cases to local counselling services .
in a statement , ms hutt said : " it is not clear how a service that was funded directly by the assembly government would intrinsically be any more independent than one commissioned locally . "
' red herring ' but setting out his objection to the decision , former high court judge sir ronald claimed that under local counselling and advocacy services , a child " would not have confidence that what he or she says to the advocate is going to be treated in confidence " .
backing a centrally-funded all-wales service , he told bbc wales ' dragon 's eye : " i simply do n't know why they have done this and i find it remarkable that there is no explanation as to why they have rejected the proposal . "
the charity voices from care was also critical of the decision .
" the advocacy board put forward by -lsb- the -rsb- welsh assembly government is a red herring and falls way short of being an independent body , as it will continue to allow local authorities to fund the people who are meant to speak out against them , " said chief executive deborah jones .
" only a truly independent and centrally funded advocacy unit with its own commissioning powers will provide the safeguards that could help prevent future exploitation as evidenced in the north wales child abuse inquiry . "

the assembly government has set up an independent advisory board as well what is being called a " national advocacy and advice service " .
however , while the advocacy service promises to be a national single point of contact for children and young people in wales , it will also be referring cases to local counselling services .

the belle toute lighthouse , on cliffs at beachy head , has been sold for an undisclosed amount .
it was put on the market for £ 850,000 by its previous owners in 2007 .
belle toute lighthouse preservation trust , which had wanted to turn it into a bed and breakfast , said it was " greatly disappointed " .
spokesman rob wassell , from redhill in surrey , said the trust would be wound up but its website would be kept updated as an information resource .
he added : " this is a great disappointment as we had invested so much time and effort in trying to make this dream a reality . "
belle toute , which was a working lighthouse until 1902 , was moved more than 17m -lrb- 50ft -rrb- inland in 1999 because coastal erosion threatened to send it crashing to the foot of the cliff .
in september , eastbourne borough council granted planning permission for the 175-year-old grade ii-listed building to be used as a b & b. the preservation trust , which made the application , had hoped to open it to the public and hold events for the local community .

in the last year there were almost 1,800 false alarm calls to the fire service from birmingham alone , a new report has shown .
the fire service said most of the hoax calls in the city came from areas such as ladywood , hodge hill and sparkbrook .
every time a crew is sent out , it costs an average in £ 2,000 in staff time and equipment , the fire authority said .
officials said false calls ranged from people saying there was a fire across the road to detailed information , for example , that a mother and baby were trapped in a house .
they added that it was not always obvious it was a prank call and they had to assume every 999 call was a fire .
a fire authority spokesperson said that as well as cash , false calls were risking resources being diverted from genuine emergencies .

" the show is called i 'd do anything , it 's hosted by me , and we 're looking for a brilliant nancy .
" laugh it out .
get used to it .
we 're bored of the jokes already . "
after solving a problem like maria and fitting lee mead with a technicolor dreamcoat , the saturday night show is looking for four actors to star in lionel bart 's classic musical oliver !
viewers will get to choose the actress who plays bawdy but lovable nancy , while the panel of judges - chaired by andrew lloyd webber - will pick three boys to share the title role of oliver twist .
" the big battle is about who is going to steal the show , " admits norton , who adds : " my money is on the olivers .
" when they walk on , all across the country thousands of ovaries will be popping .
" people who thought they 'd given up on having kids will say : ' shall we try again ?
we might have one of them ! " '
' raw talent ' more than 10,000 people auditioned for this year 's show - the highest number yet .
according to producers , more than ever before were paid-up members of acting union equity , prompting some criticism that amateur performers were at a disadvantage .
but elaine bedell , who commissioned i 'd do anything for the bbc , does n't think there is a problem .
" even if you have an equity card , it does n't mean you get to see andrew lloyd webber for an audition , " she says .
" and in the end , if the public decide the ' professional ' beats the ' non-professional ' , that 's their choice . "
norton adds that this year 's show is likely to favour " raw talent " , as the character of nancy is supposed to be a diamond in the rough . "
this is the show that turned andrew lloyd webber into a member of westlife " graham norton played by shani wallis in the 1968 film , east end girl nancy acts as a surrogate mother to oliver and the other pick-pocketing street urchins .
she gets some of the musical 's biggest and most memorable numbers , including as long as he needs me and it 's a fine life .
lord lloyd-webber has said he wants to find a singer with a sultry , soulful voice - " an even younger amy winehouse " - for the role .
" you want someone with a bit of life experience , " laughs norton , " but i do n't think he actually wants amy winehouse to show up .
" i hope she does n't get confused .
suddenly she 's wandering across the studio with a box of kfc ! "
a sir , a lord and a dame in addition to returning judges lord lloyd-webber , denise van outen and john barrowman , this year 's series will feature theatre impresario sir cameron mackintosh and comedian barry humphries - better known as dame edna everage .
while his presence may seem odd at first , humphries took part in the original 1960 stage production of oliver ! creating the role of undertaker mr sowerberry , and later playing criminal mastermind fagin at the london palladium .
sir cameron , who owns the rights to oliver ! , was approached after lord lloyd-webber suggested it as the subject of the show - other candidates included the wizard of oz and my fair lady .
bedell says the millionaire producer has been " completely seduced by the whole television process " , even though he was initially reluctant to take an on-screen role .
" i think he 's sorry about that , frankly , " quips norton .
" he 's been all over it like a rash .
i would n't be surprised to seem him in the studio in a sleeping bag ! "
the first episode of i 'd do anything on saturday showcases the best and worst auditions .
but , in reality , the final 12 contestants were chosen at " nancy school " earlier this week .
" even i was in tears , " says norton , who notes a distinct lack of back-stabbing behind the scenes .
but that could all change when the when the elimination rounds begin in two weeks .
norton says he was initially worried that the female competitors would be less weepy than last year 's histrionic any dream will do contenders - but his fears proved to be unfounded .
" last year it was boy snot , this year it 's mascara , " he chuckles .
" i 'm covered in it by the end of the show . "
i 'd do anything starts on bbc one on saturday 15 march .

" the show is called i 'd do anything , it 's hosted by me , and we 're looking for a brilliant nancy .
" laugh it out .
get used to it .
we 're bored of the jokes already . "
after solving a problem like maria and fitting lee mead with a technicolor dreamcoat , the saturday night show is looking for four actors to star in lionel bart 's classic musical oliver !
the successful olivers will rotate in the lead role viewers will get to choose the actress who plays bawdy but lovable nancy , while the panel of judges - chaired by andrew lloyd webber - will pick three boys to share the title role of oliver twist .
" the big battle is about who is going to steal the show , " admits norton , who adds : " my money is on the olivers .
" when they walk on , all across the country thousands of ovaries will be popping .
" people who thought they 'd given up on having kids will say : ' shall we try again ?
we might have one of them ! " '
' raw talent ' more than 10,000 people auditioned for this year 's show - the highest number yet .
norton says the show is a " celebration of excellence " according to producers , more than ever before were paid-up members of acting union equity , prompting some criticism that amateur performers were at a disadvantage .
but elaine bedell , who commissioned i 'd do anything for the bbc , does n't think there is a problem .
" even if you have an equity card , it does n't mean you get to see andrew lloyd webber for an audition , " she says .
" and in the end , if the public decide the ' professional ' beats the ' non-professional ' , that 's their choice . "
norton adds that this year 's show is likely to favour " raw talent " , as the character of nancy is supposed to be a diamond in the rough .
this is the show that turned andrew lloyd webber into a member of westlife graham norton played by shani wallis in the 1968 film , east end girl nancy acts as a surrogate mother to oliver and the other pick-pocketing street urchins .
she gets some of the musical 's biggest and most memorable numbers , including as long as he needs me and it 's a fine life .
lord lloyd-webber has said he wants to find a singer with a sultry , soulful voice - " an even younger amy winehouse " - for the role .
" you want someone with a bit of life experience , " laughs norton , " but i do n't think he actually wants amy winehouse to show up .
" i hope she does n't get confused .
suddenly she 's wandering across the studio with a box of kfc ! "
a sir , a lord and a dame in addition to returning judges lord lloyd-webber , denise van outen and john barrowman , this year 's series will feature theatre impresario sir cameron mackintosh and comedian barry humphries - better known as dame edna everage .
while his presence may seem odd at first , humphries took part in the original 1960 stage production of oliver ! creating the role of undertaker mr sowerberry , and later playing criminal mastermind fagin at the london palladium .
sir cameron , who owns the rights to oliver ! , was approached after lord lloyd-webber suggested it as the subject of the show - other candidates included the wizard of oz and my fair lady .
bedell says the millionaire producer has been " completely seduced by the whole television process " , even though he was initially reluctant to take an on-screen role .
" i think he 's sorry about that , frankly , " quips norton .
the competition for a place in the live show was fierce " he 's been all over it like a rash .
i would n't be surprised to seem him in the studio in a sleeping bag ! "
the first episode of i 'd do anything on saturday showcases the best and worst auditions .
but , in reality , the final 12 contestants were chosen at " nancy school " earlier this week .
" even i was in tears , " says norton , who notes a distinct lack of back-stabbing behind the scenes .
but that could all change when the when the elimination rounds begin in two weeks .
norton says he was initially worried that the female competitors would be less weepy than last year 's histrionic any dream will do contenders - but his fears proved to be unfounded .
" last year it was boy snot , this year it 's mascara , " he chuckles .
" i 'm covered in it by the end of the show . "
i 'd do anything starts on bbc one on saturday 15 march .

" the show is called i 'd do anything , it 's hosted by me , and we 're looking for a brilliant nancy .
" laugh it out .
get used to it .
we 're bored of the jokes already . "
after solving a problem like maria and fitting lee mead with a technicolor dreamcoat , the saturday night show is looking for four actors to star in lionel bart 's classic musical oliver !
the successful olivers will rotate in the lead role viewers will get to choose the actress who plays bawdy but lovable nancy , while the panel of judges - chaired by andrew lloyd webber - will pick three boys to share the title role of oliver twist .
" the big battle is about who is going to steal the show , " admits norton , who adds : " my money is on the olivers .
" when they walk on , all across the country thousands of ovaries will be popping .
" people who thought they 'd given up on having kids will say : ' shall we try again ?
we might have one of them ! " '
' raw talent ' more than 10,000 people auditioned for this year 's show - the highest number yet .
norton says the show is a " celebration of excellence " according to producers , more than ever before were paid-up members of acting union equity , prompting some criticism that amateur performers were at a disadvantage .
but elaine bedell , who commissioned i 'd do anything for the bbc , does n't think there is a problem .
" even if you have an equity card , it does n't mean you get to see andrew lloyd webber for an audition , " she says .
" and in the end , if the public decide the ' professional ' beats the ' non-professional ' , that 's their choice . "
norton adds that this year 's show is likely to favour " raw talent " , as the character of nancy is supposed to be a diamond in the rough .
this is the show that turned andrew lloyd webber into a member of westlife graham norton played by shani wallis in the 1968 film , east end girl nancy acts as a surrogate mother to oliver and the other pick-pocketing street urchins .
she gets some of the musical 's biggest and most memorable numbers , including as long as he needs me and it 's a fine life .
lord lloyd-webber has said he wants to find a singer with a sultry , soulful voice - " an even younger amy winehouse " - for the role .
" you want someone with a bit of life experience , " laughs norton , " but i do n't think he actually wants amy winehouse to show up .
