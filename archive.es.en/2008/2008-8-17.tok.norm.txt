as german chancellor angela merkel heads to georgia on sunday , aug .
17 , to continue mediating in the ongoing conflict with russia , western experts mull the chances of escalations elsewhere in the former soviet sphere . when western powers in february gave their blessing to the independence of the serbian province of kosovo , opponents warned it would trigger separatist violence across europe .
now , with the fires of secessionist war still smoking in georgia and its breakaway provinces of abkhazia and south ossetia , the west is wondering nervously whether other conflicts might be about to break out elsewhere in the former ussr .
independence for the georgian provinces " would undoubtedly give impetus to independence ambitions " in the breakaway moldovan region of transnistria , said colonel christopher langton , security analyst at the institute for international strategic studies in london .
debate still rages as to the exact role played by russia in the georgian war , with tbilisi accusing moscow of aggression and moscow insisting that it only intervened to protect civilian lives .
but western analysts agree that before the conflict , russia was the breakaway regions ' main supporter - especially once georgia began to aim for nato membership following its 2003 " rose revolution . "
and they say that russia 's intervention is a warning for ukraine and moldova - two former-soviet states who are also edging towards the west , but who have russian military forces on their territory .
the conflict is " a stern warning to ukraine that what can happen if it tries to move closer to nato is the division of the country , " said security expert dusan reljic of the swp institute for international and security affairs in berlin .
it is also " the acceleration of russia 's ongoing effort to increase its influence " around its borders , langton said .
moscow has both a strong military presence and broad-based popular support in transnistria and ukraine 's crimean peninsula , which russia ceded to its " socialist brother " in 1954 .
ukraine monitoring its own separatist province bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bush and nato have plans for yushchenko 's ukraine and analysts now say that , given nato 's refusal to rule out further eastern expansions , moscow might feel that the best way to stall that process would be to promote secession in the two areas .
" when there are russian populations linked to russia , then those territories could break away ...
so if ukraine insists on joining nato , part of its territory could split away , " reljic said .
but is it really likely that russia would call for full independence for the crimea or transnistria , given the international storm which its actions in georgia have already provoked ? observers say that the option can not be ruled out in the long term , given that one of russia 's prime foreign-policy goals is to rebuild its own influence in europe at nato 's expense .
russian leaders have already said that they see nato 's offer of eventual membership for georgia and ukraine as a direct threat .
and that gives the crimea and transnistria immense strategic significance as two russian-dominated areas on ukraine 's fringe .
ukraine 's desire for nato membership " makes transnistria strategically important for russia , " while any increase in tension between moscow and kiev will " resonate in the crimea , " langton said .
in the short term , such fears are unlikely to materialize .
russia could assert power to scupper nato plans bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : georgia 's pounding puts its nato hopes in jeopardy russia 's hands are full dealing with the aftermath of the georgian war , and some nato members say the conflict proves that georgia is in any case not ready for membership .
but with key nato members , especially the us , pressing for ukraine and georgia to join , there is a danger that russia may end up feeling it has no choice but to weaken its neighbors before it is too late .
" in the past , the answer would have been no , this is not a proxy conflict between great powers .
but increasingly the answer is becoming yes , " langton said . dpa news agency -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de in focus : dossier : getting the hang of the eu despite expansion , europe still ca n't define " european " european union makes a meal of regional treats could mutual ridicule be a sign of successful eu integration ?
will the real heart of europe please stand up ? european union -pipe- 17.08.2008 the hitch-hiker 's guide to understanding eu jargon großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the irish had nothing against the city but were vehemently against the treaty the problem with eu jargon is that you need both a political dictionary and a map to understand it .
here is a brief list of the eu 's more obscure place-names and a explanation of the processes they refer to . it sometimes seems that half of the eu 's main policies were named after the cities in which they were created .
the problem is that the nicknames almost never come with footnotes , leaving the unsuspecting visitor drowning in a sea of place-names .
barcelona is best known in the eu as the place where european , north african and middle eastern leaders met in november 1995 to try and improve their often-strained relationship .
the result was the " barcelona process , " by which the eu tried to boost trade and political ties with its mediterranean neighbors while urging them to do more for human rights and regional peace .
the process seldom made headlines until early 2007 , when french president nicolas sarkozy proposed scrapping it and creating a much more sweeping " mediterranean union " modeled on the eu .
eu members without a mediterranean coastline blocked the idea , but allowed sarkozy to launch on july 13 a watered-down version catchily titled the " barcelona process : union for the mediterranean . "
copenhagen : denmark 's capital has become eu code for the set of standards which countries have to meet if they want to join the bloc .
the " copenhagen criteria , " adopted in june 1993 , say that a state should be able to preserve democracy and human rights , have a market economy and accept the eu 's " obligations and intent , " such as peace .
over the last year , the criteria have most often been mentioned in the context of eu hopefuls macedonia , serbia and turkey , all of whom have been accused by critics of falling short in key areas .
dublin : famous for its literary giants , its dark beer and its distressing tendency to reject eu treaties , " dublin , " in eu circles , is a term used when talking about refugees .
the " dublin convention , " which came into force in 1997 , is aimed at streamlining the way eu member states deal with refugees and , in particular , deciding where each applicant should be dealt with .
with the current french presidency of the bloc pushing for an eu " pact " on migration , dublin is usually referred to when member states want to accuse one another of not doing enough for refugees .
the hague is famous as the home of various international courts , all of which tend to be nicknamed " the hague tribunal . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the hague hosts the international criminal court the one the eu refers to most often at present is the international criminal tribunal for the former yugoslavia -lrb- icty -rrb- , set up by the un in 1993 to deal with the atrocities committed in the separatist balkan wars of the 1990s .
while not an eu body , icty regularly features in eu meetings because the dutch government has vetoed any kind of eu rapprochement with serbia until icty 's chief prosecutor rules that the belgrade government is cooperating fully with his organization .
cities lend their name to treaties when european union leaders refer to the " lisbon agenda " or the " manchester declaration , " this is what they mean : lisbon : the lisbon agenda , agreed in march 2000 , is a plan aimed at making the eu the world 's most competitive economy by 2010 .
the lisbon treaty , signed in december 2007 , is an agreement between the bloc 's 27 member states aimed at making it easier to take eu-wide decisions and giving the union a higher profile abroad .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the treaty has put lisbon on the eu map with the eu lagging behind key rivals such as the united states and japan in terms of innovation , the word " lisbon " has in the past usually been used to describe the gap between the eu 's targets and its results .
however , since irish voters rejected the lisbon treaty in a referendum on june 12 , current headlines referring to " lisbon " usually refer to the treaty .
maastricht : the maastricht treaty , signed in 1992 , created the eu out of its forerunner , the european economic community , and set up the legal process that created the euro .
maastricht criteria are the strict rules on inflation and government spending that countries have to meet in order to join the euro .
the criteria last made the headlines in july , when eu finance ministers invited slovakia to become the euro club 's 16th member .
manchester : britain 's soccer giant is known in the eu for the political call , made by finance ministers in september 2005 , not to respond to fuel-price rises by cutting taxes .
barely mentioned until the recent oil-price surge , the manchester declaration has now come back to haunt ministers , as they urge one another in increasingly nervous tones not to break ranks . nice : the nice treaty , signed by eu leaders in 2001 , updated the union 's internal workings so the bloc could absorb 12 new member states between 2004 and 2007 .
its main remit was to set the number of votes in eu councils each member state should have , from 29 in germany to three in malta .
when eu leaders were negotiating the lisbon treaty in 2007 , poland , which stood to lose some of its voting power under the new rules , demanded that the nice voting weights remain unchanged , going into negotiations with the slogan " nice or death ! "
schengen : the schengen convention , which came into force in 1995 , abolished border barriers between belgium , france , germany , greece , italy , luxembourg , the netherlands , portugal and spain .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : schengen has gained international fame through the eu the agreement created the schengen zone , which now includes all the eu 's current members except britain , ireland , bulgaria and romania .
non-eu members iceland and norway are also in the zone .
schengen most recently hit the headlines in late 2007 , when it expanded to take in nine countries which joined the eu in 2004 .
tampere : the finnish town of tampere is best known in eu circles for its links with international law-enforcement .
the tampere process , launched in 1999 , is the series of talks which eu member states are holding to discuss how they can improve cooperation on sensitive issues of justice and internal affairs .
the process was given a renewed impulse at a summit in the hague in 2004 - whereupon some officials renamed it the " hague process . "
however , some diplomats say that the process will receive a new impulse when sweden takes over the eu 's rotating presidency in the second half of 2009 .
they therefore call it the " stockholm process . " dpa news agency -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

will the real heart of europe please stand up ? european union -pipe- 17.08.2008 the hitch-hiker 's guide to understanding eu jargon großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the irish had nothing against the city but were vehemently against the treaty the problem with eu jargon is that you need both a political dictionary and a map to understand it .
here is a brief list of the eu 's more obscure place-names and a explanation of the processes they refer to . it sometimes seems that half of the eu 's main policies were named after the cities in which they were created .
the problem is that the nicknames almost never come with footnotes , leaving the unsuspecting visitor drowning in a sea of place-names .
barcelona is best known in the eu as the place where european , north african and middle eastern leaders met in november 1995 to try and improve their often-strained relationship .
the result was the " barcelona process , " by which the eu tried to boost trade and political ties with its mediterranean neighbors while urging them to do more for human rights and regional peace .
the process seldom made headlines until early 2007 , when french president nicolas sarkozy proposed scrapping it and creating a much more sweeping " mediterranean union " modeled on the eu .
eu members without a mediterranean coastline blocked the idea , but allowed sarkozy to launch on july 13 a watered-down version catchily titled the " barcelona process : union for the mediterranean . "
copenhagen : denmark 's capital has become eu code for the set of standards which countries have to meet if they want to join the bloc .
the " copenhagen criteria , " adopted in june 1993 , say that a state should be able to preserve democracy and human rights , have a market economy and accept the eu 's " obligations and intent , " such as peace .
over the last year , the criteria have most often been mentioned in the context of eu hopefuls macedonia , serbia and turkey , all of whom have been accused by critics of falling short in key areas .
dublin : famous for its literary giants , its dark beer and its distressing tendency to reject eu treaties , " dublin , " in eu circles , is a term used when talking about refugees .
the " dublin convention , " which came into force in 1997 , is aimed at streamlining the way eu member states deal with refugees and , in particular , deciding where each applicant should be dealt with .
with the current french presidency of the bloc pushing for an eu " pact " on migration , dublin is usually referred to when member states want to accuse one another of not doing enough for refugees .
the hague is famous as the home of various international courts , all of which tend to be nicknamed " the hague tribunal . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the hague hosts the international criminal court the one the eu refers to most often at present is the international criminal tribunal for the former yugoslavia -lrb- icty -rrb- , set up by the un in 1993 to deal with the atrocities committed in the separatist balkan wars of the 1990s .
while not an eu body , icty regularly features in eu meetings because the dutch government has vetoed any kind of eu rapprochement with serbia until icty 's chief prosecutor rules that the belgrade government is cooperating fully with his organization .
cities lend their name to treaties when european union leaders refer to the " lisbon agenda " or the " manchester declaration , " this is what they mean : lisbon : the lisbon agenda , agreed in march 2000 , is a plan aimed at making the eu the world 's most competitive economy by 2010 .
the lisbon treaty , signed in december 2007 , is an agreement between the bloc 's 27 member states aimed at making it easier to take eu-wide decisions and giving the union a higher profile abroad .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the treaty has put lisbon on the eu map with the eu lagging behind key rivals such as the united states and japan in terms of innovation , the word " lisbon " has in the past usually been used to describe the gap between the eu 's targets and its results .
however , since irish voters rejected the lisbon treaty in a referendum on june 12 , current headlines referring to " lisbon " usually refer to the treaty .
maastricht : the maastricht treaty , signed in 1992 , created the eu out of its forerunner , the european economic community , and set up the legal process that created the euro .
maastricht criteria are the strict rules on inflation and government spending that countries have to meet in order to join the euro .
the criteria last made the headlines in july , when eu finance ministers invited slovakia to become the euro club 's 16th member .
manchester : britain 's soccer giant is known in the eu for the political call , made by finance ministers in september 2005 , not to respond to fuel-price rises by cutting taxes .
barely mentioned until the recent oil-price surge , the manchester declaration has now come back to haunt ministers , as they urge one another in increasingly nervous tones not to break ranks . nice : the nice treaty , signed by eu leaders in 2001 , updated the union 's internal workings so the bloc could absorb 12 new member states between 2004 and 2007 .
its main remit was to set the number of votes in eu councils each member state should have , from 29 in germany to three in malta .
when eu leaders were negotiating the lisbon treaty in 2007 , poland , which stood to lose some of its voting power under the new rules , demanded that the nice voting weights remain unchanged , going into negotiations with the slogan " nice or death ! "
schengen : the schengen convention , which came into force in 1995 , abolished border barriers between belgium , france , germany , greece , italy , luxembourg , the netherlands , portugal and spain .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : schengen has gained international fame through the eu the agreement created the schengen zone , which now includes all the eu 's current members except britain , ireland , bulgaria and romania .
non-eu members iceland and norway are also in the zone .
schengen most recently hit the headlines in late 2007 , when it expanded to take in nine countries which joined the eu in 2004 .
tampere : the finnish town of tampere is best known in eu circles for its links with international law-enforcement .
the tampere process , launched in 1999 , is the series of talks which eu member states are holding to discuss how they can improve cooperation on sensitive issues of justice and internal affairs .
the process was given a renewed impulse at a summit in the hague in 2004 - whereupon some officials renamed it the " hague process . "
however , some diplomats say that the process will receive a new impulse when sweden takes over the eu 's rotating presidency in the second half of 2009 .
they therefore call it the " stockholm process . " dpa news agency -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

will the real heart of europe please stand up ? european union -pipe- 17.08.2008 the hitch-hiker 's guide to understanding eu jargon großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the irish had nothing against the city but were vehemently against the treaty the problem with eu jargon is that you need both a political dictionary and a map to understand it .
here is a brief list of the eu 's more obscure place-names and a explanation of the processes they refer to . it sometimes seems that half of the eu 's main policies were named after the cities in which they were created .
the problem is that the nicknames almost never come with footnotes , leaving the unsuspecting visitor drowning in a sea of place-names .
barcelona is best known in the eu as the place where european , north african and middle eastern leaders met in november 1995 to try and improve their often-strained relationship .
the result was the " barcelona process , " by which the eu tried to boost trade and political ties with its mediterranean neighbors while urging them to do more for human rights and regional peace .
the process seldom made headlines until early 2007 , when french president nicolas sarkozy proposed scrapping it and creating a much more sweeping " mediterranean union " modeled on the eu .
eu members without a mediterranean coastline blocked the idea , but allowed sarkozy to launch on july 13 a watered-down version catchily titled the " barcelona process : union for the mediterranean . "
copenhagen : denmark 's capital has become eu code for the set of standards which countries have to meet if they want to join the bloc .
the " copenhagen criteria , " adopted in june 1993 , say that a state should be able to preserve democracy and human rights , have a market economy and accept the eu 's " obligations and intent , " such as peace .
over the last year , the criteria have most often been mentioned in the context of eu hopefuls macedonia , serbia and turkey , all of whom have been accused by critics of falling short in key areas .
dublin : famous for its literary giants , its dark beer and its distressing tendency to reject eu treaties , " dublin , " in eu circles , is a term used when talking about refugees .
the " dublin convention , " which came into force in 1997 , is aimed at streamlining the way eu member states deal with refugees and , in particular , deciding where each applicant should be dealt with .
with the current french presidency of the bloc pushing for an eu " pact " on migration , dublin is usually referred to when member states want to accuse one another of not doing enough for refugees .
the hague is famous as the home of various international courts , all of which tend to be nicknamed " the hague tribunal . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the hague hosts the international criminal court the one the eu refers to most often at present is the international criminal tribunal for the former yugoslavia -lrb- icty -rrb- , set up by the un in 1993 to deal with the atrocities committed in the separatist balkan wars of the 1990s .

as german chancellor angela merkel heads to georgia on sunday , aug .
17 , to continue mediating in the ongoing conflict with russia , western experts mull the chances of escalations elsewhere in the former soviet sphere . when western powers in february gave their blessing to the independence of the serbian province of kosovo , opponents warned it would trigger separatist violence across europe .
now , with the fires of secessionist war still smoking in georgia and its breakaway provinces of abkhazia and south ossetia , the west is wondering nervously whether other conflicts might be about to break out elsewhere in the former ussr .
independence for the georgian provinces " would undoubtedly give impetus to independence ambitions " in the breakaway moldovan region of transnistria , said colonel christopher langton , security analyst at the institute for international strategic studies in london .
debate still rages as to the exact role played by russia in the georgian war , with tbilisi accusing moscow of aggression and moscow insisting that it only intervened to protect civilian lives .
but western analysts agree that before the conflict , russia was the breakaway regions ' main supporter - especially once georgia began to aim for nato membership following its 2003 " rose revolution . "
and they say that russia 's intervention is a warning for ukraine and moldova - two former-soviet states who are also edging towards the west , but who have russian military forces on their territory .
the conflict is " a stern warning to ukraine that what can happen if it tries to move closer to nato is the division of the country , " said security expert dusan reljic of the swp institute for international and security affairs in berlin .
it is also " the acceleration of russia 's ongoing effort to increase its influence " around its borders , langton said .
moscow has both a strong military presence and broad-based popular support in transnistria and ukraine 's crimean peninsula , which russia ceded to its " socialist brother " in 1954 .
ukraine monitoring its own separatist province bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bush and nato have plans for yushchenko 's ukraine and analysts now say that , given nato 's refusal to rule out further eastern expansions , moscow might feel that the best way to stall that process would be to promote secession in the two areas .
" when there are russian populations linked to russia , then those territories could break away ...
so if ukraine insists on joining nato , part of its territory could split away , " reljic said .
but is it really likely that russia would call for full independence for the crimea or transnistria , given the international storm which its actions in georgia have already provoked ? observers say that the option can not be ruled out in the long term , given that one of russia 's prime foreign-policy goals is to rebuild its own influence in europe at nato 's expense .
russian leaders have already said that they see nato 's offer of eventual membership for georgia and ukraine as a direct threat .
and that gives the crimea and transnistria immense strategic significance as two russian-dominated areas on ukraine 's fringe .
ukraine 's desire for nato membership " makes transnistria strategically important for russia , " while any increase in tension between moscow and kiev will " resonate in the crimea , " langton said .
in the short term , such fears are unlikely to materialize .
russia could assert power to scupper nato plans bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : georgia 's pounding puts its nato hopes in jeopardy russia 's hands are full dealing with the aftermath of the georgian war , and some nato members say the conflict proves that georgia is in any case not ready for membership .
but with key nato members , especially the us , pressing for ukraine and georgia to join , there is a danger that russia may end up feeling it has no choice but to weaken its neighbors before it is too late .
" in the past , the answer would have been no , this is not a proxy conflict between great powers .
but increasingly the answer is becoming yes , " langton said . dpa news agency -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

dw 's karl zawadzky says the country has to face the fact the party is over . one thing is clear - germany is past its peak when it comes to economic performance .
the party - surging exports and strong domestic investments - is over .
still , there 's some tangible relief at the reversal in economic fortunes because things could have been much worse .
the german economy shrank by 0.5 percent in the second quarter of this year - that 's bad but it 's not going to really cripple the country 's economy .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : karl zawadzky it would be highly surprising if all the big economic powers could simply shrug off the negative factors that have in recent times plunged the global economy into crisis .
in the us , an absolutely superficially-financed housing bubble has burst , triggering a finance and banking crisis in america and europe .
the real estate boom is also over in britain and spain , two large european union nations .
the dollar has taken a battering while the rise of the euro has thrown a dampener on european exports .
oil prices have climbed to levels unimaginable until recently and food prices have skyrocketed .
finally , inflation in the euro zone has soared out of control , prompting the european central bank to raise interest rates .
all this has put a brake on germany 's economic growth rate .
within a short period , both corporate and consumer sentiment has plummeted .
talk of a long-lasting economic upturn has been replaced by dire predictions of stagnation or even recession coupled with a lasting price rise .
but the facts speak against it .
the weather is one of the main reasons for germany 's economic slowdown .
whether it had to with climate change or not , the fact is that the last winter practically did n't materialize .
add to it the fact that tax benefits for the construction sector were phased out .
both those factors led to the fact that construction sites early this year were n't closed , as is usually the case , but rather that the economy grew in the first quarter by 1.5 percent - something it has n't done in 12 years .
this surge in growth was missing in the second quarter .
that means slowing economic growth is partly due to statistical interpretation .
if you assess the first two quarters of this year individually , a dramatic decline becomes apparent .
if you consider the first half of the year as a whole , you have an economic growth rate of 1.2 percent .
in the face of the negative factors affecting the world economy , it 's quite substantial .
but one thing is clear - if the global economy has to battle with serious problems such as high oil prices , a finance crisis and volatile currency markets , it will drag the german economy into the crisis .
that 's because the german economy , like no other economic power , is reliant on exports which make up almost half of germany 's economic performance .
a decade ago , that share was only 27 percent .
the current economic downturn looks worse than it actually is .
it wo n't change the fact that germany 's economy will grow in the current year .
german economics minister michael glos is sticking to growth predictions of 1.7 percent .
but that 's one percentage point less than last year ; for the coming year , experts predict a further worsening of the economy .
it 's not the decline in the second quarter but rather the downward trend that 's sparked concerns because it 's coupled with a strong price rise that hampers the much needed lowering of interest rates by the european central bank .
developments on the labor market are still positive but a lasting economic slowdown will soon change that .
the ranks of unemployed will rise again .
there 's a reason for the bleak outlook - the party is over .
for many , it 's associated with a hangover - just like in real life .

the german economy shrank by 0.5 percent in the second quarter of this year - that 's bad but it 's not going to really cripple the country 's economy .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : karl zawadzky it would be highly surprising if all the big economic powers could simply shrug off the negative factors that have in recent times plunged the global economy into crisis .
in the us , an absolutely superficially-financed housing bubble has burst , triggering a finance and banking crisis in america and europe .
the real estate boom is also over in britain and spain , two large european union nations .
the dollar has taken a battering while the rise of the euro has thrown a dampener on european exports .
oil prices have climbed to levels unimaginable until recently and food prices have skyrocketed .
finally , inflation in the euro zone has soared out of control , prompting the european central bank to raise interest rates .
all this has put a brake on germany 's economic growth rate .
within a short period , both corporate and consumer sentiment has plummeted .
talk of a long-lasting economic upturn has been replaced by dire predictions of stagnation or even recession coupled with a lasting price rise .
but the facts speak against it .
the weather is one of the main reasons for germany 's economic slowdown .
whether it had to with climate change or not , the fact is that the last winter practically did n't materialize .
add to it the fact that tax benefits for the construction sector were phased out .
both those factors led to the fact that construction sites early this year were n't closed , as is usually the case , but rather that the economy grew in the first quarter by 1.5 percent - something it has n't done in 12 years .
this surge in growth was missing in the second quarter .
that means slowing economic growth is partly due to statistical interpretation .
if you assess the first two quarters of this year individually , a dramatic decline becomes apparent .
if you consider the first half of the year as a whole , you have an economic growth rate of 1.2 percent .
in the face of the negative factors affecting the world economy , it 's quite substantial .
but one thing is clear - if the global economy has to battle with serious problems such as high oil prices , a finance crisis and volatile currency markets , it will drag the german economy into the crisis .
that 's because the german economy , like no other economic power , is reliant on exports which make up almost half of germany 's economic performance .
a decade ago , that share was only 27 percent .
the current economic downturn looks worse than it actually is .
it wo n't change the fact that germany 's economy will grow in the current year .
german economics minister michael glos is sticking to growth predictions of 1.7 percent .
but that 's one percentage point less than last year ; for the coming year , experts predict a further worsening of the economy .
it 's not the decline in the second quarter but rather the downward trend that 's sparked concerns because it 's coupled with a strong price rise that hampers the much needed lowering of interest rates by the european central bank .
developments on the labor market are still positive but a lasting economic slowdown will soon change that .
the ranks of unemployed will rise again .
there 's a reason for the bleak outlook - the party is over .
for many , it 's associated with a hangover - just like in real life .

dw 's karl zawadzky says the country has to face the fact the party is over . one thing is clear - germany is past its peak when it comes to economic performance .
the party - surging exports and strong domestic investments - is over .
still , there 's some tangible relief at the reversal in economic fortunes because things could have been much worse .
the german economy shrank by 0.5 percent in the second quarter of this year - that 's bad but it 's not going to really cripple the country 's economy .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : karl zawadzky it would be highly surprising if all the big economic powers could simply shrug off the negative factors that have in recent times plunged the global economy into crisis .
in the us , an absolutely superficially-financed housing bubble has burst , triggering a finance and banking crisis in america and europe .
the real estate boom is also over in britain and spain , two large european union nations .
the dollar has taken a battering while the rise of the euro has thrown a dampener on european exports .
oil prices have climbed to levels unimaginable until recently and food prices have skyrocketed .
finally , inflation in the euro zone has soared out of control , prompting the european central bank to raise interest rates .
all this has put a brake on germany 's economic growth rate .
within a short period , both corporate and consumer sentiment has plummeted .
talk of a long-lasting economic upturn has been replaced by dire predictions of stagnation or even recession coupled with a lasting price rise .
but the facts speak against it .
the weather is one of the main reasons for germany 's economic slowdown .
whether it had to with climate change or not , the fact is that the last winter practically did n't materialize .
add to it the fact that tax benefits for the construction sector were phased out .
both those factors led to the fact that construction sites early this year were n't closed , as is usually the case , but rather that the economy grew in the first quarter by 1.5 percent - something it has n't done in 12 years .
this surge in growth was missing in the second quarter .
that means slowing economic growth is partly due to statistical interpretation .
if you assess the first two quarters of this year individually , a dramatic decline becomes apparent .
if you consider the first half of the year as a whole , you have an economic growth rate of 1.2 percent .
in the face of the negative factors affecting the world economy , it 's quite substantial .
but one thing is clear - if the global economy has to battle with serious problems such as high oil prices , a finance crisis and volatile currency markets , it will drag the german economy into the crisis .
that 's because the german economy , like no other economic power , is reliant on exports which make up almost half of germany 's economic performance .
a decade ago , that share was only 27 percent .
the current economic downturn looks worse than it actually is .
it wo n't change the fact that germany 's economy will grow in the current year .
german economics minister michael glos is sticking to growth predictions of 1.7 percent .
but that 's one percentage point less than last year ; for the coming year , experts predict a further worsening of the economy .
it 's not the decline in the second quarter but rather the downward trend that 's sparked concerns because it 's coupled with a strong price rise that hampers the much needed lowering of interest rates by the european central bank .
developments on the labor market are still positive but a lasting economic slowdown will soon change that .
the ranks of unemployed will rise again .
there 's a reason for the bleak outlook - the party is over .
for many , it 's associated with a hangover - just like in real life .

as german chancellor angela merkel heads to georgia on sunday , aug .
17 , to continue mediating in the ongoing conflict with russia , western experts mull the chances of escalations elsewhere in the former soviet sphere . when western powers in february gave their blessing to the independence of the serbian province of kosovo , opponents warned it would trigger separatist violence across europe .
now , with the fires of secessionist war still smoking in georgia and its breakaway provinces of abkhazia and south ossetia , the west is wondering nervously whether other conflicts might be about to break out elsewhere in the former ussr .
independence for the georgian provinces " would undoubtedly give impetus to independence ambitions " in the breakaway moldovan region of transnistria , said colonel christopher langton , security analyst at the institute for international strategic studies in london .
debate still rages as to the exact role played by russia in the georgian war , with tbilisi accusing moscow of aggression and moscow insisting that it only intervened to protect civilian lives .
but western analysts agree that before the conflict , russia was the breakaway regions ' main supporter - especially once georgia began to aim for nato membership following its 2003 " rose revolution . "
and they say that russia 's intervention is a warning for ukraine and moldova - two former-soviet states who are also edging towards the west , but who have russian military forces on their territory .
the conflict is " a stern warning to ukraine that what can happen if it tries to move closer to nato is the division of the country , " said security expert dusan reljic of the swp institute for international and security affairs in berlin .
it is also " the acceleration of russia 's ongoing effort to increase its influence " around its borders , langton said .
moscow has both a strong military presence and broad-based popular support in transnistria and ukraine 's crimean peninsula , which russia ceded to its " socialist brother " in 1954 .
ukraine monitoring its own separatist province bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bush and nato have plans for yushchenko 's ukraine and analysts now say that , given nato 's refusal to rule out further eastern expansions , moscow might feel that the best way to stall that process would be to promote secession in the two areas .
" when there are russian populations linked to russia , then those territories could break away ...
so if ukraine insists on joining nato , part of its territory could split away , " reljic said .
but is it really likely that russia would call for full independence for the crimea or transnistria , given the international storm which its actions in georgia have already provoked ? observers say that the option can not be ruled out in the long term , given that one of russia 's prime foreign-policy goals is to rebuild its own influence in europe at nato 's expense .
russian leaders have already said that they see nato 's offer of eventual membership for georgia and ukraine as a direct threat .
and that gives the crimea and transnistria immense strategic significance as two russian-dominated areas on ukraine 's fringe .
ukraine 's desire for nato membership " makes transnistria strategically important for russia , " while any increase in tension between moscow and kiev will " resonate in the crimea , " langton said .
in the short term , such fears are unlikely to materialize .
russia could assert power to scupper nato plans bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : georgia 's pounding puts its nato hopes in jeopardy russia 's hands are full dealing with the aftermath of the georgian war , and some nato members say the conflict proves that georgia is in any case not ready for membership .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de in focus : dossier : getting the hang of the eu despite expansion , europe still ca n't define " european " european union makes a meal of regional treats could mutual ridicule be a sign of successful eu integration ?
will the real heart of europe please stand up ? european union -pipe- 17.08.2008 the hitch-hiker 's guide to understanding eu jargon großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the irish had nothing against the city but were vehemently against the treaty the problem with eu jargon is that you need both a political dictionary and a map to understand it .
here is a brief list of the eu 's more obscure place-names and a explanation of the processes they refer to . it sometimes seems that half of the eu 's main policies were named after the cities in which they were created .
the problem is that the nicknames almost never come with footnotes , leaving the unsuspecting visitor drowning in a sea of place-names .
barcelona is best known in the eu as the place where european , north african and middle eastern leaders met in november 1995 to try and improve their often-strained relationship .
the result was the " barcelona process , " by which the eu tried to boost trade and political ties with its mediterranean neighbors while urging them to do more for human rights and regional peace .
the process seldom made headlines until early 2007 , when french president nicolas sarkozy proposed scrapping it and creating a much more sweeping " mediterranean union " modeled on the eu .
eu members without a mediterranean coastline blocked the idea , but allowed sarkozy to launch on july 13 a watered-down version catchily titled the " barcelona process : union for the mediterranean . "
copenhagen : denmark 's capital has become eu code for the set of standards which countries have to meet if they want to join the bloc .
the " copenhagen criteria , " adopted in june 1993 , say that a state should be able to preserve democracy and human rights , have a market economy and accept the eu 's " obligations and intent , " such as peace .
over the last year , the criteria have most often been mentioned in the context of eu hopefuls macedonia , serbia and turkey , all of whom have been accused by critics of falling short in key areas .
dublin : famous for its literary giants , its dark beer and its distressing tendency to reject eu treaties , " dublin , " in eu circles , is a term used when talking about refugees .
the " dublin convention , " which came into force in 1997 , is aimed at streamlining the way eu member states deal with refugees and , in particular , deciding where each applicant should be dealt with .
with the current french presidency of the bloc pushing for an eu " pact " on migration , dublin is usually referred to when member states want to accuse one another of not doing enough for refugees .
the hague is famous as the home of various international courts , all of which tend to be nicknamed " the hague tribunal . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the hague hosts the international criminal court the one the eu refers to most often at present is the international criminal tribunal for the former yugoslavia -lrb- icty -rrb- , set up by the un in 1993 to deal with the atrocities committed in the separatist balkan wars of the 1990s .
while not an eu body , icty regularly features in eu meetings because the dutch government has vetoed any kind of eu rapprochement with serbia until icty 's chief prosecutor rules that the belgrade government is cooperating fully with his organization .
cities lend their name to treaties when european union leaders refer to the " lisbon agenda " or the " manchester declaration , " this is what they mean : lisbon : the lisbon agenda , agreed in march 2000 , is a plan aimed at making the eu the world 's most competitive economy by 2010 .
the lisbon treaty , signed in december 2007 , is an agreement between the bloc 's 27 member states aimed at making it easier to take eu-wide decisions and giving the union a higher profile abroad .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the treaty has put lisbon on the eu map with the eu lagging behind key rivals such as the united states and japan in terms of innovation , the word " lisbon " has in the past usually been used to describe the gap between the eu 's targets and its results .
however , since irish voters rejected the lisbon treaty in a referendum on june 12 , current headlines referring to " lisbon " usually refer to the treaty .
maastricht : the maastricht treaty , signed in 1992 , created the eu out of its forerunner , the european economic community , and set up the legal process that created the euro .
maastricht criteria are the strict rules on inflation and government spending that countries have to meet in order to join the euro .
the criteria last made the headlines in july , when eu finance ministers invited slovakia to become the euro club 's 16th member .
manchester : britain 's soccer giant is known in the eu for the political call , made by finance ministers in september 2005 , not to respond to fuel-price rises by cutting taxes .
barely mentioned until the recent oil-price surge , the manchester declaration has now come back to haunt ministers , as they urge one another in increasingly nervous tones not to break ranks . nice : the nice treaty , signed by eu leaders in 2001 , updated the union 's internal workings so the bloc could absorb 12 new member states between 2004 and 2007 .
its main remit was to set the number of votes in eu councils each member state should have , from 29 in germany to three in malta .
when eu leaders were negotiating the lisbon treaty in 2007 , poland , which stood to lose some of its voting power under the new rules , demanded that the nice voting weights remain unchanged , going into negotiations with the slogan " nice or death ! "
schengen : the schengen convention , which came into force in 1995 , abolished border barriers between belgium , france , germany , greece , italy , luxembourg , the netherlands , portugal and spain .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : schengen has gained international fame through the eu the agreement created the schengen zone , which now includes all the eu 's current members except britain , ireland , bulgaria and romania .
non-eu members iceland and norway are also in the zone .
schengen most recently hit the headlines in late 2007 , when it expanded to take in nine countries which joined the eu in 2004 .
tampere : the finnish town of tampere is best known in eu circles for its links with international law-enforcement .
the tampere process , launched in 1999 , is the series of talks which eu member states are holding to discuss how they can improve cooperation on sensitive issues of justice and internal affairs .
the process was given a renewed impulse at a summit in the hague in 2004 - whereupon some officials renamed it the " hague process . "
however , some diplomats say that the process will receive a new impulse when sweden takes over the eu 's rotating presidency in the second half of 2009 .
they therefore call it the " stockholm process . " dpa news agency -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

as german chancellor angela merkel heads to georgia on sunday , aug .
17 , to continue mediating in the ongoing conflict with russia , western experts mull the chances of escalations elsewhere in the former soviet sphere . when western powers in february gave their blessing to the independence of the serbian province of kosovo , opponents warned it would trigger separatist violence across europe .
now , with the fires of secessionist war still smoking in georgia and its breakaway provinces of abkhazia and south ossetia , the west is wondering nervously whether other conflicts might be about to break out elsewhere in the former ussr .
independence for the georgian provinces " would undoubtedly give impetus to independence ambitions " in the breakaway moldovan region of transnistria , said colonel christopher langton , security analyst at the institute for international strategic studies in london .
debate still rages as to the exact role played by russia in the georgian war , with tbilisi accusing moscow of aggression and moscow insisting that it only intervened to protect civilian lives .
but western analysts agree that before the conflict , russia was the breakaway regions ' main supporter - especially once georgia began to aim for nato membership following its 2003 " rose revolution . "
and they say that russia 's intervention is a warning for ukraine and moldova - two former-soviet states who are also edging towards the west , but who have russian military forces on their territory .
the conflict is " a stern warning to ukraine that what can happen if it tries to move closer to nato is the division of the country , " said security expert dusan reljic of the swp institute for international and security affairs in berlin .
it is also " the acceleration of russia 's ongoing effort to increase its influence " around its borders , langton said .
moscow has both a strong military presence and broad-based popular support in transnistria and ukraine 's crimean peninsula , which russia ceded to its " socialist brother " in 1954 .
ukraine monitoring its own separatist province bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bush and nato have plans for yushchenko 's ukraine and analysts now say that , given nato 's refusal to rule out further eastern expansions , moscow might feel that the best way to stall that process would be to promote secession in the two areas .
" when there are russian populations linked to russia , then those territories could break away ...
so if ukraine insists on joining nato , part of its territory could split away , " reljic said .
but is it really likely that russia would call for full independence for the crimea or transnistria , given the international storm which its actions in georgia have already provoked ? observers say that the option can not be ruled out in the long term , given that one of russia 's prime foreign-policy goals is to rebuild its own influence in europe at nato 's expense .
russian leaders have already said that they see nato 's offer of eventual membership for georgia and ukraine as a direct threat .
and that gives the crimea and transnistria immense strategic significance as two russian-dominated areas on ukraine 's fringe .
ukraine 's desire for nato membership " makes transnistria strategically important for russia , " while any increase in tension between moscow and kiev will " resonate in the crimea , " langton said .
in the short term , such fears are unlikely to materialize .
russia could assert power to scupper nato plans bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : georgia 's pounding puts its nato hopes in jeopardy russia 's hands are full dealing with the aftermath of the georgian war , and some nato members say the conflict proves that georgia is in any case not ready for membership .
but with key nato members , especially the us , pressing for ukraine and georgia to join , there is a danger that russia may end up feeling it has no choice but to weaken its neighbors before it is too late .
" in the past , the answer would have been no , this is not a proxy conflict between great powers .
but increasingly the answer is becoming yes , " langton said . dpa news agency -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" georgia will become a member of nato if it wants to - and it does want to , " merkel said before talks with president mikheil saakashvili in tbilisi . it was one of the strongest statements yet of support for georgia 's nato membership bid which is fiercely opposed by russia .
the statement signals a change in germany 's position towards georgian nato membership .
earlier this year , germany led european resistance to plans , pushed by the us , to put georgia on the track to nato membership . later at a joint news conference with saakashvili , merkel said that though georgia was on a clear path to membership in nato she stood by her decision at a summit in april not to grant tbilisi a " membership action plan " for joining the alliance . at the last nato summit in bucharest in april , leaders agreed that georgia and ukraine should join the north atlantic treaty organization eventually , but neither nation was given candidate status and no timetables were set .
the united states is strongly in favour of georgia joining nato , but misgivings from france and germany prevented tbilisi being awarded full candidate status in bucharest . medvedev confirms pull-out in a meeting with medvedev in the black sea resort of sochi on friday , merkel had criticized russian actions during the week-long war between russia and georgia over the breakaway region of south ossetia .
she demanded that russia withdraw all its troops from georgia 's core territory . the georgian government says rebel abkhaz forces with the support of russian troops are occupying 13 georgian villages , effectively pushing the border of abkhazia westwards into georgia proper . medvedev said sunday that russian regular forces would start their pullout from georgia on monday , the kremlin said .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : medvedev has confirmed russia will begin withdrawing troops from georgia " from tomorrow , russia will begin withdrawing its military forces that are supporting russian peacekeepers , " medvedev told french president nicolas sarkozy in a telephone conversation , the kremlin said in a statement . speaking at a sunday press conference in tbilisi , merkel said that despite medvedev 's commitment " according to the information i have available to me this -lrb- russian withdrawal -rrb- has not yet begun . "
merkel : georgia 's integrity must be respected merkel also repeated that germany 's position was that georgia 's territorial integrity was beyond question , and that its borders should be inviolate . in her meeting with medvedev , merkel also stressed that germany 's position was that georgia 's territorial integrity was beyond question and that saakashvili was a democratically elected president . government sources said ahead of her departure that she intended to push for " a complete cessation of hostilities . " " the ceasefire must be verifiable and lasting , " they said . bildunterschrift : the map shows where russian troops blew up a georgian railroad bridge near the capital tbilisi georgian media hald back from predictions of what effect , if any , merkel 's visit would have on russian troops currently occupying georgian territory . rustaveli 2 television described merkel 's presence in georgia as " part of an international effort to support georgia . " west divided on how to deal with russia german foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier warned on sunday against any knee-jerk reaction to the caucasus conflict in relations with russia .
" i do not advise ... any knee-jerk reaction such as suspending talks on a partnership and cooperation agreement -lrb- with the european union -rrb- .
that would signify that such an agreement is more important to the eu than to russia , " steinmeier said in an interview with german weekly welt am sonntag .
" or russia joining the world trade organisation -lrb- wto -rrb- : our interest in this is as great as russia itself .
talks in the nato-russian council are essential too .
because we need open lines of communication - to tbilisi and to moscow , " steinmeier told the paper .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : steinmeier 's comments on russia are in sharp contrast to the views held by other western nations steinmeier 's comments were at odds with the views of other eu members as well as the us .
french president nicolas sarkozy , whose country holds the rotating eu presidency until the end of the year , warned on sunday that russian relations with the eu would be seriously damaged if moscow failed to fully implement the peace deal it signed with georgia .
in a statement , sarkozy told medvedev of the " serious consequences that a failure to quickly and fully implement the deal would have on relations between russia and the european union . "
britain 's foreign secretary david miliband said on wednesday that the eu should reassess its relations with russia after its " aggressive " actions in georgia and decide whether " to proceed with the partnership and cooperation agreement . "
us secretary of state condoleezza rice said on sunday that moscow 's international reputation had taken a beating by its military action in georgia .
" russia overreached , used disproportionate force against a small neighbour and is now paying the price for that because russia 's reputation as a potential partner in international institutions , diplomatic , political , security , economic , is frankly , in tatters , " rice told nbc 's meet the press . dw staff -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" georgia will become a member of nato if it wants to - and it does want to , " merkel said before talks with president mikheil saakashvili in tbilisi . it was one of the strongest statements yet of support for georgia 's nato membership bid which is fiercely opposed by russia .
the statement signals a change in germany 's position towards georgian nato membership .
earlier this year , germany led european resistance to plans , pushed by the us , to put georgia on the track to nato membership . later at a joint news conference with saakashvili , merkel said that though georgia was on a clear path to membership in nato she stood by her decision at a summit in april not to grant tbilisi a " membership action plan " for joining the alliance . at the last nato summit in bucharest in april , leaders agreed that georgia and ukraine should join the north atlantic treaty organization eventually , but neither nation was given candidate status and no timetables were set .
the united states is strongly in favour of georgia joining nato , but misgivings from france and germany prevented tbilisi being awarded full candidate status in bucharest . medvedev confirms pull-out in a meeting with medvedev in the black sea resort of sochi on friday , merkel had criticized russian actions during the week-long war between russia and georgia over the breakaway region of south ossetia .
she demanded that russia withdraw all its troops from georgia 's core territory . the georgian government says rebel abkhaz forces with the support of russian troops are occupying 13 georgian villages , effectively pushing the border of abkhazia westwards into georgia proper . medvedev said sunday that russian regular forces would start their pullout from georgia on monday , the kremlin said .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : medvedev has confirmed russia will begin withdrawing troops from georgia " from tomorrow , russia will begin withdrawing its military forces that are supporting russian peacekeepers , " medvedev told french president nicolas sarkozy in a telephone conversation , the kremlin said in a statement . speaking at a sunday press conference in tbilisi , merkel said that despite medvedev 's commitment " according to the information i have available to me this -lrb- russian withdrawal -rrb- has not yet begun . "
merkel : georgia 's integrity must be respected merkel also repeated that germany 's position was that georgia 's territorial integrity was beyond question , and that its borders should be inviolate . in her meeting with medvedev , merkel also stressed that germany 's position was that georgia 's territorial integrity was beyond question and that saakashvili was a democratically elected president . government sources said ahead of her departure that she intended to push for " a complete cessation of hostilities . " " the ceasefire must be verifiable and lasting , " they said . bildunterschrift : the map shows where russian troops blew up a georgian railroad bridge near the capital tbilisi georgian media hald back from predictions of what effect , if any , merkel 's visit would have on russian troops currently occupying georgian territory . rustaveli 2 television described merkel 's presence in georgia as " part of an international effort to support georgia . " west divided on how to deal with russia german foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier warned on sunday against any knee-jerk reaction to the caucasus conflict in relations with russia .
" i do not advise ... any knee-jerk reaction such as suspending talks on a partnership and cooperation agreement -lrb- with the european union -rrb- .
that would signify that such an agreement is more important to the eu than to russia , " steinmeier said in an interview with german weekly welt am sonntag .
" or russia joining the world trade organisation -lrb- wto -rrb- : our interest in this is as great as russia itself .
talks in the nato-russian council are essential too .
because we need open lines of communication - to tbilisi and to moscow , " steinmeier told the paper .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : steinmeier 's comments on russia are in sharp contrast to the views held by other western nations steinmeier 's comments were at odds with the views of other eu members as well as the us .
french president nicolas sarkozy , whose country holds the rotating eu presidency until the end of the year , warned on sunday that russian relations with the eu would be seriously damaged if moscow failed to fully implement the peace deal it signed with georgia .
in a statement , sarkozy told medvedev of the " serious consequences that a failure to quickly and fully implement the deal would have on relations between russia and the european union . "
britain 's foreign secretary david miliband said on wednesday that the eu should reassess its relations with russia after its " aggressive " actions in georgia and decide whether " to proceed with the partnership and cooperation agreement . "
us secretary of state condoleezza rice said on sunday that moscow 's international reputation had taken a beating by its military action in georgia .

the german federal labor office has now started offering training courses for interested long-term unemployed , who receive some 160 hours of instruction to be able to work with patients . they have to have been unemployed for at least 12 months and show an interest in working in a nursing home , according to a report in german daily sueddeutsche zeitung .
after the training , they will be able to work as nursing care assistants , performing tasks such as reading to patients , talking with them or running errands for them . a brazen proposal ? geriatric care experts , who said that care assistants need to have at least 900 hours of training , were outraged by the proposal . " to equate dementia with handicrafts , reading to people and walking them is brazen , " helmut wallrafen-dreisow , a member of the german board for geriatric care .
" the health care companies want to get things done cheap , but nursing homes are meant to fulfill highest standards .
that does n't work . " dirk niebel , a leading member of germany 's opposition free-market liberal free democratic party called the move " labor-market policy charlatanism . "
germany 's unemployment figures have risen slightly after several years of steady decline .

she said that many people with dementia are currently cared for by volunteers , who have received no training whatsoever . she also said that many of those interested in participating in the trainings already had experience working in the health care sector . " for many unemployed people , a job in a nursing home is a chance to rejoin the old line of work , " schmidt told dpa news agency .
" that 's especially true for women . " experts doubt , however , that labor office officials will find enough people to fill the positions .

will the real heart of europe please stand up ? european union -pipe- 17.08.2008 the hitch-hiker 's guide to understanding eu jargon großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the irish had nothing against the city but were vehemently against the treaty the problem with eu jargon is that you need both a political dictionary and a map to understand it .
here is a brief list of the eu 's more obscure place-names and a explanation of the processes they refer to . it sometimes seems that half of the eu 's main policies were named after the cities in which they were created .
the problem is that the nicknames almost never come with footnotes , leaving the unsuspecting visitor drowning in a sea of place-names .
barcelona is best known in the eu as the place where european , north african and middle eastern leaders met in november 1995 to try and improve their often-strained relationship .
the result was the " barcelona process , " by which the eu tried to boost trade and political ties with its mediterranean neighbors while urging them to do more for human rights and regional peace .
the process seldom made headlines until early 2007 , when french president nicolas sarkozy proposed scrapping it and creating a much more sweeping " mediterranean union " modeled on the eu .
eu members without a mediterranean coastline blocked the idea , but allowed sarkozy to launch on july 13 a watered-down version catchily titled the " barcelona process : union for the mediterranean . "
copenhagen : denmark 's capital has become eu code for the set of standards which countries have to meet if they want to join the bloc .
the " copenhagen criteria , " adopted in june 1993 , say that a state should be able to preserve democracy and human rights , have a market economy and accept the eu 's " obligations and intent , " such as peace .
over the last year , the criteria have most often been mentioned in the context of eu hopefuls macedonia , serbia and turkey , all of whom have been accused by critics of falling short in key areas .
dublin : famous for its literary giants , its dark beer and its distressing tendency to reject eu treaties , " dublin , " in eu circles , is a term used when talking about refugees .
the " dublin convention , " which came into force in 1997 , is aimed at streamlining the way eu member states deal with refugees and , in particular , deciding where each applicant should be dealt with .
with the current french presidency of the bloc pushing for an eu " pact " on migration , dublin is usually referred to when member states want to accuse one another of not doing enough for refugees .
the hague is famous as the home of various international courts , all of which tend to be nicknamed " the hague tribunal . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the hague hosts the international criminal court the one the eu refers to most often at present is the international criminal tribunal for the former yugoslavia -lrb- icty -rrb- , set up by the un in 1993 to deal with the atrocities committed in the separatist balkan wars of the 1990s .
while not an eu body , icty regularly features in eu meetings because the dutch government has vetoed any kind of eu rapprochement with serbia until icty 's chief prosecutor rules that the belgrade government is cooperating fully with his organization .
cities lend their name to treaties when european union leaders refer to the " lisbon agenda " or the " manchester declaration , " this is what they mean : lisbon : the lisbon agenda , agreed in march 2000 , is a plan aimed at making the eu the world 's most competitive economy by 2010 .
the lisbon treaty , signed in december 2007 , is an agreement between the bloc 's 27 member states aimed at making it easier to take eu-wide decisions and giving the union a higher profile abroad .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the treaty has put lisbon on the eu map with the eu lagging behind key rivals such as the united states and japan in terms of innovation , the word " lisbon " has in the past usually been used to describe the gap between the eu 's targets and its results .
however , since irish voters rejected the lisbon treaty in a referendum on june 12 , current headlines referring to " lisbon " usually refer to the treaty .
maastricht : the maastricht treaty , signed in 1992 , created the eu out of its forerunner , the european economic community , and set up the legal process that created the euro .
maastricht criteria are the strict rules on inflation and government spending that countries have to meet in order to join the euro .
the criteria last made the headlines in july , when eu finance ministers invited slovakia to become the euro club 's 16th member .
manchester : britain 's soccer giant is known in the eu for the political call , made by finance ministers in september 2005 , not to respond to fuel-price rises by cutting taxes .
barely mentioned until the recent oil-price surge , the manchester declaration has now come back to haunt ministers , as they urge one another in increasingly nervous tones not to break ranks . nice : the nice treaty , signed by eu leaders in 2001 , updated the union 's internal workings so the bloc could absorb 12 new member states between 2004 and 2007 .
its main remit was to set the number of votes in eu councils each member state should have , from 29 in germany to three in malta .
when eu leaders were negotiating the lisbon treaty in 2007 , poland , which stood to lose some of its voting power under the new rules , demanded that the nice voting weights remain unchanged , going into negotiations with the slogan " nice or death ! "
schengen : the schengen convention , which came into force in 1995 , abolished border barriers between belgium , france , germany , greece , italy , luxembourg , the netherlands , portugal and spain .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : schengen has gained international fame through the eu the agreement created the schengen zone , which now includes all the eu 's current members except britain , ireland , bulgaria and romania .
non-eu members iceland and norway are also in the zone .
schengen most recently hit the headlines in late 2007 , when it expanded to take in nine countries which joined the eu in 2004 .
tampere : the finnish town of tampere is best known in eu circles for its links with international law-enforcement .
the tampere process , launched in 1999 , is the series of talks which eu member states are holding to discuss how they can improve cooperation on sensitive issues of justice and internal affairs .
the process was given a renewed impulse at a summit in the hague in 2004 - whereupon some officials renamed it the " hague process . "
however , some diplomats say that the process will receive a new impulse when sweden takes over the eu 's rotating presidency in the second half of 2009 .
they therefore call it the " stockholm process . " dpa news agency -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

while not an eu body , icty regularly features in eu meetings because the dutch government has vetoed any kind of eu rapprochement with serbia until icty 's chief prosecutor rules that the belgrade government is cooperating fully with his organization .
cities lend their name to treaties when european union leaders refer to the " lisbon agenda " or the " manchester declaration , " this is what they mean : lisbon : the lisbon agenda , agreed in march 2000 , is a plan aimed at making the eu the world 's most competitive economy by 2010 .
the lisbon treaty , signed in december 2007 , is an agreement between the bloc 's 27 member states aimed at making it easier to take eu-wide decisions and giving the union a higher profile abroad .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the treaty has put lisbon on the eu map with the eu lagging behind key rivals such as the united states and japan in terms of innovation , the word " lisbon " has in the past usually been used to describe the gap between the eu 's targets and its results .
however , since irish voters rejected the lisbon treaty in a referendum on june 12 , current headlines referring to " lisbon " usually refer to the treaty .
maastricht : the maastricht treaty , signed in 1992 , created the eu out of its forerunner , the european economic community , and set up the legal process that created the euro .
maastricht criteria are the strict rules on inflation and government spending that countries have to meet in order to join the euro .
the criteria last made the headlines in july , when eu finance ministers invited slovakia to become the euro club 's 16th member .
manchester : britain 's soccer giant is known in the eu for the political call , made by finance ministers in september 2005 , not to respond to fuel-price rises by cutting taxes .
barely mentioned until the recent oil-price surge , the manchester declaration has now come back to haunt ministers , as they urge one another in increasingly nervous tones not to break ranks . nice : the nice treaty , signed by eu leaders in 2001 , updated the union 's internal workings so the bloc could absorb 12 new member states between 2004 and 2007 .
its main remit was to set the number of votes in eu councils each member state should have , from 29 in germany to three in malta .
when eu leaders were negotiating the lisbon treaty in 2007 , poland , which stood to lose some of its voting power under the new rules , demanded that the nice voting weights remain unchanged , going into negotiations with the slogan " nice or death ! "
schengen : the schengen convention , which came into force in 1995 , abolished border barriers between belgium , france , germany , greece , italy , luxembourg , the netherlands , portugal and spain .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : schengen has gained international fame through the eu the agreement created the schengen zone , which now includes all the eu 's current members except britain , ireland , bulgaria and romania .
non-eu members iceland and norway are also in the zone .
schengen most recently hit the headlines in late 2007 , when it expanded to take in nine countries which joined the eu in 2004 .
tampere : the finnish town of tampere is best known in eu circles for its links with international law-enforcement .
the tampere process , launched in 1999 , is the series of talks which eu member states are holding to discuss how they can improve cooperation on sensitive issues of justice and internal affairs .
the process was given a renewed impulse at a summit in the hague in 2004 - whereupon some officials renamed it the " hague process . "
however , some diplomats say that the process will receive a new impulse when sweden takes over the eu 's rotating presidency in the second half of 2009 .
they therefore call it the " stockholm process . " dpa news agency -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

will the real heart of europe please stand up ? european union -pipe- 17.08.2008 the hitch-hiker 's guide to understanding eu jargon großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the irish had nothing against the city but were vehemently against the treaty the problem with eu jargon is that you need both a political dictionary and a map to understand it .
here is a brief list of the eu 's more obscure place-names and a explanation of the processes they refer to . it sometimes seems that half of the eu 's main policies were named after the cities in which they were created .
the problem is that the nicknames almost never come with footnotes , leaving the unsuspecting visitor drowning in a sea of place-names .
barcelona is best known in the eu as the place where european , north african and middle eastern leaders met in november 1995 to try and improve their often-strained relationship .
the result was the " barcelona process , " by which the eu tried to boost trade and political ties with its mediterranean neighbors while urging them to do more for human rights and regional peace .
the process seldom made headlines until early 2007 , when french president nicolas sarkozy proposed scrapping it and creating a much more sweeping " mediterranean union " modeled on the eu .
eu members without a mediterranean coastline blocked the idea , but allowed sarkozy to launch on july 13 a watered-down version catchily titled the " barcelona process : union for the mediterranean . "
copenhagen : denmark 's capital has become eu code for the set of standards which countries have to meet if they want to join the bloc .
the " copenhagen criteria , " adopted in june 1993 , say that a state should be able to preserve democracy and human rights , have a market economy and accept the eu 's " obligations and intent , " such as peace .
over the last year , the criteria have most often been mentioned in the context of eu hopefuls macedonia , serbia and turkey , all of whom have been accused by critics of falling short in key areas .
dublin : famous for its literary giants , its dark beer and its distressing tendency to reject eu treaties , " dublin , " in eu circles , is a term used when talking about refugees .
the " dublin convention , " which came into force in 1997 , is aimed at streamlining the way eu member states deal with refugees and , in particular , deciding where each applicant should be dealt with .
with the current french presidency of the bloc pushing for an eu " pact " on migration , dublin is usually referred to when member states want to accuse one another of not doing enough for refugees .
the hague is famous as the home of various international courts , all of which tend to be nicknamed " the hague tribunal . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the hague hosts the international criminal court the one the eu refers to most often at present is the international criminal tribunal for the former yugoslavia -lrb- icty -rrb- , set up by the un in 1993 to deal with the atrocities committed in the separatist balkan wars of the 1990s .

dw 's karl zawadzky says the country has to face the fact the party is over . one thing is clear - germany is past its peak when it comes to economic performance .
the party - surging exports and strong domestic investments - is over .
still , there 's some tangible relief at the reversal in economic fortunes because things could have been much worse .
the german economy shrank by 0.5 percent in the second quarter of this year - that 's bad but it 's not going to really cripple the country 's economy .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : karl zawadzky it would be highly surprising if all the big economic powers could simply shrug off the negative factors that have in recent times plunged the global economy into crisis .
in the us , an absolutely superficially-financed housing bubble has burst , triggering a finance and banking crisis in america and europe .
the real estate boom is also over in britain and spain , two large european union nations .
the dollar has taken a battering while the rise of the euro has thrown a dampener on european exports .
oil prices have climbed to levels unimaginable until recently and food prices have skyrocketed .
finally , inflation in the euro zone has soared out of control , prompting the european central bank to raise interest rates .
all this has put a brake on germany 's economic growth rate .
within a short period , both corporate and consumer sentiment has plummeted .
talk of a long-lasting economic upturn has been replaced by dire predictions of stagnation or even recession coupled with a lasting price rise .
but the facts speak against it .
the weather is one of the main reasons for germany 's economic slowdown .
whether it had to with climate change or not , the fact is that the last winter practically did n't materialize .
add to it the fact that tax benefits for the construction sector were phased out .
both those factors led to the fact that construction sites early this year were n't closed , as is usually the case , but rather that the economy grew in the first quarter by 1.5 percent - something it has n't done in 12 years .
this surge in growth was missing in the second quarter .
that means slowing economic growth is partly due to statistical interpretation .
if you assess the first two quarters of this year individually , a dramatic decline becomes apparent .
if you consider the first half of the year as a whole , you have an economic growth rate of 1.2 percent .
in the face of the negative factors affecting the world economy , it 's quite substantial .
but one thing is clear - if the global economy has to battle with serious problems such as high oil prices , a finance crisis and volatile currency markets , it will drag the german economy into the crisis .
that 's because the german economy , like no other economic power , is reliant on exports which make up almost half of germany 's economic performance .
a decade ago , that share was only 27 percent .
the current economic downturn looks worse than it actually is .
it wo n't change the fact that germany 's economy will grow in the current year .
german economics minister michael glos is sticking to growth predictions of 1.7 percent .
but that 's one percentage point less than last year ; for the coming year , experts predict a further worsening of the economy .
it 's not the decline in the second quarter but rather the downward trend that 's sparked concerns because it 's coupled with a strong price rise that hampers the much needed lowering of interest rates by the european central bank .
developments on the labor market are still positive but a lasting economic slowdown will soon change that .
the ranks of unemployed will rise again .
there 's a reason for the bleak outlook - the party is over .
for many , it 's associated with a hangover - just like in real life .

will the real heart of europe please stand up ? european union -pipe- 17.08.2008 the hitch-hiker 's guide to understanding eu jargon großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the irish had nothing against the city but were vehemently against the treaty the problem with eu jargon is that you need both a political dictionary and a map to understand it .
here is a brief list of the eu 's more obscure place-names and a explanation of the processes they refer to . it sometimes seems that half of the eu 's main policies were named after the cities in which they were created .
the problem is that the nicknames almost never come with footnotes , leaving the unsuspecting visitor drowning in a sea of place-names .
barcelona is best known in the eu as the place where european , north african and middle eastern leaders met in november 1995 to try and improve their often-strained relationship .
the result was the " barcelona process , " by which the eu tried to boost trade and political ties with its mediterranean neighbors while urging them to do more for human rights and regional peace .
the process seldom made headlines until early 2007 , when french president nicolas sarkozy proposed scrapping it and creating a much more sweeping " mediterranean union " modeled on the eu .
eu members without a mediterranean coastline blocked the idea , but allowed sarkozy to launch on july 13 a watered-down version catchily titled the " barcelona process : union for the mediterranean . "
copenhagen : denmark 's capital has become eu code for the set of standards which countries have to meet if they want to join the bloc .
the " copenhagen criteria , " adopted in june 1993 , say that a state should be able to preserve democracy and human rights , have a market economy and accept the eu 's " obligations and intent , " such as peace .
over the last year , the criteria have most often been mentioned in the context of eu hopefuls macedonia , serbia and turkey , all of whom have been accused by critics of falling short in key areas .
dublin : famous for its literary giants , its dark beer and its distressing tendency to reject eu treaties , " dublin , " in eu circles , is a term used when talking about refugees .
the " dublin convention , " which came into force in 1997 , is aimed at streamlining the way eu member states deal with refugees and , in particular , deciding where each applicant should be dealt with .
with the current french presidency of the bloc pushing for an eu " pact " on migration , dublin is usually referred to when member states want to accuse one another of not doing enough for refugees .
the hague is famous as the home of various international courts , all of which tend to be nicknamed " the hague tribunal . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the hague hosts the international criminal court the one the eu refers to most often at present is the international criminal tribunal for the former yugoslavia -lrb- icty -rrb- , set up by the un in 1993 to deal with the atrocities committed in the separatist balkan wars of the 1990s .
while not an eu body , icty regularly features in eu meetings because the dutch government has vetoed any kind of eu rapprochement with serbia until icty 's chief prosecutor rules that the belgrade government is cooperating fully with his organization .
cities lend their name to treaties when european union leaders refer to the " lisbon agenda " or the " manchester declaration , " this is what they mean : lisbon : the lisbon agenda , agreed in march 2000 , is a plan aimed at making the eu the world 's most competitive economy by 2010 .
the lisbon treaty , signed in december 2007 , is an agreement between the bloc 's 27 member states aimed at making it easier to take eu-wide decisions and giving the union a higher profile abroad .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the treaty has put lisbon on the eu map with the eu lagging behind key rivals such as the united states and japan in terms of innovation , the word " lisbon " has in the past usually been used to describe the gap between the eu 's targets and its results .
however , since irish voters rejected the lisbon treaty in a referendum on june 12 , current headlines referring to " lisbon " usually refer to the treaty .
maastricht : the maastricht treaty , signed in 1992 , created the eu out of its forerunner , the european economic community , and set up the legal process that created the euro .
maastricht criteria are the strict rules on inflation and government spending that countries have to meet in order to join the euro .
the criteria last made the headlines in july , when eu finance ministers invited slovakia to become the euro club 's 16th member .
manchester : britain 's soccer giant is known in the eu for the political call , made by finance ministers in september 2005 , not to respond to fuel-price rises by cutting taxes .
barely mentioned until the recent oil-price surge , the manchester declaration has now come back to haunt ministers , as they urge one another in increasingly nervous tones not to break ranks . nice : the nice treaty , signed by eu leaders in 2001 , updated the union 's internal workings so the bloc could absorb 12 new member states between 2004 and 2007 .
its main remit was to set the number of votes in eu councils each member state should have , from 29 in germany to three in malta .
when eu leaders were negotiating the lisbon treaty in 2007 , poland , which stood to lose some of its voting power under the new rules , demanded that the nice voting weights remain unchanged , going into negotiations with the slogan " nice or death ! "
schengen : the schengen convention , which came into force in 1995 , abolished border barriers between belgium , france , germany , greece , italy , luxembourg , the netherlands , portugal and spain .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : schengen has gained international fame through the eu the agreement created the schengen zone , which now includes all the eu 's current members except britain , ireland , bulgaria and romania .
non-eu members iceland and norway are also in the zone .
schengen most recently hit the headlines in late 2007 , when it expanded to take in nine countries which joined the eu in 2004 .
tampere : the finnish town of tampere is best known in eu circles for its links with international law-enforcement .
the tampere process , launched in 1999 , is the series of talks which eu member states are holding to discuss how they can improve cooperation on sensitive issues of justice and internal affairs .
the process was given a renewed impulse at a summit in the hague in 2004 - whereupon some officials renamed it the " hague process . "
however , some diplomats say that the process will receive a new impulse when sweden takes over the eu 's rotating presidency in the second half of 2009 .
they therefore call it the " stockholm process . " dpa news agency -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

dw 's karl zawadzky says the country has to face the fact the party is over . one thing is clear - germany is past its peak when it comes to economic performance .
the party - surging exports and strong domestic investments - is over .
still , there 's some tangible relief at the reversal in economic fortunes because things could have been much worse .
the german economy shrank by 0.5 percent in the second quarter of this year - that 's bad but it 's not going to really cripple the country 's economy .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : karl zawadzky it would be highly surprising if all the big economic powers could simply shrug off the negative factors that have in recent times plunged the global economy into crisis .
in the us , an absolutely superficially-financed housing bubble has burst , triggering a finance and banking crisis in america and europe .
the real estate boom is also over in britain and spain , two large european union nations .
the dollar has taken a battering while the rise of the euro has thrown a dampener on european exports .
oil prices have climbed to levels unimaginable until recently and food prices have skyrocketed .
finally , inflation in the euro zone has soared out of control , prompting the european central bank to raise interest rates .
all this has put a brake on germany 's economic growth rate .
within a short period , both corporate and consumer sentiment has plummeted .
talk of a long-lasting economic upturn has been replaced by dire predictions of stagnation or even recession coupled with a lasting price rise .
but the facts speak against it .
the weather is one of the main reasons for germany 's economic slowdown .
whether it had to with climate change or not , the fact is that the last winter practically did n't materialize .
add to it the fact that tax benefits for the construction sector were phased out .
both those factors led to the fact that construction sites early this year were n't closed , as is usually the case , but rather that the economy grew in the first quarter by 1.5 percent - something it has n't done in 12 years .
this surge in growth was missing in the second quarter .
that means slowing economic growth is partly due to statistical interpretation .
if you assess the first two quarters of this year individually , a dramatic decline becomes apparent .
if you consider the first half of the year as a whole , you have an economic growth rate of 1.2 percent .
in the face of the negative factors affecting the world economy , it 's quite substantial .
but one thing is clear - if the global economy has to battle with serious problems such as high oil prices , a finance crisis and volatile currency markets , it will drag the german economy into the crisis .
that 's because the german economy , like no other economic power , is reliant on exports which make up almost half of germany 's economic performance .
a decade ago , that share was only 27 percent .
the current economic downturn looks worse than it actually is .
it wo n't change the fact that germany 's economy will grow in the current year .
german economics minister michael glos is sticking to growth predictions of 1.7 percent .
but that 's one percentage point less than last year ; for the coming year , experts predict a further worsening of the economy .
it 's not the decline in the second quarter but rather the downward trend that 's sparked concerns because it 's coupled with a strong price rise that hampers the much needed lowering of interest rates by the european central bank .
developments on the labor market are still positive but a lasting economic slowdown will soon change that .
the ranks of unemployed will rise again .
there 's a reason for the bleak outlook - the party is over .
for many , it 's associated with a hangover - just like in real life .

dw 's karl zawadzky says the country has to face the fact the party is over . one thing is clear - germany is past its peak when it comes to economic performance .
the party - surging exports and strong domestic investments - is over .
still , there 's some tangible relief at the reversal in economic fortunes because things could have been much worse .
the german economy shrank by 0.5 percent in the second quarter of this year - that 's bad but it 's not going to really cripple the country 's economy .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : karl zawadzky it would be highly surprising if all the big economic powers could simply shrug off the negative factors that have in recent times plunged the global economy into crisis .
in the us , an absolutely superficially-financed housing bubble has burst , triggering a finance and banking crisis in america and europe .
the real estate boom is also over in britain and spain , two large european union nations .
the dollar has taken a battering while the rise of the euro has thrown a dampener on european exports .
oil prices have climbed to levels unimaginable until recently and food prices have skyrocketed .
finally , inflation in the euro zone has soared out of control , prompting the european central bank to raise interest rates .
all this has put a brake on germany 's economic growth rate .
within a short period , both corporate and consumer sentiment has plummeted .
talk of a long-lasting economic upturn has been replaced by dire predictions of stagnation or even recession coupled with a lasting price rise .
but the facts speak against it .
the weather is one of the main reasons for germany 's economic slowdown .
whether it had to with climate change or not , the fact is that the last winter practically did n't materialize .
add to it the fact that tax benefits for the construction sector were phased out .
both those factors led to the fact that construction sites early this year were n't closed , as is usually the case , but rather that the economy grew in the first quarter by 1.5 percent - something it has n't done in 12 years .
this surge in growth was missing in the second quarter .
that means slowing economic growth is partly due to statistical interpretation .
if you assess the first two quarters of this year individually , a dramatic decline becomes apparent .
if you consider the first half of the year as a whole , you have an economic growth rate of 1.2 percent .
in the face of the negative factors affecting the world economy , it 's quite substantial .
but one thing is clear - if the global economy has to battle with serious problems such as high oil prices , a finance crisis and volatile currency markets , it will drag the german economy into the crisis .
that 's because the german economy , like no other economic power , is reliant on exports which make up almost half of germany 's economic performance .
a decade ago , that share was only 27 percent .
the current economic downturn looks worse than it actually is .
it wo n't change the fact that germany 's economy will grow in the current year .
german economics minister michael glos is sticking to growth predictions of 1.7 percent .
but that 's one percentage point less than last year ; for the coming year , experts predict a further worsening of the economy .
it 's not the decline in the second quarter but rather the downward trend that 's sparked concerns because it 's coupled with a strong price rise that hampers the much needed lowering of interest rates by the european central bank .
developments on the labor market are still positive but a lasting economic slowdown will soon change that .
the ranks of unemployed will rise again .
there 's a reason for the bleak outlook - the party is over .
for many , it 's associated with a hangover - just like in real life .

as german chancellor angela merkel heads to georgia on sunday , aug .
17 , to continue mediating in the ongoing conflict with russia , western experts mull the chances of escalations elsewhere in the former soviet sphere . when western powers in february gave their blessing to the independence of the serbian province of kosovo , opponents warned it would trigger separatist violence across europe .
now , with the fires of secessionist war still smoking in georgia and its breakaway provinces of abkhazia and south ossetia , the west is wondering nervously whether other conflicts might be about to break out elsewhere in the former ussr .
independence for the georgian provinces " would undoubtedly give impetus to independence ambitions " in the breakaway moldovan region of transnistria , said colonel christopher langton , security analyst at the institute for international strategic studies in london .
debate still rages as to the exact role played by russia in the georgian war , with tbilisi accusing moscow of aggression and moscow insisting that it only intervened to protect civilian lives .
but western analysts agree that before the conflict , russia was the breakaway regions ' main supporter - especially once georgia began to aim for nato membership following its 2003 " rose revolution . "
and they say that russia 's intervention is a warning for ukraine and moldova - two former-soviet states who are also edging towards the west , but who have russian military forces on their territory .
the conflict is " a stern warning to ukraine that what can happen if it tries to move closer to nato is the division of the country , " said security expert dusan reljic of the swp institute for international and security affairs in berlin .
it is also " the acceleration of russia 's ongoing effort to increase its influence " around its borders , langton said .
moscow has both a strong military presence and broad-based popular support in transnistria and ukraine 's crimean peninsula , which russia ceded to its " socialist brother " in 1954 .
ukraine monitoring its own separatist province bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bush and nato have plans for yushchenko 's ukraine and analysts now say that , given nato 's refusal to rule out further eastern expansions , moscow might feel that the best way to stall that process would be to promote secession in the two areas .
" when there are russian populations linked to russia , then those territories could break away ...
so if ukraine insists on joining nato , part of its territory could split away , " reljic said .
but is it really likely that russia would call for full independence for the crimea or transnistria , given the international storm which its actions in georgia have already provoked ? observers say that the option can not be ruled out in the long term , given that one of russia 's prime foreign-policy goals is to rebuild its own influence in europe at nato 's expense .
russian leaders have already said that they see nato 's offer of eventual membership for georgia and ukraine as a direct threat .
and that gives the crimea and transnistria immense strategic significance as two russian-dominated areas on ukraine 's fringe .
ukraine 's desire for nato membership " makes transnistria strategically important for russia , " while any increase in tension between moscow and kiev will " resonate in the crimea , " langton said .
in the short term , such fears are unlikely to materialize .
russia could assert power to scupper nato plans bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : georgia 's pounding puts its nato hopes in jeopardy russia 's hands are full dealing with the aftermath of the georgian war , and some nato members say the conflict proves that georgia is in any case not ready for membership .
but with key nato members , especially the us , pressing for ukraine and georgia to join , there is a danger that russia may end up feeling it has no choice but to weaken its neighbors before it is too late .
" in the past , the answer would have been no , this is not a proxy conflict between great powers .
but increasingly the answer is becoming yes , " langton said . dpa news agency -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

dw 's karl zawadzky says the country has to face the fact the party is over . one thing is clear - germany is past its peak when it comes to economic performance .
the party - surging exports and strong domestic investments - is over .
still , there 's some tangible relief at the reversal in economic fortunes because things could have been much worse .
the german economy shrank by 0.5 percent in the second quarter of this year - that 's bad but it 's not going to really cripple the country 's economy .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : karl zawadzky it would be highly surprising if all the big economic powers could simply shrug off the negative factors that have in recent times plunged the global economy into crisis .
in the us , an absolutely superficially-financed housing bubble has burst , triggering a finance and banking crisis in america and europe .
the real estate boom is also over in britain and spain , two large european union nations .
the dollar has taken a battering while the rise of the euro has thrown a dampener on european exports .
oil prices have climbed to levels unimaginable until recently and food prices have skyrocketed .
finally , inflation in the euro zone has soared out of control , prompting the european central bank to raise interest rates .
all this has put a brake on germany 's economic growth rate .
within a short period , both corporate and consumer sentiment has plummeted .
talk of a long-lasting economic upturn has been replaced by dire predictions of stagnation or even recession coupled with a lasting price rise .
but the facts speak against it .
the weather is one of the main reasons for germany 's economic slowdown .
whether it had to with climate change or not , the fact is that the last winter practically did n't materialize .
add to it the fact that tax benefits for the construction sector were phased out .
both those factors led to the fact that construction sites early this year were n't closed , as is usually the case , but rather that the economy grew in the first quarter by 1.5 percent - something it has n't done in 12 years .
this surge in growth was missing in the second quarter .
that means slowing economic growth is partly due to statistical interpretation .
if you assess the first two quarters of this year individually , a dramatic decline becomes apparent .
if you consider the first half of the year as a whole , you have an economic growth rate of 1.2 percent .
in the face of the negative factors affecting the world economy , it 's quite substantial .
but one thing is clear - if the global economy has to battle with serious problems such as high oil prices , a finance crisis and volatile currency markets , it will drag the german economy into the crisis .
that 's because the german economy , like no other economic power , is reliant on exports which make up almost half of germany 's economic performance .
a decade ago , that share was only 27 percent .
the current economic downturn looks worse than it actually is .
it wo n't change the fact that germany 's economy will grow in the current year .
german economics minister michael glos is sticking to growth predictions of 1.7 percent .
but that 's one percentage point less than last year ; for the coming year , experts predict a further worsening of the economy .
it 's not the decline in the second quarter but rather the downward trend that 's sparked concerns because it 's coupled with a strong price rise that hampers the much needed lowering of interest rates by the european central bank .
developments on the labor market are still positive but a lasting economic slowdown will soon change that .
the ranks of unemployed will rise again .
there 's a reason for the bleak outlook - the party is over .
for many , it 's associated with a hangover - just like in real life .

as german chancellor angela merkel heads to georgia on sunday , aug .
17 , to continue mediating in the ongoing conflict with russia , western experts mull the chances of escalations elsewhere in the former soviet sphere . when western powers in february gave their blessing to the independence of the serbian province of kosovo , opponents warned it would trigger separatist violence across europe .
now , with the fires of secessionist war still smoking in georgia and its breakaway provinces of abkhazia and south ossetia , the west is wondering nervously whether other conflicts might be about to break out elsewhere in the former ussr .
independence for the georgian provinces " would undoubtedly give impetus to independence ambitions " in the breakaway moldovan region of transnistria , said colonel christopher langton , security analyst at the institute for international strategic studies in london .
debate still rages as to the exact role played by russia in the georgian war , with tbilisi accusing moscow of aggression and moscow insisting that it only intervened to protect civilian lives .
but western analysts agree that before the conflict , russia was the breakaway regions ' main supporter - especially once georgia began to aim for nato membership following its 2003 " rose revolution . "
and they say that russia 's intervention is a warning for ukraine and moldova - two former-soviet states who are also edging towards the west , but who have russian military forces on their territory .
the conflict is " a stern warning to ukraine that what can happen if it tries to move closer to nato is the division of the country , " said security expert dusan reljic of the swp institute for international and security affairs in berlin .
it is also " the acceleration of russia 's ongoing effort to increase its influence " around its borders , langton said .
moscow has both a strong military presence and broad-based popular support in transnistria and ukraine 's crimean peninsula , which russia ceded to its " socialist brother " in 1954 .
ukraine monitoring its own separatist province bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bush and nato have plans for yushchenko 's ukraine and analysts now say that , given nato 's refusal to rule out further eastern expansions , moscow might feel that the best way to stall that process would be to promote secession in the two areas .
" when there are russian populations linked to russia , then those territories could break away ...
so if ukraine insists on joining nato , part of its territory could split away , " reljic said .
but is it really likely that russia would call for full independence for the crimea or transnistria , given the international storm which its actions in georgia have already provoked ? observers say that the option can not be ruled out in the long term , given that one of russia 's prime foreign-policy goals is to rebuild its own influence in europe at nato 's expense .
russian leaders have already said that they see nato 's offer of eventual membership for georgia and ukraine as a direct threat .
and that gives the crimea and transnistria immense strategic significance as two russian-dominated areas on ukraine 's fringe .
ukraine 's desire for nato membership " makes transnistria strategically important for russia , " while any increase in tension between moscow and kiev will " resonate in the crimea , " langton said .
in the short term , such fears are unlikely to materialize .
russia could assert power to scupper nato plans bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : georgia 's pounding puts its nato hopes in jeopardy russia 's hands are full dealing with the aftermath of the georgian war , and some nato members say the conflict proves that georgia is in any case not ready for membership .
but with key nato members , especially the us , pressing for ukraine and georgia to join , there is a danger that russia may end up feeling it has no choice but to weaken its neighbors before it is too late .
" in the past , the answer would have been no , this is not a proxy conflict between great powers .
but increasingly the answer is becoming yes , " langton said . dpa news agency -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

ukraine monitoring its own separatist province bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bush and nato have plans for yushchenko 's ukraine and analysts now say that , given nato 's refusal to rule out further eastern expansions , moscow might feel that the best way to stall that process would be to promote secession in the two areas .
" when there are russian populations linked to russia , then those territories could break away ...
so if ukraine insists on joining nato , part of its territory could split away , " reljic said .
but is it really likely that russia would call for full independence for the crimea or transnistria , given the international storm which its actions in georgia have already provoked ? observers say that the option can not be ruled out in the long term , given that one of russia 's prime foreign-policy goals is to rebuild its own influence in europe at nato 's expense .
russian leaders have already said that they see nato 's offer of eventual membership for georgia and ukraine as a direct threat .
and that gives the crimea and transnistria immense strategic significance as two russian-dominated areas on ukraine 's fringe .
ukraine 's desire for nato membership " makes transnistria strategically important for russia , " while any increase in tension between moscow and kiev will " resonate in the crimea , " langton said .
in the short term , such fears are unlikely to materialize .
russia could assert power to scupper nato plans bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : georgia 's pounding puts its nato hopes in jeopardy russia 's hands are full dealing with the aftermath of the georgian war , and some nato members say the conflict proves that georgia is in any case not ready for membership .
but with key nato members , especially the us , pressing for ukraine and georgia to join , there is a danger that russia may end up feeling it has no choice but to weaken its neighbors before it is too late .
" in the past , the answer would have been no , this is not a proxy conflict between great powers .
but increasingly the answer is becoming yes , " langton said . dpa news agency -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the german federal labor office has now started offering training courses for interested long-term unemployed , who receive some 160 hours of instruction to be able to work with patients . they have to have been unemployed for at least 12 months and show an interest in working in a nursing home , according to a report in german daily sueddeutsche zeitung .
after the training , they will be able to work as nursing care assistants , performing tasks such as reading to patients , talking with them or running errands for them . a brazen proposal ? geriatric care experts , who said that care assistants need to have at least 900 hours of training , were outraged by the proposal . " to equate dementia with handicrafts , reading to people and walking them is brazen , " helmut wallrafen-dreisow , a member of the german board for geriatric care .
" the health care companies want to get things done cheap , but nursing homes are meant to fulfill highest standards .
that does n't work . " dirk niebel , a leading member of germany 's opposition free-market liberal free democratic party called the move " labor-market policy charlatanism . "
germany 's unemployment figures have risen slightly after several years of steady decline . " the fact that someone 's unemployed alone is no qualification for a job in the health care sector , " he told mass tabloid bild am sonntag . better than nothing ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ulla schmidt defends the plan but german health minister ulla schmidt defended the project .
she said that many people with dementia are currently cared for by volunteers , who have received no training whatsoever . she also said that many of those interested in participating in the trainings already had experience working in the health care sector . " for many unemployed people , a job in a nursing home is a chance to rejoin the old line of work , " schmidt told dpa news agency .
" that 's especially true for women . " experts doubt , however , that labor office officials will find enough people to fill the positions .
according to sueddeutsche zeitung , 10,157 vacant positions are currently registered with the office nationwide - despite the fact that some 30,000 health care workers are currently registered as unemployed . dw staff -lrb- win -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

as german chancellor angela merkel heads to georgia on sunday , aug .
17 , to continue mediating in the ongoing conflict with russia , western experts mull the chances of escalations elsewhere in the former soviet sphere . when western powers in february gave their blessing to the independence of the serbian province of kosovo , opponents warned it would trigger separatist violence across europe .
now , with the fires of secessionist war still smoking in georgia and its breakaway provinces of abkhazia and south ossetia , the west is wondering nervously whether other conflicts might be about to break out elsewhere in the former ussr .
independence for the georgian provinces " would undoubtedly give impetus to independence ambitions " in the breakaway moldovan region of transnistria , said colonel christopher langton , security analyst at the institute for international strategic studies in london .
debate still rages as to the exact role played by russia in the georgian war , with tbilisi accusing moscow of aggression and moscow insisting that it only intervened to protect civilian lives .
but western analysts agree that before the conflict , russia was the breakaway regions ' main supporter - especially once georgia began to aim for nato membership following its 2003 " rose revolution . "
and they say that russia 's intervention is a warning for ukraine and moldova - two former-soviet states who are also edging towards the west , but who have russian military forces on their territory .
the conflict is " a stern warning to ukraine that what can happen if it tries to move closer to nato is the division of the country , " said security expert dusan reljic of the swp institute for international and security affairs in berlin .
it is also " the acceleration of russia 's ongoing effort to increase its influence " around its borders , langton said .
moscow has both a strong military presence and broad-based popular support in transnistria and ukraine 's crimean peninsula , which russia ceded to its " socialist brother " in 1954 .
ukraine monitoring its own separatist province bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bush and nato have plans for yushchenko 's ukraine and analysts now say that , given nato 's refusal to rule out further eastern expansions , moscow might feel that the best way to stall that process would be to promote secession in the two areas .
" when there are russian populations linked to russia , then those territories could break away ...
so if ukraine insists on joining nato , part of its territory could split away , " reljic said .
but is it really likely that russia would call for full independence for the crimea or transnistria , given the international storm which its actions in georgia have already provoked ? observers say that the option can not be ruled out in the long term , given that one of russia 's prime foreign-policy goals is to rebuild its own influence in europe at nato 's expense .
russian leaders have already said that they see nato 's offer of eventual membership for georgia and ukraine as a direct threat .
and that gives the crimea and transnistria immense strategic significance as two russian-dominated areas on ukraine 's fringe .
ukraine 's desire for nato membership " makes transnistria strategically important for russia , " while any increase in tension between moscow and kiev will " resonate in the crimea , " langton said .
in the short term , such fears are unlikely to materialize .
russia could assert power to scupper nato plans bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : georgia 's pounding puts its nato hopes in jeopardy russia 's hands are full dealing with the aftermath of the georgian war , and some nato members say the conflict proves that georgia is in any case not ready for membership .
but with key nato members , especially the us , pressing for ukraine and georgia to join , there is a danger that russia may end up feeling it has no choice but to weaken its neighbors before it is too late .
" in the past , the answer would have been no , this is not a proxy conflict between great powers .
but increasingly the answer is becoming yes , " langton said . dpa news agency -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" georgia will become a member of nato if it wants to - and it does want to , " merkel said before talks with president mikheil saakashvili in tbilisi . it was one of the strongest statements yet of support for georgia 's nato membership bid which is fiercely opposed by russia .
the statement signals a change in germany 's position towards georgian nato membership .
earlier this year , germany led european resistance to plans , pushed by the us , to put georgia on the track to nato membership . later at a joint news conference with saakashvili , merkel said that though georgia was on a clear path to membership in nato she stood by her decision at a summit in april not to grant tbilisi a " membership action plan " for joining the alliance . at the last nato summit in bucharest in april , leaders agreed that georgia and ukraine should join the north atlantic treaty organization eventually , but neither nation was given candidate status and no timetables were set .
the united states is strongly in favour of georgia joining nato , but misgivings from france and germany prevented tbilisi being awarded full candidate status in bucharest . medvedev confirms pull-out in a meeting with medvedev in the black sea resort of sochi on friday , merkel had criticized russian actions during the week-long war between russia and georgia over the breakaway region of south ossetia .
she demanded that russia withdraw all its troops from georgia 's core territory . the georgian government says rebel abkhaz forces with the support of russian troops are occupying 13 georgian villages , effectively pushing the border of abkhazia westwards into georgia proper . medvedev said sunday that russian regular forces would start their pullout from georgia on monday , the kremlin said .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : medvedev has confirmed russia will begin withdrawing troops from georgia " from tomorrow , russia will begin withdrawing its military forces that are supporting russian peacekeepers , " medvedev told french president nicolas sarkozy in a telephone conversation , the kremlin said in a statement . speaking at a sunday press conference in tbilisi , merkel said that despite medvedev 's commitment " according to the information i have available to me this -lrb- russian withdrawal -rrb- has not yet begun . "
merkel : georgia 's integrity must be respected merkel also repeated that germany 's position was that georgia 's territorial integrity was beyond question , and that its borders should be inviolate . in her meeting with medvedev , merkel also stressed that germany 's position was that georgia 's territorial integrity was beyond question and that saakashvili was a democratically elected president . government sources said ahead of her departure that she intended to push for " a complete cessation of hostilities . " " the ceasefire must be verifiable and lasting , " they said . bildunterschrift : the map shows where russian troops blew up a georgian railroad bridge near the capital tbilisi georgian media hald back from predictions of what effect , if any , merkel 's visit would have on russian troops currently occupying georgian territory . rustaveli 2 television described merkel 's presence in georgia as " part of an international effort to support georgia . " west divided on how to deal with russia german foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier warned on sunday against any knee-jerk reaction to the caucasus conflict in relations with russia .
" i do not advise ... any knee-jerk reaction such as suspending talks on a partnership and cooperation agreement -lrb- with the european union -rrb- .

french president nicolas sarkozy , whose country holds the rotating eu presidency until the end of the year , warned on sunday that russian relations with the eu would be seriously damaged if moscow failed to fully implement the peace deal it signed with georgia .
in a statement , sarkozy told medvedev of the " serious consequences that a failure to quickly and fully implement the deal would have on relations between russia and the european union . "

earlier this year , germany led european resistance to plans , pushed by the us , to put georgia on the track to nato membership . later at a joint news conference with saakashvili , merkel said that though georgia was on a clear path to membership in nato she stood by her decision at a summit in april not to grant tbilisi a " membership action plan " for joining the alliance . at the last nato summit in bucharest in april , leaders agreed that georgia and ukraine should join the north atlantic treaty organization eventually , but neither nation was given candidate status and no timetables were set .
the united states is strongly in favour of georgia joining nato , but misgivings from france and germany prevented tbilisi being awarded full candidate status in bucharest . medvedev confirms pull-out in a meeting with medvedev in the black sea resort of sochi on friday , merkel had criticized russian actions during the week-long war between russia and georgia over the breakaway region of south ossetia .
she demanded that russia withdraw all its troops from georgia 's core territory . the georgian government says rebel abkhaz forces with the support of russian troops are occupying 13 georgian villages , effectively pushing the border of abkhazia westwards into georgia proper . medvedev said sunday that russian regular forces would start their pullout from georgia on monday , the kremlin said .

"
merkel : georgia 's integrity must be respected merkel also repeated that germany 's position was that georgia 's territorial integrity was beyond question , and that its borders should be inviolate . in her meeting with medvedev , merkel also stressed that germany 's position was that georgia 's territorial integrity was beyond question and that saakashvili was a democratically elected president . government sources said ahead of her departure that she intended to push for " a complete cessation of hostilities .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de in focus : dossier : getting the hang of the eu despite expansion , europe still ca n't define " european " european union makes a meal of regional treats could mutual ridicule be a sign of successful eu integration ?
will the real heart of europe please stand up ? european union -pipe- 17.08.2008 the hitch-hiker 's guide to understanding eu jargon großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the irish had nothing against the city but were vehemently against the treaty the problem with eu jargon is that you need both a political dictionary and a map to understand it .
here is a brief list of the eu 's more obscure place-names and a explanation of the processes they refer to . it sometimes seems that half of the eu 's main policies were named after the cities in which they were created .
the problem is that the nicknames almost never come with footnotes , leaving the unsuspecting visitor drowning in a sea of place-names .
barcelona is best known in the eu as the place where european , north african and middle eastern leaders met in november 1995 to try and improve their often-strained relationship .
the result was the " barcelona process , " by which the eu tried to boost trade and political ties with its mediterranean neighbors while urging them to do more for human rights and regional peace .
the process seldom made headlines until early 2007 , when french president nicolas sarkozy proposed scrapping it and creating a much more sweeping " mediterranean union " modeled on the eu .
eu members without a mediterranean coastline blocked the idea , but allowed sarkozy to launch on july 13 a watered-down version catchily titled the " barcelona process : union for the mediterranean . "
copenhagen : denmark 's capital has become eu code for the set of standards which countries have to meet if they want to join the bloc .
the " copenhagen criteria , " adopted in june 1993 , say that a state should be able to preserve democracy and human rights , have a market economy and accept the eu 's " obligations and intent , " such as peace .
over the last year , the criteria have most often been mentioned in the context of eu hopefuls macedonia , serbia and turkey , all of whom have been accused by critics of falling short in key areas .
dublin : famous for its literary giants , its dark beer and its distressing tendency to reject eu treaties , " dublin , " in eu circles , is a term used when talking about refugees .
the " dublin convention , " which came into force in 1997 , is aimed at streamlining the way eu member states deal with refugees and , in particular , deciding where each applicant should be dealt with .
with the current french presidency of the bloc pushing for an eu " pact " on migration , dublin is usually referred to when member states want to accuse one another of not doing enough for refugees .
the hague is famous as the home of various international courts , all of which tend to be nicknamed " the hague tribunal . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the hague hosts the international criminal court the one the eu refers to most often at present is the international criminal tribunal for the former yugoslavia -lrb- icty -rrb- , set up by the un in 1993 to deal with the atrocities committed in the separatist balkan wars of the 1990s .
while not an eu body , icty regularly features in eu meetings because the dutch government has vetoed any kind of eu rapprochement with serbia until icty 's chief prosecutor rules that the belgrade government is cooperating fully with his organization .
cities lend their name to treaties when european union leaders refer to the " lisbon agenda " or the " manchester declaration , " this is what they mean : lisbon : the lisbon agenda , agreed in march 2000 , is a plan aimed at making the eu the world 's most competitive economy by 2010 .
the lisbon treaty , signed in december 2007 , is an agreement between the bloc 's 27 member states aimed at making it easier to take eu-wide decisions and giving the union a higher profile abroad .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the treaty has put lisbon on the eu map with the eu lagging behind key rivals such as the united states and japan in terms of innovation , the word " lisbon " has in the past usually been used to describe the gap between the eu 's targets and its results .
however , since irish voters rejected the lisbon treaty in a referendum on june 12 , current headlines referring to " lisbon " usually refer to the treaty .
maastricht : the maastricht treaty , signed in 1992 , created the eu out of its forerunner , the european economic community , and set up the legal process that created the euro .
maastricht criteria are the strict rules on inflation and government spending that countries have to meet in order to join the euro .
the criteria last made the headlines in july , when eu finance ministers invited slovakia to become the euro club 's 16th member .
manchester : britain 's soccer giant is known in the eu for the political call , made by finance ministers in september 2005 , not to respond to fuel-price rises by cutting taxes .
barely mentioned until the recent oil-price surge , the manchester declaration has now come back to haunt ministers , as they urge one another in increasingly nervous tones not to break ranks . nice : the nice treaty , signed by eu leaders in 2001 , updated the union 's internal workings so the bloc could absorb 12 new member states between 2004 and 2007 .
its main remit was to set the number of votes in eu councils each member state should have , from 29 in germany to three in malta .
when eu leaders were negotiating the lisbon treaty in 2007 , poland , which stood to lose some of its voting power under the new rules , demanded that the nice voting weights remain unchanged , going into negotiations with the slogan " nice or death ! "
schengen : the schengen convention , which came into force in 1995 , abolished border barriers between belgium , france , germany , greece , italy , luxembourg , the netherlands , portugal and spain .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : schengen has gained international fame through the eu the agreement created the schengen zone , which now includes all the eu 's current members except britain , ireland , bulgaria and romania .
non-eu members iceland and norway are also in the zone .
schengen most recently hit the headlines in late 2007 , when it expanded to take in nine countries which joined the eu in 2004 .
tampere : the finnish town of tampere is best known in eu circles for its links with international law-enforcement .
the tampere process , launched in 1999 , is the series of talks which eu member states are holding to discuss how they can improve cooperation on sensitive issues of justice and internal affairs .
the process was given a renewed impulse at a summit in the hague in 2004 - whereupon some officials renamed it the " hague process . "
however , some diplomats say that the process will receive a new impulse when sweden takes over the eu 's rotating presidency in the second half of 2009 .
they therefore call it the " stockholm process . " dpa news agency -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

will the real heart of europe please stand up ? european union -pipe- 17.08.2008 the hitch-hiker 's guide to understanding eu jargon großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the irish had nothing against the city but were vehemently against the treaty the problem with eu jargon is that you need both a political dictionary and a map to understand it .
here is a brief list of the eu 's more obscure place-names and a explanation of the processes they refer to . it sometimes seems that half of the eu 's main policies were named after the cities in which they were created .
the problem is that the nicknames almost never come with footnotes , leaving the unsuspecting visitor drowning in a sea of place-names .
barcelona is best known in the eu as the place where european , north african and middle eastern leaders met in november 1995 to try and improve their often-strained relationship .
the result was the " barcelona process , " by which the eu tried to boost trade and political ties with its mediterranean neighbors while urging them to do more for human rights and regional peace .
the process seldom made headlines until early 2007 , when french president nicolas sarkozy proposed scrapping it and creating a much more sweeping " mediterranean union " modeled on the eu .
eu members without a mediterranean coastline blocked the idea , but allowed sarkozy to launch on july 13 a watered-down version catchily titled the " barcelona process : union for the mediterranean . "
copenhagen : denmark 's capital has become eu code for the set of standards which countries have to meet if they want to join the bloc .
the " copenhagen criteria , " adopted in june 1993 , say that a state should be able to preserve democracy and human rights , have a market economy and accept the eu 's " obligations and intent , " such as peace .
over the last year , the criteria have most often been mentioned in the context of eu hopefuls macedonia , serbia and turkey , all of whom have been accused by critics of falling short in key areas .
dublin : famous for its literary giants , its dark beer and its distressing tendency to reject eu treaties , " dublin , " in eu circles , is a term used when talking about refugees .
the " dublin convention , " which came into force in 1997 , is aimed at streamlining the way eu member states deal with refugees and , in particular , deciding where each applicant should be dealt with .
with the current french presidency of the bloc pushing for an eu " pact " on migration , dublin is usually referred to when member states want to accuse one another of not doing enough for refugees .
the hague is famous as the home of various international courts , all of which tend to be nicknamed " the hague tribunal . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the hague hosts the international criminal court the one the eu refers to most often at present is the international criminal tribunal for the former yugoslavia -lrb- icty -rrb- , set up by the un in 1993 to deal with the atrocities committed in the separatist balkan wars of the 1990s .
while not an eu body , icty regularly features in eu meetings because the dutch government has vetoed any kind of eu rapprochement with serbia until icty 's chief prosecutor rules that the belgrade government is cooperating fully with his organization .
cities lend their name to treaties when european union leaders refer to the " lisbon agenda " or the " manchester declaration , " this is what they mean : lisbon : the lisbon agenda , agreed in march 2000 , is a plan aimed at making the eu the world 's most competitive economy by 2010 .
the lisbon treaty , signed in december 2007 , is an agreement between the bloc 's 27 member states aimed at making it easier to take eu-wide decisions and giving the union a higher profile abroad .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the treaty has put lisbon on the eu map with the eu lagging behind key rivals such as the united states and japan in terms of innovation , the word " lisbon " has in the past usually been used to describe the gap between the eu 's targets and its results .
however , since irish voters rejected the lisbon treaty in a referendum on june 12 , current headlines referring to " lisbon " usually refer to the treaty .
maastricht : the maastricht treaty , signed in 1992 , created the eu out of its forerunner , the european economic community , and set up the legal process that created the euro .
maastricht criteria are the strict rules on inflation and government spending that countries have to meet in order to join the euro .
the criteria last made the headlines in july , when eu finance ministers invited slovakia to become the euro club 's 16th member .
manchester : britain 's soccer giant is known in the eu for the political call , made by finance ministers in september 2005 , not to respond to fuel-price rises by cutting taxes .
barely mentioned until the recent oil-price surge , the manchester declaration has now come back to haunt ministers , as they urge one another in increasingly nervous tones not to break ranks . nice : the nice treaty , signed by eu leaders in 2001 , updated the union 's internal workings so the bloc could absorb 12 new member states between 2004 and 2007 .
its main remit was to set the number of votes in eu councils each member state should have , from 29 in germany to three in malta .
when eu leaders were negotiating the lisbon treaty in 2007 , poland , which stood to lose some of its voting power under the new rules , demanded that the nice voting weights remain unchanged , going into negotiations with the slogan " nice or death ! "
schengen : the schengen convention , which came into force in 1995 , abolished border barriers between belgium , france , germany , greece , italy , luxembourg , the netherlands , portugal and spain .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : schengen has gained international fame through the eu the agreement created the schengen zone , which now includes all the eu 's current members except britain , ireland , bulgaria and romania .
non-eu members iceland and norway are also in the zone .
schengen most recently hit the headlines in late 2007 , when it expanded to take in nine countries which joined the eu in 2004 .
tampere : the finnish town of tampere is best known in eu circles for its links with international law-enforcement .
the tampere process , launched in 1999 , is the series of talks which eu member states are holding to discuss how they can improve cooperation on sensitive issues of justice and internal affairs .
the process was given a renewed impulse at a summit in the hague in 2004 - whereupon some officials renamed it the " hague process . "
however , some diplomats say that the process will receive a new impulse when sweden takes over the eu 's rotating presidency in the second half of 2009 .
they therefore call it the " stockholm process . " dpa news agency -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de in focus : dossier : getting the hang of the eu despite expansion , europe still ca n't define " european " european union makes a meal of regional treats could mutual ridicule be a sign of successful eu integration ?
will the real heart of europe please stand up ? european union -pipe- 17.08.2008 the hitch-hiker 's guide to understanding eu jargon großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the irish had nothing against the city but were vehemently against the treaty the problem with eu jargon is that you need both a political dictionary and a map to understand it .
here is a brief list of the eu 's more obscure place-names and a explanation of the processes they refer to . it sometimes seems that half of the eu 's main policies were named after the cities in which they were created .
the problem is that the nicknames almost never come with footnotes , leaving the unsuspecting visitor drowning in a sea of place-names .
barcelona is best known in the eu as the place where european , north african and middle eastern leaders met in november 1995 to try and improve their often-strained relationship .
the result was the " barcelona process , " by which the eu tried to boost trade and political ties with its mediterranean neighbors while urging them to do more for human rights and regional peace .
the process seldom made headlines until early 2007 , when french president nicolas sarkozy proposed scrapping it and creating a much more sweeping " mediterranean union " modeled on the eu .
eu members without a mediterranean coastline blocked the idea , but allowed sarkozy to launch on july 13 a watered-down version catchily titled the " barcelona process : union for the mediterranean . "
copenhagen : denmark 's capital has become eu code for the set of standards which countries have to meet if they want to join the bloc .
the " copenhagen criteria , " adopted in june 1993 , say that a state should be able to preserve democracy and human rights , have a market economy and accept the eu 's " obligations and intent , " such as peace .
over the last year , the criteria have most often been mentioned in the context of eu hopefuls macedonia , serbia and turkey , all of whom have been accused by critics of falling short in key areas .
dublin : famous for its literary giants , its dark beer and its distressing tendency to reject eu treaties , " dublin , " in eu circles , is a term used when talking about refugees .
the " dublin convention , " which came into force in 1997 , is aimed at streamlining the way eu member states deal with refugees and , in particular , deciding where each applicant should be dealt with .
with the current french presidency of the bloc pushing for an eu " pact " on migration , dublin is usually referred to when member states want to accuse one another of not doing enough for refugees .
the hague is famous as the home of various international courts , all of which tend to be nicknamed " the hague tribunal . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the hague hosts the international criminal court the one the eu refers to most often at present is the international criminal tribunal for the former yugoslavia -lrb- icty -rrb- , set up by the un in 1993 to deal with the atrocities committed in the separatist balkan wars of the 1990s .
while not an eu body , icty regularly features in eu meetings because the dutch government has vetoed any kind of eu rapprochement with serbia until icty 's chief prosecutor rules that the belgrade government is cooperating fully with his organization .
cities lend their name to treaties when european union leaders refer to the " lisbon agenda " or the " manchester declaration , " this is what they mean : lisbon : the lisbon agenda , agreed in march 2000 , is a plan aimed at making the eu the world 's most competitive economy by 2010 .
the lisbon treaty , signed in december 2007 , is an agreement between the bloc 's 27 member states aimed at making it easier to take eu-wide decisions and giving the union a higher profile abroad .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the treaty has put lisbon on the eu map with the eu lagging behind key rivals such as the united states and japan in terms of innovation , the word " lisbon " has in the past usually been used to describe the gap between the eu 's targets and its results .
however , since irish voters rejected the lisbon treaty in a referendum on june 12 , current headlines referring to " lisbon " usually refer to the treaty .
maastricht : the maastricht treaty , signed in 1992 , created the eu out of its forerunner , the european economic community , and set up the legal process that created the euro .
maastricht criteria are the strict rules on inflation and government spending that countries have to meet in order to join the euro .
the criteria last made the headlines in july , when eu finance ministers invited slovakia to become the euro club 's 16th member .
manchester : britain 's soccer giant is known in the eu for the political call , made by finance ministers in september 2005 , not to respond to fuel-price rises by cutting taxes .
barely mentioned until the recent oil-price surge , the manchester declaration has now come back to haunt ministers , as they urge one another in increasingly nervous tones not to break ranks . nice : the nice treaty , signed by eu leaders in 2001 , updated the union 's internal workings so the bloc could absorb 12 new member states between 2004 and 2007 .
its main remit was to set the number of votes in eu councils each member state should have , from 29 in germany to three in malta .
when eu leaders were negotiating the lisbon treaty in 2007 , poland , which stood to lose some of its voting power under the new rules , demanded that the nice voting weights remain unchanged , going into negotiations with the slogan " nice or death ! "
schengen : the schengen convention , which came into force in 1995 , abolished border barriers between belgium , france , germany , greece , italy , luxembourg , the netherlands , portugal and spain .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : schengen has gained international fame through the eu the agreement created the schengen zone , which now includes all the eu 's current members except britain , ireland , bulgaria and romania .
non-eu members iceland and norway are also in the zone .
schengen most recently hit the headlines in late 2007 , when it expanded to take in nine countries which joined the eu in 2004 .
tampere : the finnish town of tampere is best known in eu circles for its links with international law-enforcement .
the tampere process , launched in 1999 , is the series of talks which eu member states are holding to discuss how they can improve cooperation on sensitive issues of justice and internal affairs .
the process was given a renewed impulse at a summit in the hague in 2004 - whereupon some officials renamed it the " hague process . "
however , some diplomats say that the process will receive a new impulse when sweden takes over the eu 's rotating presidency in the second half of 2009 .
they therefore call it the " stockholm process . " dpa news agency -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de russia -pipe- 17.08.2008 analysis : after georgia , will there be other separatist hotspots ? großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : will other former soviet states suffer the same fate as georgia and south ossetia ?
as german chancellor angela merkel heads to georgia on sunday , aug .
17 , to continue mediating in the ongoing conflict with russia , western experts mull the chances of escalations elsewhere in the former soviet sphere . when western powers in february gave their blessing to the independence of the serbian province of kosovo , opponents warned it would trigger separatist violence across europe .
now , with the fires of secessionist war still smoking in georgia and its breakaway provinces of abkhazia and south ossetia , the west is wondering nervously whether other conflicts might be about to break out elsewhere in the former ussr .
independence for the georgian provinces " would undoubtedly give impetus to independence ambitions " in the breakaway moldovan region of transnistria , said colonel christopher langton , security analyst at the institute for international strategic studies in london .
debate still rages as to the exact role played by russia in the georgian war , with tbilisi accusing moscow of aggression and moscow insisting that it only intervened to protect civilian lives .
but western analysts agree that before the conflict , russia was the breakaway regions ' main supporter - especially once georgia began to aim for nato membership following its 2003 " rose revolution . "
and they say that russia 's intervention is a warning for ukraine and moldova - two former-soviet states who are also edging towards the west , but who have russian military forces on their territory .
the conflict is " a stern warning to ukraine that what can happen if it tries to move closer to nato is the division of the country , " said security expert dusan reljic of the swp institute for international and security affairs in berlin .
it is also " the acceleration of russia 's ongoing effort to increase its influence " around its borders , langton said .
moscow has both a strong military presence and broad-based popular support in transnistria and ukraine 's crimean peninsula , which russia ceded to its " socialist brother " in 1954 .
ukraine monitoring its own separatist province bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bush and nato have plans for yushchenko 's ukraine and analysts now say that , given nato 's refusal to rule out further eastern expansions , moscow might feel that the best way to stall that process would be to promote secession in the two areas .
" when there are russian populations linked to russia , then those territories could break away ...
so if ukraine insists on joining nato , part of its territory could split away , " reljic said .
but is it really likely that russia would call for full independence for the crimea or transnistria , given the international storm which its actions in georgia have already provoked ? observers say that the option can not be ruled out in the long term , given that one of russia 's prime foreign-policy goals is to rebuild its own influence in europe at nato 's expense .
russian leaders have already said that they see nato 's offer of eventual membership for georgia and ukraine as a direct threat .
and that gives the crimea and transnistria immense strategic significance as two russian-dominated areas on ukraine 's fringe .
ukraine 's desire for nato membership " makes transnistria strategically important for russia , " while any increase in tension between moscow and kiev will " resonate in the crimea , " langton said .
in the short term , such fears are unlikely to materialize .
russia could assert power to scupper nato plans bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : georgia 's pounding puts its nato hopes in jeopardy russia 's hands are full dealing with the aftermath of the georgian war , and some nato members say the conflict proves that georgia is in any case not ready for membership .
but with key nato members , especially the us , pressing for ukraine and georgia to join , there is a danger that russia may end up feeling it has no choice but to weaken its neighbors before it is too late .
" in the past , the answer would have been no , this is not a proxy conflict between great powers .
but increasingly the answer is becoming yes , " langton said . dpa news agency -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

dw 's karl zawadzky says the country has to face the fact the party is over . one thing is clear - germany is past its peak when it comes to economic performance .
the party - surging exports and strong domestic investments - is over .
still , there 's some tangible relief at the reversal in economic fortunes because things could have been much worse .
the german economy shrank by 0.5 percent in the second quarter of this year - that 's bad but it 's not going to really cripple the country 's economy .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : karl zawadzky it would be highly surprising if all the big economic powers could simply shrug off the negative factors that have in recent times plunged the global economy into crisis .
in the us , an absolutely superficially-financed housing bubble has burst , triggering a finance and banking crisis in america and europe .
the real estate boom is also over in britain and spain , two large european union nations .
the dollar has taken a battering while the rise of the euro has thrown a dampener on european exports .
oil prices have climbed to levels unimaginable until recently and food prices have skyrocketed .
finally , inflation in the euro zone has soared out of control , prompting the european central bank to raise interest rates .
all this has put a brake on germany 's economic growth rate .
within a short period , both corporate and consumer sentiment has plummeted .
talk of a long-lasting economic upturn has been replaced by dire predictions of stagnation or even recession coupled with a lasting price rise .
but the facts speak against it .
the weather is one of the main reasons for germany 's economic slowdown .
whether it had to with climate change or not , the fact is that the last winter practically did n't materialize .
add to it the fact that tax benefits for the construction sector were phased out .
both those factors led to the fact that construction sites early this year were n't closed , as is usually the case , but rather that the economy grew in the first quarter by 1.5 percent - something it has n't done in 12 years .
this surge in growth was missing in the second quarter .
that means slowing economic growth is partly due to statistical interpretation .
if you assess the first two quarters of this year individually , a dramatic decline becomes apparent .
if you consider the first half of the year as a whole , you have an economic growth rate of 1.2 percent .
in the face of the negative factors affecting the world economy , it 's quite substantial .
but one thing is clear - if the global economy has to battle with serious problems such as high oil prices , a finance crisis and volatile currency markets , it will drag the german economy into the crisis .
that 's because the german economy , like no other economic power , is reliant on exports which make up almost half of germany 's economic performance .
a decade ago , that share was only 27 percent .
the current economic downturn looks worse than it actually is .
it wo n't change the fact that germany 's economy will grow in the current year .
german economics minister michael glos is sticking to growth predictions of 1.7 percent .
but that 's one percentage point less than last year ; for the coming year , experts predict a further worsening of the economy .
it 's not the decline in the second quarter but rather the downward trend that 's sparked concerns because it 's coupled with a strong price rise that hampers the much needed lowering of interest rates by the european central bank .
developments on the labor market are still positive but a lasting economic slowdown will soon change that .
the ranks of unemployed will rise again .
there 's a reason for the bleak outlook - the party is over .
for many , it 's associated with a hangover - just like in real life .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de russia -pipe- 17.08.2008 analysis : after georgia , will there be other separatist hotspots ? großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : will other former soviet states suffer the same fate as georgia and south ossetia ?
as german chancellor angela merkel heads to georgia on sunday , aug .
17 , to continue mediating in the ongoing conflict with russia , western experts mull the chances of escalations elsewhere in the former soviet sphere . when western powers in february gave their blessing to the independence of the serbian province of kosovo , opponents warned it would trigger separatist violence across europe .
now , with the fires of secessionist war still smoking in georgia and its breakaway provinces of abkhazia and south ossetia , the west is wondering nervously whether other conflicts might be about to break out elsewhere in the former ussr .
independence for the georgian provinces " would undoubtedly give impetus to independence ambitions " in the breakaway moldovan region of transnistria , said colonel christopher langton , security analyst at the institute for international strategic studies in london .
debate still rages as to the exact role played by russia in the georgian war , with tbilisi accusing moscow of aggression and moscow insisting that it only intervened to protect civilian lives .
but western analysts agree that before the conflict , russia was the breakaway regions ' main supporter - especially once georgia began to aim for nato membership following its 2003 " rose revolution . "
and they say that russia 's intervention is a warning for ukraine and moldova - two former-soviet states who are also edging towards the west , but who have russian military forces on their territory .
the conflict is " a stern warning to ukraine that what can happen if it tries to move closer to nato is the division of the country , " said security expert dusan reljic of the swp institute for international and security affairs in berlin .
it is also " the acceleration of russia 's ongoing effort to increase its influence " around its borders , langton said .
moscow has both a strong military presence and broad-based popular support in transnistria and ukraine 's crimean peninsula , which russia ceded to its " socialist brother " in 1954 .
ukraine monitoring its own separatist province bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bush and nato have plans for yushchenko 's ukraine and analysts now say that , given nato 's refusal to rule out further eastern expansions , moscow might feel that the best way to stall that process would be to promote secession in the two areas .
" when there are russian populations linked to russia , then those territories could break away ...
so if ukraine insists on joining nato , part of its territory could split away , " reljic said .
but is it really likely that russia would call for full independence for the crimea or transnistria , given the international storm which its actions in georgia have already provoked ? observers say that the option can not be ruled out in the long term , given that one of russia 's prime foreign-policy goals is to rebuild its own influence in europe at nato 's expense .
russian leaders have already said that they see nato 's offer of eventual membership for georgia and ukraine as a direct threat .
and that gives the crimea and transnistria immense strategic significance as two russian-dominated areas on ukraine 's fringe .
ukraine 's desire for nato membership " makes transnistria strategically important for russia , " while any increase in tension between moscow and kiev will " resonate in the crimea , " langton said .
in the short term , such fears are unlikely to materialize .
russia could assert power to scupper nato plans bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : georgia 's pounding puts its nato hopes in jeopardy russia 's hands are full dealing with the aftermath of the georgian war , and some nato members say the conflict proves that georgia is in any case not ready for membership .
but with key nato members , especially the us , pressing for ukraine and georgia to join , there is a danger that russia may end up feeling it has no choice but to weaken its neighbors before it is too late .
" in the past , the answer would have been no , this is not a proxy conflict between great powers .
but increasingly the answer is becoming yes , " langton said . dpa news agency -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

will the real heart of europe please stand up ? european union -pipe- 17.08.2008 the hitch-hiker 's guide to understanding eu jargon großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the irish had nothing against the city but were vehemently against the treaty the problem with eu jargon is that you need both a political dictionary and a map to understand it .
here is a brief list of the eu 's more obscure place-names and a explanation of the processes they refer to . it sometimes seems that half of the eu 's main policies were named after the cities in which they were created .
the problem is that the nicknames almost never come with footnotes , leaving the unsuspecting visitor drowning in a sea of place-names .
barcelona is best known in the eu as the place where european , north african and middle eastern leaders met in november 1995 to try and improve their often-strained relationship .
the result was the " barcelona process , " by which the eu tried to boost trade and political ties with its mediterranean neighbors while urging them to do more for human rights and regional peace .
the process seldom made headlines until early 2007 , when french president nicolas sarkozy proposed scrapping it and creating a much more sweeping " mediterranean union " modeled on the eu .
eu members without a mediterranean coastline blocked the idea , but allowed sarkozy to launch on july 13 a watered-down version catchily titled the " barcelona process : union for the mediterranean . "
copenhagen : denmark 's capital has become eu code for the set of standards which countries have to meet if they want to join the bloc .
the " copenhagen criteria , " adopted in june 1993 , say that a state should be able to preserve democracy and human rights , have a market economy and accept the eu 's " obligations and intent , " such as peace .
over the last year , the criteria have most often been mentioned in the context of eu hopefuls macedonia , serbia and turkey , all of whom have been accused by critics of falling short in key areas .
dublin : famous for its literary giants , its dark beer and its distressing tendency to reject eu treaties , " dublin , " in eu circles , is a term used when talking about refugees .
the " dublin convention , " which came into force in 1997 , is aimed at streamlining the way eu member states deal with refugees and , in particular , deciding where each applicant should be dealt with .
with the current french presidency of the bloc pushing for an eu " pact " on migration , dublin is usually referred to when member states want to accuse one another of not doing enough for refugees .
the hague is famous as the home of various international courts , all of which tend to be nicknamed " the hague tribunal . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the hague hosts the international criminal court the one the eu refers to most often at present is the international criminal tribunal for the former yugoslavia -lrb- icty -rrb- , set up by the un in 1993 to deal with the atrocities committed in the separatist balkan wars of the 1990s .
while not an eu body , icty regularly features in eu meetings because the dutch government has vetoed any kind of eu rapprochement with serbia until icty 's chief prosecutor rules that the belgrade government is cooperating fully with his organization .
cities lend their name to treaties when european union leaders refer to the " lisbon agenda " or the " manchester declaration , " this is what they mean : lisbon : the lisbon agenda , agreed in march 2000 , is a plan aimed at making the eu the world 's most competitive economy by 2010 .
the lisbon treaty , signed in december 2007 , is an agreement between the bloc 's 27 member states aimed at making it easier to take eu-wide decisions and giving the union a higher profile abroad .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the treaty has put lisbon on the eu map with the eu lagging behind key rivals such as the united states and japan in terms of innovation , the word " lisbon " has in the past usually been used to describe the gap between the eu 's targets and its results .
however , since irish voters rejected the lisbon treaty in a referendum on june 12 , current headlines referring to " lisbon " usually refer to the treaty .
maastricht : the maastricht treaty , signed in 1992 , created the eu out of its forerunner , the european economic community , and set up the legal process that created the euro .
maastricht criteria are the strict rules on inflation and government spending that countries have to meet in order to join the euro .
the criteria last made the headlines in july , when eu finance ministers invited slovakia to become the euro club 's 16th member .
manchester : britain 's soccer giant is known in the eu for the political call , made by finance ministers in september 2005 , not to respond to fuel-price rises by cutting taxes .
barely mentioned until the recent oil-price surge , the manchester declaration has now come back to haunt ministers , as they urge one another in increasingly nervous tones not to break ranks . nice : the nice treaty , signed by eu leaders in 2001 , updated the union 's internal workings so the bloc could absorb 12 new member states between 2004 and 2007 .
its main remit was to set the number of votes in eu councils each member state should have , from 29 in germany to three in malta .
when eu leaders were negotiating the lisbon treaty in 2007 , poland , which stood to lose some of its voting power under the new rules , demanded that the nice voting weights remain unchanged , going into negotiations with the slogan " nice or death ! "
schengen : the schengen convention , which came into force in 1995 , abolished border barriers between belgium , france , germany , greece , italy , luxembourg , the netherlands , portugal and spain .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : schengen has gained international fame through the eu the agreement created the schengen zone , which now includes all the eu 's current members except britain , ireland , bulgaria and romania .
non-eu members iceland and norway are also in the zone .
schengen most recently hit the headlines in late 2007 , when it expanded to take in nine countries which joined the eu in 2004 .
tampere : the finnish town of tampere is best known in eu circles for its links with international law-enforcement .
the tampere process , launched in 1999 , is the series of talks which eu member states are holding to discuss how they can improve cooperation on sensitive issues of justice and internal affairs .
the process was given a renewed impulse at a summit in the hague in 2004 - whereupon some officials renamed it the " hague process . "
however , some diplomats say that the process will receive a new impulse when sweden takes over the eu 's rotating presidency in the second half of 2009 .
they therefore call it the " stockholm process . " dpa news agency -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the lisbon treaty , signed in december 2007 , is an agreement between the bloc 's 27 member states aimed at making it easier to take eu-wide decisions and giving the union a higher profile abroad .

its main remit was to set the number of votes in eu councils each member state should have , from 29 in germany to three in malta .

will the real heart of europe please stand up ? european union -pipe- 17.08.2008 the hitch-hiker 's guide to understanding eu jargon großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the irish had nothing against the city but were vehemently against the treaty the problem with eu jargon is that you need both a political dictionary and a map to understand it .
here is a brief list of the eu 's more obscure place-names and a explanation of the processes they refer to . it sometimes seems that half of the eu 's main policies were named after the cities in which they were created .
the problem is that the nicknames almost never come with footnotes , leaving the unsuspecting visitor drowning in a sea of place-names .
barcelona is best known in the eu as the place where european , north african and middle eastern leaders met in november 1995 to try and improve their often-strained relationship .
the result was the " barcelona process , " by which the eu tried to boost trade and political ties with its mediterranean neighbors while urging them to do more for human rights and regional peace .
the process seldom made headlines until early 2007 , when french president nicolas sarkozy proposed scrapping it and creating a much more sweeping " mediterranean union " modeled on the eu .
eu members without a mediterranean coastline blocked the idea , but allowed sarkozy to launch on july 13 a watered-down version catchily titled the " barcelona process : union for the mediterranean . "
copenhagen : denmark 's capital has become eu code for the set of standards which countries have to meet if they want to join the bloc .
the " copenhagen criteria , " adopted in june 1993 , say that a state should be able to preserve democracy and human rights , have a market economy and accept the eu 's " obligations and intent , " such as peace .
over the last year , the criteria have most often been mentioned in the context of eu hopefuls macedonia , serbia and turkey , all of whom have been accused by critics of falling short in key areas .
dublin : famous for its literary giants , its dark beer and its distressing tendency to reject eu treaties , " dublin , " in eu circles , is a term used when talking about refugees .
the " dublin convention , " which came into force in 1997 , is aimed at streamlining the way eu member states deal with refugees and , in particular , deciding where each applicant should be dealt with .
with the current french presidency of the bloc pushing for an eu " pact " on migration , dublin is usually referred to when member states want to accuse one another of not doing enough for refugees .
the hague is famous as the home of various international courts , all of which tend to be nicknamed " the hague tribunal . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the hague hosts the international criminal court the one the eu refers to most often at present is the international criminal tribunal for the former yugoslavia -lrb- icty -rrb- , set up by the un in 1993 to deal with the atrocities committed in the separatist balkan wars of the 1990s .
while not an eu body , icty regularly features in eu meetings because the dutch government has vetoed any kind of eu rapprochement with serbia until icty 's chief prosecutor rules that the belgrade government is cooperating fully with his organization .

as german chancellor angela merkel heads to georgia on sunday , aug .
17 , to continue mediating in the ongoing conflict with russia , western experts mull the chances of escalations elsewhere in the former soviet sphere . when western powers in february gave their blessing to the independence of the serbian province of kosovo , opponents warned it would trigger separatist violence across europe .
now , with the fires of secessionist war still smoking in georgia and its breakaway provinces of abkhazia and south ossetia , the west is wondering nervously whether other conflicts might be about to break out elsewhere in the former ussr .
independence for the georgian provinces " would undoubtedly give impetus to independence ambitions " in the breakaway moldovan region of transnistria , said colonel christopher langton , security analyst at the institute for international strategic studies in london .
debate still rages as to the exact role played by russia in the georgian war , with tbilisi accusing moscow of aggression and moscow insisting that it only intervened to protect civilian lives .
but western analysts agree that before the conflict , russia was the breakaway regions ' main supporter - especially once georgia began to aim for nato membership following its 2003 " rose revolution . "
and they say that russia 's intervention is a warning for ukraine and moldova - two former-soviet states who are also edging towards the west , but who have russian military forces on their territory .
the conflict is " a stern warning to ukraine that what can happen if it tries to move closer to nato is the division of the country , " said security expert dusan reljic of the swp institute for international and security affairs in berlin .
it is also " the acceleration of russia 's ongoing effort to increase its influence " around its borders , langton said .
moscow has both a strong military presence and broad-based popular support in transnistria and ukraine 's crimean peninsula , which russia ceded to its " socialist brother " in 1954 .
ukraine monitoring its own separatist province bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bush and nato have plans for yushchenko 's ukraine and analysts now say that , given nato 's refusal to rule out further eastern expansions , moscow might feel that the best way to stall that process would be to promote secession in the two areas .
" when there are russian populations linked to russia , then those territories could break away ...
so if ukraine insists on joining nato , part of its territory could split away , " reljic said .
but is it really likely that russia would call for full independence for the crimea or transnistria , given the international storm which its actions in georgia have already provoked ? observers say that the option can not be ruled out in the long term , given that one of russia 's prime foreign-policy goals is to rebuild its own influence in europe at nato 's expense .
russian leaders have already said that they see nato 's offer of eventual membership for georgia and ukraine as a direct threat .
and that gives the crimea and transnistria immense strategic significance as two russian-dominated areas on ukraine 's fringe .
ukraine 's desire for nato membership " makes transnistria strategically important for russia , " while any increase in tension between moscow and kiev will " resonate in the crimea , " langton said .
in the short term , such fears are unlikely to materialize .
russia could assert power to scupper nato plans bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : georgia 's pounding puts its nato hopes in jeopardy russia 's hands are full dealing with the aftermath of the georgian war , and some nato members say the conflict proves that georgia is in any case not ready for membership .
but with key nato members , especially the us , pressing for ukraine and georgia to join , there is a danger that russia may end up feeling it has no choice but to weaken its neighbors before it is too late .

dw 's karl zawadzky says the country has to face the fact the party is over . one thing is clear - germany is past its peak when it comes to economic performance .
the party - surging exports and strong domestic investments - is over .
still , there 's some tangible relief at the reversal in economic fortunes because things could have been much worse .
the german economy shrank by 0.5 percent in the second quarter of this year - that 's bad but it 's not going to really cripple the country 's economy .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : karl zawadzky it would be highly surprising if all the big economic powers could simply shrug off the negative factors that have in recent times plunged the global economy into crisis .
in the us , an absolutely superficially-financed housing bubble has burst , triggering a finance and banking crisis in america and europe .
the real estate boom is also over in britain and spain , two large european union nations .
the dollar has taken a battering while the rise of the euro has thrown a dampener on european exports .
oil prices have climbed to levels unimaginable until recently and food prices have skyrocketed .

as german chancellor angela merkel heads to georgia on sunday , aug .
17 , to continue mediating in the ongoing conflict with russia , western experts mull the chances of escalations elsewhere in the former soviet sphere . when western powers in february gave their blessing to the independence of the serbian province of kosovo , opponents warned it would trigger separatist violence across europe .
now , with the fires of secessionist war still smoking in georgia and its breakaway provinces of abkhazia and south ossetia , the west is wondering nervously whether other conflicts might be about to break out elsewhere in the former ussr .
independence for the georgian provinces " would undoubtedly give impetus to independence ambitions " in the breakaway moldovan region of transnistria , said colonel christopher langton , security analyst at the institute for international strategic studies in london .
debate still rages as to the exact role played by russia in the georgian war , with tbilisi accusing moscow of aggression and moscow insisting that it only intervened to protect civilian lives .
but western analysts agree that before the conflict , russia was the breakaway regions ' main supporter - especially once georgia began to aim for nato membership following its 2003 " rose revolution . "
and they say that russia 's intervention is a warning for ukraine and moldova - two former-soviet states who are also edging towards the west , but who have russian military forces on their territory .
the conflict is " a stern warning to ukraine that what can happen if it tries to move closer to nato is the division of the country , " said security expert dusan reljic of the swp institute for international and security affairs in berlin .
it is also " the acceleration of russia 's ongoing effort to increase its influence " around its borders , langton said .
moscow has both a strong military presence and broad-based popular support in transnistria and ukraine 's crimean peninsula , which russia ceded to its " socialist brother " in 1954 .
ukraine monitoring its own separatist province bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bush and nato have plans for yushchenko 's ukraine and analysts now say that , given nato 's refusal to rule out further eastern expansions , moscow might feel that the best way to stall that process would be to promote secession in the two areas .
" when there are russian populations linked to russia , then those territories could break away ...
so if ukraine insists on joining nato , part of its territory could split away , " reljic said .
but is it really likely that russia would call for full independence for the crimea or transnistria , given the international storm which its actions in georgia have already provoked ? observers say that the option can not be ruled out in the long term , given that one of russia 's prime foreign-policy goals is to rebuild its own influence in europe at nato 's expense .
russian leaders have already said that they see nato 's offer of eventual membership for georgia and ukraine as a direct threat .
and that gives the crimea and transnistria immense strategic significance as two russian-dominated areas on ukraine 's fringe .
ukraine 's desire for nato membership " makes transnistria strategically important for russia , " while any increase in tension between moscow and kiev will " resonate in the crimea , " langton said .
in the short term , such fears are unlikely to materialize .
russia could assert power to scupper nato plans bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : georgia 's pounding puts its nato hopes in jeopardy russia 's hands are full dealing with the aftermath of the georgian war , and some nato members say the conflict proves that georgia is in any case not ready for membership .
but with key nato members , especially the us , pressing for ukraine and georgia to join , there is a danger that russia may end up feeling it has no choice but to weaken its neighbors before it is too late .
" in the past , the answer would have been no , this is not a proxy conflict between great powers .
but increasingly the answer is becoming yes , " langton said . dpa news agency -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

dw 's karl zawadzky says the country has to face the fact the party is over . one thing is clear - germany is past its peak when it comes to economic performance .
the party - surging exports and strong domestic investments - is over .
still , there 's some tangible relief at the reversal in economic fortunes because things could have been much worse .
the german economy shrank by 0.5 percent in the second quarter of this year - that 's bad but it 's not going to really cripple the country 's economy .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : karl zawadzky it would be highly surprising if all the big economic powers could simply shrug off the negative factors that have in recent times plunged the global economy into crisis .
in the us , an absolutely superficially-financed housing bubble has burst , triggering a finance and banking crisis in america and europe .
the real estate boom is also over in britain and spain , two large european union nations .
the dollar has taken a battering while the rise of the euro has thrown a dampener on european exports .
oil prices have climbed to levels unimaginable until recently and food prices have skyrocketed .

the real estate boom is also over in britain and spain , two large european union nations .
the dollar has taken a battering while the rise of the euro has thrown a dampener on european exports .
oil prices have climbed to levels unimaginable until recently and food prices have skyrocketed .
finally , inflation in the euro zone has soared out of control , prompting the european central bank to raise interest rates .
all this has put a brake on germany 's economic growth rate .
within a short period , both corporate and consumer sentiment has plummeted .
talk of a long-lasting economic upturn has been replaced by dire predictions of stagnation or even recession coupled with a lasting price rise .
but the facts speak against it .
the weather is one of the main reasons for germany 's economic slowdown .
whether it had to with climate change or not , the fact is that the last winter practically did n't materialize .
add to it the fact that tax benefits for the construction sector were phased out .
both those factors led to the fact that construction sites early this year were n't closed , as is usually the case , but rather that the economy grew in the first quarter by 1.5 percent - something it has n't done in 12 years .
this surge in growth was missing in the second quarter .
that means slowing economic growth is partly due to statistical interpretation .
if you assess the first two quarters of this year individually , a dramatic decline becomes apparent .
if you consider the first half of the year as a whole , you have an economic growth rate of 1.2 percent .
in the face of the negative factors affecting the world economy , it 's quite substantial .
but one thing is clear - if the global economy has to battle with serious problems such as high oil prices , a finance crisis and volatile currency markets , it will drag the german economy into the crisis .
that 's because the german economy , like no other economic power , is reliant on exports which make up almost half of germany 's economic performance .
a decade ago , that share was only 27 percent .
the current economic downturn looks worse than it actually is .
it wo n't change the fact that germany 's economy will grow in the current year .
german economics minister michael glos is sticking to growth predictions of 1.7 percent .
but that 's one percentage point less than last year ; for the coming year , experts predict a further worsening of the economy .
it 's not the decline in the second quarter but rather the downward trend that 's sparked concerns because it 's coupled with a strong price rise that hampers the much needed lowering of interest rates by the european central bank .
developments on the labor market are still positive but a lasting economic slowdown will soon change that .
the ranks of unemployed will rise again .
there 's a reason for the bleak outlook - the party is over .
for many , it 's associated with a hangover - just like in real life .

dw 's karl zawadzky says the country has to face the fact the party is over . one thing is clear - germany is past its peak when it comes to economic performance .
the party - surging exports and strong domestic investments - is over .
still , there 's some tangible relief at the reversal in economic fortunes because things could have been much worse .
the german economy shrank by 0.5 percent in the second quarter of this year - that 's bad but it 's not going to really cripple the country 's economy .

" georgia will become a member of nato if it wants to - and it does want to , " merkel said before talks with president mikheil saakashvili in tbilisi . it was one of the strongest statements yet of support for georgia 's nato membership bid which is fiercely opposed by russia .
the statement signals a change in germany 's position towards georgian nato membership .
earlier this year , germany led european resistance to plans , pushed by the us , to put georgia on the track to nato membership . later at a joint news conference with saakashvili , merkel said that though georgia was on a clear path to membership in nato she stood by her decision at a summit in april not to grant tbilisi a " membership action plan " for joining the alliance . at the last nato summit in bucharest in april , leaders agreed that georgia and ukraine should join the north atlantic treaty organization eventually , but neither nation was given candidate status and no timetables were set .
the united states is strongly in favour of georgia joining nato , but misgivings from france and germany prevented tbilisi being awarded full candidate status in bucharest . medvedev confirms pull-out in a meeting with medvedev in the black sea resort of sochi on friday , merkel had criticized russian actions during the week-long war between russia and georgia over the breakaway region of south ossetia .
she demanded that russia withdraw all its troops from georgia 's core territory . the georgian government says rebel abkhaz forces with the support of russian troops are occupying 13 georgian villages , effectively pushing the border of abkhazia westwards into georgia proper . medvedev said sunday that russian regular forces would start their pullout from georgia on monday , the kremlin said .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : medvedev has confirmed russia will begin withdrawing troops from georgia " from tomorrow , russia will begin withdrawing its military forces that are supporting russian peacekeepers , " medvedev told french president nicolas sarkozy in a telephone conversation , the kremlin said in a statement . speaking at a sunday press conference in tbilisi , merkel said that despite medvedev 's commitment " according to the information i have available to me this -lrb- russian withdrawal -rrb- has not yet begun . "
merkel : georgia 's integrity must be respected merkel also repeated that germany 's position was that georgia 's territorial integrity was beyond question , and that its borders should be inviolate . in her meeting with medvedev , merkel also stressed that germany 's position was that georgia 's territorial integrity was beyond question and that saakashvili was a democratically elected president . government sources said ahead of her departure that she intended to push for " a complete cessation of hostilities .

" west divided on how to deal with russia german foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier warned on sunday against any knee-jerk reaction to the caucasus conflict in relations with russia .
" i do not advise ... any knee-jerk reaction such as suspending talks on a partnership and cooperation agreement -lrb- with the european union -rrb- .

earlier this year , germany led european resistance to plans , pushed by the us , to put georgia on the track to nato membership . later at a joint news conference with saakashvili , merkel said that though georgia was on a clear path to membership in nato she stood by her decision at a summit in april not to grant tbilisi a " membership action plan " for joining the alliance . at the last nato summit in bucharest in april , leaders agreed that georgia and ukraine should join the north atlantic treaty organization eventually , but neither nation was given candidate status and no timetables were set .
the united states is strongly in favour of georgia joining nato , but misgivings from france and germany prevented tbilisi being awarded full candidate status in bucharest . medvedev confirms pull-out in a meeting with medvedev in the black sea resort of sochi on friday , merkel had criticized russian actions during the week-long war between russia and georgia over the breakaway region of south ossetia .
she demanded that russia withdraw all its troops from georgia 's core territory . the georgian government says rebel abkhaz forces with the support of russian troops are occupying 13 georgian villages , effectively pushing the border of abkhazia westwards into georgia proper . medvedev said sunday that russian regular forces would start their pullout from georgia on monday , the kremlin said .

dw 's karl zawadzky says the country has to face the fact the party is over . one thing is clear - germany is past its peak when it comes to economic performance .
the party - surging exports and strong domestic investments - is over .
still , there 's some tangible relief at the reversal in economic fortunes because things could have been much worse .
the german economy shrank by 0.5 percent in the second quarter of this year - that 's bad but it 's not going to really cripple the country 's economy .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : karl zawadzky it would be highly surprising if all the big economic powers could simply shrug off the negative factors that have in recent times plunged the global economy into crisis .
in the us , an absolutely superficially-financed housing bubble has burst , triggering a finance and banking crisis in america and europe .
the real estate boom is also over in britain and spain , two large european union nations .
the dollar has taken a battering while the rise of the euro has thrown a dampener on european exports .
oil prices have climbed to levels unimaginable until recently and food prices have skyrocketed .
finally , inflation in the euro zone has soared out of control , prompting the european central bank to raise interest rates .
all this has put a brake on germany 's economic growth rate .
within a short period , both corporate and consumer sentiment has plummeted .
talk of a long-lasting economic upturn has been replaced by dire predictions of stagnation or even recession coupled with a lasting price rise .
but the facts speak against it .
the weather is one of the main reasons for germany 's economic slowdown .
whether it had to with climate change or not , the fact is that the last winter practically did n't materialize .
add to it the fact that tax benefits for the construction sector were phased out .
both those factors led to the fact that construction sites early this year were n't closed , as is usually the case , but rather that the economy grew in the first quarter by 1.5 percent - something it has n't done in 12 years .
this surge in growth was missing in the second quarter .
that means slowing economic growth is partly due to statistical interpretation .
if you assess the first two quarters of this year individually , a dramatic decline becomes apparent .
if you consider the first half of the year as a whole , you have an economic growth rate of 1.2 percent .
in the face of the negative factors affecting the world economy , it 's quite substantial .
but one thing is clear - if the global economy has to battle with serious problems such as high oil prices , a finance crisis and volatile currency markets , it will drag the german economy into the crisis .
that 's because the german economy , like no other economic power , is reliant on exports which make up almost half of germany 's economic performance .
a decade ago , that share was only 27 percent .
the current economic downturn looks worse than it actually is .
it wo n't change the fact that germany 's economy will grow in the current year .
german economics minister michael glos is sticking to growth predictions of 1.7 percent .
but that 's one percentage point less than last year ; for the coming year , experts predict a further worsening of the economy .
it 's not the decline in the second quarter but rather the downward trend that 's sparked concerns because it 's coupled with a strong price rise that hampers the much needed lowering of interest rates by the european central bank .
developments on the labor market are still positive but a lasting economic slowdown will soon change that .
the ranks of unemployed will rise again .
there 's a reason for the bleak outlook - the party is over .
for many , it 's associated with a hangover - just like in real life .

as german chancellor angela merkel heads to georgia on sunday , aug .
17 , to continue mediating in the ongoing conflict with russia , western experts mull the chances of escalations elsewhere in the former soviet sphere . when western powers in february gave their blessing to the independence of the serbian province of kosovo , opponents warned it would trigger separatist violence across europe .
now , with the fires of secessionist war still smoking in georgia and its breakaway provinces of abkhazia and south ossetia , the west is wondering nervously whether other conflicts might be about to break out elsewhere in the former ussr .
independence for the georgian provinces " would undoubtedly give impetus to independence ambitions " in the breakaway moldovan region of transnistria , said colonel christopher langton , security analyst at the institute for international strategic studies in london .
debate still rages as to the exact role played by russia in the georgian war , with tbilisi accusing moscow of aggression and moscow insisting that it only intervened to protect civilian lives .
but western analysts agree that before the conflict , russia was the breakaway regions ' main supporter - especially once georgia began to aim for nato membership following its 2003 " rose revolution . "
and they say that russia 's intervention is a warning for ukraine and moldova - two former-soviet states who are also edging towards the west , but who have russian military forces on their territory .
the conflict is " a stern warning to ukraine that what can happen if it tries to move closer to nato is the division of the country , " said security expert dusan reljic of the swp institute for international and security affairs in berlin .
it is also " the acceleration of russia 's ongoing effort to increase its influence " around its borders , langton said .
moscow has both a strong military presence and broad-based popular support in transnistria and ukraine 's crimean peninsula , which russia ceded to its " socialist brother " in 1954 .
ukraine monitoring its own separatist province bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bush and nato have plans for yushchenko 's ukraine and analysts now say that , given nato 's refusal to rule out further eastern expansions , moscow might feel that the best way to stall that process would be to promote secession in the two areas .
" when there are russian populations linked to russia , then those territories could break away ...
so if ukraine insists on joining nato , part of its territory could split away , " reljic said .
but is it really likely that russia would call for full independence for the crimea or transnistria , given the international storm which its actions in georgia have already provoked ? observers say that the option can not be ruled out in the long term , given that one of russia 's prime foreign-policy goals is to rebuild its own influence in europe at nato 's expense .
russian leaders have already said that they see nato 's offer of eventual membership for georgia and ukraine as a direct threat .
and that gives the crimea and transnistria immense strategic significance as two russian-dominated areas on ukraine 's fringe .
ukraine 's desire for nato membership " makes transnistria strategically important for russia , " while any increase in tension between moscow and kiev will " resonate in the crimea , " langton said .
in the short term , such fears are unlikely to materialize .
russia could assert power to scupper nato plans bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : georgia 's pounding puts its nato hopes in jeopardy russia 's hands are full dealing with the aftermath of the georgian war , and some nato members say the conflict proves that georgia is in any case not ready for membership .
but with key nato members , especially the us , pressing for ukraine and georgia to join , there is a danger that russia may end up feeling it has no choice but to weaken its neighbors before it is too late .
" in the past , the answer would have been no , this is not a proxy conflict between great powers .
but increasingly the answer is becoming yes , " langton said . dpa news agency -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

earlier this year , germany led european resistance to plans , pushed by the us , to put georgia on the track to nato membership . later at a joint news conference with saakashvili , merkel said that though georgia was on a clear path to membership in nato she stood by her decision at a summit in april not to grant tbilisi a " membership action plan " for joining the alliance . at the last nato summit in bucharest in april , leaders agreed that georgia and ukraine should join the north atlantic treaty organization eventually , but neither nation was given candidate status and no timetables were set .
the united states is strongly in favour of georgia joining nato , but misgivings from france and germany prevented tbilisi being awarded full candidate status in bucharest . medvedev confirms pull-out in a meeting with medvedev in the black sea resort of sochi on friday , merkel had criticized russian actions during the week-long war between russia and georgia over the breakaway region of south ossetia .
she demanded that russia withdraw all its troops from georgia 's core territory . the georgian government says rebel abkhaz forces with the support of russian troops are occupying 13 georgian villages , effectively pushing the border of abkhazia westwards into georgia proper . medvedev said sunday that russian regular forces would start their pullout from georgia on monday , the kremlin said .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : medvedev has confirmed russia will begin withdrawing troops from georgia " from tomorrow , russia will begin withdrawing its military forces that are supporting russian peacekeepers , " medvedev told french president nicolas sarkozy in a telephone conversation , the kremlin said in a statement . speaking at a sunday press conference in tbilisi , merkel said that despite medvedev 's commitment " according to the information i have available to me this -lrb- russian withdrawal -rrb- has not yet begun . "
merkel : georgia 's integrity must be respected merkel also repeated that germany 's position was that georgia 's territorial integrity was beyond question , and that its borders should be inviolate . in her meeting with medvedev , merkel also stressed that germany 's position was that georgia 's territorial integrity was beyond question and that saakashvili was a democratically elected president . government sources said ahead of her departure that she intended to push for " a complete cessation of hostilities . " " the ceasefire must be verifiable and lasting , " they said . bildunterschrift : the map shows where russian troops blew up a georgian railroad bridge near the capital tbilisi georgian media hald back from predictions of what effect , if any , merkel 's visit would have on russian troops currently occupying georgian territory . rustaveli 2 television described merkel 's presence in georgia as " part of an international effort to support georgia . " west divided on how to deal with russia german foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier warned on sunday against any knee-jerk reaction to the caucasus conflict in relations with russia .
" i do not advise ... any knee-jerk reaction such as suspending talks on a partnership and cooperation agreement -lrb- with the european union -rrb- .
that would signify that such an agreement is more important to the eu than to russia , " steinmeier said in an interview with german weekly welt am sonntag .
" or russia joining the world trade organisation -lrb- wto -rrb- : our interest in this is as great as russia itself .
talks in the nato-russian council are essential too .
because we need open lines of communication - to tbilisi and to moscow , " steinmeier told the paper .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : steinmeier 's comments on russia are in sharp contrast to the views held by other western nations steinmeier 's comments were at odds with the views of other eu members as well as the us .
french president nicolas sarkozy , whose country holds the rotating eu presidency until the end of the year , warned on sunday that russian relations with the eu would be seriously damaged if moscow failed to fully implement the peace deal it signed with georgia .
in a statement , sarkozy told medvedev of the " serious consequences that a failure to quickly and fully implement the deal would have on relations between russia and the european union . "
britain 's foreign secretary david miliband said on wednesday that the eu should reassess its relations with russia after its " aggressive " actions in georgia and decide whether " to proceed with the partnership and cooperation agreement . "
us secretary of state condoleezza rice said on sunday that moscow 's international reputation had taken a beating by its military action in georgia .
" russia overreached , used disproportionate force against a small neighbour and is now paying the price for that because russia 's reputation as a potential partner in international institutions , diplomatic , political , security , economic , is frankly , in tatters , " rice told nbc 's meet the press . dw staff -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de russia -pipe- 17.08.2008 analysis : after georgia , will there be other separatist hotspots ? großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : will other former soviet states suffer the same fate as georgia and south ossetia ?
as german chancellor angela merkel heads to georgia on sunday , aug .
17 , to continue mediating in the ongoing conflict with russia , western experts mull the chances of escalations elsewhere in the former soviet sphere . when western powers in february gave their blessing to the independence of the serbian province of kosovo , opponents warned it would trigger separatist violence across europe .
now , with the fires of secessionist war still smoking in georgia and its breakaway provinces of abkhazia and south ossetia , the west is wondering nervously whether other conflicts might be about to break out elsewhere in the former ussr .
independence for the georgian provinces " would undoubtedly give impetus to independence ambitions " in the breakaway moldovan region of transnistria , said colonel christopher langton , security analyst at the institute for international strategic studies in london .
debate still rages as to the exact role played by russia in the georgian war , with tbilisi accusing moscow of aggression and moscow insisting that it only intervened to protect civilian lives .
but western analysts agree that before the conflict , russia was the breakaway regions ' main supporter - especially once georgia began to aim for nato membership following its 2003 " rose revolution . "
and they say that russia 's intervention is a warning for ukraine and moldova - two former-soviet states who are also edging towards the west , but who have russian military forces on their territory .
the conflict is " a stern warning to ukraine that what can happen if it tries to move closer to nato is the division of the country , " said security expert dusan reljic of the swp institute for international and security affairs in berlin .
it is also " the acceleration of russia 's ongoing effort to increase its influence " around its borders , langton said .
moscow has both a strong military presence and broad-based popular support in transnistria and ukraine 's crimean peninsula , which russia ceded to its " socialist brother " in 1954 .
ukraine monitoring its own separatist province bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bush and nato have plans for yushchenko 's ukraine and analysts now say that , given nato 's refusal to rule out further eastern expansions , moscow might feel that the best way to stall that process would be to promote secession in the two areas .
" when there are russian populations linked to russia , then those territories could break away ...
so if ukraine insists on joining nato , part of its territory could split away , " reljic said .
but is it really likely that russia would call for full independence for the crimea or transnistria , given the international storm which its actions in georgia have already provoked ? observers say that the option can not be ruled out in the long term , given that one of russia 's prime foreign-policy goals is to rebuild its own influence in europe at nato 's expense .
russian leaders have already said that they see nato 's offer of eventual membership for georgia and ukraine as a direct threat .
and that gives the crimea and transnistria immense strategic significance as two russian-dominated areas on ukraine 's fringe .
ukraine 's desire for nato membership " makes transnistria strategically important for russia , " while any increase in tension between moscow and kiev will " resonate in the crimea , " langton said .
in the short term , such fears are unlikely to materialize .
russia could assert power to scupper nato plans bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : georgia 's pounding puts its nato hopes in jeopardy russia 's hands are full dealing with the aftermath of the georgian war , and some nato members say the conflict proves that georgia is in any case not ready for membership .
but with key nato members , especially the us , pressing for ukraine and georgia to join , there is a danger that russia may end up feeling it has no choice but to weaken its neighbors before it is too late .
" in the past , the answer would have been no , this is not a proxy conflict between great powers .
but increasingly the answer is becoming yes , " langton said . dpa news agency -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de in focus : dossier : getting the hang of the eu despite expansion , europe still ca n't define " european " european union makes a meal of regional treats could mutual ridicule be a sign of successful eu integration ?
will the real heart of europe please stand up ? european union -pipe- 17.08.2008 the hitch-hiker 's guide to understanding eu jargon großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the irish had nothing against the city but were vehemently against the treaty the problem with eu jargon is that you need both a political dictionary and a map to understand it .
here is a brief list of the eu 's more obscure place-names and a explanation of the processes they refer to . it sometimes seems that half of the eu 's main policies were named after the cities in which they were created .
the problem is that the nicknames almost never come with footnotes , leaving the unsuspecting visitor drowning in a sea of place-names .
barcelona is best known in the eu as the place where european , north african and middle eastern leaders met in november 1995 to try and improve their often-strained relationship .
the result was the " barcelona process , " by which the eu tried to boost trade and political ties with its mediterranean neighbors while urging them to do more for human rights and regional peace .
the process seldom made headlines until early 2007 , when french president nicolas sarkozy proposed scrapping it and creating a much more sweeping " mediterranean union " modeled on the eu .
eu members without a mediterranean coastline blocked the idea , but allowed sarkozy to launch on july 13 a watered-down version catchily titled the " barcelona process : union for the mediterranean . "
copenhagen : denmark 's capital has become eu code for the set of standards which countries have to meet if they want to join the bloc .
the " copenhagen criteria , " adopted in june 1993 , say that a state should be able to preserve democracy and human rights , have a market economy and accept the eu 's " obligations and intent , " such as peace .
over the last year , the criteria have most often been mentioned in the context of eu hopefuls macedonia , serbia and turkey , all of whom have been accused by critics of falling short in key areas .
dublin : famous for its literary giants , its dark beer and its distressing tendency to reject eu treaties , " dublin , " in eu circles , is a term used when talking about refugees .
the " dublin convention , " which came into force in 1997 , is aimed at streamlining the way eu member states deal with refugees and , in particular , deciding where each applicant should be dealt with .
with the current french presidency of the bloc pushing for an eu " pact " on migration , dublin is usually referred to when member states want to accuse one another of not doing enough for refugees .
the hague is famous as the home of various international courts , all of which tend to be nicknamed " the hague tribunal . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the hague hosts the international criminal court the one the eu refers to most often at present is the international criminal tribunal for the former yugoslavia -lrb- icty -rrb- , set up by the un in 1993 to deal with the atrocities committed in the separatist balkan wars of the 1990s .
while not an eu body , icty regularly features in eu meetings because the dutch government has vetoed any kind of eu rapprochement with serbia until icty 's chief prosecutor rules that the belgrade government is cooperating fully with his organization .
cities lend their name to treaties when european union leaders refer to the " lisbon agenda " or the " manchester declaration , " this is what they mean : lisbon : the lisbon agenda , agreed in march 2000 , is a plan aimed at making the eu the world 's most competitive economy by 2010 .
the lisbon treaty , signed in december 2007 , is an agreement between the bloc 's 27 member states aimed at making it easier to take eu-wide decisions and giving the union a higher profile abroad .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the treaty has put lisbon on the eu map with the eu lagging behind key rivals such as the united states and japan in terms of innovation , the word " lisbon " has in the past usually been used to describe the gap between the eu 's targets and its results .
however , since irish voters rejected the lisbon treaty in a referendum on june 12 , current headlines referring to " lisbon " usually refer to the treaty .
maastricht : the maastricht treaty , signed in 1992 , created the eu out of its forerunner , the european economic community , and set up the legal process that created the euro .
maastricht criteria are the strict rules on inflation and government spending that countries have to meet in order to join the euro .
the criteria last made the headlines in july , when eu finance ministers invited slovakia to become the euro club 's 16th member .
manchester : britain 's soccer giant is known in the eu for the political call , made by finance ministers in september 2005 , not to respond to fuel-price rises by cutting taxes .
barely mentioned until the recent oil-price surge , the manchester declaration has now come back to haunt ministers , as they urge one another in increasingly nervous tones not to break ranks . nice : the nice treaty , signed by eu leaders in 2001 , updated the union 's internal workings so the bloc could absorb 12 new member states between 2004 and 2007 .
its main remit was to set the number of votes in eu councils each member state should have , from 29 in germany to three in malta .
when eu leaders were negotiating the lisbon treaty in 2007 , poland , which stood to lose some of its voting power under the new rules , demanded that the nice voting weights remain unchanged , going into negotiations with the slogan " nice or death ! "
schengen : the schengen convention , which came into force in 1995 , abolished border barriers between belgium , france , germany , greece , italy , luxembourg , the netherlands , portugal and spain .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : schengen has gained international fame through the eu the agreement created the schengen zone , which now includes all the eu 's current members except britain , ireland , bulgaria and romania .
non-eu members iceland and norway are also in the zone .
schengen most recently hit the headlines in late 2007 , when it expanded to take in nine countries which joined the eu in 2004 .
tampere : the finnish town of tampere is best known in eu circles for its links with international law-enforcement .
the tampere process , launched in 1999 , is the series of talks which eu member states are holding to discuss how they can improve cooperation on sensitive issues of justice and internal affairs .
the process was given a renewed impulse at a summit in the hague in 2004 - whereupon some officials renamed it the " hague process . "
however , some diplomats say that the process will receive a new impulse when sweden takes over the eu 's rotating presidency in the second half of 2009 .
they therefore call it the " stockholm process . " dpa news agency -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

will the real heart of europe please stand up ? european union -pipe- 17.08.2008 the hitch-hiker 's guide to understanding eu jargon großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the irish had nothing against the city but were vehemently against the treaty the problem with eu jargon is that you need both a political dictionary and a map to understand it .
here is a brief list of the eu 's more obscure place-names and a explanation of the processes they refer to . it sometimes seems that half of the eu 's main policies were named after the cities in which they were created .
the problem is that the nicknames almost never come with footnotes , leaving the unsuspecting visitor drowning in a sea of place-names .
barcelona is best known in the eu as the place where european , north african and middle eastern leaders met in november 1995 to try and improve their often-strained relationship .
the result was the " barcelona process , " by which the eu tried to boost trade and political ties with its mediterranean neighbors while urging them to do more for human rights and regional peace .
the process seldom made headlines until early 2007 , when french president nicolas sarkozy proposed scrapping it and creating a much more sweeping " mediterranean union " modeled on the eu .
eu members without a mediterranean coastline blocked the idea , but allowed sarkozy to launch on july 13 a watered-down version catchily titled the " barcelona process : union for the mediterranean . "
copenhagen : denmark 's capital has become eu code for the set of standards which countries have to meet if they want to join the bloc .
the " copenhagen criteria , " adopted in june 1993 , say that a state should be able to preserve democracy and human rights , have a market economy and accept the eu 's " obligations and intent , " such as peace .
over the last year , the criteria have most often been mentioned in the context of eu hopefuls macedonia , serbia and turkey , all of whom have been accused by critics of falling short in key areas .
dublin : famous for its literary giants , its dark beer and its distressing tendency to reject eu treaties , " dublin , " in eu circles , is a term used when talking about refugees .
the " dublin convention , " which came into force in 1997 , is aimed at streamlining the way eu member states deal with refugees and , in particular , deciding where each applicant should be dealt with .
with the current french presidency of the bloc pushing for an eu " pact " on migration , dublin is usually referred to when member states want to accuse one another of not doing enough for refugees .
the hague is famous as the home of various international courts , all of which tend to be nicknamed " the hague tribunal . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the hague hosts the international criminal court the one the eu refers to most often at present is the international criminal tribunal for the former yugoslavia -lrb- icty -rrb- , set up by the un in 1993 to deal with the atrocities committed in the separatist balkan wars of the 1990s .
while not an eu body , icty regularly features in eu meetings because the dutch government has vetoed any kind of eu rapprochement with serbia until icty 's chief prosecutor rules that the belgrade government is cooperating fully with his organization .
cities lend their name to treaties when european union leaders refer to the " lisbon agenda " or the " manchester declaration , " this is what they mean : lisbon : the lisbon agenda , agreed in march 2000 , is a plan aimed at making the eu the world 's most competitive economy by 2010 .
the lisbon treaty , signed in december 2007 , is an agreement between the bloc 's 27 member states aimed at making it easier to take eu-wide decisions and giving the union a higher profile abroad .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the treaty has put lisbon on the eu map with the eu lagging behind key rivals such as the united states and japan in terms of innovation , the word " lisbon " has in the past usually been used to describe the gap between the eu 's targets and its results .
however , since irish voters rejected the lisbon treaty in a referendum on june 12 , current headlines referring to " lisbon " usually refer to the treaty .
maastricht : the maastricht treaty , signed in 1992 , created the eu out of its forerunner , the european economic community , and set up the legal process that created the euro .
maastricht criteria are the strict rules on inflation and government spending that countries have to meet in order to join the euro .
the criteria last made the headlines in july , when eu finance ministers invited slovakia to become the euro club 's 16th member .
manchester : britain 's soccer giant is known in the eu for the political call , made by finance ministers in september 2005 , not to respond to fuel-price rises by cutting taxes .
barely mentioned until the recent oil-price surge , the manchester declaration has now come back to haunt ministers , as they urge one another in increasingly nervous tones not to break ranks . nice : the nice treaty , signed by eu leaders in 2001 , updated the union 's internal workings so the bloc could absorb 12 new member states between 2004 and 2007 .
its main remit was to set the number of votes in eu councils each member state should have , from 29 in germany to three in malta .
when eu leaders were negotiating the lisbon treaty in 2007 , poland , which stood to lose some of its voting power under the new rules , demanded that the nice voting weights remain unchanged , going into negotiations with the slogan " nice or death ! "
schengen : the schengen convention , which came into force in 1995 , abolished border barriers between belgium , france , germany , greece , italy , luxembourg , the netherlands , portugal and spain .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : schengen has gained international fame through the eu the agreement created the schengen zone , which now includes all the eu 's current members except britain , ireland , bulgaria and romania .
non-eu members iceland and norway are also in the zone .
schengen most recently hit the headlines in late 2007 , when it expanded to take in nine countries which joined the eu in 2004 .
tampere : the finnish town of tampere is best known in eu circles for its links with international law-enforcement .
the tampere process , launched in 1999 , is the series of talks which eu member states are holding to discuss how they can improve cooperation on sensitive issues of justice and internal affairs .
the process was given a renewed impulse at a summit in the hague in 2004 - whereupon some officials renamed it the " hague process . "
however , some diplomats say that the process will receive a new impulse when sweden takes over the eu 's rotating presidency in the second half of 2009 .
they therefore call it the " stockholm process . " dpa news agency -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

hess lies buried in the northern bavarian town . the wunsiedel democracy festival was being held for the fourth year in a row to express support for the ban , which the right wing has tried to overturn . local police said npd supporters had largely adhered to the court ban .
three carloads of party supporters had been stopped and told to turn around , a police spokesman said . after world war ii , hess , who was hitler 's deputy until flying on a mysterious mission to britain in 1941 , received a life sentence at the nuremberg trials .

the tampere process , launched in 1999 , is the series of talks which eu member states are holding to discuss how they can improve cooperation on sensitive issues of justice and internal affairs .
the process was given a renewed impulse at a summit in the hague in 2004 - whereupon some officials renamed it the " hague process . "
however , some diplomats say that the process will receive a new impulse when sweden takes over the eu 's rotating presidency in the second half of 2009 .
they therefore call it the " stockholm process . " dpa news agency -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de in focus : dossier : getting the hang of the eu despite expansion , europe still ca n't define " european " european union makes a meal of regional treats could mutual ridicule be a sign of successful eu integration ?
will the real heart of europe please stand up ? european union -pipe- 17.08.2008 the hitch-hiker 's guide to understanding eu jargon großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the irish had nothing against the city but were vehemently against the treaty the problem with eu jargon is that you need both a political dictionary and a map to understand it .
here is a brief list of the eu 's more obscure place-names and a explanation of the processes they refer to . it sometimes seems that half of the eu 's main policies were named after the cities in which they were created .
the problem is that the nicknames almost never come with footnotes , leaving the unsuspecting visitor drowning in a sea of place-names .
barcelona is best known in the eu as the place where european , north african and middle eastern leaders met in november 1995 to try and improve their often-strained relationship .
the result was the " barcelona process , " by which the eu tried to boost trade and political ties with its mediterranean neighbors while urging them to do more for human rights and regional peace .
the process seldom made headlines until early 2007 , when french president nicolas sarkozy proposed scrapping it and creating a much more sweeping " mediterranean union " modeled on the eu .
eu members without a mediterranean coastline blocked the idea , but allowed sarkozy to launch on july 13 a watered-down version catchily titled the " barcelona process : union for the mediterranean . "
copenhagen : denmark 's capital has become eu code for the set of standards which countries have to meet if they want to join the bloc .
the " copenhagen criteria , " adopted in june 1993 , say that a state should be able to preserve democracy and human rights , have a market economy and accept the eu 's " obligations and intent , " such as peace .
over the last year , the criteria have most often been mentioned in the context of eu hopefuls macedonia , serbia and turkey , all of whom have been accused by critics of falling short in key areas .
dublin : famous for its literary giants , its dark beer and its distressing tendency to reject eu treaties , " dublin , " in eu circles , is a term used when talking about refugees .
the " dublin convention , " which came into force in 1997 , is aimed at streamlining the way eu member states deal with refugees and , in particular , deciding where each applicant should be dealt with .
with the current french presidency of the bloc pushing for an eu " pact " on migration , dublin is usually referred to when member states want to accuse one another of not doing enough for refugees .
the hague is famous as the home of various international courts , all of which tend to be nicknamed " the hague tribunal . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the hague hosts the international criminal court the one the eu refers to most often at present is the international criminal tribunal for the former yugoslavia -lrb- icty -rrb- , set up by the un in 1993 to deal with the atrocities committed in the separatist balkan wars of the 1990s .
while not an eu body , icty regularly features in eu meetings because the dutch government has vetoed any kind of eu rapprochement with serbia until icty 's chief prosecutor rules that the belgrade government is cooperating fully with his organization .
cities lend their name to treaties when european union leaders refer to the " lisbon agenda " or the " manchester declaration , " this is what they mean : lisbon : the lisbon agenda , agreed in march 2000 , is a plan aimed at making the eu the world 's most competitive economy by 2010 .
the lisbon treaty , signed in december 2007 , is an agreement between the bloc 's 27 member states aimed at making it easier to take eu-wide decisions and giving the union a higher profile abroad .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the treaty has put lisbon on the eu map with the eu lagging behind key rivals such as the united states and japan in terms of innovation , the word " lisbon " has in the past usually been used to describe the gap between the eu 's targets and its results .
however , since irish voters rejected the lisbon treaty in a referendum on june 12 , current headlines referring to " lisbon " usually refer to the treaty .
maastricht : the maastricht treaty , signed in 1992 , created the eu out of its forerunner , the european economic community , and set up the legal process that created the euro .
maastricht criteria are the strict rules on inflation and government spending that countries have to meet in order to join the euro .
the criteria last made the headlines in july , when eu finance ministers invited slovakia to become the euro club 's 16th member .
manchester : britain 's soccer giant is known in the eu for the political call , made by finance ministers in september 2005 , not to respond to fuel-price rises by cutting taxes .
barely mentioned until the recent oil-price surge , the manchester declaration has now come back to haunt ministers , as they urge one another in increasingly nervous tones not to break ranks . nice : the nice treaty , signed by eu leaders in 2001 , updated the union 's internal workings so the bloc could absorb 12 new member states between 2004 and 2007 .
its main remit was to set the number of votes in eu councils each member state should have , from 29 in germany to three in malta .
when eu leaders were negotiating the lisbon treaty in 2007 , poland , which stood to lose some of its voting power under the new rules , demanded that the nice voting weights remain unchanged , going into negotiations with the slogan " nice or death ! "
schengen : the schengen convention , which came into force in 1995 , abolished border barriers between belgium , france , germany , greece , italy , luxembourg , the netherlands , portugal and spain .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : schengen has gained international fame through the eu the agreement created the schengen zone , which now includes all the eu 's current members except britain , ireland , bulgaria and romania .
non-eu members iceland and norway are also in the zone .
schengen most recently hit the headlines in late 2007 , when it expanded to take in nine countries which joined the eu in 2004 .
tampere : the finnish town of tampere is best known in eu circles for its links with international law-enforcement .
the tampere process , launched in 1999 , is the series of talks which eu member states are holding to discuss how they can improve cooperation on sensitive issues of justice and internal affairs .

as german chancellor angela merkel heads to georgia on sunday , aug .
17 , to continue mediating in the ongoing conflict with russia , western experts mull the chances of escalations elsewhere in the former soviet sphere . when western powers in february gave their blessing to the independence of the serbian province of kosovo , opponents warned it would trigger separatist violence across europe .
now , with the fires of secessionist war still smoking in georgia and its breakaway provinces of abkhazia and south ossetia , the west is wondering nervously whether other conflicts might be about to break out elsewhere in the former ussr .
independence for the georgian provinces " would undoubtedly give impetus to independence ambitions " in the breakaway moldovan region of transnistria , said colonel christopher langton , security analyst at the institute for international strategic studies in london .
debate still rages as to the exact role played by russia in the georgian war , with tbilisi accusing moscow of aggression and moscow insisting that it only intervened to protect civilian lives .
but western analysts agree that before the conflict , russia was the breakaway regions ' main supporter - especially once georgia began to aim for nato membership following its 2003 " rose revolution . "
and they say that russia 's intervention is a warning for ukraine and moldova - two former-soviet states who are also edging towards the west , but who have russian military forces on their territory .
the conflict is " a stern warning to ukraine that what can happen if it tries to move closer to nato is the division of the country , " said security expert dusan reljic of the swp institute for international and security affairs in berlin .
it is also " the acceleration of russia 's ongoing effort to increase its influence " around its borders , langton said .
moscow has both a strong military presence and broad-based popular support in transnistria and ukraine 's crimean peninsula , which russia ceded to its " socialist brother " in 1954 .
ukraine monitoring its own separatist province bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bush and nato have plans for yushchenko 's ukraine and analysts now say that , given nato 's refusal to rule out further eastern expansions , moscow might feel that the best way to stall that process would be to promote secession in the two areas .
" when there are russian populations linked to russia , then those territories could break away ...
so if ukraine insists on joining nato , part of its territory could split away , " reljic said .
but is it really likely that russia would call for full independence for the crimea or transnistria , given the international storm which its actions in georgia have already provoked ? observers say that the option can not be ruled out in the long term , given that one of russia 's prime foreign-policy goals is to rebuild its own influence in europe at nato 's expense .
russian leaders have already said that they see nato 's offer of eventual membership for georgia and ukraine as a direct threat .
and that gives the crimea and transnistria immense strategic significance as two russian-dominated areas on ukraine 's fringe .
ukraine 's desire for nato membership " makes transnistria strategically important for russia , " while any increase in tension between moscow and kiev will " resonate in the crimea , " langton said .
in the short term , such fears are unlikely to materialize .
russia could assert power to scupper nato plans bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : georgia 's pounding puts its nato hopes in jeopardy russia 's hands are full dealing with the aftermath of the georgian war , and some nato members say the conflict proves that georgia is in any case not ready for membership .
but with key nato members , especially the us , pressing for ukraine and georgia to join , there is a danger that russia may end up feeling it has no choice but to weaken its neighbors before it is too late .
" in the past , the answer would have been no , this is not a proxy conflict between great powers .
but increasingly the answer is becoming yes , " langton said . dpa news agency -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

but is it really likely that russia would call for full independence for the crimea or transnistria , given the international storm which its actions in georgia have already provoked ? observers say that the option can not be ruled out in the long term , given that one of russia 's prime foreign-policy goals is to rebuild its own influence in europe at nato 's expense .
russian leaders have already said that they see nato 's offer of eventual membership for georgia and ukraine as a direct threat .
and that gives the crimea and transnistria immense strategic significance as two russian-dominated areas on ukraine 's fringe .
ukraine 's desire for nato membership " makes transnistria strategically important for russia , " while any increase in tension between moscow and kiev will " resonate in the crimea , " langton said .
in the short term , such fears are unlikely to materialize .
russia could assert power to scupper nato plans bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : georgia 's pounding puts its nato hopes in jeopardy russia 's hands are full dealing with the aftermath of the georgian war , and some nato members say the conflict proves that georgia is in any case not ready for membership .
but with key nato members , especially the us , pressing for ukraine and georgia to join , there is a danger that russia may end up feeling it has no choice but to weaken its neighbors before it is too late .
" in the past , the answer would have been no , this is not a proxy conflict between great powers .
but increasingly the answer is becoming yes , " langton said . dpa news agency -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" georgia will become a member of nato if it wants to - and it does want to , " merkel said before talks with president mikheil saakashvili in tbilisi . it was one of the strongest statements yet of support for georgia 's nato membership bid which is fiercely opposed by russia .
the statement signals a change in germany 's position towards georgian nato membership .
earlier this year , germany led european resistance to plans , pushed by the us , to put georgia on the track to nato membership . later at a joint news conference with saakashvili , merkel said that though georgia was on a clear path to membership in nato she stood by her decision at a summit in april not to grant tbilisi a " membership action plan " for joining the alliance . at the last nato summit in bucharest in april , leaders agreed that georgia and ukraine should join the north atlantic treaty organization eventually , but neither nation was given candidate status and no timetables were set .

will the real heart of europe please stand up ? european union -pipe- 17.08.2008 the hitch-hiker 's guide to understanding eu jargon großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the irish had nothing against the city but were vehemently against the treaty the problem with eu jargon is that you need both a political dictionary and a map to understand it .
here is a brief list of the eu 's more obscure place-names and a explanation of the processes they refer to . it sometimes seems that half of the eu 's main policies were named after the cities in which they were created .
the problem is that the nicknames almost never come with footnotes , leaving the unsuspecting visitor drowning in a sea of place-names .
barcelona is best known in the eu as the place where european , north african and middle eastern leaders met in november 1995 to try and improve their often-strained relationship .
the result was the " barcelona process , " by which the eu tried to boost trade and political ties with its mediterranean neighbors while urging them to do more for human rights and regional peace .
the process seldom made headlines until early 2007 , when french president nicolas sarkozy proposed scrapping it and creating a much more sweeping " mediterranean union " modeled on the eu .
eu members without a mediterranean coastline blocked the idea , but allowed sarkozy to launch on july 13 a watered-down version catchily titled the " barcelona process : union for the mediterranean . "
copenhagen : denmark 's capital has become eu code for the set of standards which countries have to meet if they want to join the bloc .
the " copenhagen criteria , " adopted in june 1993 , say that a state should be able to preserve democracy and human rights , have a market economy and accept the eu 's " obligations and intent , " such as peace .
over the last year , the criteria have most often been mentioned in the context of eu hopefuls macedonia , serbia and turkey , all of whom have been accused by critics of falling short in key areas .
dublin : famous for its literary giants , its dark beer and its distressing tendency to reject eu treaties , " dublin , " in eu circles , is a term used when talking about refugees .
the " dublin convention , " which came into force in 1997 , is aimed at streamlining the way eu member states deal with refugees and , in particular , deciding where each applicant should be dealt with .
with the current french presidency of the bloc pushing for an eu " pact " on migration , dublin is usually referred to when member states want to accuse one another of not doing enough for refugees .
the hague is famous as the home of various international courts , all of which tend to be nicknamed " the hague tribunal . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the hague hosts the international criminal court the one the eu refers to most often at present is the international criminal tribunal for the former yugoslavia -lrb- icty -rrb- , set up by the un in 1993 to deal with the atrocities committed in the separatist balkan wars of the 1990s .
while not an eu body , icty regularly features in eu meetings because the dutch government has vetoed any kind of eu rapprochement with serbia until icty 's chief prosecutor rules that the belgrade government is cooperating fully with his organization .
cities lend their name to treaties when european union leaders refer to the " lisbon agenda " or the " manchester declaration , " this is what they mean : lisbon : the lisbon agenda , agreed in march 2000 , is a plan aimed at making the eu the world 's most competitive economy by 2010 .
the lisbon treaty , signed in december 2007 , is an agreement between the bloc 's 27 member states aimed at making it easier to take eu-wide decisions and giving the union a higher profile abroad .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the treaty has put lisbon on the eu map with the eu lagging behind key rivals such as the united states and japan in terms of innovation , the word " lisbon " has in the past usually been used to describe the gap between the eu 's targets and its results .
however , since irish voters rejected the lisbon treaty in a referendum on june 12 , current headlines referring to " lisbon " usually refer to the treaty .
maastricht : the maastricht treaty , signed in 1992 , created the eu out of its forerunner , the european economic community , and set up the legal process that created the euro .
maastricht criteria are the strict rules on inflation and government spending that countries have to meet in order to join the euro .
the criteria last made the headlines in july , when eu finance ministers invited slovakia to become the euro club 's 16th member .
manchester : britain 's soccer giant is known in the eu for the political call , made by finance ministers in september 2005 , not to respond to fuel-price rises by cutting taxes .
barely mentioned until the recent oil-price surge , the manchester declaration has now come back to haunt ministers , as they urge one another in increasingly nervous tones not to break ranks . nice : the nice treaty , signed by eu leaders in 2001 , updated the union 's internal workings so the bloc could absorb 12 new member states between 2004 and 2007 .
its main remit was to set the number of votes in eu councils each member state should have , from 29 in germany to three in malta .
when eu leaders were negotiating the lisbon treaty in 2007 , poland , which stood to lose some of its voting power under the new rules , demanded that the nice voting weights remain unchanged , going into negotiations with the slogan " nice or death ! "
schengen : the schengen convention , which came into force in 1995 , abolished border barriers between belgium , france , germany , greece , italy , luxembourg , the netherlands , portugal and spain .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : schengen has gained international fame through the eu the agreement created the schengen zone , which now includes all the eu 's current members except britain , ireland , bulgaria and romania .
non-eu members iceland and norway are also in the zone .
schengen most recently hit the headlines in late 2007 , when it expanded to take in nine countries which joined the eu in 2004 .
tampere : the finnish town of tampere is best known in eu circles for its links with international law-enforcement .
the tampere process , launched in 1999 , is the series of talks which eu member states are holding to discuss how they can improve cooperation on sensitive issues of justice and internal affairs .
the process was given a renewed impulse at a summit in the hague in 2004 - whereupon some officials renamed it the " hague process . "
however , some diplomats say that the process will receive a new impulse when sweden takes over the eu 's rotating presidency in the second half of 2009 .
they therefore call it the " stockholm process . " dpa news agency -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the german federal labor office has now started offering training courses for interested long-term unemployed , who receive some 160 hours of instruction to be able to work with patients . they have to have been unemployed for at least 12 months and show an interest in working in a nursing home , according to a report in german daily sueddeutsche zeitung .
after the training , they will be able to work as nursing care assistants , performing tasks such as reading to patients , talking with them or running errands for them . a brazen proposal ? geriatric care experts , who said that care assistants need to have at least 900 hours of training , were outraged by the proposal . " to equate dementia with handicrafts , reading to people and walking them is brazen , " helmut wallrafen-dreisow , a member of the german board for geriatric care .
" the health care companies want to get things done cheap , but nursing homes are meant to fulfill highest standards .
that does n't work . " dirk niebel , a leading member of germany 's opposition free-market liberal free democratic party called the move " labor-market policy charlatanism . "
germany 's unemployment figures have risen slightly after several years of steady decline . " the fact that someone 's unemployed alone is no qualification for a job in the health care sector , " he told mass tabloid bild am sonntag . better than nothing ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ulla schmidt defends the plan but german health minister ulla schmidt defended the project .
she said that many people with dementia are currently cared for by volunteers , who have received no training whatsoever . she also said that many of those interested in participating in the trainings already had experience working in the health care sector . " for many unemployed people , a job in a nursing home is a chance to rejoin the old line of work , " schmidt told dpa news agency .
" that 's especially true for women . " experts doubt , however , that labor office officials will find enough people to fill the positions .
according to sueddeutsche zeitung , 10,157 vacant positions are currently registered with the office nationwide - despite the fact that some 30,000 health care workers are currently registered as unemployed . dw staff -lrb- win -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de in focus : dossier : getting the hang of the eu despite expansion , europe still ca n't define " european " european union makes a meal of regional treats could mutual ridicule be a sign of successful eu integration ?
will the real heart of europe please stand up ? european union -pipe- 17.08.2008 the hitch-hiker 's guide to understanding eu jargon großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the irish had nothing against the city but were vehemently against the treaty the problem with eu jargon is that you need both a political dictionary and a map to understand it .
here is a brief list of the eu 's more obscure place-names and a explanation of the processes they refer to . it sometimes seems that half of the eu 's main policies were named after the cities in which they were created .
the problem is that the nicknames almost never come with footnotes , leaving the unsuspecting visitor drowning in a sea of place-names .
barcelona is best known in the eu as the place where european , north african and middle eastern leaders met in november 1995 to try and improve their often-strained relationship .
the result was the " barcelona process , " by which the eu tried to boost trade and political ties with its mediterranean neighbors while urging them to do more for human rights and regional peace .
the process seldom made headlines until early 2007 , when french president nicolas sarkozy proposed scrapping it and creating a much more sweeping " mediterranean union " modeled on the eu .
eu members without a mediterranean coastline blocked the idea , but allowed sarkozy to launch on july 13 a watered-down version catchily titled the " barcelona process : union for the mediterranean . "
copenhagen : denmark 's capital has become eu code for the set of standards which countries have to meet if they want to join the bloc .
the " copenhagen criteria , " adopted in june 1993 , say that a state should be able to preserve democracy and human rights , have a market economy and accept the eu 's " obligations and intent , " such as peace .
over the last year , the criteria have most often been mentioned in the context of eu hopefuls macedonia , serbia and turkey , all of whom have been accused by critics of falling short in key areas .
dublin : famous for its literary giants , its dark beer and its distressing tendency to reject eu treaties , " dublin , " in eu circles , is a term used when talking about refugees .
the " dublin convention , " which came into force in 1997 , is aimed at streamlining the way eu member states deal with refugees and , in particular , deciding where each applicant should be dealt with .
with the current french presidency of the bloc pushing for an eu " pact " on migration , dublin is usually referred to when member states want to accuse one another of not doing enough for refugees .
the hague is famous as the home of various international courts , all of which tend to be nicknamed " the hague tribunal . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the hague hosts the international criminal court the one the eu refers to most often at present is the international criminal tribunal for the former yugoslavia -lrb- icty -rrb- , set up by the un in 1993 to deal with the atrocities committed in the separatist balkan wars of the 1990s .
while not an eu body , icty regularly features in eu meetings because the dutch government has vetoed any kind of eu rapprochement with serbia until icty 's chief prosecutor rules that the belgrade government is cooperating fully with his organization .
cities lend their name to treaties when european union leaders refer to the " lisbon agenda " or the " manchester declaration , " this is what they mean : lisbon : the lisbon agenda , agreed in march 2000 , is a plan aimed at making the eu the world 's most competitive economy by 2010 .
the lisbon treaty , signed in december 2007 , is an agreement between the bloc 's 27 member states aimed at making it easier to take eu-wide decisions and giving the union a higher profile abroad .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the treaty has put lisbon on the eu map with the eu lagging behind key rivals such as the united states and japan in terms of innovation , the word " lisbon " has in the past usually been used to describe the gap between the eu 's targets and its results .
however , since irish voters rejected the lisbon treaty in a referendum on june 12 , current headlines referring to " lisbon " usually refer to the treaty .
maastricht : the maastricht treaty , signed in 1992 , created the eu out of its forerunner , the european economic community , and set up the legal process that created the euro .
maastricht criteria are the strict rules on inflation and government spending that countries have to meet in order to join the euro .
the criteria last made the headlines in july , when eu finance ministers invited slovakia to become the euro club 's 16th member .
manchester : britain 's soccer giant is known in the eu for the political call , made by finance ministers in september 2005 , not to respond to fuel-price rises by cutting taxes .
barely mentioned until the recent oil-price surge , the manchester declaration has now come back to haunt ministers , as they urge one another in increasingly nervous tones not to break ranks . nice : the nice treaty , signed by eu leaders in 2001 , updated the union 's internal workings so the bloc could absorb 12 new member states between 2004 and 2007 .
its main remit was to set the number of votes in eu councils each member state should have , from 29 in germany to three in malta .
when eu leaders were negotiating the lisbon treaty in 2007 , poland , which stood to lose some of its voting power under the new rules , demanded that the nice voting weights remain unchanged , going into negotiations with the slogan " nice or death ! "
schengen : the schengen convention , which came into force in 1995 , abolished border barriers between belgium , france , germany , greece , italy , luxembourg , the netherlands , portugal and spain .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : schengen has gained international fame through the eu the agreement created the schengen zone , which now includes all the eu 's current members except britain , ireland , bulgaria and romania .
non-eu members iceland and norway are also in the zone .
schengen most recently hit the headlines in late 2007 , when it expanded to take in nine countries which joined the eu in 2004 .
tampere : the finnish town of tampere is best known in eu circles for its links with international law-enforcement .
the tampere process , launched in 1999 , is the series of talks which eu member states are holding to discuss how they can improve cooperation on sensitive issues of justice and internal affairs .
the process was given a renewed impulse at a summit in the hague in 2004 - whereupon some officials renamed it the " hague process . "
however , some diplomats say that the process will receive a new impulse when sweden takes over the eu 's rotating presidency in the second half of 2009 .
they therefore call it the " stockholm process . " dpa news agency -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

as german chancellor angela merkel heads to georgia on sunday , aug .
17 , to continue mediating in the ongoing conflict with russia , western experts mull the chances of escalations elsewhere in the former soviet sphere . when western powers in february gave their blessing to the independence of the serbian province of kosovo , opponents warned it would trigger separatist violence across europe .
now , with the fires of secessionist war still smoking in georgia and its breakaway provinces of abkhazia and south ossetia , the west is wondering nervously whether other conflicts might be about to break out elsewhere in the former ussr .
independence for the georgian provinces " would undoubtedly give impetus to independence ambitions " in the breakaway moldovan region of transnistria , said colonel christopher langton , security analyst at the institute for international strategic studies in london .
debate still rages as to the exact role played by russia in the georgian war , with tbilisi accusing moscow of aggression and moscow insisting that it only intervened to protect civilian lives .
but western analysts agree that before the conflict , russia was the breakaway regions ' main supporter - especially once georgia began to aim for nato membership following its 2003 " rose revolution . "
and they say that russia 's intervention is a warning for ukraine and moldova - two former-soviet states who are also edging towards the west , but who have russian military forces on their territory .
the conflict is " a stern warning to ukraine that what can happen if it tries to move closer to nato is the division of the country , " said security expert dusan reljic of the swp institute for international and security affairs in berlin .
it is also " the acceleration of russia 's ongoing effort to increase its influence " around its borders , langton said .
moscow has both a strong military presence and broad-based popular support in transnistria and ukraine 's crimean peninsula , which russia ceded to its " socialist brother " in 1954 .
ukraine monitoring its own separatist province bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bush and nato have plans for yushchenko 's ukraine and analysts now say that , given nato 's refusal to rule out further eastern expansions , moscow might feel that the best way to stall that process would be to promote secession in the two areas .
" when there are russian populations linked to russia , then those territories could break away ...
so if ukraine insists on joining nato , part of its territory could split away , " reljic said .
but is it really likely that russia would call for full independence for the crimea or transnistria , given the international storm which its actions in georgia have already provoked ? observers say that the option can not be ruled out in the long term , given that one of russia 's prime foreign-policy goals is to rebuild its own influence in europe at nato 's expense .
russian leaders have already said that they see nato 's offer of eventual membership for georgia and ukraine as a direct threat .
and that gives the crimea and transnistria immense strategic significance as two russian-dominated areas on ukraine 's fringe .
ukraine 's desire for nato membership " makes transnistria strategically important for russia , " while any increase in tension between moscow and kiev will " resonate in the crimea , " langton said .
in the short term , such fears are unlikely to materialize .
russia could assert power to scupper nato plans bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : georgia 's pounding puts its nato hopes in jeopardy russia 's hands are full dealing with the aftermath of the georgian war , and some nato members say the conflict proves that georgia is in any case not ready for membership .
but with key nato members , especially the us , pressing for ukraine and georgia to join , there is a danger that russia may end up feeling it has no choice but to weaken its neighbors before it is too late .

and that gives the crimea and transnistria immense strategic significance as two russian-dominated areas on ukraine 's fringe .
ukraine 's desire for nato membership " makes transnistria strategically important for russia , " while any increase in tension between moscow and kiev will " resonate in the crimea , " langton said .
in the short term , such fears are unlikely to materialize .
russia could assert power to scupper nato plans bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : georgia 's pounding puts its nato hopes in jeopardy russia 's hands are full dealing with the aftermath of the georgian war , and some nato members say the conflict proves that georgia is in any case not ready for membership .
but with key nato members , especially the us , pressing for ukraine and georgia to join , there is a danger that russia may end up feeling it has no choice but to weaken its neighbors before it is too late .
" in the past , the answer would have been no , this is not a proxy conflict between great powers .
but increasingly the answer is becoming yes , " langton said . dpa news agency -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

dw 's karl zawadzky says the country has to face the fact the party is over . one thing is clear - germany is past its peak when it comes to economic performance .
the party - surging exports and strong domestic investments - is over .
still , there 's some tangible relief at the reversal in economic fortunes because things could have been much worse .
the german economy shrank by 0.5 percent in the second quarter of this year - that 's bad but it 's not going to really cripple the country 's economy .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : karl zawadzky it would be highly surprising if all the big economic powers could simply shrug off the negative factors that have in recent times plunged the global economy into crisis .
in the us , an absolutely superficially-financed housing bubble has burst , triggering a finance and banking crisis in america and europe .
the real estate boom is also over in britain and spain , two large european union nations .
the dollar has taken a battering while the rise of the euro has thrown a dampener on european exports .
oil prices have climbed to levels unimaginable until recently and food prices have skyrocketed .
finally , inflation in the euro zone has soared out of control , prompting the european central bank to raise interest rates .
all this has put a brake on germany 's economic growth rate .
within a short period , both corporate and consumer sentiment has plummeted .
talk of a long-lasting economic upturn has been replaced by dire predictions of stagnation or even recession coupled with a lasting price rise .
but the facts speak against it .
the weather is one of the main reasons for germany 's economic slowdown .
whether it had to with climate change or not , the fact is that the last winter practically did n't materialize .
add to it the fact that tax benefits for the construction sector were phased out .
both those factors led to the fact that construction sites early this year were n't closed , as is usually the case , but rather that the economy grew in the first quarter by 1.5 percent - something it has n't done in 12 years .
this surge in growth was missing in the second quarter .
that means slowing economic growth is partly due to statistical interpretation .
if you assess the first two quarters of this year individually , a dramatic decline becomes apparent .
if you consider the first half of the year as a whole , you have an economic growth rate of 1.2 percent .
in the face of the negative factors affecting the world economy , it 's quite substantial .
but one thing is clear - if the global economy has to battle with serious problems such as high oil prices , a finance crisis and volatile currency markets , it will drag the german economy into the crisis .
that 's because the german economy , like no other economic power , is reliant on exports which make up almost half of germany 's economic performance .
a decade ago , that share was only 27 percent .
the current economic downturn looks worse than it actually is .
it wo n't change the fact that germany 's economy will grow in the current year .
german economics minister michael glos is sticking to growth predictions of 1.7 percent .
but that 's one percentage point less than last year ; for the coming year , experts predict a further worsening of the economy .
it 's not the decline in the second quarter but rather the downward trend that 's sparked concerns because it 's coupled with a strong price rise that hampers the much needed lowering of interest rates by the european central bank .
developments on the labor market are still positive but a lasting economic slowdown will soon change that .
the ranks of unemployed will rise again .
there 's a reason for the bleak outlook - the party is over .
for many , it 's associated with a hangover - just like in real life .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de in focus : dossier : getting the hang of the eu despite expansion , europe still ca n't define " european " european union makes a meal of regional treats could mutual ridicule be a sign of successful eu integration ?
will the real heart of europe please stand up ? european union -pipe- 17.08.2008 the hitch-hiker 's guide to understanding eu jargon großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the irish had nothing against the city but were vehemently against the treaty the problem with eu jargon is that you need both a political dictionary and a map to understand it .
here is a brief list of the eu 's more obscure place-names and a explanation of the processes they refer to . it sometimes seems that half of the eu 's main policies were named after the cities in which they were created .
the problem is that the nicknames almost never come with footnotes , leaving the unsuspecting visitor drowning in a sea of place-names .
barcelona is best known in the eu as the place where european , north african and middle eastern leaders met in november 1995 to try and improve their often-strained relationship .
the result was the " barcelona process , " by which the eu tried to boost trade and political ties with its mediterranean neighbors while urging them to do more for human rights and regional peace .
the process seldom made headlines until early 2007 , when french president nicolas sarkozy proposed scrapping it and creating a much more sweeping " mediterranean union " modeled on the eu .
eu members without a mediterranean coastline blocked the idea , but allowed sarkozy to launch on july 13 a watered-down version catchily titled the " barcelona process : union for the mediterranean . "
copenhagen : denmark 's capital has become eu code for the set of standards which countries have to meet if they want to join the bloc .
the " copenhagen criteria , " adopted in june 1993 , say that a state should be able to preserve democracy and human rights , have a market economy and accept the eu 's " obligations and intent , " such as peace .
over the last year , the criteria have most often been mentioned in the context of eu hopefuls macedonia , serbia and turkey , all of whom have been accused by critics of falling short in key areas .
dublin : famous for its literary giants , its dark beer and its distressing tendency to reject eu treaties , " dublin , " in eu circles , is a term used when talking about refugees .
the " dublin convention , " which came into force in 1997 , is aimed at streamlining the way eu member states deal with refugees and , in particular , deciding where each applicant should be dealt with .
with the current french presidency of the bloc pushing for an eu " pact " on migration , dublin is usually referred to when member states want to accuse one another of not doing enough for refugees .
the hague is famous as the home of various international courts , all of which tend to be nicknamed " the hague tribunal . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the hague hosts the international criminal court the one the eu refers to most often at present is the international criminal tribunal for the former yugoslavia -lrb- icty -rrb- , set up by the un in 1993 to deal with the atrocities committed in the separatist balkan wars of the 1990s .
while not an eu body , icty regularly features in eu meetings because the dutch government has vetoed any kind of eu rapprochement with serbia until icty 's chief prosecutor rules that the belgrade government is cooperating fully with his organization .
cities lend their name to treaties when european union leaders refer to the " lisbon agenda " or the " manchester declaration , " this is what they mean : lisbon : the lisbon agenda , agreed in march 2000 , is a plan aimed at making the eu the world 's most competitive economy by 2010 .
the lisbon treaty , signed in december 2007 , is an agreement between the bloc 's 27 member states aimed at making it easier to take eu-wide decisions and giving the union a higher profile abroad .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the treaty has put lisbon on the eu map with the eu lagging behind key rivals such as the united states and japan in terms of innovation , the word " lisbon " has in the past usually been used to describe the gap between the eu 's targets and its results .
however , since irish voters rejected the lisbon treaty in a referendum on june 12 , current headlines referring to " lisbon " usually refer to the treaty .
maastricht : the maastricht treaty , signed in 1992 , created the eu out of its forerunner , the european economic community , and set up the legal process that created the euro .
maastricht criteria are the strict rules on inflation and government spending that countries have to meet in order to join the euro .
the criteria last made the headlines in july , when eu finance ministers invited slovakia to become the euro club 's 16th member .
manchester : britain 's soccer giant is known in the eu for the political call , made by finance ministers in september 2005 , not to respond to fuel-price rises by cutting taxes .
barely mentioned until the recent oil-price surge , the manchester declaration has now come back to haunt ministers , as they urge one another in increasingly nervous tones not to break ranks . nice : the nice treaty , signed by eu leaders in 2001 , updated the union 's internal workings so the bloc could absorb 12 new member states between 2004 and 2007 .
its main remit was to set the number of votes in eu councils each member state should have , from 29 in germany to three in malta .
when eu leaders were negotiating the lisbon treaty in 2007 , poland , which stood to lose some of its voting power under the new rules , demanded that the nice voting weights remain unchanged , going into negotiations with the slogan " nice or death ! "
schengen : the schengen convention , which came into force in 1995 , abolished border barriers between belgium , france , germany , greece , italy , luxembourg , the netherlands , portugal and spain .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : schengen has gained international fame through the eu the agreement created the schengen zone , which now includes all the eu 's current members except britain , ireland , bulgaria and romania .
non-eu members iceland and norway are also in the zone .
schengen most recently hit the headlines in late 2007 , when it expanded to take in nine countries which joined the eu in 2004 .
tampere : the finnish town of tampere is best known in eu circles for its links with international law-enforcement .
the tampere process , launched in 1999 , is the series of talks which eu member states are holding to discuss how they can improve cooperation on sensitive issues of justice and internal affairs .
the process was given a renewed impulse at a summit in the hague in 2004 - whereupon some officials renamed it the " hague process . "

the german federal labor office has now started offering training courses for interested long-term unemployed , who receive some 160 hours of instruction to be able to work with patients . they have to have been unemployed for at least 12 months and show an interest in working in a nursing home , according to a report in german daily sueddeutsche zeitung .
after the training , they will be able to work as nursing care assistants , performing tasks such as reading to patients , talking with them or running errands for them . a brazen proposal ? geriatric care experts , who said that care assistants need to have at least 900 hours of training , were outraged by the proposal . " to equate dementia with handicrafts , reading to people and walking them is brazen , " helmut wallrafen-dreisow , a member of the german board for geriatric care .
" the health care companies want to get things done cheap , but nursing homes are meant to fulfill highest standards .
that does n't work . " dirk niebel , a leading member of germany 's opposition free-market liberal free democratic party called the move " labor-market policy charlatanism . "
germany 's unemployment figures have risen slightly after several years of steady decline . " the fact that someone 's unemployed alone is no qualification for a job in the health care sector , " he told mass tabloid bild am sonntag . better than nothing ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ulla schmidt defends the plan but german health minister ulla schmidt defended the project .
she said that many people with dementia are currently cared for by volunteers , who have received no training whatsoever . she also said that many of those interested in participating in the trainings already had experience working in the health care sector . " for many unemployed people , a job in a nursing home is a chance to rejoin the old line of work , " schmidt told dpa news agency .
" that 's especially true for women . " experts doubt , however , that labor office officials will find enough people to fill the positions .
according to sueddeutsche zeitung , 10,157 vacant positions are currently registered with the office nationwide - despite the fact that some 30,000 health care workers are currently registered as unemployed . dw staff -lrb- win -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" georgia will become a member of nato if it wants to - and it does want to , " merkel said before talks with president mikheil saakashvili in tbilisi . it was one of the strongest statements yet of support for georgia 's nato membership bid which is fiercely opposed by russia .
the statement signals a change in germany 's position towards georgian nato membership .
earlier this year , germany led european resistance to plans , pushed by the us , to put georgia on the track to nato membership . later at a joint news conference with saakashvili , merkel said that though georgia was on a clear path to membership in nato she stood by her decision at a summit in april not to grant tbilisi a " membership action plan " for joining the alliance . at the last nato summit in bucharest in april , leaders agreed that georgia and ukraine should join the north atlantic treaty organization eventually , but neither nation was given candidate status and no timetables were set .
the united states is strongly in favour of georgia joining nato , but misgivings from france and germany prevented tbilisi being awarded full candidate status in bucharest . medvedev confirms pull-out in a meeting with medvedev in the black sea resort of sochi on friday , merkel had criticized russian actions during the week-long war between russia and georgia over the breakaway region of south ossetia .
she demanded that russia withdraw all its troops from georgia 's core territory . the georgian government says rebel abkhaz forces with the support of russian troops are occupying 13 georgian villages , effectively pushing the border of abkhazia westwards into georgia proper . medvedev said sunday that russian regular forces would start their pullout from georgia on monday , the kremlin said .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : medvedev has confirmed russia will begin withdrawing troops from georgia " from tomorrow , russia will begin withdrawing its military forces that are supporting russian peacekeepers , " medvedev told french president nicolas sarkozy in a telephone conversation , the kremlin said in a statement . speaking at a sunday press conference in tbilisi , merkel said that despite medvedev 's commitment " according to the information i have available to me this -lrb- russian withdrawal -rrb- has not yet begun . "
merkel : georgia 's integrity must be respected merkel also repeated that germany 's position was that georgia 's territorial integrity was beyond question , and that its borders should be inviolate . in her meeting with medvedev , merkel also stressed that germany 's position was that georgia 's territorial integrity was beyond question and that saakashvili was a democratically elected president . government sources said ahead of her departure that she intended to push for " a complete cessation of hostilities . " " the ceasefire must be verifiable and lasting , " they said . bildunterschrift : the map shows where russian troops blew up a georgian railroad bridge near the capital tbilisi georgian media hald back from predictions of what effect , if any , merkel 's visit would have on russian troops currently occupying georgian territory . rustaveli 2 television described merkel 's presence in georgia as " part of an international effort to support georgia . " west divided on how to deal with russia german foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier warned on sunday against any knee-jerk reaction to the caucasus conflict in relations with russia .
" i do not advise ... any knee-jerk reaction such as suspending talks on a partnership and cooperation agreement -lrb- with the european union -rrb- .
that would signify that such an agreement is more important to the eu than to russia , " steinmeier said in an interview with german weekly welt am sonntag .
" or russia joining the world trade organisation -lrb- wto -rrb- : our interest in this is as great as russia itself .
talks in the nato-russian council are essential too .
because we need open lines of communication - to tbilisi and to moscow , " steinmeier told the paper .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : steinmeier 's comments on russia are in sharp contrast to the views held by other western nations steinmeier 's comments were at odds with the views of other eu members as well as the us .
french president nicolas sarkozy , whose country holds the rotating eu presidency until the end of the year , warned on sunday that russian relations with the eu would be seriously damaged if moscow failed to fully implement the peace deal it signed with georgia .
in a statement , sarkozy told medvedev of the " serious consequences that a failure to quickly and fully implement the deal would have on relations between russia and the european union . "
britain 's foreign secretary david miliband said on wednesday that the eu should reassess its relations with russia after its " aggressive " actions in georgia and decide whether " to proceed with the partnership and cooperation agreement . "
us secretary of state condoleezza rice said on sunday that moscow 's international reputation had taken a beating by its military action in georgia .
" russia overreached , used disproportionate force against a small neighbour and is now paying the price for that because russia 's reputation as a potential partner in international institutions , diplomatic , political , security , economic , is frankly , in tatters , " rice told nbc 's meet the press . dw staff -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de opinion -pipe- 17.08.2008 opinion : germany 's economic boom is over großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany 's economy shrank for the first time in four years , raising fears europe 's economic powerhouse may be headed for recession .
dw 's karl zawadzky says the country has to face the fact the party is over . one thing is clear - germany is past its peak when it comes to economic performance .
the party - surging exports and strong domestic investments - is over .
still , there 's some tangible relief at the reversal in economic fortunes because things could have been much worse .
the german economy shrank by 0.5 percent in the second quarter of this year - that 's bad but it 's not going to really cripple the country 's economy .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : karl zawadzky it would be highly surprising if all the big economic powers could simply shrug off the negative factors that have in recent times plunged the global economy into crisis .
in the us , an absolutely superficially-financed housing bubble has burst , triggering a finance and banking crisis in america and europe .
the real estate boom is also over in britain and spain , two large european union nations .
the dollar has taken a battering while the rise of the euro has thrown a dampener on european exports .
oil prices have climbed to levels unimaginable until recently and food prices have skyrocketed .
finally , inflation in the euro zone has soared out of control , prompting the european central bank to raise interest rates .
all this has put a brake on germany 's economic growth rate .
within a short period , both corporate and consumer sentiment has plummeted .
talk of a long-lasting economic upturn has been replaced by dire predictions of stagnation or even recession coupled with a lasting price rise .
but the facts speak against it .
the weather is one of the main reasons for germany 's economic slowdown .
whether it had to with climate change or not , the fact is that the last winter practically did n't materialize .
add to it the fact that tax benefits for the construction sector were phased out .
both those factors led to the fact that construction sites early this year were n't closed , as is usually the case , but rather that the economy grew in the first quarter by 1.5 percent - something it has n't done in 12 years .
this surge in growth was missing in the second quarter .
that means slowing economic growth is partly due to statistical interpretation .
if you assess the first two quarters of this year individually , a dramatic decline becomes apparent .
if you consider the first half of the year as a whole , you have an economic growth rate of 1.2 percent .
in the face of the negative factors affecting the world economy , it 's quite substantial .
but one thing is clear - if the global economy has to battle with serious problems such as high oil prices , a finance crisis and volatile currency markets , it will drag the german economy into the crisis .
that 's because the german economy , like no other economic power , is reliant on exports which make up almost half of germany 's economic performance .
a decade ago , that share was only 27 percent .
the current economic downturn looks worse than it actually is .
it wo n't change the fact that germany 's economy will grow in the current year .
german economics minister michael glos is sticking to growth predictions of 1.7 percent .
but that 's one percentage point less than last year ; for the coming year , experts predict a further worsening of the economy .
it 's not the decline in the second quarter but rather the downward trend that 's sparked concerns because it 's coupled with a strong price rise that hampers the much needed lowering of interest rates by the european central bank .
developments on the labor market are still positive but a lasting economic slowdown will soon change that .
the ranks of unemployed will rise again .
there 's a reason for the bleak outlook - the party is over .
for many , it 's associated with a hangover - just like in real life .

dw 's karl zawadzky says the country has to face the fact the party is over . one thing is clear - germany is past its peak when it comes to economic performance .
the party - surging exports and strong domestic investments - is over .
still , there 's some tangible relief at the reversal in economic fortunes because things could have been much worse .
the german economy shrank by 0.5 percent in the second quarter of this year - that 's bad but it 's not going to really cripple the country 's economy .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : karl zawadzky it would be highly surprising if all the big economic powers could simply shrug off the negative factors that have in recent times plunged the global economy into crisis .
in the us , an absolutely superficially-financed housing bubble has burst , triggering a finance and banking crisis in america and europe .
the real estate boom is also over in britain and spain , two large european union nations .
the dollar has taken a battering while the rise of the euro has thrown a dampener on european exports .
oil prices have climbed to levels unimaginable until recently and food prices have skyrocketed .
finally , inflation in the euro zone has soared out of control , prompting the european central bank to raise interest rates .
all this has put a brake on germany 's economic growth rate .
within a short period , both corporate and consumer sentiment has plummeted .
talk of a long-lasting economic upturn has been replaced by dire predictions of stagnation or even recession coupled with a lasting price rise .
but the facts speak against it .
the weather is one of the main reasons for germany 's economic slowdown .
whether it had to with climate change or not , the fact is that the last winter practically did n't materialize .
add to it the fact that tax benefits for the construction sector were phased out .
both those factors led to the fact that construction sites early this year were n't closed , as is usually the case , but rather that the economy grew in the first quarter by 1.5 percent - something it has n't done in 12 years .
this surge in growth was missing in the second quarter .
that means slowing economic growth is partly due to statistical interpretation .
if you assess the first two quarters of this year individually , a dramatic decline becomes apparent .
if you consider the first half of the year as a whole , you have an economic growth rate of 1.2 percent .
in the face of the negative factors affecting the world economy , it 's quite substantial .
but one thing is clear - if the global economy has to battle with serious problems such as high oil prices , a finance crisis and volatile currency markets , it will drag the german economy into the crisis .
that 's because the german economy , like no other economic power , is reliant on exports which make up almost half of germany 's economic performance .
a decade ago , that share was only 27 percent .
the current economic downturn looks worse than it actually is .
it wo n't change the fact that germany 's economy will grow in the current year .
german economics minister michael glos is sticking to growth predictions of 1.7 percent .
but that 's one percentage point less than last year ; for the coming year , experts predict a further worsening of the economy .
it 's not the decline in the second quarter but rather the downward trend that 's sparked concerns because it 's coupled with a strong price rise that hampers the much needed lowering of interest rates by the european central bank .
developments on the labor market are still positive but a lasting economic slowdown will soon change that .
the ranks of unemployed will rise again .
there 's a reason for the bleak outlook - the party is over .
for many , it 's associated with a hangover - just like in real life .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de in focus : dossier : getting the hang of the eu despite expansion , europe still ca n't define " european " european union makes a meal of regional treats could mutual ridicule be a sign of successful eu integration ?
will the real heart of europe please stand up ? european union -pipe- 17.08.2008 the hitch-hiker 's guide to understanding eu jargon großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the irish had nothing against the city but were vehemently against the treaty the problem with eu jargon is that you need both a political dictionary and a map to understand it .
here is a brief list of the eu 's more obscure place-names and a explanation of the processes they refer to . it sometimes seems that half of the eu 's main policies were named after the cities in which they were created .
the problem is that the nicknames almost never come with footnotes , leaving the unsuspecting visitor drowning in a sea of place-names .
barcelona is best known in the eu as the place where european , north african and middle eastern leaders met in november 1995 to try and improve their often-strained relationship .
the result was the " barcelona process , " by which the eu tried to boost trade and political ties with its mediterranean neighbors while urging them to do more for human rights and regional peace .
the process seldom made headlines until early 2007 , when french president nicolas sarkozy proposed scrapping it and creating a much more sweeping " mediterranean union " modeled on the eu .
eu members without a mediterranean coastline blocked the idea , but allowed sarkozy to launch on july 13 a watered-down version catchily titled the " barcelona process : union for the mediterranean . "
copenhagen : denmark 's capital has become eu code for the set of standards which countries have to meet if they want to join the bloc .
the " copenhagen criteria , " adopted in june 1993 , say that a state should be able to preserve democracy and human rights , have a market economy and accept the eu 's " obligations and intent , " such as peace .
over the last year , the criteria have most often been mentioned in the context of eu hopefuls macedonia , serbia and turkey , all of whom have been accused by critics of falling short in key areas .
dublin : famous for its literary giants , its dark beer and its distressing tendency to reject eu treaties , " dublin , " in eu circles , is a term used when talking about refugees .
the " dublin convention , " which came into force in 1997 , is aimed at streamlining the way eu member states deal with refugees and , in particular , deciding where each applicant should be dealt with .
with the current french presidency of the bloc pushing for an eu " pact " on migration , dublin is usually referred to when member states want to accuse one another of not doing enough for refugees .
the hague is famous as the home of various international courts , all of which tend to be nicknamed " the hague tribunal . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the hague hosts the international criminal court the one the eu refers to most often at present is the international criminal tribunal for the former yugoslavia -lrb- icty -rrb- , set up by the un in 1993 to deal with the atrocities committed in the separatist balkan wars of the 1990s .
while not an eu body , icty regularly features in eu meetings because the dutch government has vetoed any kind of eu rapprochement with serbia until icty 's chief prosecutor rules that the belgrade government is cooperating fully with his organization .
cities lend their name to treaties when european union leaders refer to the " lisbon agenda " or the " manchester declaration , " this is what they mean : lisbon : the lisbon agenda , agreed in march 2000 , is a plan aimed at making the eu the world 's most competitive economy by 2010 .
the lisbon treaty , signed in december 2007 , is an agreement between the bloc 's 27 member states aimed at making it easier to take eu-wide decisions and giving the union a higher profile abroad .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the treaty has put lisbon on the eu map with the eu lagging behind key rivals such as the united states and japan in terms of innovation , the word " lisbon " has in the past usually been used to describe the gap between the eu 's targets and its results .
however , since irish voters rejected the lisbon treaty in a referendum on june 12 , current headlines referring to " lisbon " usually refer to the treaty .
maastricht : the maastricht treaty , signed in 1992 , created the eu out of its forerunner , the european economic community , and set up the legal process that created the euro .
maastricht criteria are the strict rules on inflation and government spending that countries have to meet in order to join the euro .
the criteria last made the headlines in july , when eu finance ministers invited slovakia to become the euro club 's 16th member .
manchester : britain 's soccer giant is known in the eu for the political call , made by finance ministers in september 2005 , not to respond to fuel-price rises by cutting taxes .
barely mentioned until the recent oil-price surge , the manchester declaration has now come back to haunt ministers , as they urge one another in increasingly nervous tones not to break ranks . nice : the nice treaty , signed by eu leaders in 2001 , updated the union 's internal workings so the bloc could absorb 12 new member states between 2004 and 2007 .
its main remit was to set the number of votes in eu councils each member state should have , from 29 in germany to three in malta .
when eu leaders were negotiating the lisbon treaty in 2007 , poland , which stood to lose some of its voting power under the new rules , demanded that the nice voting weights remain unchanged , going into negotiations with the slogan " nice or death ! "
schengen : the schengen convention , which came into force in 1995 , abolished border barriers between belgium , france , germany , greece , italy , luxembourg , the netherlands , portugal and spain .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : schengen has gained international fame through the eu the agreement created the schengen zone , which now includes all the eu 's current members except britain , ireland , bulgaria and romania .
non-eu members iceland and norway are also in the zone .
schengen most recently hit the headlines in late 2007 , when it expanded to take in nine countries which joined the eu in 2004 .
tampere : the finnish town of tampere is best known in eu circles for its links with international law-enforcement .
the tampere process , launched in 1999 , is the series of talks which eu member states are holding to discuss how they can improve cooperation on sensitive issues of justice and internal affairs .
the process was given a renewed impulse at a summit in the hague in 2004 - whereupon some officials renamed it the " hague process . "
however , some diplomats say that the process will receive a new impulse when sweden takes over the eu 's rotating presidency in the second half of 2009 .

will the real heart of europe please stand up ? european union -pipe- 17.08.2008 the hitch-hiker 's guide to understanding eu jargon großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the irish had nothing against the city but were vehemently against the treaty the problem with eu jargon is that you need both a political dictionary and a map to understand it .
here is a brief list of the eu 's more obscure place-names and a explanation of the processes they refer to . it sometimes seems that half of the eu 's main policies were named after the cities in which they were created .
the problem is that the nicknames almost never come with footnotes , leaving the unsuspecting visitor drowning in a sea of place-names .
barcelona is best known in the eu as the place where european , north african and middle eastern leaders met in november 1995 to try and improve their often-strained relationship .
the result was the " barcelona process , " by which the eu tried to boost trade and political ties with its mediterranean neighbors while urging them to do more for human rights and regional peace .
the process seldom made headlines until early 2007 , when french president nicolas sarkozy proposed scrapping it and creating a much more sweeping " mediterranean union " modeled on the eu .
eu members without a mediterranean coastline blocked the idea , but allowed sarkozy to launch on july 13 a watered-down version catchily titled the " barcelona process : union for the mediterranean . "
copenhagen : denmark 's capital has become eu code for the set of standards which countries have to meet if they want to join the bloc .
the " copenhagen criteria , " adopted in june 1993 , say that a state should be able to preserve democracy and human rights , have a market economy and accept the eu 's " obligations and intent , " such as peace .
over the last year , the criteria have most often been mentioned in the context of eu hopefuls macedonia , serbia and turkey , all of whom have been accused by critics of falling short in key areas .
dublin : famous for its literary giants , its dark beer and its distressing tendency to reject eu treaties , " dublin , " in eu circles , is a term used when talking about refugees .
the " dublin convention , " which came into force in 1997 , is aimed at streamlining the way eu member states deal with refugees and , in particular , deciding where each applicant should be dealt with .
with the current french presidency of the bloc pushing for an eu " pact " on migration , dublin is usually referred to when member states want to accuse one another of not doing enough for refugees .

its main remit was to set the number of votes in eu councils each member state should have , from 29 in germany to three in malta .
when eu leaders were negotiating the lisbon treaty in 2007 , poland , which stood to lose some of its voting power under the new rules , demanded that the nice voting weights remain unchanged , going into negotiations with the slogan " nice or death ! "
schengen : the schengen convention , which came into force in 1995 , abolished border barriers between belgium , france , germany , greece , italy , luxembourg , the netherlands , portugal and spain .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : schengen has gained international fame through the eu the agreement created the schengen zone , which now includes all the eu 's current members except britain , ireland , bulgaria and romania .
non-eu members iceland and norway are also in the zone .
schengen most recently hit the headlines in late 2007 , when it expanded to take in nine countries which joined the eu in 2004 .
tampere : the finnish town of tampere is best known in eu circles for its links with international law-enforcement .
the tampere process , launched in 1999 , is the series of talks which eu member states are holding to discuss how they can improve cooperation on sensitive issues of justice and internal affairs .
the process was given a renewed impulse at a summit in the hague in 2004 - whereupon some officials renamed it the " hague process . "
however , some diplomats say that the process will receive a new impulse when sweden takes over the eu 's rotating presidency in the second half of 2009 .

will the real heart of europe please stand up ? european union -pipe- 17.08.2008 the hitch-hiker 's guide to understanding eu jargon großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the irish had nothing against the city but were vehemently against the treaty the problem with eu jargon is that you need both a political dictionary and a map to understand it .
here is a brief list of the eu 's more obscure place-names and a explanation of the processes they refer to . it sometimes seems that half of the eu 's main policies were named after the cities in which they were created .
the problem is that the nicknames almost never come with footnotes , leaving the unsuspecting visitor drowning in a sea of place-names .
barcelona is best known in the eu as the place where european , north african and middle eastern leaders met in november 1995 to try and improve their often-strained relationship .
the result was the " barcelona process , " by which the eu tried to boost trade and political ties with its mediterranean neighbors while urging them to do more for human rights and regional peace .
the process seldom made headlines until early 2007 , when french president nicolas sarkozy proposed scrapping it and creating a much more sweeping " mediterranean union " modeled on the eu .
eu members without a mediterranean coastline blocked the idea , but allowed sarkozy to launch on july 13 a watered-down version catchily titled the " barcelona process : union for the mediterranean . "
copenhagen : denmark 's capital has become eu code for the set of standards which countries have to meet if they want to join the bloc .
the " copenhagen criteria , " adopted in june 1993 , say that a state should be able to preserve democracy and human rights , have a market economy and accept the eu 's " obligations and intent , " such as peace .
over the last year , the criteria have most often been mentioned in the context of eu hopefuls macedonia , serbia and turkey , all of whom have been accused by critics of falling short in key areas .
dublin : famous for its literary giants , its dark beer and its distressing tendency to reject eu treaties , " dublin , " in eu circles , is a term used when talking about refugees .
the " dublin convention , " which came into force in 1997 , is aimed at streamlining the way eu member states deal with refugees and , in particular , deciding where each applicant should be dealt with .
with the current french presidency of the bloc pushing for an eu " pact " on migration , dublin is usually referred to when member states want to accuse one another of not doing enough for refugees .
the hague is famous as the home of various international courts , all of which tend to be nicknamed " the hague tribunal . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the hague hosts the international criminal court the one the eu refers to most often at present is the international criminal tribunal for the former yugoslavia -lrb- icty -rrb- , set up by the un in 1993 to deal with the atrocities committed in the separatist balkan wars of the 1990s .
while not an eu body , icty regularly features in eu meetings because the dutch government has vetoed any kind of eu rapprochement with serbia until icty 's chief prosecutor rules that the belgrade government is cooperating fully with his organization .
cities lend their name to treaties when european union leaders refer to the " lisbon agenda " or the " manchester declaration , " this is what they mean : lisbon : the lisbon agenda , agreed in march 2000 , is a plan aimed at making the eu the world 's most competitive economy by 2010 .
the lisbon treaty , signed in december 2007 , is an agreement between the bloc 's 27 member states aimed at making it easier to take eu-wide decisions and giving the union a higher profile abroad .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the treaty has put lisbon on the eu map with the eu lagging behind key rivals such as the united states and japan in terms of innovation , the word " lisbon " has in the past usually been used to describe the gap between the eu 's targets and its results .
however , since irish voters rejected the lisbon treaty in a referendum on june 12 , current headlines referring to " lisbon " usually refer to the treaty .
maastricht : the maastricht treaty , signed in 1992 , created the eu out of its forerunner , the european economic community , and set up the legal process that created the euro .
maastricht criteria are the strict rules on inflation and government spending that countries have to meet in order to join the euro .
the criteria last made the headlines in july , when eu finance ministers invited slovakia to become the euro club 's 16th member .
manchester : britain 's soccer giant is known in the eu for the political call , made by finance ministers in september 2005 , not to respond to fuel-price rises by cutting taxes .

as german chancellor angela merkel heads to georgia on sunday , aug .
17 , to continue mediating in the ongoing conflict with russia , western experts mull the chances of escalations elsewhere in the former soviet sphere . when western powers in february gave their blessing to the independence of the serbian province of kosovo , opponents warned it would trigger separatist violence across europe .
now , with the fires of secessionist war still smoking in georgia and its breakaway provinces of abkhazia and south ossetia , the west is wondering nervously whether other conflicts might be about to break out elsewhere in the former ussr .
independence for the georgian provinces " would undoubtedly give impetus to independence ambitions " in the breakaway moldovan region of transnistria , said colonel christopher langton , security analyst at the institute for international strategic studies in london .
debate still rages as to the exact role played by russia in the georgian war , with tbilisi accusing moscow of aggression and moscow insisting that it only intervened to protect civilian lives .
but western analysts agree that before the conflict , russia was the breakaway regions ' main supporter - especially once georgia began to aim for nato membership following its 2003 " rose revolution . "
and they say that russia 's intervention is a warning for ukraine and moldova - two former-soviet states who are also edging towards the west , but who have russian military forces on their territory .
the conflict is " a stern warning to ukraine that what can happen if it tries to move closer to nato is the division of the country , " said security expert dusan reljic of the swp institute for international and security affairs in berlin .
it is also " the acceleration of russia 's ongoing effort to increase its influence " around its borders , langton said .
moscow has both a strong military presence and broad-based popular support in transnistria and ukraine 's crimean peninsula , which russia ceded to its " socialist brother " in 1954 .
ukraine monitoring its own separatist province bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bush and nato have plans for yushchenko 's ukraine and analysts now say that , given nato 's refusal to rule out further eastern expansions , moscow might feel that the best way to stall that process would be to promote secession in the two areas .
" when there are russian populations linked to russia , then those territories could break away ...
so if ukraine insists on joining nato , part of its territory could split away , " reljic said .
but is it really likely that russia would call for full independence for the crimea or transnistria , given the international storm which its actions in georgia have already provoked ? observers say that the option can not be ruled out in the long term , given that one of russia 's prime foreign-policy goals is to rebuild its own influence in europe at nato 's expense .
russian leaders have already said that they see nato 's offer of eventual membership for georgia and ukraine as a direct threat .
and that gives the crimea and transnistria immense strategic significance as two russian-dominated areas on ukraine 's fringe .
ukraine 's desire for nato membership " makes transnistria strategically important for russia , " while any increase in tension between moscow and kiev will " resonate in the crimea , " langton said .
in the short term , such fears are unlikely to materialize .
russia could assert power to scupper nato plans bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : georgia 's pounding puts its nato hopes in jeopardy russia 's hands are full dealing with the aftermath of the georgian war , and some nato members say the conflict proves that georgia is in any case not ready for membership .
but with key nato members , especially the us , pressing for ukraine and georgia to join , there is a danger that russia may end up feeling it has no choice but to weaken its neighbors before it is too late .
" in the past , the answer would have been no , this is not a proxy conflict between great powers .
but increasingly the answer is becoming yes , " langton said . dpa news agency -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

as german chancellor angela merkel heads to georgia on sunday , aug .
17 , to continue mediating in the ongoing conflict with russia , western experts mull the chances of escalations elsewhere in the former soviet sphere . when western powers in february gave their blessing to the independence of the serbian province of kosovo , opponents warned it would trigger separatist violence across europe .
now , with the fires of secessionist war still smoking in georgia and its breakaway provinces of abkhazia and south ossetia , the west is wondering nervously whether other conflicts might be about to break out elsewhere in the former ussr .
independence for the georgian provinces " would undoubtedly give impetus to independence ambitions " in the breakaway moldovan region of transnistria , said colonel christopher langton , security analyst at the institute for international strategic studies in london .
debate still rages as to the exact role played by russia in the georgian war , with tbilisi accusing moscow of aggression and moscow insisting that it only intervened to protect civilian lives .
but western analysts agree that before the conflict , russia was the breakaway regions ' main supporter - especially once georgia began to aim for nato membership following its 2003 " rose revolution . "
and they say that russia 's intervention is a warning for ukraine and moldova - two former-soviet states who are also edging towards the west , but who have russian military forces on their territory .
the conflict is " a stern warning to ukraine that what can happen if it tries to move closer to nato is the division of the country , " said security expert dusan reljic of the swp institute for international and security affairs in berlin .
it is also " the acceleration of russia 's ongoing effort to increase its influence " around its borders , langton said .
moscow has both a strong military presence and broad-based popular support in transnistria and ukraine 's crimean peninsula , which russia ceded to its " socialist brother " in 1954 .
ukraine monitoring its own separatist province bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bush and nato have plans for yushchenko 's ukraine and analysts now say that , given nato 's refusal to rule out further eastern expansions , moscow might feel that the best way to stall that process would be to promote secession in the two areas .
" when there are russian populations linked to russia , then those territories could break away ...
so if ukraine insists on joining nato , part of its territory could split away , " reljic said .
but is it really likely that russia would call for full independence for the crimea or transnistria , given the international storm which its actions in georgia have already provoked ? observers say that the option can not be ruled out in the long term , given that one of russia 's prime foreign-policy goals is to rebuild its own influence in europe at nato 's expense .
russian leaders have already said that they see nato 's offer of eventual membership for georgia and ukraine as a direct threat .
and that gives the crimea and transnistria immense strategic significance as two russian-dominated areas on ukraine 's fringe .
ukraine 's desire for nato membership " makes transnistria strategically important for russia , " while any increase in tension between moscow and kiev will " resonate in the crimea , " langton said .
in the short term , such fears are unlikely to materialize .
russia could assert power to scupper nato plans bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : georgia 's pounding puts its nato hopes in jeopardy russia 's hands are full dealing with the aftermath of the georgian war , and some nato members say the conflict proves that georgia is in any case not ready for membership .
but with key nato members , especially the us , pressing for ukraine and georgia to join , there is a danger that russia may end up feeling it has no choice but to weaken its neighbors before it is too late .
" in the past , the answer would have been no , this is not a proxy conflict between great powers .
but increasingly the answer is becoming yes , " langton said . dpa news agency -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

ukraine 's desire for nato membership " makes transnistria strategically important for russia , " while any increase in tension between moscow and kiev will " resonate in the crimea , " langton said .
in the short term , such fears are unlikely to materialize .
russia could assert power to scupper nato plans bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : georgia 's pounding puts its nato hopes in jeopardy russia 's hands are full dealing with the aftermath of the georgian war , and some nato members say the conflict proves that georgia is in any case not ready for membership .
but with key nato members , especially the us , pressing for ukraine and georgia to join , there is a danger that russia may end up feeling it has no choice but to weaken its neighbors before it is too late .
" in the past , the answer would have been no , this is not a proxy conflict between great powers .
but increasingly the answer is becoming yes , " langton said . dpa news agency -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" georgia will become a member of nato if it wants to - and it does want to , " merkel said before talks with president mikheil saakashvili in tbilisi . it was one of the strongest statements yet of support for georgia 's nato membership bid which is fiercely opposed by russia .
the statement signals a change in germany 's position towards georgian nato membership .
earlier this year , germany led european resistance to plans , pushed by the us , to put georgia on the track to nato membership . later at a joint news conference with saakashvili , merkel said that though georgia was on a clear path to membership in nato she stood by her decision at a summit in april not to grant tbilisi a " membership action plan " for joining the alliance . at the last nato summit in bucharest in april , leaders agreed that georgia and ukraine should join the north atlantic treaty organization eventually , but neither nation was given candidate status and no timetables were set .
the united states is strongly in favour of georgia joining nato , but misgivings from france and germany prevented tbilisi being awarded full candidate status in bucharest . medvedev confirms pull-out in a meeting with medvedev in the black sea resort of sochi on friday , merkel had criticized russian actions during the week-long war between russia and georgia over the breakaway region of south ossetia .
she demanded that russia withdraw all its troops from georgia 's core territory . the georgian government says rebel abkhaz forces with the support of russian troops are occupying 13 georgian villages , effectively pushing the border of abkhazia westwards into georgia proper . medvedev said sunday that russian regular forces would start their pullout from georgia on monday , the kremlin said .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : medvedev has confirmed russia will begin withdrawing troops from georgia " from tomorrow , russia will begin withdrawing its military forces that are supporting russian peacekeepers , " medvedev told french president nicolas sarkozy in a telephone conversation , the kremlin said in a statement . speaking at a sunday press conference in tbilisi , merkel said that despite medvedev 's commitment " according to the information i have available to me this -lrb- russian withdrawal -rrb- has not yet begun . "
merkel : georgia 's integrity must be respected merkel also repeated that germany 's position was that georgia 's territorial integrity was beyond question , and that its borders should be inviolate . in her meeting with medvedev , merkel also stressed that germany 's position was that georgia 's territorial integrity was beyond question and that saakashvili was a democratically elected president . government sources said ahead of her departure that she intended to push for " a complete cessation of hostilities . " " the ceasefire must be verifiable and lasting , " they said . bildunterschrift : the map shows where russian troops blew up a georgian railroad bridge near the capital tbilisi georgian media hald back from predictions of what effect , if any , merkel 's visit would have on russian troops currently occupying georgian territory . rustaveli 2 television described merkel 's presence in georgia as " part of an international effort to support georgia . " west divided on how to deal with russia german foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier warned on sunday against any knee-jerk reaction to the caucasus conflict in relations with russia .
" i do not advise ... any knee-jerk reaction such as suspending talks on a partnership and cooperation agreement -lrb- with the european union -rrb- .
that would signify that such an agreement is more important to the eu than to russia , " steinmeier said in an interview with german weekly welt am sonntag .
" or russia joining the world trade organisation -lrb- wto -rrb- : our interest in this is as great as russia itself .
talks in the nato-russian council are essential too .
because we need open lines of communication - to tbilisi and to moscow , " steinmeier told the paper .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : steinmeier 's comments on russia are in sharp contrast to the views held by other western nations steinmeier 's comments were at odds with the views of other eu members as well as the us .
french president nicolas sarkozy , whose country holds the rotating eu presidency until the end of the year , warned on sunday that russian relations with the eu would be seriously damaged if moscow failed to fully implement the peace deal it signed with georgia .
in a statement , sarkozy told medvedev of the " serious consequences that a failure to quickly and fully implement the deal would have on relations between russia and the european union . "
britain 's foreign secretary david miliband said on wednesday that the eu should reassess its relations with russia after its " aggressive " actions in georgia and decide whether " to proceed with the partnership and cooperation agreement . "
us secretary of state condoleezza rice said on sunday that moscow 's international reputation had taken a beating by its military action in georgia .
" russia overreached , used disproportionate force against a small neighbour and is now paying the price for that because russia 's reputation as a potential partner in international institutions , diplomatic , political , security , economic , is frankly , in tatters , " rice told nbc 's meet the press . dw staff -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de in focus : dossier : getting the hang of the eu despite expansion , europe still ca n't define " european " european union makes a meal of regional treats could mutual ridicule be a sign of successful eu integration ?
will the real heart of europe please stand up ? european union -pipe- 17.08.2008 the hitch-hiker 's guide to understanding eu jargon großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the irish had nothing against the city but were vehemently against the treaty the problem with eu jargon is that you need both a political dictionary and a map to understand it .
here is a brief list of the eu 's more obscure place-names and a explanation of the processes they refer to . it sometimes seems that half of the eu 's main policies were named after the cities in which they were created .
the problem is that the nicknames almost never come with footnotes , leaving the unsuspecting visitor drowning in a sea of place-names .
barcelona is best known in the eu as the place where european , north african and middle eastern leaders met in november 1995 to try and improve their often-strained relationship .
the result was the " barcelona process , " by which the eu tried to boost trade and political ties with its mediterranean neighbors while urging them to do more for human rights and regional peace .
the process seldom made headlines until early 2007 , when french president nicolas sarkozy proposed scrapping it and creating a much more sweeping " mediterranean union " modeled on the eu .
eu members without a mediterranean coastline blocked the idea , but allowed sarkozy to launch on july 13 a watered-down version catchily titled the " barcelona process : union for the mediterranean . "
copenhagen : denmark 's capital has become eu code for the set of standards which countries have to meet if they want to join the bloc .
the " copenhagen criteria , " adopted in june 1993 , say that a state should be able to preserve democracy and human rights , have a market economy and accept the eu 's " obligations and intent , " such as peace .
over the last year , the criteria have most often been mentioned in the context of eu hopefuls macedonia , serbia and turkey , all of whom have been accused by critics of falling short in key areas .
dublin : famous for its literary giants , its dark beer and its distressing tendency to reject eu treaties , " dublin , " in eu circles , is a term used when talking about refugees .
the " dublin convention , " which came into force in 1997 , is aimed at streamlining the way eu member states deal with refugees and , in particular , deciding where each applicant should be dealt with .
with the current french presidency of the bloc pushing for an eu " pact " on migration , dublin is usually referred to when member states want to accuse one another of not doing enough for refugees .
the hague is famous as the home of various international courts , all of which tend to be nicknamed " the hague tribunal . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the hague hosts the international criminal court the one the eu refers to most often at present is the international criminal tribunal for the former yugoslavia -lrb- icty -rrb- , set up by the un in 1993 to deal with the atrocities committed in the separatist balkan wars of the 1990s .
while not an eu body , icty regularly features in eu meetings because the dutch government has vetoed any kind of eu rapprochement with serbia until icty 's chief prosecutor rules that the belgrade government is cooperating fully with his organization .
cities lend their name to treaties when european union leaders refer to the " lisbon agenda " or the " manchester declaration , " this is what they mean : lisbon : the lisbon agenda , agreed in march 2000 , is a plan aimed at making the eu the world 's most competitive economy by 2010 .
the lisbon treaty , signed in december 2007 , is an agreement between the bloc 's 27 member states aimed at making it easier to take eu-wide decisions and giving the union a higher profile abroad .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the treaty has put lisbon on the eu map with the eu lagging behind key rivals such as the united states and japan in terms of innovation , the word " lisbon " has in the past usually been used to describe the gap between the eu 's targets and its results .
however , since irish voters rejected the lisbon treaty in a referendum on june 12 , current headlines referring to " lisbon " usually refer to the treaty .
maastricht : the maastricht treaty , signed in 1992 , created the eu out of its forerunner , the european economic community , and set up the legal process that created the euro .
maastricht criteria are the strict rules on inflation and government spending that countries have to meet in order to join the euro .
the criteria last made the headlines in july , when eu finance ministers invited slovakia to become the euro club 's 16th member .
manchester : britain 's soccer giant is known in the eu for the political call , made by finance ministers in september 2005 , not to respond to fuel-price rises by cutting taxes .
barely mentioned until the recent oil-price surge , the manchester declaration has now come back to haunt ministers , as they urge one another in increasingly nervous tones not to break ranks . nice : the nice treaty , signed by eu leaders in 2001 , updated the union 's internal workings so the bloc could absorb 12 new member states between 2004 and 2007 .
its main remit was to set the number of votes in eu councils each member state should have , from 29 in germany to three in malta .
when eu leaders were negotiating the lisbon treaty in 2007 , poland , which stood to lose some of its voting power under the new rules , demanded that the nice voting weights remain unchanged , going into negotiations with the slogan " nice or death ! "
schengen : the schengen convention , which came into force in 1995 , abolished border barriers between belgium , france , germany , greece , italy , luxembourg , the netherlands , portugal and spain .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : schengen has gained international fame through the eu the agreement created the schengen zone , which now includes all the eu 's current members except britain , ireland , bulgaria and romania .
non-eu members iceland and norway are also in the zone .
schengen most recently hit the headlines in late 2007 , when it expanded to take in nine countries which joined the eu in 2004 .
tampere : the finnish town of tampere is best known in eu circles for its links with international law-enforcement .
the tampere process , launched in 1999 , is the series of talks which eu member states are holding to discuss how they can improve cooperation on sensitive issues of justice and internal affairs .
the process was given a renewed impulse at a summit in the hague in 2004 - whereupon some officials renamed it the " hague process . "
however , some diplomats say that the process will receive a new impulse when sweden takes over the eu 's rotating presidency in the second half of 2009 .
they therefore call it the " stockholm process . " dpa news agency -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the german federal labor office has now started offering training courses for interested long-term unemployed , who receive some 160 hours of instruction to be able to work with patients . they have to have been unemployed for at least 12 months and show an interest in working in a nursing home , according to a report in german daily sueddeutsche zeitung .
after the training , they will be able to work as nursing care assistants , performing tasks such as reading to patients , talking with them or running errands for them . a brazen proposal ? geriatric care experts , who said that care assistants need to have at least 900 hours of training , were outraged by the proposal . " to equate dementia with handicrafts , reading to people and walking them is brazen , " helmut wallrafen-dreisow , a member of the german board for geriatric care .
" the health care companies want to get things done cheap , but nursing homes are meant to fulfill highest standards .
that does n't work . " dirk niebel , a leading member of germany 's opposition free-market liberal free democratic party called the move " labor-market policy charlatanism . "
germany 's unemployment figures have risen slightly after several years of steady decline . " the fact that someone 's unemployed alone is no qualification for a job in the health care sector , " he told mass tabloid bild am sonntag . better than nothing ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ulla schmidt defends the plan but german health minister ulla schmidt defended the project .
she said that many people with dementia are currently cared for by volunteers , who have received no training whatsoever . she also said that many of those interested in participating in the trainings already had experience working in the health care sector . " for many unemployed people , a job in a nursing home is a chance to rejoin the old line of work , " schmidt told dpa news agency .
" that 's especially true for women . " experts doubt , however , that labor office officials will find enough people to fill the positions .
according to sueddeutsche zeitung , 10,157 vacant positions are currently registered with the office nationwide - despite the fact that some 30,000 health care workers are currently registered as unemployed . dw staff -lrb- win -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

dw 's karl zawadzky says the country has to face the fact the party is over . one thing is clear - germany is past its peak when it comes to economic performance .
the party - surging exports and strong domestic investments - is over .
still , there 's some tangible relief at the reversal in economic fortunes because things could have been much worse .
the german economy shrank by 0.5 percent in the second quarter of this year - that 's bad but it 's not going to really cripple the country 's economy .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : karl zawadzky it would be highly surprising if all the big economic powers could simply shrug off the negative factors that have in recent times plunged the global economy into crisis .
in the us , an absolutely superficially-financed housing bubble has burst , triggering a finance and banking crisis in america and europe .
the real estate boom is also over in britain and spain , two large european union nations .
the dollar has taken a battering while the rise of the euro has thrown a dampener on european exports .
oil prices have climbed to levels unimaginable until recently and food prices have skyrocketed .
finally , inflation in the euro zone has soared out of control , prompting the european central bank to raise interest rates .
all this has put a brake on germany 's economic growth rate .
within a short period , both corporate and consumer sentiment has plummeted .
talk of a long-lasting economic upturn has been replaced by dire predictions of stagnation or even recession coupled with a lasting price rise .
but the facts speak against it .
the weather is one of the main reasons for germany 's economic slowdown .
whether it had to with climate change or not , the fact is that the last winter practically did n't materialize .
add to it the fact that tax benefits for the construction sector were phased out .
both those factors led to the fact that construction sites early this year were n't closed , as is usually the case , but rather that the economy grew in the first quarter by 1.5 percent - something it has n't done in 12 years .
this surge in growth was missing in the second quarter .
that means slowing economic growth is partly due to statistical interpretation .
if you assess the first two quarters of this year individually , a dramatic decline becomes apparent .
if you consider the first half of the year as a whole , you have an economic growth rate of 1.2 percent .
in the face of the negative factors affecting the world economy , it 's quite substantial .
but one thing is clear - if the global economy has to battle with serious problems such as high oil prices , a finance crisis and volatile currency markets , it will drag the german economy into the crisis .
that 's because the german economy , like no other economic power , is reliant on exports which make up almost half of germany 's economic performance .
a decade ago , that share was only 27 percent .
the current economic downturn looks worse than it actually is .
it wo n't change the fact that germany 's economy will grow in the current year .
german economics minister michael glos is sticking to growth predictions of 1.7 percent .
but that 's one percentage point less than last year ; for the coming year , experts predict a further worsening of the economy .
it 's not the decline in the second quarter but rather the downward trend that 's sparked concerns because it 's coupled with a strong price rise that hampers the much needed lowering of interest rates by the european central bank .
developments on the labor market are still positive but a lasting economic slowdown will soon change that .
the ranks of unemployed will rise again .
there 's a reason for the bleak outlook - the party is over .
for many , it 's associated with a hangover - just like in real life .

as german chancellor angela merkel heads to georgia on sunday , aug .
17 , to continue mediating in the ongoing conflict with russia , western experts mull the chances of escalations elsewhere in the former soviet sphere . when western powers in february gave their blessing to the independence of the serbian province of kosovo , opponents warned it would trigger separatist violence across europe .
now , with the fires of secessionist war still smoking in georgia and its breakaway provinces of abkhazia and south ossetia , the west is wondering nervously whether other conflicts might be about to break out elsewhere in the former ussr .
independence for the georgian provinces " would undoubtedly give impetus to independence ambitions " in the breakaway moldovan region of transnistria , said colonel christopher langton , security analyst at the institute for international strategic studies in london .
debate still rages as to the exact role played by russia in the georgian war , with tbilisi accusing moscow of aggression and moscow insisting that it only intervened to protect civilian lives .
but western analysts agree that before the conflict , russia was the breakaway regions ' main supporter - especially once georgia began to aim for nato membership following its 2003 " rose revolution . "
and they say that russia 's intervention is a warning for ukraine and moldova - two former-soviet states who are also edging towards the west , but who have russian military forces on their territory .
the conflict is " a stern warning to ukraine that what can happen if it tries to move closer to nato is the division of the country , " said security expert dusan reljic of the swp institute for international and security affairs in berlin .
it is also " the acceleration of russia 's ongoing effort to increase its influence " around its borders , langton said .
moscow has both a strong military presence and broad-based popular support in transnistria and ukraine 's crimean peninsula , which russia ceded to its " socialist brother " in 1954 .
ukraine monitoring its own separatist province bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bush and nato have plans for yushchenko 's ukraine and analysts now say that , given nato 's refusal to rule out further eastern expansions , moscow might feel that the best way to stall that process would be to promote secession in the two areas .
" when there are russian populations linked to russia , then those territories could break away ...
so if ukraine insists on joining nato , part of its territory could split away , " reljic said .
but is it really likely that russia would call for full independence for the crimea or transnistria , given the international storm which its actions in georgia have already provoked ? observers say that the option can not be ruled out in the long term , given that one of russia 's prime foreign-policy goals is to rebuild its own influence in europe at nato 's expense .
russian leaders have already said that they see nato 's offer of eventual membership for georgia and ukraine as a direct threat .
and that gives the crimea and transnistria immense strategic significance as two russian-dominated areas on ukraine 's fringe .
ukraine 's desire for nato membership " makes transnistria strategically important for russia , " while any increase in tension between moscow and kiev will " resonate in the crimea , " langton said .
in the short term , such fears are unlikely to materialize .
russia could assert power to scupper nato plans bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : georgia 's pounding puts its nato hopes in jeopardy russia 's hands are full dealing with the aftermath of the georgian war , and some nato members say the conflict proves that georgia is in any case not ready for membership .
but with key nato members , especially the us , pressing for ukraine and georgia to join , there is a danger that russia may end up feeling it has no choice but to weaken its neighbors before it is too late .

independence for the georgian provinces " would undoubtedly give impetus to independence ambitions " in the breakaway moldovan region of transnistria , said colonel christopher langton , security analyst at the institute for international strategic studies in london .
debate still rages as to the exact role played by russia in the georgian war , with tbilisi accusing moscow of aggression and moscow insisting that it only intervened to protect civilian lives .
but western analysts agree that before the conflict , russia was the breakaway regions ' main supporter - especially once georgia began to aim for nato membership following its 2003 " rose revolution . "
and they say that russia 's intervention is a warning for ukraine and moldova - two former-soviet states who are also edging towards the west , but who have russian military forces on their territory .
the conflict is " a stern warning to ukraine that what can happen if it tries to move closer to nato is the division of the country , " said security expert dusan reljic of the swp institute for international and security affairs in berlin .
it is also " the acceleration of russia 's ongoing effort to increase its influence " around its borders , langton said .
moscow has both a strong military presence and broad-based popular support in transnistria and ukraine 's crimean peninsula , which russia ceded to its " socialist brother " in 1954 .
ukraine monitoring its own separatist province bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bush and nato have plans for yushchenko 's ukraine and analysts now say that , given nato 's refusal to rule out further eastern expansions , moscow might feel that the best way to stall that process would be to promote secession in the two areas .
" when there are russian populations linked to russia , then those territories could break away ...
so if ukraine insists on joining nato , part of its territory could split away , " reljic said .
but is it really likely that russia would call for full independence for the crimea or transnistria , given the international storm which its actions in georgia have already provoked ? observers say that the option can not be ruled out in the long term , given that one of russia 's prime foreign-policy goals is to rebuild its own influence in europe at nato 's expense .
russian leaders have already said that they see nato 's offer of eventual membership for georgia and ukraine as a direct threat .
and that gives the crimea and transnistria immense strategic significance as two russian-dominated areas on ukraine 's fringe .
ukraine 's desire for nato membership " makes transnistria strategically important for russia , " while any increase in tension between moscow and kiev will " resonate in the crimea , " langton said .
in the short term , such fears are unlikely to materialize .
russia could assert power to scupper nato plans bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : georgia 's pounding puts its nato hopes in jeopardy russia 's hands are full dealing with the aftermath of the georgian war , and some nato members say the conflict proves that georgia is in any case not ready for membership .
but with key nato members , especially the us , pressing for ukraine and georgia to join , there is a danger that russia may end up feeling it has no choice but to weaken its neighbors before it is too late .
" in the past , the answer would have been no , this is not a proxy conflict between great powers .
but increasingly the answer is becoming yes , " langton said . dpa news agency -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the german federal labor office has now started offering training courses for interested long-term unemployed , who receive some 160 hours of instruction to be able to work with patients . they have to have been unemployed for at least 12 months and show an interest in working in a nursing home , according to a report in german daily sueddeutsche zeitung .
after the training , they will be able to work as nursing care assistants , performing tasks such as reading to patients , talking with them or running errands for them . a brazen proposal ? geriatric care experts , who said that care assistants need to have at least 900 hours of training , were outraged by the proposal . " to equate dementia with handicrafts , reading to people and walking them is brazen , " helmut wallrafen-dreisow , a member of the german board for geriatric care .
" the health care companies want to get things done cheap , but nursing homes are meant to fulfill highest standards .
that does n't work . " dirk niebel , a leading member of germany 's opposition free-market liberal free democratic party called the move " labor-market policy charlatanism . "
germany 's unemployment figures have risen slightly after several years of steady decline . " the fact that someone 's unemployed alone is no qualification for a job in the health care sector , " he told mass tabloid bild am sonntag . better than nothing ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ulla schmidt defends the plan but german health minister ulla schmidt defended the project .
she said that many people with dementia are currently cared for by volunteers , who have received no training whatsoever . she also said that many of those interested in participating in the trainings already had experience working in the health care sector . " for many unemployed people , a job in a nursing home is a chance to rejoin the old line of work , " schmidt told dpa news agency .
" that 's especially true for women . " experts doubt , however , that labor office officials will find enough people to fill the positions .
according to sueddeutsche zeitung , 10,157 vacant positions are currently registered with the office nationwide - despite the fact that some 30,000 health care workers are currently registered as unemployed . dw staff -lrb- win -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de in focus : dossier : getting the hang of the eu despite expansion , europe still ca n't define " european " european union makes a meal of regional treats could mutual ridicule be a sign of successful eu integration ?
will the real heart of europe please stand up ? european union -pipe- 17.08.2008 the hitch-hiker 's guide to understanding eu jargon großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the irish had nothing against the city but were vehemently against the treaty the problem with eu jargon is that you need both a political dictionary and a map to understand it .
here is a brief list of the eu 's more obscure place-names and a explanation of the processes they refer to . it sometimes seems that half of the eu 's main policies were named after the cities in which they were created .
the problem is that the nicknames almost never come with footnotes , leaving the unsuspecting visitor drowning in a sea of place-names .
barcelona is best known in the eu as the place where european , north african and middle eastern leaders met in november 1995 to try and improve their often-strained relationship .
the result was the " barcelona process , " by which the eu tried to boost trade and political ties with its mediterranean neighbors while urging them to do more for human rights and regional peace .
the process seldom made headlines until early 2007 , when french president nicolas sarkozy proposed scrapping it and creating a much more sweeping " mediterranean union " modeled on the eu .
eu members without a mediterranean coastline blocked the idea , but allowed sarkozy to launch on july 13 a watered-down version catchily titled the " barcelona process : union for the mediterranean . "
copenhagen : denmark 's capital has become eu code for the set of standards which countries have to meet if they want to join the bloc .
the " copenhagen criteria , " adopted in june 1993 , say that a state should be able to preserve democracy and human rights , have a market economy and accept the eu 's " obligations and intent , " such as peace .
over the last year , the criteria have most often been mentioned in the context of eu hopefuls macedonia , serbia and turkey , all of whom have been accused by critics of falling short in key areas .
dublin : famous for its literary giants , its dark beer and its distressing tendency to reject eu treaties , " dublin , " in eu circles , is a term used when talking about refugees .
the " dublin convention , " which came into force in 1997 , is aimed at streamlining the way eu member states deal with refugees and , in particular , deciding where each applicant should be dealt with .
with the current french presidency of the bloc pushing for an eu " pact " on migration , dublin is usually referred to when member states want to accuse one another of not doing enough for refugees .
the hague is famous as the home of various international courts , all of which tend to be nicknamed " the hague tribunal . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the hague hosts the international criminal court the one the eu refers to most often at present is the international criminal tribunal for the former yugoslavia -lrb- icty -rrb- , set up by the un in 1993 to deal with the atrocities committed in the separatist balkan wars of the 1990s .
while not an eu body , icty regularly features in eu meetings because the dutch government has vetoed any kind of eu rapprochement with serbia until icty 's chief prosecutor rules that the belgrade government is cooperating fully with his organization .
cities lend their name to treaties when european union leaders refer to the " lisbon agenda " or the " manchester declaration , " this is what they mean : lisbon : the lisbon agenda , agreed in march 2000 , is a plan aimed at making the eu the world 's most competitive economy by 2010 .
the lisbon treaty , signed in december 2007 , is an agreement between the bloc 's 27 member states aimed at making it easier to take eu-wide decisions and giving the union a higher profile abroad .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the treaty has put lisbon on the eu map with the eu lagging behind key rivals such as the united states and japan in terms of innovation , the word " lisbon " has in the past usually been used to describe the gap between the eu 's targets and its results .
however , since irish voters rejected the lisbon treaty in a referendum on june 12 , current headlines referring to " lisbon " usually refer to the treaty .
maastricht : the maastricht treaty , signed in 1992 , created the eu out of its forerunner , the european economic community , and set up the legal process that created the euro .
maastricht criteria are the strict rules on inflation and government spending that countries have to meet in order to join the euro .
the criteria last made the headlines in july , when eu finance ministers invited slovakia to become the euro club 's 16th member .
manchester : britain 's soccer giant is known in the eu for the political call , made by finance ministers in september 2005 , not to respond to fuel-price rises by cutting taxes .
barely mentioned until the recent oil-price surge , the manchester declaration has now come back to haunt ministers , as they urge one another in increasingly nervous tones not to break ranks . nice : the nice treaty , signed by eu leaders in 2001 , updated the union 's internal workings so the bloc could absorb 12 new member states between 2004 and 2007 .
its main remit was to set the number of votes in eu councils each member state should have , from 29 in germany to three in malta .
when eu leaders were negotiating the lisbon treaty in 2007 , poland , which stood to lose some of its voting power under the new rules , demanded that the nice voting weights remain unchanged , going into negotiations with the slogan " nice or death ! "
schengen : the schengen convention , which came into force in 1995 , abolished border barriers between belgium , france , germany , greece , italy , luxembourg , the netherlands , portugal and spain .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : schengen has gained international fame through the eu the agreement created the schengen zone , which now includes all the eu 's current members except britain , ireland , bulgaria and romania .
non-eu members iceland and norway are also in the zone .
schengen most recently hit the headlines in late 2007 , when it expanded to take in nine countries which joined the eu in 2004 .
tampere : the finnish town of tampere is best known in eu circles for its links with international law-enforcement .
the tampere process , launched in 1999 , is the series of talks which eu member states are holding to discuss how they can improve cooperation on sensitive issues of justice and internal affairs .
the process was given a renewed impulse at a summit in the hague in 2004 - whereupon some officials renamed it the " hague process . "
however , some diplomats say that the process will receive a new impulse when sweden takes over the eu 's rotating presidency in the second half of 2009 .
they therefore call it the " stockholm process . " dpa news agency -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the home office said the uk had tough laws but children 's charity ecpat uk wants an overhaul of the way britain deals with nationals convicted abroad .
it wants offenders returned to the uk , put on the sex offenders register , and in some cases have travel restricted .
gary glitter is due to be freed from a vietnamese jail and deported to the uk .
the report from the children 's rights charity comes ahead of the ex-pop star being deported by the vietnamese government after serving 27 months in prison for child molestation .
the 64-year-old , whose real name is paul francis gadd , was convicted in 2006 for molesting two vietnamese girls aged 11 and 12 .
they go from one country to the next or they may stay underground in the first country where the offence has taken place - we lose track of them christine beddoe ecpat he had his three-year sentence cut last year under a national amnesty , and is due to be sent back to britain on tuesday .
he will then be interviewed by uk police and required to sign the sex offenders ' register .
but ecpat said tools to protect children were not being used fully by the british authorities , with only five sex offenders prosecuted for abuse abroad since 1997 .
it said this compared with more than 65 prosecutions by us authorities and over 25 by australian authorities .
the charity - which campaigns against the commercial sexual exploitation of children - said between 2006 and 2008 at least 15 british nationals were charged in thailand alone for the sexual abuse of children .
and others have been prosecuted in india , ghana , vietnam , cambodia , and albania .
many had been teachers or volunteers in orphanages , said epcat .

ecpat 's christine beddoe explains the charity 's concerns ministers should return offenders to the uk immediately after sentencing so they can be placed on the sex offenders register , risk-assessed and managed , said the report .
director of ecpat christine beddoe said it was often only cases involving celebrities that caught public attention , and that it was too easy for abusers to stay off the radar of british police .
" the biggest problem is in the twilight zone of international jurisdictions when offenders do n't come back to the uk immediately .
they go from one country to the next or they may stay underground in the first country where the offence has taken place .
we lose track of them . "
joint investigations the report also said future foreign travel should be restricted , where appropriate .
the charity argued foreign travel orders -lrb- fto -rrb- - civil orders developed to restrict the travel by uk registered sex offenders - had not been used enough .
an fto requires an offender to notify police if he or she intends to travel and the information is shared with police at the destination .
if there is evidence an offender intends to commit an offence abroad they can prevent them from visiting that country or travelling at all .
the home office said five ftos were granted between 2004/5 and 2006/7 .
more than 3,000 similar bans have been issued to prevent football hooligans travelling .
ecpat 's report also made the following recommendations : • the uk should develop stronger bilateral co-operation relationships with relevant countries . • joint investigation teams should be developed with other national law enforcement agencies . • agreements with foreign governments should be constructed to deport and chaperone convicted offenders back to the uk , to be placed on the sex offenders register .
meanwhile , the home office said while more could always be done to keep children safe , the uk had " some of the toughest laws in the world " .
it added that a recent change to the law meant those who commit sex offences against children abroad now faced prosecution in the uk .
ecpat said it was too easy for offenders to stay off the radar of uk police this " sends a strong message to so-called sex-tourists that they wo n't get away with targeting other countries with less strict controls than the uk , " said the home office spokesman .
" from the autumn , we also intend to make registered sex offenders notify the police of any travel abroad . "
they added that britain had recently signed the council of europe 's convention on the protection of children from sexual exploitation and abuse , " which sets standards to ensure that countries criminalise the sexual exploitation and abuse of children " .
last month new rules came into force which meant that british " sex tourists " who abuse children abroad could face prosecution in the uk even if their actions were legal in the country they visited .

gary glitter is due to be freed from a vietnamese jail and deported to the uk .
the report from the children 's rights charity comes ahead of the ex-pop star being deported by the vietnamese government after serving 27 months in prison for child molestation .
the 64-year-old , whose real name is paul francis gadd , was convicted in 2006 for molesting two vietnamese girls aged 11 and 12 .

but ecpat said tools to protect children were not being used fully by the british authorities , with only five sex offenders prosecuted for abuse abroad since 1997 .
it said this compared with more than 65 prosecutions by us authorities and over 25 by australian authorities .
the charity - which campaigns against the commercial sexual exploitation of children - said between 2006 and 2008 at least 15 british nationals were charged in thailand alone for the sexual abuse of children .
and others have been prosecuted in india , ghana , vietnam , cambodia , and albania .
many had been teachers or volunteers in orphanages , said epcat .

ecpat 's christine beddoe explains the charity 's concerns ministers should return offenders to the uk immediately after sentencing so they can be placed on the sex offenders register , risk-assessed and managed , said the report .
director of ecpat christine beddoe said it was often only cases involving celebrities that caught public attention , and that it was too easy for abusers to stay off the radar of british police .
" the biggest problem is in the twilight zone of international jurisdictions when offenders do n't come back to the uk immediately .
they go from one country to the next or they may stay underground in the first country where the offence has taken place .
we lose track of them . "
joint investigations the report also said future foreign travel should be restricted , where appropriate .
the charity argued foreign travel orders -lrb- fto -rrb- - civil orders developed to restrict the travel by uk registered sex offenders - had not been used enough .
an fto requires an offender to notify police if he or she intends to travel and the information is shared with police at the destination .
if there is evidence an offender intends to commit an offence abroad they can prevent them from visiting that country or travelling at all .
the home office said five ftos were granted between 2004/5 and 2006/7 .
more than 3,000 similar bans have been issued to prevent football hooligans travelling .
ecpat 's report also made the following recommendations : • the uk should develop stronger bilateral co-operation relationships with relevant countries . • joint investigation teams should be developed with other national law enforcement agencies . • agreements with foreign governments should be constructed to deport and chaperone convicted offenders back to the uk , to be placed on the sex offenders register .
meanwhile , the home office said while more could always be done to keep children safe , the uk had " some of the toughest laws in the world " .
it added that a recent change to the law meant those who commit sex offences against children abroad now faced prosecution in the uk .
ecpat said it was too easy for offenders to stay off the radar of uk police this " sends a strong message to so-called sex-tourists that they wo n't get away with targeting other countries with less strict controls than the uk , " said the home office spokesman .
" from the autumn , we also intend to make registered sex offenders notify the police of any travel abroad . "
they added that britain had recently signed the council of europe 's convention on the protection of children from sexual exploitation and abuse , " which sets standards to ensure that countries criminalise the sexual exploitation and abuse of children " .
last month new rules came into force which meant that british " sex tourists " who abuse children abroad could face prosecution in the uk even if their actions were legal in the country they visited .

the home office said the uk had tough laws but children 's charity ecpat uk wants an overhaul of the way britain deals with nationals convicted abroad .
it wants offenders returned to the uk , put on the sex offenders register , and in some cases have travel restricted .
gary glitter is due to be freed from a vietnamese jail and deported to the uk .
the report from the children 's rights charity comes ahead of the ex-pop star being deported by the vietnamese government after serving 27 months in prison for child molestation .
the 64-year-old , whose real name is paul francis gadd , was convicted in 2006 for molesting two vietnamese girls aged 11 and 12 .

he will then be interviewed by uk police and required to sign the sex offenders ' register .
but ecpat said tools to protect children were not being used fully by the british authorities , with only five sex offenders prosecuted for abuse abroad since 1997 .
it said this compared with more than 65 prosecutions by us authorities and over 25 by australian authorities .
the charity - which campaigns against the commercial sexual exploitation of children - said between 2006 and 2008 at least 15 british nationals were charged in thailand alone for the sexual abuse of children .
and others have been prosecuted in india , ghana , vietnam , cambodia , and albania .
many had been teachers or volunteers in orphanages , said epcat .

ecpat 's christine beddoe explains the charity 's concerns ministers should return offenders to the uk immediately after sentencing so they can be placed on the sex offenders register , risk-assessed and managed , said the report .
director of ecpat christine beddoe said it was often only cases involving celebrities that caught public attention , and that it was too easy for abusers to stay off the radar of british police .
" the biggest problem is in the twilight zone of international jurisdictions when offenders do n't come back to the uk immediately .
they go from one country to the next or they may stay underground in the first country where the offence has taken place .
we lose track of them . "
joint investigations the report also said future foreign travel should be restricted , where appropriate .
the charity argued foreign travel orders -lrb- fto -rrb- - civil orders developed to restrict the travel by uk registered sex offenders - had not been used enough .
an fto requires an offender to notify police if he or she intends to travel and the information is shared with police at the destination .
if there is evidence an offender intends to commit an offence abroad they can prevent them from visiting that country or travelling at all .
the home office said five ftos were granted between 2004/5 and 2006/7 .
more than 3,000 similar bans have been issued to prevent football hooligans travelling .
ecpat 's report also made the following recommendations : • the uk should develop stronger bilateral co-operation relationships with relevant countries . • joint investigation teams should be developed with other national law enforcement agencies . • agreements with foreign governments should be constructed to deport and chaperone convicted offenders back to the uk , to be placed on the sex offenders register .
meanwhile , the home office said while more could always be done to keep children safe , the uk had " some of the toughest laws in the world " .
it added that a recent change to the law meant those who commit sex offences against children abroad now faced prosecution in the uk .
ecpat said it was too easy for offenders to stay off the radar of uk police this " sends a strong message to so-called sex-tourists that they wo n't get away with targeting other countries with less strict controls than the uk , " said the home office spokesman .
" from the autumn , we also intend to make registered sex offenders notify the police of any travel abroad . "
they added that britain had recently signed the council of europe 's convention on the protection of children from sexual exploitation and abuse , " which sets standards to ensure that countries criminalise the sexual exploitation and abuse of children " .
last month new rules came into force which meant that british " sex tourists " who abuse children abroad could face prosecution in the uk even if their actions were legal in the country they visited .
in some countries , possessing indecent images of children is not illegal , or the age of consent is lower than 16 .

the home office said the uk had tough laws but children 's charity ecpat uk wants an overhaul of the way britain deals with nationals convicted abroad .
it wants offenders returned to the uk , put on the sex offenders register , and in some cases have travel restricted .
gary glitter is due to be freed from a vietnamese jail and deported to the uk .
the report from the children 's rights charity comes ahead of the ex-pop star being deported by the vietnamese government after serving 27 months in prison for child molestation .
the 64-year-old , whose real name is paul francis gadd , was convicted in 2006 for molesting two vietnamese girls aged 11 and 12 .

he will then be interviewed by uk police and required to sign the sex offenders ' register .
but ecpat said tools to protect children were not being used fully by the british authorities , with only five sex offenders prosecuted for abuse abroad since 1997 .
it said this compared with more than 65 prosecutions by us authorities and over 25 by australian authorities .
the charity - which campaigns against the commercial sexual exploitation of children - said between 2006 and 2008 at least 15 british nationals were charged in thailand alone for the sexual abuse of children .
and others have been prosecuted in india , ghana , vietnam , cambodia , and albania .
many had been teachers or volunteers in orphanages , said epcat .

ecpat 's christine beddoe explains the charity 's concerns ministers should return offenders to the uk immediately after sentencing so they can be placed on the sex offenders register , risk-assessed and managed , said the report .
director of ecpat christine beddoe said it was often only cases involving celebrities that caught public attention , and that it was too easy for abusers to stay off the radar of british police .
" the biggest problem is in the twilight zone of international jurisdictions when offenders do n't come back to the uk immediately .
they go from one country to the next or they may stay underground in the first country where the offence has taken place .
we lose track of them . "
joint investigations the report also said future foreign travel should be restricted , where appropriate .
the charity argued foreign travel orders -lrb- fto -rrb- - civil orders developed to restrict the travel by uk registered sex offenders - had not been used enough .
an fto requires an offender to notify police if he or she intends to travel and the information is shared with police at the destination .
if there is evidence an offender intends to commit an offence abroad they can prevent them from visiting that country or travelling at all .
the home office said five ftos were granted between 2004/5 and 2006/7 .
more than 3,000 similar bans have been issued to prevent football hooligans travelling .
ecpat 's report also made the following recommendations : • the uk should develop stronger bilateral co-operation relationships with relevant countries . • joint investigation teams should be developed with other national law enforcement agencies . • agreements with foreign governments should be constructed to deport and chaperone convicted offenders back to the uk , to be placed on the sex offenders register .
meanwhile , the home office said while more could always be done to keep children safe , the uk had " some of the toughest laws in the world " .
it added that a recent change to the law meant those who commit sex offences against children abroad now faced prosecution in the uk .
ecpat said it was too easy for offenders to stay off the radar of uk police this " sends a strong message to so-called sex-tourists that they wo n't get away with targeting other countries with less strict controls than the uk , " said the home office spokesman .
" from the autumn , we also intend to make registered sex offenders notify the police of any travel abroad . "
they added that britain had recently signed the council of europe 's convention on the protection of children from sexual exploitation and abuse , " which sets standards to ensure that countries criminalise the sexual exploitation and abuse of children " .
last month new rules came into force which meant that british " sex tourists " who abuse children abroad could face prosecution in the uk even if their actions were legal in the country they visited .

writing in the sunday times , health minister ivan lewis said introducing practical measures to boost morale at this difficult time was vital .
he warns that labour will lose the next election if it does not take tough tax decisions to bail out core voters .
his comments come as a poll suggests labour party popularity is waning .
the latest yougov poll , commissioned by the sunday times , showed that labour 's support was at 25 % , with the conservative party in a 20-point lead .
since the party 's defeat in the glasgow east by-election in july , there has been criticism by some within the party about prime minister gordon brown 's performance as leader and his ability to win labour a fourth term in office .
' duty to act ' the only way to win the next election , mr lewis warns , is by protecting the living standards of the " mainstream majority " that helped secure labour 's victory in the past three elections .
" our duty is to act decisively and make tax and spending decisions that show we understand what it is like to cope with rising food , fuel and utility bills , " mr lewis said .
" if as a result of the current economic situation the only way to help hard-pressed middle-class families is to ask the higher earners to pay more , then serious consideration should be given to that , " he added .
he does not specify how much one has to earn to fall within this bracket , but it is thought to be aimed at people earning £ 250,000 and more , according to the newspaper .
other suggestions include a windfall tax or a temporary freeze on stamp duty payments .
this would ensure " meaningful extra help " for the hard-pressed middle classes who " work long hours for their two holidays a year " , but are now struggling with the basic cost of living .
earlier this month , chancellor alistair darling said that a stamp duty holiday was one option the government was considering to boost the stagnant housing market .
the government has also come under pressure to impose a windfall tax on energy companies amid soaring petrol and energy costs .
