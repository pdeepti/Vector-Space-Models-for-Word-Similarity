michalsky has his own stores featuring his own collection and his name is associated with many top brands . " right now there 's no city more interesting than berlin , " said michalsky .
" berlin is not only the heart of new europe , but also an indicator of new social trends , which is important for the fashion world . " art schools have responded to the trend bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : british fashion guru vivienne westwood taught in berlin that 's a fact also recognized by berlin 's schools , which in recent years have founded numerous fashion study programs .

this school attracts young designers who stay in berlin after finishing their education . one of the best examples of this is sisi wasabi , a label with a mix of casual street clothes and elements borrowed from traditional german costumes .
berlin is not just a place to work for zerlina von dem bussche , owner of the sisi wasabi label . " berlin is a city that is tremendously inspiring through incessant change , " said von dem bussche . berlin draws fashion industry names bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : berlin now has its very own fashion week this boom in creativity has led even names that really count in the fashion industry to stalk the city .
events like berlin fashion week attract thousands of people who work in the fashion industry .
as a result berlin is not just a place where fashion is created , but also a place where it is vigorously bought and sold . tourists have taken notice .
they do n't have to search long because the large renowned stores have discovered new berlin fashion also .
galeries lafayette , in the friedrich street , is the ritzy offshoot of the same-named parisian department store and has set aside a corner for young designers . visitors to the upper floors find berlinomat where the latest styles in belts , bags , shirts and evening wear by various designers are available amid black lacquered walls .
but the biggest fashion discovery is the area around the hackesche hoefe .
while many tourists simply stroll in awe through the courtyard shopping area , fashion conscious visitors find clothes like no other here . " the area is a fashion bermuda triangle , " said barth , comparing the mysterious geographical region in the atlantic ocean to the shape formed by alte schoenhauser , mulack and rosenthaler streets form on the city map . the hackesche hoefe makes for an ideal starting point for a fashion tour of the area .
just behind the cinema is a store called berlinerklamotten that offers more than just a single designer 's line .
in fact about 140 fashion designers are represented on the ground floor of the factory-like building . every table and every rack has a different notion of fashion .
there are shiny sack purses reminiscent of the kind seen in children 's books , t-shirts with filigree motifs of the city , casual woolen jackets and colorfully-patterned overshirts . prices can be described as halfway toward moderate : about 40 euros -lrb- $ 52 -rrb- will buy you an unusual top and a unique pair of trousers cost around 120 euros . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : berlin label miroike showcased its work at the 2008 show anyone in the mood for a more extensive shopping spree should walk down neue schoenhauser street to where it turns into alte schoenhauser street .
wander past the dozens of stores there and then turn left onto mulack street .
there 's also one young designer store after another here .
in bless , for example , the collections are numbered like art objects , in van reimersdahl there are prints and lala berlin has knitted hats , scarves and hand warmers .

" we , both of us , affirmed that we will continue in these negotiations and that we will not stop even as israel prepares to go for elections , " abbas told a joint news conference with livni .
" our meetings will continue as usual , " he added .
for her part , livni said that the continued talks , aimed at forging an israeli-palestinian peace resulting in a palestinian state , would continue the framework agreed on at last year 's annapolis peace summit , when the sides agreed to rekindle the negotiations after a seven-year hiatus .
" the annapolis process serves the interest of both parties , the israeli and palestinian , " she said .
quartet pledges further support bildunterschrift : the middle east quartet - the us , eu , un and russia - offer its continued support the process ' sponsors - the so-called quartet of the us , russia , the european union and the united nations - said in a statement that they would continue their commitment supporting the parties efforts and also pledged to " respect the bilateral and confidential nature of the negotiations . "
renewed officially at the turn of the year , the negotiations , headed by livni for the israelis and former-premier ahmed quriea for the palestinians , have been conducted amid a virtual media blackout , with concomitant conflicting reports of the progress being made .
but according to an israeli foreign ministry communiqué , livni told the quartet sunday that " real and intensive progress " has been made , and the sides believed they had the elements , guiding principles and trust needed to create a good basis for a deal .
at annapolis abbas and israeli prime minister ehud olmert pledged to try and secure a treaty by the end of the year , but on thursday us secretary of state condoleezza rice conceded that this is unlikely to happen , as israel heads for elections early next year .
fears have also been expressed that the transition period in the us , as president-elect barack obama prepares to take office , may affect the momentum of the talks .
tough issues under negotiation bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : rice , solana and lavrov heard the report in sharm el-sheikh officials from both sides have said that it is proving difficult to reach agreement on the many tough issues that are under negotiations which include the future of east jerusalem , the fate of palestinian refugees , the borders and management of natural resources , especially water .
both israelis and palestinians say they need more time to agree .
east jerusalem is proving to be an especially tough issue to settle , and an israeli trial balloon , to conclude a partial agreement without it , was quickly shot down by the palestinians .
in sharm el-sheikh on sunday , neither livni nor abbas expressed any indication of how much longer the two sides would need to conclude an agreement according to the annapolis framework , but both agreed and said that nothing is done until it is actually done .
abbas and livni did not take any questions from the press .
however , speaking privately their aides said that each side was more or less satisfied with the outcome of the sharm el-sheikh meeting .
the israelis said that they were pleased with the consensus they have with the palestinians and the international community as represented in the quartet to " stick to the annapolis process " .
" it is important that we do n't keep seeing new initiatives being offered every day .
this will complicate matters , " said one israeli source who spoke on condition of anonymity to the dpa news agency .
livni had called on the international community not to intervene in the talks by submitting " bridging proposals and initiatives which do not suit reality . "
the palestinians said they were also pleased with the understanding the quartet demonstrated for their determination to secure a comprehensive settlement .
" we can not go back to our people with bits and pieces .
the palestinians have suffered for a long time and now they want to see the final peace deal and their state , " said a palestinian source , who asked not to be named .
israel also received more assurances from the palestinians , the egyptian host of the meeting and the quartet members that all efforts will be duly exerted to observe their security concerns , diplomatic sources said .
envoy blair promises continued economic aid bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : quartet envoy blair said funding would continue the palestinians received promises that economic aid will be sustained .
tony blair , the quartet envoy to the middle east , who is in charge of observing the flow of international financial aid to the palestinians said sunday that he would continue to work for the support of palestinian economy and for the upgrade of palestinian security .
the palestinians , however , did not get a mechanism they demanded , to be in charge of following up on israeli commitments to ease economic and security sanctions on palestinian territories .
un secretary-general ban ki-moon said sunday in a press conference that " the quartet is the mechanism . " dpa news agency -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

9 , at a berlin ceremony to recall a 1938 pogrom against jewish residents of germany . " indifference is the first step towards endangering essential values , " merkel said during germany 's national memorial ceremony at the old synagogue in berlin 's rykestrasse .
" xenophobia , racism and anti-semitism must never be given an opportunity in europe again . " she added that germany needs to encourage moral courage in the face of racism and anti-semitism . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel said germans must not be indifferent to xenophobia , racism or anti-semitism " there was no storm of protest against the nazi , but silence , shrugged shoulders and people looking away - from individual citizens to large parts of the church , " she said .
" we can not be silent , we can not be indifferent when jewish cemeteries are desecrated and rabbis are insulted on the street . " it is a mistake to think it does n't affect you when your neighbors are affected , " merkel added .
" this mistake just leads us further and further into evil . " in an annual symbol of how jewish life is flowering again in germany , yet another community opened a synagogue on sunday . the building is a half-timbered village synagogue that was in use from 1825 to 1937 and was carefully moved to its new site in the central city of goettingen and renovated . in another city , speyer , the jewish community was laying the foundation stone for a new synagogue . pope recalls horror of kristallnacht bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : pope benedict spoke of a deep solidarity with the jews pope benedict , who is german , spoke out after public prayers sunday in rome on the horrific legacy of the 1938 violence . he said vigilance was needed against anti-semitism and every form of discrimination .
he said he spoke " in deep solidarity with the jewish world . " at the national ceremony , in the synagogue first opened in 1904 in berlin 's rykestrasse and re-inaugurated two years ago , emotion overwhelmed charlotte knobloch , 76 , president of germany 's central council of jews . she recalled being led through munich as a child by her father and seeing the destruction and indifferent lookers-on in 1938 . at the end of her speech , she sobbed for a moment before she could read her closing line , based on a remark by henrik mandelbaum , who survived the nazis ' auschwitz death camp . " i beg you not to ever let anyone talk you into whom you have to love and whom you have to hate , " she said . the late november 9 , 1938 pogrom , a precursor to the holocaust , ultimately led to more than 1,300 deaths from injuries , by suicide or in concentration camps , official historians have said . vicious pogrom a precursor for holocaust flames leapt into the sky across germany when the nazis gave a foretaste of the holocaust in the vicious pogrom against the jewish community .

" more than 400 people were beaten to death , shot or driven to suicide , records show .
more than 30,000 were rounded up and packed off to concentration camps . the tyranny marked a turning point in the anti-semitic policies pursued after hitler took power in 1933 and which eventually led to the holocaust , the systematic state-sponsored killing of jews . new anti-semitism resolution adopted bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkl 's government agreed a new resolution against anti-semitism germany 's parliament adopted a resolution against anti-semitism to mark sunday 's 70th anniversary of the pogrom after a dispute over whether a far-left party should be included . chancellor angela merkel 's christian democrats lobbied to have the left excluded because of its cooperation with " extremists hostile to jews " - a reference to the palestinian movement hamas . merkel herself will represent the government at a remembrance ceremony held together with the central council of jews in germany at the country 's largest synagogue , located in berlin . built in 1904 , the ryke street synagogue was badly damaged in the 1938 pogrom , but was not burned down , apparently because the nazis feared damage would be caused to adjacent buildings . it was reopened in august 2007 after being restored to its original glory at a cost of $ 7 million . some 600,000 jews lived in germany before the war , but the figure declined to around 12,000 after 1945 .

" germany must , should and will take on responsibility , " she said .
but in remarks to supporters a day later , the limits to german willingness were clear .
germany has not forgotten an obama speech in berlin in june during which he called on the germans to take on more of the fighting burden in afghanistan , where german soldiers have rarely fought the taliban .
merkel told the youth section of her christian democratic union -lrb- cdu -rrb- that berlin would not accede to any request from the next us administration to send troops to southern afghanistan , the scene of most fighting .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel will give obama the same message as she gave bush " wherever germany commits itself , a wholeness of military and civilian assistance should be visible , " she said .
she would be able to tell obama that " just as well " as she had said it to president george w. bush .
german forces , the third-biggest component in the international security assistance force -lrb- isaf -rrb- , are based in safer northern afghanistan .
other armies have borne the brunt of the fighting in the south .
merkel may gain her chance to tell obama fairly soon when she attends a g20 summit in washington at the end of this week .
world leaders hope to see obama during their stay .
enthusiasm for obama has been huge in berlin most of this year : that helped ensure a crowd of 200,000 heard his speech in a city park on july 24 .
former defense minister expects pressure from obama the social democrats -lrb- spd -rrb- , the other main party in the merkel federal coalition , have claimed obama 's election as vindication for their own centre-left policies , but have also had an undertone of caution about afghanistan .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : obama is expected to ask for troops to help the us peter struck , who heads the spd parliamentary caucus and is a former german defense minister , told a sunday newspaper , bild am sonntag , he expected obama to seek more from nato and its european members .
but if obama requested german fighting troops in the south , " i would resist that most resolutely , " he said .
" there are limits . "
he said germany was already sending an extra 1,000 men to the north and offering advance-warning aircraft .
foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier , the social democrat who is to challenge merkel next year for the chancellorship , has already begun staking out that german position in diplomatic language .
he told a german newspaper , the hamburger abendblatt , on saturday that obama " highly appreciated " germany 's current contribution in afghanistan .
obama would not just seek more troops but also more reconstruction aid .
" we are very close to obama on this , " he said .
both merkel and steinmeier are driven on the troops issue by voter concerns about the afghan war .
german leaders wary as elections loom on horizon bildunterschrift : chancellor-candidate steinmeier is picking his words carefully on troop deployments with an election coming up in september , neither camp wants a surge in german casualties , including those from suicide attackers , to trigger a new round of anguish over the deployment .
surveys show most germans think the country is doing enough in afghanistan .
a forsa poll found 80 percent agree a us request for more troops should be refused and only 15 percent disagree .
however neither main party wants to upset obama at this stage by criticizing him .
the germans are eager to move forward with washington on many issues " in a spirit of togetherness , " merkel said .
she told the bild am sonntag on sunday those issues included " stabilizing afghanistan , " fixing the global financial crisis , fighting global warming and improving human rights .
steinmeier has already begun plans to demonstrate goodwill on another front , setting up plans to pay a call on the us-backed government in iraq next year and asking aides to draw up substantive aid plans for iraq .
that in itself is remarkable , since steinmeier , as chief of staff to former german chancellor gerhard schroeder , was a leading figure in germany 's refusal to assist the united states in the 2003 gulf war . dpa news agency -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" we , both of us , affirmed that we will continue in these negotiations and that we will not stop even as israel prepares to go for elections , " abbas told a joint news conference with livni .
" our meetings will continue as usual , " he added .
for her part , livni said that the continued talks , aimed at forging an israeli-palestinian peace resulting in a palestinian state , would continue the framework agreed on at last year 's annapolis peace summit , when the sides agreed to rekindle the negotiations after a seven-year hiatus .
" the annapolis process serves the interest of both parties , the israeli and palestinian , " she said .
quartet pledges further support bildunterschrift : the middle east quartet - the us , eu , un and russia - offer its continued support the process ' sponsors - the so-called quartet of the us , russia , the european union and the united nations - said in a statement that they would continue their commitment supporting the parties efforts and also pledged to " respect the bilateral and confidential nature of the negotiations . "
renewed officially at the turn of the year , the negotiations , headed by livni for the israelis and former-premier ahmed quriea for the palestinians , have been conducted amid a virtual media blackout , with concomitant conflicting reports of the progress being made .
but according to an israeli foreign ministry communiqué , livni told the quartet sunday that " real and intensive progress " has been made , and the sides believed they had the elements , guiding principles and trust needed to create a good basis for a deal .
at annapolis abbas and israeli prime minister ehud olmert pledged to try and secure a treaty by the end of the year , but on thursday us secretary of state condoleezza rice conceded that this is unlikely to happen , as israel heads for elections early next year .
fears have also been expressed that the transition period in the us , as president-elect barack obama prepares to take office , may affect the momentum of the talks .
tough issues under negotiation bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : rice , solana and lavrov heard the report in sharm el-sheikh officials from both sides have said that it is proving difficult to reach agreement on the many tough issues that are under negotiations which include the future of east jerusalem , the fate of palestinian refugees , the borders and management of natural resources , especially water .
both israelis and palestinians say they need more time to agree .
east jerusalem is proving to be an especially tough issue to settle , and an israeli trial balloon , to conclude a partial agreement without it , was quickly shot down by the palestinians .
in sharm el-sheikh on sunday , neither livni nor abbas expressed any indication of how much longer the two sides would need to conclude an agreement according to the annapolis framework , but both agreed and said that nothing is done until it is actually done .
abbas and livni did not take any questions from the press .
however , speaking privately their aides said that each side was more or less satisfied with the outcome of the sharm el-sheikh meeting .
the israelis said that they were pleased with the consensus they have with the palestinians and the international community as represented in the quartet to " stick to the annapolis process " .
" it is important that we do n't keep seeing new initiatives being offered every day .
this will complicate matters , " said one israeli source who spoke on condition of anonymity to the dpa news agency .
livni had called on the international community not to intervene in the talks by submitting " bridging proposals and initiatives which do not suit reality . "
the palestinians said they were also pleased with the understanding the quartet demonstrated for their determination to secure a comprehensive settlement .
" we can not go back to our people with bits and pieces .
the palestinians have suffered for a long time and now they want to see the final peace deal and their state , " said a palestinian source , who asked not to be named .
israel also received more assurances from the palestinians , the egyptian host of the meeting and the quartet members that all efforts will be duly exerted to observe their security concerns , diplomatic sources said .
envoy blair promises continued economic aid bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : quartet envoy blair said funding would continue the palestinians received promises that economic aid will be sustained .
tony blair , the quartet envoy to the middle east , who is in charge of observing the flow of international financial aid to the palestinians said sunday that he would continue to work for the support of palestinian economy and for the upgrade of palestinian security .
the palestinians , however , did not get a mechanism they demanded , to be in charge of following up on israeli commitments to ease economic and security sanctions on palestinian territories .
un secretary-general ban ki-moon said sunday in a press conference that " the quartet is the mechanism . " dpa news agency -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the german president also stressed that as-yet-unexplained issues of raw material exploration were also behind the conflict in the east of the democratic republic of congo .
" part of the complexity in the east of the congo is also the question of who wants the commodity , the raw materials and who is exploiting the raw materials and who is behind these exploitations , " koehler said .

in germany , just over a dozen female imams work in their communities .
yet more women are urgently needed in the mosques for counseling and integration aid . they lead prayers , give koran lessons and offer counseling .
whether it 's new york , berlin , cairo or istanbul : female imams are currently high in demand . zeynep cesen is one of the very few female imams who came to germany from turkey to specifically help women in muslim communities .
even when friday prayers continue to be the domain of her male counterparts , cesen 's range of responsibilities is very diverse , but she mainly helps women with their problems . " it 's generally young women who came here from turkey , " cesen said .
" we listen to their problems and try to find solutions . " due to her close contact to women of all ages , cesen reaches circles which a male imam in germany never could .
this is one of the reasons why the turkish-islamic union ditib employs female imams , said speaker ayse aydin . " religious services and human needs ca n't always be separated , " aydin said .
ditib 's goal is serving the needs of the community .
this included consciously addressing women , answering their questions and giving them the possibility to feel secure in the community , she said . supporting integration efforts when cesen came to germany at the beginning of the 1990s , her position was initially limited to six years .
today , she counsels up to 100 women per day . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : women and girls of all ages seek cesen 's advice in addition to her counseling tasks , she has developed her own form of preaching .
she said she answers religious questions " not down from the pulpit " but rather in discussion rounds with different women 's groups .
and daily problems are not excluded . women of all ages and with various social and personal problems turn to her .
many women would not open up to a male imam . " there are many things that women only want to share with women , " cesen said , adding that a warm and friendly atmosphere was necessary in order to share certain problems and issues . cesen said she reaches many turkish families through her intensive counseling work with women .
she said she wants to show them possibilities to access german society .
she said integration problems of mainly young turks in schools and training facilities require urgent action , cesen said . cesen said she urged both turkish businesses as well as german companies to create more training opportunities for young people .
in addition , much more needed to be done for women of turkish descent in order for their integration to succeed . dialog with christians when cesen speaks , many people in her community are all ears - even non-muslims . " she is often consulted from outside , too , " said ditib speaker aydin .
" we are proud of the work which our imam does here . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : integrating turks into german society still faces many problems cesen said she sees her contribution in an interchange with the neighborhood . " we need one another in good times as well as in bad times , " she said .
" so we need a good dialog with our german friends . " cesen said she therefore needed to be a good role model and encourage her community to do the same .
this included , for example , that muslims and christians wish each other happy holidays , no matter if it 's christmas or ramadan .
or that you go visit neighbors who are ill . the 50-year-old cesen is one of only 13 female imams currently working in turkish mosques in germany .
this is in part due to the lack of theological training for imams in germany .
the turkish-islamic union would like to have theologians trained in germany and foremost , ones who speak german well . cesen studied at the faculty for islamic theology in izmir and worked as an imam in turkey for 18 years before coming to germany in 1994 .
here , she initially served 51 mosque communities in cologne and the surrounding areas .
today , she works solely for ditib . diyanet , the state authority for religious affairs in turkey , helps select female theologians for the ditib communities .
since 2002 , there has been a more intensive preparation for female and male imams who are to be employed in germany .
they are prepared for their new tasks with german courses and cultural studies at the goethe institute in ankara .
after all , they are supposed to help their fellow countrymen and women to better integrate themselves in germany . whether the union can raise the current number of female imams for germany is unclear .
many turkish mosques in germany would like to have a woman in their ranks .
it would be a measure which would unburden cesen and her female colleagues . ulrike hummel -lrb- sac -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

but this culture was destroyed by world war ii , and berlin , as a divided city , did not rebound from the blow .
that finally changed in 1989 . " the fall of the berlin wall strengthened the city 's arts community and reproduced the modern , sizzling , creative fashion scene , " said barth . michael michalsky - one of the big new names in german fashion - moved to berlin a few years ago .
michalsky has his own stores featuring his own collection and his name is associated with many top brands . " right now there 's no city more interesting than berlin , " said michalsky .
" berlin is not only the heart of new europe , but also an indicator of new social trends , which is important for the fashion world . " art schools have responded to the trend bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : british fashion guru vivienne westwood taught in berlin that 's a fact also recognized by berlin 's schools , which in recent years have founded numerous fashion study programs .
vivienne westwood taught for a long time at berlin university of the arts and students at the fashion school esmod profit from the city 's international networks spanning the world of fashion .
this school attracts young designers who stay in berlin after finishing their education . one of the best examples of this is sisi wasabi , a label with a mix of casual street clothes and elements borrowed from traditional german costumes .
berlin is not just a place to work for zerlina von dem bussche , owner of the sisi wasabi label . " berlin is a city that is tremendously inspiring through incessant change , " said von dem bussche . berlin draws fashion industry names bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : berlin now has its very own fashion week this boom in creativity has led even names that really count in the fashion industry to stalk the city .
events like berlin fashion week attract thousands of people who work in the fashion industry .
as a result berlin is not just a place where fashion is created , but also a place where it is vigorously bought and sold . tourists have taken notice .
they do n't have to search long because the large renowned stores have discovered new berlin fashion also .
galeries lafayette , in the friedrich street , is the ritzy offshoot of the same-named parisian department store and has set aside a corner for young designers . visitors to the upper floors find berlinomat where the latest styles in belts , bags , shirts and evening wear by various designers are available amid black lacquered walls .
but the biggest fashion discovery is the area around the hackesche hoefe .
while many tourists simply stroll in awe through the courtyard shopping area , fashion conscious visitors find clothes like no other here . " the area is a fashion bermuda triangle , " said barth , comparing the mysterious geographical region in the atlantic ocean to the shape formed by alte schoenhauser , mulack and rosenthaler streets form on the city map . the hackesche hoefe makes for an ideal starting point for a fashion tour of the area .
just behind the cinema is a store called berlinerklamotten that offers more than just a single designer 's line .
in fact about 140 fashion designers are represented on the ground floor of the factory-like building . every table and every rack has a different notion of fashion .
there are shiny sack purses reminiscent of the kind seen in children 's books , t-shirts with filigree motifs of the city , casual woolen jackets and colorfully-patterned overshirts . prices can be described as halfway toward moderate : about 40 euros -lrb- $ 52 -rrb- will buy you an unusual top and a unique pair of trousers cost around 120 euros . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : berlin label miroike showcased its work at the 2008 show anyone in the mood for a more extensive shopping spree should walk down neue schoenhauser street to where it turns into alte schoenhauser street .
wander past the dozens of stores there and then turn left onto mulack street .
there 's also one young designer store after another here .
in bless , for example , the collections are numbered like art objects , in van reimersdahl there are prints and lala berlin has knitted hats , scarves and hand warmers .
at some point , turn left onto rosenthaler street and go south toward the city center to complete the triangle . dpa news agency -lrb- jg -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

this will complicate matters , " said one israeli source who spoke on condition of anonymity to the dpa news agency .
livni had called on the international community not to intervene in the talks by submitting " bridging proposals and initiatives which do not suit reality . "

" we can not go back to our people with bits and pieces .

7 , club chairman karl-heinz rummenigge has leapt to his defense . " we are convinced jurgen is the right coach for bayern , " rummenigge told the club 's agm in munich on friday night after klinsmann received whistles before sunday 's bundesliga clash with schalke 04 in gelsenkirchen .
" he is a very modern and innovative coach , and we are convinced of the fact that we will celebrate plenty of successes with him . "
although bayern were fourth before sunday 's game , some bayern fans remain unconvinced klinsmann is the right man after munich 's poor start to the league which saw them 11th last month after defeat 's to werder bremen and hanover .
" we are already seeing improvement and his philosophy works , " insisted rummenigge .
" we can be confident of the future . "
bayern captain mark van bommel said the german giants feel the pressure at the munich club where failure is not an option .
" it is a requirement at bayern that we win titles , third place is not the goal , " said the dutch hard-man .
munich faces schalke without injured stars bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : podolski is nursing a back injury - from sitting too long ?
meanwhile , bayern will be without injured pair bastian schweinsteiger and lukas podolski against schalke as both are struggling with knocks received in last wednesday 's champions league 1-1 draw at fiorentina .
" lukas has back problems which makes his involvement not possible and bastian continues to suffer from the bruised leg he picked up against fiorentina , " said klinsmann on the bayern website .
but italian world cup winner luca toni is back in the team and the striker will play from the start .
klinsmann said germany defender philipp lahm is back in training after picking up an ankle injury a fortnight ago , but will not feature against schalke .
bayern 's argentina internationals meet maradona meanwhile , bayern 's argentine internationals martin demichelis and jose ernesto sosa admit they were impressed new national coach diego maradona flew to see them .
the pair met maradona in a munich hotel for nearly an hour on thursday as part of his tour of european-based players to discuss tactics in the run up to the 2010 world cup .
both players have both been called up for maradona 's first match in charge , the meeting with scotland on november 19 at hampden park , glasgow .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : new argentina coach maradona is on a world tour " he wanted to establish a personal relationship with us and outline his plans , " said said demichelis , who admitted maradona was a child-hood hero .
" i 've previously met maradona , but that 's the first time i 've spoken to him for any length of time .
that was a gift from football , and a moment i 'll never forget .
" his presence is enough to motivate you to new heights .
you ca n't ask for more than having the greatest idol and the last world cup winning coach come to munich just to see jose and me .
" around 80 argentine players are performing at the highest level with european clubs .
we could put out three or four strong teams .
making it into the national side is incredibly difficult . "
the fact that maradona came to munich solely to see demichelis and sosa was a sign of the duo 's importance , according to klinsmann .
" he 's doing what i did four years ago , " said ex-germany boss klinsmann , who also sought early contact with his best players after taking the national hot seat in 2004 . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

meanwhile , bayern will be without injured pair bastian schweinsteiger and lukas podolski against schalke as both are struggling with knocks received in last wednesday 's champions league 1-1 draw at fiorentina .
" lukas has back problems which makes his involvement not possible and bastian continues to suffer from the bruised leg he picked up against fiorentina , " said klinsmann on the bayern website .

that was a gift from football , and a moment i 'll never forget .
" his presence is enough to motivate you to new heights .

" around 80 argentine players are performing at the highest level with european clubs .
we could put out three or four strong teams .
making it into the national side is incredibly difficult . "
the fact that maradona came to munich solely to see demichelis and sosa was a sign of the duo 's importance , according to klinsmann .

9 , the horrific violence unleashed 70 years ago against jews in germany on the night of broken glass , and from rome , pope benedict xvi , appealed for vigilance against anti-semitism . germans can not be indifferent to anti-semitism , chancellor angela merkel said sunday , nov .
9 , at a berlin ceremony to recall a 1938 pogrom against jewish residents of germany . " indifference is the first step towards endangering essential values , " merkel said during germany 's national memorial ceremony at the old synagogue in berlin 's rykestrasse .
" xenophobia , racism and anti-semitism must never be given an opportunity in europe again . " she added that germany needs to encourage moral courage in the face of racism and anti-semitism . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel said germans must not be indifferent to xenophobia , racism or anti-semitism " there was no storm of protest against the nazi , but silence , shrugged shoulders and people looking away - from individual citizens to large parts of the church , " she said .
" we can not be silent , we can not be indifferent when jewish cemeteries are desecrated and rabbis are insulted on the street . " it is a mistake to think it does n't affect you when your neighbors are affected , " merkel added .
" this mistake just leads us further and further into evil . " in an annual symbol of how jewish life is flowering again in germany , yet another community opened a synagogue on sunday . the building is a half-timbered village synagogue that was in use from 1825 to 1937 and was carefully moved to its new site in the central city of goettingen and renovated . in another city , speyer , the jewish community was laying the foundation stone for a new synagogue . pope recalls horror of kristallnacht bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : pope benedict spoke of a deep solidarity with the jews pope benedict , who is german , spoke out after public prayers sunday in rome on the horrific legacy of the 1938 violence . he said vigilance was needed against anti-semitism and every form of discrimination .

" germany must , should and will take on responsibility , " she said .
but in remarks to supporters a day later , the limits to german willingness were clear .
germany has not forgotten an obama speech in berlin in june during which he called on the germans to take on more of the fighting burden in afghanistan , where german soldiers have rarely fought the taliban .
merkel told the youth section of her christian democratic union -lrb- cdu -rrb- that berlin would not accede to any request from the next us administration to send troops to southern afghanistan , the scene of most fighting .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel will give obama the same message as she gave bush " wherever germany commits itself , a wholeness of military and civilian assistance should be visible , " she said .
she would be able to tell obama that " just as well " as she had said it to president george w. bush .
german forces , the third-biggest component in the international security assistance force -lrb- isaf -rrb- , are based in safer northern afghanistan .
other armies have borne the brunt of the fighting in the south .
merkel may gain her chance to tell obama fairly soon when she attends a g20 summit in washington at the end of this week .
world leaders hope to see obama during their stay .
enthusiasm for obama has been huge in berlin most of this year : that helped ensure a crowd of 200,000 heard his speech in a city park on july 24 .
former defense minister expects pressure from obama the social democrats -lrb- spd -rrb- , the other main party in the merkel federal coalition , have claimed obama 's election as vindication for their own centre-left policies , but have also had an undertone of caution about afghanistan .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : obama is expected to ask for troops to help the us peter struck , who heads the spd parliamentary caucus and is a former german defense minister , told a sunday newspaper , bild am sonntag , he expected obama to seek more from nato and its european members .
but if obama requested german fighting troops in the south , " i would resist that most resolutely , " he said .
" there are limits . "
he said germany was already sending an extra 1,000 men to the north and offering advance-warning aircraft .
foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier , the social democrat who is to challenge merkel next year for the chancellorship , has already begun staking out that german position in diplomatic language .
he told a german newspaper , the hamburger abendblatt , on saturday that obama " highly appreciated " germany 's current contribution in afghanistan .
obama would not just seek more troops but also more reconstruction aid .

" germany must , should and will take on responsibility , " she said .
but in remarks to supporters a day later , the limits to german willingness were clear .
germany has not forgotten an obama speech in berlin in june during which he called on the germans to take on more of the fighting burden in afghanistan , where german soldiers have rarely fought the taliban .
merkel told the youth section of her christian democratic union -lrb- cdu -rrb- that berlin would not accede to any request from the next us administration to send troops to southern afghanistan , the scene of most fighting .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel will give obama the same message as she gave bush " wherever germany commits itself , a wholeness of military and civilian assistance should be visible , " she said .

merkel may gain her chance to tell obama fairly soon when she attends a g20 summit in washington at the end of this week .

former defense minister expects pressure from obama the social democrats -lrb- spd -rrb- , the other main party in the merkel federal coalition , have claimed obama 's election as vindication for their own centre-left policies , but have also had an undertone of caution about afghanistan .

but if obama requested german fighting troops in the south , " i would resist that most resolutely , " he said .
" there are limits . "
he said germany was already sending an extra 1,000 men to the north and offering advance-warning aircraft .
foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier , the social democrat who is to challenge merkel next year for the chancellorship , has already begun staking out that german position in diplomatic language .
he told a german newspaper , the hamburger abendblatt , on saturday that obama " highly appreciated " germany 's current contribution in afghanistan .

" germany must , should and will take on responsibility , " she said .
but in remarks to supporters a day later , the limits to german willingness were clear .
germany has not forgotten an obama speech in berlin in june during which he called on the germans to take on more of the fighting burden in afghanistan , where german soldiers have rarely fought the taliban .
merkel told the youth section of her christian democratic union -lrb- cdu -rrb- that berlin would not accede to any request from the next us administration to send troops to southern afghanistan , the scene of most fighting .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel will give obama the same message as she gave bush " wherever germany commits itself , a wholeness of military and civilian assistance should be visible , " she said .
she would be able to tell obama that " just as well " as she had said it to president george w. bush .
german forces , the third-biggest component in the international security assistance force -lrb- isaf -rrb- , are based in safer northern afghanistan .
other armies have borne the brunt of the fighting in the south .
merkel may gain her chance to tell obama fairly soon when she attends a g20 summit in washington at the end of this week .
world leaders hope to see obama during their stay .
enthusiasm for obama has been huge in berlin most of this year : that helped ensure a crowd of 200,000 heard his speech in a city park on july 24 .
former defense minister expects pressure from obama the social democrats -lrb- spd -rrb- , the other main party in the merkel federal coalition , have claimed obama 's election as vindication for their own centre-left policies , but have also had an undertone of caution about afghanistan .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : obama is expected to ask for troops to help the us peter struck , who heads the spd parliamentary caucus and is a former german defense minister , told a sunday newspaper , bild am sonntag , he expected obama to seek more from nato and its european members .
but if obama requested german fighting troops in the south , " i would resist that most resolutely , " he said .
" there are limits . "
he said germany was already sending an extra 1,000 men to the north and offering advance-warning aircraft .
foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier , the social democrat who is to challenge merkel next year for the chancellorship , has already begun staking out that german position in diplomatic language .
he told a german newspaper , the hamburger abendblatt , on saturday that obama " highly appreciated " germany 's current contribution in afghanistan .
obama would not just seek more troops but also more reconstruction aid .
" we are very close to obama on this , " he said .
both merkel and steinmeier are driven on the troops issue by voter concerns about the afghan war .
german leaders wary as elections loom on horizon bildunterschrift : chancellor-candidate steinmeier is picking his words carefully on troop deployments with an election coming up in september , neither camp wants a surge in german casualties , including those from suicide attackers , to trigger a new round of anguish over the deployment .
surveys show most germans think the country is doing enough in afghanistan .
a forsa poll found 80 percent agree a us request for more troops should be refused and only 15 percent disagree .
however neither main party wants to upset obama at this stage by criticizing him .
the germans are eager to move forward with washington on many issues " in a spirit of togetherness , " merkel said .
she told the bild am sonntag on sunday those issues included " stabilizing afghanistan , " fixing the global financial crisis , fighting global warming and improving human rights .
steinmeier has already begun plans to demonstrate goodwill on another front , setting up plans to pay a call on the us-backed government in iraq next year and asking aides to draw up substantive aid plans for iraq .
that in itself is remarkable , since steinmeier , as chief of staff to former german chancellor gerhard schroeder , was a leading figure in germany 's refusal to assist the united states in the 2003 gulf war . dpa news agency -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

today its pulsating young fashion scene is giving paris , london and milan a run for their money .
fashion junkies will find plenty to keep them busy . plaster crumbles off building facades and when the street car rumbles by , the ground shakes a bit .
at first sight , berlin 's alte schoenhauser street looks like an ordinary residential street .
but this is where the city 's young fashion scene pulsates in row after row of designer shops . the area near the hackesche hoefe in the mitte district has become so well-known in the fashion world that it has boosted berlin 's reputation as one of europe 's most important fashion centers to a position on par with paris , milan and london . tourists who explore the area just north of downtown berlin will find that they can both admire the newest styles and buy them . reunification marked revival bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the districts of prenzlauer berg and friedrichshain are also fashion meccas " berlin 's fashion scene has a very long tradition .
it was already enigmatic and glamorous at the beginning of the 20th century , " said fashion journalist and book author nadine barth .
but this culture was destroyed by world war ii , and berlin , as a divided city , did not rebound from the blow .
that finally changed in 1989 . " the fall of the berlin wall strengthened the city 's arts community and reproduced the modern , sizzling , creative fashion scene , " said barth . michael michalsky - one of the big new names in german fashion - moved to berlin a few years ago .
michalsky has his own stores featuring his own collection and his name is associated with many top brands . " right now there 's no city more interesting than berlin , " said michalsky .
" berlin is not only the heart of new europe , but also an indicator of new social trends , which is important for the fashion world . " art schools have responded to the trend bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : british fashion guru vivienne westwood taught in berlin that 's a fact also recognized by berlin 's schools , which in recent years have founded numerous fashion study programs .
vivienne westwood taught for a long time at berlin university of the arts and students at the fashion school esmod profit from the city 's international networks spanning the world of fashion .
this school attracts young designers who stay in berlin after finishing their education . one of the best examples of this is sisi wasabi , a label with a mix of casual street clothes and elements borrowed from traditional german costumes .
berlin is not just a place to work for zerlina von dem bussche , owner of the sisi wasabi label . " berlin is a city that is tremendously inspiring through incessant change , " said von dem bussche . berlin draws fashion industry names bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : berlin now has its very own fashion week this boom in creativity has led even names that really count in the fashion industry to stalk the city .
events like berlin fashion week attract thousands of people who work in the fashion industry .
as a result berlin is not just a place where fashion is created , but also a place where it is vigorously bought and sold . tourists have taken notice .
they do n't have to search long because the large renowned stores have discovered new berlin fashion also .
galeries lafayette , in the friedrich street , is the ritzy offshoot of the same-named parisian department store and has set aside a corner for young designers . visitors to the upper floors find berlinomat where the latest styles in belts , bags , shirts and evening wear by various designers are available amid black lacquered walls .
but the biggest fashion discovery is the area around the hackesche hoefe .
while many tourists simply stroll in awe through the courtyard shopping area , fashion conscious visitors find clothes like no other here . " the area is a fashion bermuda triangle , " said barth , comparing the mysterious geographical region in the atlantic ocean to the shape formed by alte schoenhauser , mulack and rosenthaler streets form on the city map . the hackesche hoefe makes for an ideal starting point for a fashion tour of the area .
just behind the cinema is a store called berlinerklamotten that offers more than just a single designer 's line .
in fact about 140 fashion designers are represented on the ground floor of the factory-like building . every table and every rack has a different notion of fashion .
there are shiny sack purses reminiscent of the kind seen in children 's books , t-shirts with filigree motifs of the city , casual woolen jackets and colorfully-patterned overshirts . prices can be described as halfway toward moderate : about 40 euros -lrb- $ 52 -rrb- will buy you an unusual top and a unique pair of trousers cost around 120 euros . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : berlin label miroike showcased its work at the 2008 show anyone in the mood for a more extensive shopping spree should walk down neue schoenhauser street to where it turns into alte schoenhauser street .
wander past the dozens of stores there and then turn left onto mulack street .
there 's also one young designer store after another here .
in bless , for example , the collections are numbered like art objects , in van reimersdahl there are prints and lala berlin has knitted hats , scarves and hand warmers .
at some point , turn left onto rosenthaler street and go south toward the city center to complete the triangle . dpa news agency -lrb- jg -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

fashion junkies will find plenty to keep them busy . plaster crumbles off building facades and when the street car rumbles by , the ground shakes a bit .
at first sight , berlin 's alte schoenhauser street looks like an ordinary residential street .
but this is where the city 's young fashion scene pulsates in row after row of designer shops . the area near the hackesche hoefe in the mitte district has become so well-known in the fashion world that it has boosted berlin 's reputation as one of europe 's most important fashion centers to a position on par with paris , milan and london . tourists who explore the area just north of downtown berlin will find that they can both admire the newest styles and buy them . reunification marked revival bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the districts of prenzlauer berg and friedrichshain are also fashion meccas " berlin 's fashion scene has a very long tradition .
it was already enigmatic and glamorous at the beginning of the 20th century , " said fashion journalist and book author nadine barth .
but this culture was destroyed by world war ii , and berlin , as a divided city , did not rebound from the blow .
that finally changed in 1989 . " the fall of the berlin wall strengthened the city 's arts community and reproduced the modern , sizzling , creative fashion scene , " said barth . michael michalsky - one of the big new names in german fashion - moved to berlin a few years ago .
michalsky has his own stores featuring his own collection and his name is associated with many top brands . " right now there 's no city more interesting than berlin , " said michalsky .
" berlin is not only the heart of new europe , but also an indicator of new social trends , which is important for the fashion world . " art schools have responded to the trend bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : british fashion guru vivienne westwood taught in berlin that 's a fact also recognized by berlin 's schools , which in recent years have founded numerous fashion study programs .

this school attracts young designers who stay in berlin after finishing their education . one of the best examples of this is sisi wasabi , a label with a mix of casual street clothes and elements borrowed from traditional german costumes .

they do n't have to search long because the large renowned stores have discovered new berlin fashion also .
galeries lafayette , in the friedrich street , is the ritzy offshoot of the same-named parisian department store and has set aside a corner for young designers . visitors to the upper floors find berlinomat where the latest styles in belts , bags , shirts and evening wear by various designers are available amid black lacquered walls .
but the biggest fashion discovery is the area around the hackesche hoefe .
while many tourists simply stroll in awe through the courtyard shopping area , fashion conscious visitors find clothes like no other here . " the area is a fashion bermuda triangle , " said barth , comparing the mysterious geographical region in the atlantic ocean to the shape formed by alte schoenhauser , mulack and rosenthaler streets form on the city map . the hackesche hoefe makes for an ideal starting point for a fashion tour of the area .
just behind the cinema is a store called berlinerklamotten that offers more than just a single designer 's line .
in fact about 140 fashion designers are represented on the ground floor of the factory-like building . every table and every rack has a different notion of fashion .
there are shiny sack purses reminiscent of the kind seen in children 's books , t-shirts with filigree motifs of the city , casual woolen jackets and colorfully-patterned overshirts . prices can be described as halfway toward moderate : about 40 euros -lrb- $ 52 -rrb- will buy you an unusual top and a unique pair of trousers cost around 120 euros . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : berlin label miroike showcased its work at the 2008 show anyone in the mood for a more extensive shopping spree should walk down neue schoenhauser street to where it turns into alte schoenhauser street .

there 's also one young designer store after another here .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de integration -pipe- 09.11.2008 female imams reach out into german communities großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : leading friday prayers continues to be the domain of men religious leaders in mosques are for the large part men .
in germany , just over a dozen female imams work in their communities .
yet more women are urgently needed in the mosques for counseling and integration aid . they lead prayers , give koran lessons and offer counseling .
whether it 's new york , berlin , cairo or istanbul : female imams are currently high in demand . zeynep cesen is one of the very few female imams who came to germany from turkey to specifically help women in muslim communities .
even when friday prayers continue to be the domain of her male counterparts , cesen 's range of responsibilities is very diverse , but she mainly helps women with their problems . " it 's generally young women who came here from turkey , " cesen said .
" we listen to their problems and try to find solutions . " due to her close contact to women of all ages , cesen reaches circles which a male imam in germany never could .
this is one of the reasons why the turkish-islamic union ditib employs female imams , said speaker ayse aydin . " religious services and human needs ca n't always be separated , " aydin said .
ditib 's goal is serving the needs of the community .
this included consciously addressing women , answering their questions and giving them the possibility to feel secure in the community , she said . supporting integration efforts when cesen came to germany at the beginning of the 1990s , her position was initially limited to six years .
today , she counsels up to 100 women per day . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : women and girls of all ages seek cesen 's advice in addition to her counseling tasks , she has developed her own form of preaching .
she said she answers religious questions " not down from the pulpit " but rather in discussion rounds with different women 's groups .
and daily problems are not excluded . women of all ages and with various social and personal problems turn to her .
many women would not open up to a male imam . " there are many things that women only want to share with women , " cesen said , adding that a warm and friendly atmosphere was necessary in order to share certain problems and issues . cesen said she reaches many turkish families through her intensive counseling work with women .
she said she wants to show them possibilities to access german society .
she said integration problems of mainly young turks in schools and training facilities require urgent action , cesen said . cesen said she urged both turkish businesses as well as german companies to create more training opportunities for young people .
in addition , much more needed to be done for women of turkish descent in order for their integration to succeed . dialog with christians when cesen speaks , many people in her community are all ears - even non-muslims . " she is often consulted from outside , too , " said ditib speaker aydin .
" we are proud of the work which our imam does here . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : integrating turks into german society still faces many problems cesen said she sees her contribution in an interchange with the neighborhood . " we need one another in good times as well as in bad times , " she said .
" so we need a good dialog with our german friends . " cesen said she therefore needed to be a good role model and encourage her community to do the same .
this included , for example , that muslims and christians wish each other happy holidays , no matter if it 's christmas or ramadan .
or that you go visit neighbors who are ill . the 50-year-old cesen is one of only 13 female imams currently working in turkish mosques in germany .
this is in part due to the lack of theological training for imams in germany .
the turkish-islamic union would like to have theologians trained in germany and foremost , ones who speak german well . cesen studied at the faculty for islamic theology in izmir and worked as an imam in turkey for 18 years before coming to germany in 1994 .
here , she initially served 51 mosque communities in cologne and the surrounding areas .
today , she works solely for ditib . diyanet , the state authority for religious affairs in turkey , helps select female theologians for the ditib communities .
since 2002 , there has been a more intensive preparation for female and male imams who are to be employed in germany .
they are prepared for their new tasks with german courses and cultural studies at the goethe institute in ankara .
after all , they are supposed to help their fellow countrymen and women to better integrate themselves in germany . whether the union can raise the current number of female imams for germany is unclear .
many turkish mosques in germany would like to have a woman in their ranks .
it would be a measure which would unburden cesen and her female colleagues . ulrike hummel -lrb- sac -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

in germany , just over a dozen female imams work in their communities .
yet more women are urgently needed in the mosques for counseling and integration aid . they lead prayers , give koran lessons and offer counseling .
whether it 's new york , berlin , cairo or istanbul : female imams are currently high in demand . zeynep cesen is one of the very few female imams who came to germany from turkey to specifically help women in muslim communities .
even when friday prayers continue to be the domain of her male counterparts , cesen 's range of responsibilities is very diverse , but she mainly helps women with their problems . " it 's generally young women who came here from turkey , " cesen said .
" we listen to their problems and try to find solutions . " due to her close contact to women of all ages , cesen reaches circles which a male imam in germany never could .
this is one of the reasons why the turkish-islamic union ditib employs female imams , said speaker ayse aydin . " religious services and human needs ca n't always be separated , " aydin said .
ditib 's goal is serving the needs of the community .
this included consciously addressing women , answering their questions and giving them the possibility to feel secure in the community , she said . supporting integration efforts when cesen came to germany at the beginning of the 1990s , her position was initially limited to six years .
today , she counsels up to 100 women per day . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : women and girls of all ages seek cesen 's advice in addition to her counseling tasks , she has developed her own form of preaching .
she said she answers religious questions " not down from the pulpit " but rather in discussion rounds with different women 's groups .
and daily problems are not excluded . women of all ages and with various social and personal problems turn to her .
many women would not open up to a male imam . " there are many things that women only want to share with women , " cesen said , adding that a warm and friendly atmosphere was necessary in order to share certain problems and issues . cesen said she reaches many turkish families through her intensive counseling work with women .
she said she wants to show them possibilities to access german society .
she said integration problems of mainly young turks in schools and training facilities require urgent action , cesen said . cesen said she urged both turkish businesses as well as german companies to create more training opportunities for young people .
in addition , much more needed to be done for women of turkish descent in order for their integration to succeed . dialog with christians when cesen speaks , many people in her community are all ears - even non-muslims . " she is often consulted from outside , too , " said ditib speaker aydin .
" we are proud of the work which our imam does here . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : integrating turks into german society still faces many problems cesen said she sees her contribution in an interchange with the neighborhood . " we need one another in good times as well as in bad times , " she said .
" so we need a good dialog with our german friends . " cesen said she therefore needed to be a good role model and encourage her community to do the same .
this included , for example , that muslims and christians wish each other happy holidays , no matter if it 's christmas or ramadan .
or that you go visit neighbors who are ill . the 50-year-old cesen is one of only 13 female imams currently working in turkish mosques in germany .
this is in part due to the lack of theological training for imams in germany .
the turkish-islamic union would like to have theologians trained in germany and foremost , ones who speak german well . cesen studied at the faculty for islamic theology in izmir and worked as an imam in turkey for 18 years before coming to germany in 1994 .
here , she initially served 51 mosque communities in cologne and the surrounding areas .
today , she works solely for ditib . diyanet , the state authority for religious affairs in turkey , helps select female theologians for the ditib communities .
since 2002 , there has been a more intensive preparation for female and male imams who are to be employed in germany .
they are prepared for their new tasks with german courses and cultural studies at the goethe institute in ankara .
after all , they are supposed to help their fellow countrymen and women to better integrate themselves in germany . whether the union can raise the current number of female imams for germany is unclear .
many turkish mosques in germany would like to have a woman in their ranks .
it would be a measure which would unburden cesen and her female colleagues . ulrike hummel -lrb- sac -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" we , both of us , affirmed that we will continue in these negotiations and that we will not stop even as israel prepares to go for elections , " abbas told a joint news conference with livni .
" our meetings will continue as usual , " he added .
for her part , livni said that the continued talks , aimed at forging an israeli-palestinian peace resulting in a palestinian state , would continue the framework agreed on at last year 's annapolis peace summit , when the sides agreed to rekindle the negotiations after a seven-year hiatus .
" the annapolis process serves the interest of both parties , the israeli and palestinian , " she said .
quartet pledges further support bildunterschrift : the middle east quartet - the us , eu , un and russia - offer its continued support the process ' sponsors - the so-called quartet of the us , russia , the european union and the united nations - said in a statement that they would continue their commitment supporting the parties efforts and also pledged to " respect the bilateral and confidential nature of the negotiations . "
renewed officially at the turn of the year , the negotiations , headed by livni for the israelis and former-premier ahmed quriea for the palestinians , have been conducted amid a virtual media blackout , with concomitant conflicting reports of the progress being made .
but according to an israeli foreign ministry communiqué , livni told the quartet sunday that " real and intensive progress " has been made , and the sides believed they had the elements , guiding principles and trust needed to create a good basis for a deal .
at annapolis abbas and israeli prime minister ehud olmert pledged to try and secure a treaty by the end of the year , but on thursday us secretary of state condoleezza rice conceded that this is unlikely to happen , as israel heads for elections early next year .
fears have also been expressed that the transition period in the us , as president-elect barack obama prepares to take office , may affect the momentum of the talks .
tough issues under negotiation bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : rice , solana and lavrov heard the report in sharm el-sheikh officials from both sides have said that it is proving difficult to reach agreement on the many tough issues that are under negotiations which include the future of east jerusalem , the fate of palestinian refugees , the borders and management of natural resources , especially water .
both israelis and palestinians say they need more time to agree .
east jerusalem is proving to be an especially tough issue to settle , and an israeli trial balloon , to conclude a partial agreement without it , was quickly shot down by the palestinians .
in sharm el-sheikh on sunday , neither livni nor abbas expressed any indication of how much longer the two sides would need to conclude an agreement according to the annapolis framework , but both agreed and said that nothing is done until it is actually done .
abbas and livni did not take any questions from the press .
however , speaking privately their aides said that each side was more or less satisfied with the outcome of the sharm el-sheikh meeting .
the israelis said that they were pleased with the consensus they have with the palestinians and the international community as represented in the quartet to " stick to the annapolis process " .
" it is important that we do n't keep seeing new initiatives being offered every day .
this will complicate matters , " said one israeli source who spoke on condition of anonymity to the dpa news agency .
livni had called on the international community not to intervene in the talks by submitting " bridging proposals and initiatives which do not suit reality . "
the palestinians said they were also pleased with the understanding the quartet demonstrated for their determination to secure a comprehensive settlement .
" we can not go back to our people with bits and pieces .
the palestinians have suffered for a long time and now they want to see the final peace deal and their state , " said a palestinian source , who asked not to be named .
israel also received more assurances from the palestinians , the egyptian host of the meeting and the quartet members that all efforts will be duly exerted to observe their security concerns , diplomatic sources said .

7 , club chairman karl-heinz rummenigge has leapt to his defense . " we are convinced jurgen is the right coach for bayern , " rummenigge told the club 's agm in munich on friday night after klinsmann received whistles before sunday 's bundesliga clash with schalke 04 in gelsenkirchen .
" he is a very modern and innovative coach , and we are convinced of the fact that we will celebrate plenty of successes with him . "
although bayern were fourth before sunday 's game , some bayern fans remain unconvinced klinsmann is the right man after munich 's poor start to the league which saw them 11th last month after defeat 's to werder bremen and hanover .
" we are already seeing improvement and his philosophy works , " insisted rummenigge .
" we can be confident of the future . "
bayern captain mark van bommel said the german giants feel the pressure at the munich club where failure is not an option .
" it is a requirement at bayern that we win titles , third place is not the goal , " said the dutch hard-man .

meanwhile , bayern will be without injured pair bastian schweinsteiger and lukas podolski against schalke as both are struggling with knocks received in last wednesday 's champions league 1-1 draw at fiorentina .
" lukas has back problems which makes his involvement not possible and bastian continues to suffer from the bruised leg he picked up against fiorentina , " said klinsmann on the bayern website .
but italian world cup winner luca toni is back in the team and the striker will play from the start .
klinsmann said germany defender philipp lahm is back in training after picking up an ankle injury a fortnight ago , but will not feature against schalke .

the pair met maradona in a munich hotel for nearly an hour on thursday as part of his tour of european-based players to discuss tactics in the run up to the 2010 world cup .
both players have both been called up for maradona 's first match in charge , the meeting with scotland on november 19 at hampden park , glasgow .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : new argentina coach maradona is on a world tour " he wanted to establish a personal relationship with us and outline his plans , " said said demichelis , who admitted maradona was a child-hood hero .
" i 've previously met maradona , but that 's the first time i 've spoken to him for any length of time .
that was a gift from football , and a moment i 'll never forget .
" his presence is enough to motivate you to new heights .
you ca n't ask for more than having the greatest idol and the last world cup winning coach come to munich just to see jose and me .
" around 80 argentine players are performing at the highest level with european clubs .
we could put out three or four strong teams .
making it into the national side is incredibly difficult . "
the fact that maradona came to munich solely to see demichelis and sosa was a sign of the duo 's importance , according to klinsmann .

" germany must , should and will take on responsibility , " she said .
but in remarks to supporters a day later , the limits to german willingness were clear .
germany has not forgotten an obama speech in berlin in june during which he called on the germans to take on more of the fighting burden in afghanistan , where german soldiers have rarely fought the taliban .
merkel told the youth section of her christian democratic union -lrb- cdu -rrb- that berlin would not accede to any request from the next us administration to send troops to southern afghanistan , the scene of most fighting .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel will give obama the same message as she gave bush " wherever germany commits itself , a wholeness of military and civilian assistance should be visible , " she said .
she would be able to tell obama that " just as well " as she had said it to president george w. bush .
german forces , the third-biggest component in the international security assistance force -lrb- isaf -rrb- , are based in safer northern afghanistan .
other armies have borne the brunt of the fighting in the south .
merkel may gain her chance to tell obama fairly soon when she attends a g20 summit in washington at the end of this week .
world leaders hope to see obama during their stay .
enthusiasm for obama has been huge in berlin most of this year : that helped ensure a crowd of 200,000 heard his speech in a city park on july 24 .
former defense minister expects pressure from obama the social democrats -lrb- spd -rrb- , the other main party in the merkel federal coalition , have claimed obama 's election as vindication for their own centre-left policies , but have also had an undertone of caution about afghanistan .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : obama is expected to ask for troops to help the us peter struck , who heads the spd parliamentary caucus and is a former german defense minister , told a sunday newspaper , bild am sonntag , he expected obama to seek more from nato and its european members .
but if obama requested german fighting troops in the south , " i would resist that most resolutely , " he said .
" there are limits . "
he said germany was already sending an extra 1,000 men to the north and offering advance-warning aircraft .
foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier , the social democrat who is to challenge merkel next year for the chancellorship , has already begun staking out that german position in diplomatic language .
he told a german newspaper , the hamburger abendblatt , on saturday that obama " highly appreciated " germany 's current contribution in afghanistan .
obama would not just seek more troops but also more reconstruction aid .
" we are very close to obama on this , " he said .
both merkel and steinmeier are driven on the troops issue by voter concerns about the afghan war .
german leaders wary as elections loom on horizon bildunterschrift : chancellor-candidate steinmeier is picking his words carefully on troop deployments with an election coming up in september , neither camp wants a surge in german casualties , including those from suicide attackers , to trigger a new round of anguish over the deployment .
surveys show most germans think the country is doing enough in afghanistan .
a forsa poll found 80 percent agree a us request for more troops should be refused and only 15 percent disagree .
however neither main party wants to upset obama at this stage by criticizing him .
the germans are eager to move forward with washington on many issues " in a spirit of togetherness , " merkel said .
she told the bild am sonntag on sunday those issues included " stabilizing afghanistan , " fixing the global financial crisis , fighting global warming and improving human rights .
steinmeier has already begun plans to demonstrate goodwill on another front , setting up plans to pay a call on the us-backed government in iraq next year and asking aides to draw up substantive aid plans for iraq .
that in itself is remarkable , since steinmeier , as chief of staff to former german chancellor gerhard schroeder , was a leading figure in germany 's refusal to assist the united states in the 2003 gulf war . dpa news agency -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the german president also stressed that as-yet-unexplained issues of raw material exploration were also behind the conflict in the east of the democratic republic of congo .
" part of the complexity in the east of the congo is also the question of who wants the commodity , the raw materials and who is exploiting the raw materials and who is behind these exploitations , " koehler said .
" there is no doubt that the international community and the european community is in close contact with african leaders to find out what should be the sustainable solution , " he added .

" the 21st century demands that we both depend on each other in credibility and should not talk about good governance in a corrupt setting , " koehler said .
africa , he added , had a right to its own structures and the principles and foundations of its leaders " should not be influenced by the european definition of ideas . "
koehler began a state visit to nigeria on monday and over the weekend participated in the africa forum where participants agreed on policies to tackle some of africa 's challenges .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de integration -pipe- 09.11.2008 female imams reach out into german communities großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : leading friday prayers continues to be the domain of men religious leaders in mosques are for the large part men .
in germany , just over a dozen female imams work in their communities .
yet more women are urgently needed in the mosques for counseling and integration aid . they lead prayers , give koran lessons and offer counseling .
whether it 's new york , berlin , cairo or istanbul : female imams are currently high in demand . zeynep cesen is one of the very few female imams who came to germany from turkey to specifically help women in muslim communities .
even when friday prayers continue to be the domain of her male counterparts , cesen 's range of responsibilities is very diverse , but she mainly helps women with their problems . " it 's generally young women who came here from turkey , " cesen said .
" we listen to their problems and try to find solutions . " due to her close contact to women of all ages , cesen reaches circles which a male imam in germany never could .
this is one of the reasons why the turkish-islamic union ditib employs female imams , said speaker ayse aydin . " religious services and human needs ca n't always be separated , " aydin said .
ditib 's goal is serving the needs of the community .
this included consciously addressing women , answering their questions and giving them the possibility to feel secure in the community , she said . supporting integration efforts when cesen came to germany at the beginning of the 1990s , her position was initially limited to six years .
today , she counsels up to 100 women per day . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : women and girls of all ages seek cesen 's advice in addition to her counseling tasks , she has developed her own form of preaching .
she said she answers religious questions " not down from the pulpit " but rather in discussion rounds with different women 's groups .
and daily problems are not excluded . women of all ages and with various social and personal problems turn to her .
many women would not open up to a male imam . " there are many things that women only want to share with women , " cesen said , adding that a warm and friendly atmosphere was necessary in order to share certain problems and issues . cesen said she reaches many turkish families through her intensive counseling work with women .
she said she wants to show them possibilities to access german society .
she said integration problems of mainly young turks in schools and training facilities require urgent action , cesen said . cesen said she urged both turkish businesses as well as german companies to create more training opportunities for young people .
in addition , much more needed to be done for women of turkish descent in order for their integration to succeed . dialog with christians when cesen speaks , many people in her community are all ears - even non-muslims . " she is often consulted from outside , too , " said ditib speaker aydin .
" we are proud of the work which our imam does here . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : integrating turks into german society still faces many problems cesen said she sees her contribution in an interchange with the neighborhood . " we need one another in good times as well as in bad times , " she said .
" so we need a good dialog with our german friends . " cesen said she therefore needed to be a good role model and encourage her community to do the same .
this included , for example , that muslims and christians wish each other happy holidays , no matter if it 's christmas or ramadan .
or that you go visit neighbors who are ill . the 50-year-old cesen is one of only 13 female imams currently working in turkish mosques in germany .
this is in part due to the lack of theological training for imams in germany .
the turkish-islamic union would like to have theologians trained in germany and foremost , ones who speak german well . cesen studied at the faculty for islamic theology in izmir and worked as an imam in turkey for 18 years before coming to germany in 1994 .
here , she initially served 51 mosque communities in cologne and the surrounding areas .
today , she works solely for ditib . diyanet , the state authority for religious affairs in turkey , helps select female theologians for the ditib communities .
since 2002 , there has been a more intensive preparation for female and male imams who are to be employed in germany .
they are prepared for their new tasks with german courses and cultural studies at the goethe institute in ankara .
after all , they are supposed to help their fellow countrymen and women to better integrate themselves in germany . whether the union can raise the current number of female imams for germany is unclear .
many turkish mosques in germany would like to have a woman in their ranks .
it would be a measure which would unburden cesen and her female colleagues . ulrike hummel -lrb- sac -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" we , both of us , affirmed that we will continue in these negotiations and that we will not stop even as israel prepares to go for elections , " abbas told a joint news conference with livni .
" our meetings will continue as usual , " he added .
for her part , livni said that the continued talks , aimed at forging an israeli-palestinian peace resulting in a palestinian state , would continue the framework agreed on at last year 's annapolis peace summit , when the sides agreed to rekindle the negotiations after a seven-year hiatus .
" the annapolis process serves the interest of both parties , the israeli and palestinian , " she said .
quartet pledges further support bildunterschrift : the middle east quartet - the us , eu , un and russia - offer its continued support the process ' sponsors - the so-called quartet of the us , russia , the european union and the united nations - said in a statement that they would continue their commitment supporting the parties efforts and also pledged to " respect the bilateral and confidential nature of the negotiations . "
renewed officially at the turn of the year , the negotiations , headed by livni for the israelis and former-premier ahmed quriea for the palestinians , have been conducted amid a virtual media blackout , with concomitant conflicting reports of the progress being made .
but according to an israeli foreign ministry communiqué , livni told the quartet sunday that " real and intensive progress " has been made , and the sides believed they had the elements , guiding principles and trust needed to create a good basis for a deal .
at annapolis abbas and israeli prime minister ehud olmert pledged to try and secure a treaty by the end of the year , but on thursday us secretary of state condoleezza rice conceded that this is unlikely to happen , as israel heads for elections early next year .
fears have also been expressed that the transition period in the us , as president-elect barack obama prepares to take office , may affect the momentum of the talks .
tough issues under negotiation bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : rice , solana and lavrov heard the report in sharm el-sheikh officials from both sides have said that it is proving difficult to reach agreement on the many tough issues that are under negotiations which include the future of east jerusalem , the fate of palestinian refugees , the borders and management of natural resources , especially water .
both israelis and palestinians say they need more time to agree .
east jerusalem is proving to be an especially tough issue to settle , and an israeli trial balloon , to conclude a partial agreement without it , was quickly shot down by the palestinians .
in sharm el-sheikh on sunday , neither livni nor abbas expressed any indication of how much longer the two sides would need to conclude an agreement according to the annapolis framework , but both agreed and said that nothing is done until it is actually done .
abbas and livni did not take any questions from the press .
however , speaking privately their aides said that each side was more or less satisfied with the outcome of the sharm el-sheikh meeting .
the israelis said that they were pleased with the consensus they have with the palestinians and the international community as represented in the quartet to " stick to the annapolis process " .
" it is important that we do n't keep seeing new initiatives being offered every day .
this will complicate matters , " said one israeli source who spoke on condition of anonymity to the dpa news agency .
livni had called on the international community not to intervene in the talks by submitting " bridging proposals and initiatives which do not suit reality . "
the palestinians said they were also pleased with the understanding the quartet demonstrated for their determination to secure a comprehensive settlement .
" we can not go back to our people with bits and pieces .
the palestinians have suffered for a long time and now they want to see the final peace deal and their state , " said a palestinian source , who asked not to be named .
israel also received more assurances from the palestinians , the egyptian host of the meeting and the quartet members that all efforts will be duly exerted to observe their security concerns , diplomatic sources said .

tony blair , the quartet envoy to the middle east , who is in charge of observing the flow of international financial aid to the palestinians said sunday that he would continue to work for the support of palestinian economy and for the upgrade of palestinian security .

" germany must , should and will take on responsibility , " she said .
but in remarks to supporters a day later , the limits to german willingness were clear .
germany has not forgotten an obama speech in berlin in june during which he called on the germans to take on more of the fighting burden in afghanistan , where german soldiers have rarely fought the taliban .
merkel told the youth section of her christian democratic union -lrb- cdu -rrb- that berlin would not accede to any request from the next us administration to send troops to southern afghanistan , the scene of most fighting .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel will give obama the same message as she gave bush " wherever germany commits itself , a wholeness of military and civilian assistance should be visible , " she said .
she would be able to tell obama that " just as well " as she had said it to president george w. bush .
german forces , the third-biggest component in the international security assistance force -lrb- isaf -rrb- , are based in safer northern afghanistan .
other armies have borne the brunt of the fighting in the south .
merkel may gain her chance to tell obama fairly soon when she attends a g20 summit in washington at the end of this week .
world leaders hope to see obama during their stay .
enthusiasm for obama has been huge in berlin most of this year : that helped ensure a crowd of 200,000 heard his speech in a city park on july 24 .
former defense minister expects pressure from obama the social democrats -lrb- spd -rrb- , the other main party in the merkel federal coalition , have claimed obama 's election as vindication for their own centre-left policies , but have also had an undertone of caution about afghanistan .

but if obama requested german fighting troops in the south , " i would resist that most resolutely , " he said .
" there are limits . "
he said germany was already sending an extra 1,000 men to the north and offering advance-warning aircraft .
foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier , the social democrat who is to challenge merkel next year for the chancellorship , has already begun staking out that german position in diplomatic language .
he told a german newspaper , the hamburger abendblatt , on saturday that obama " highly appreciated " germany 's current contribution in afghanistan .
obama would not just seek more troops but also more reconstruction aid .
" we are very close to obama on this , " he said .
both merkel and steinmeier are driven on the troops issue by voter concerns about the afghan war .
german leaders wary as elections loom on horizon bildunterschrift : chancellor-candidate steinmeier is picking his words carefully on troop deployments with an election coming up in september , neither camp wants a surge in german casualties , including those from suicide attackers , to trigger a new round of anguish over the deployment .
surveys show most germans think the country is doing enough in afghanistan .
a forsa poll found 80 percent agree a us request for more troops should be refused and only 15 percent disagree .

the germans are eager to move forward with washington on many issues " in a spirit of togetherness , " merkel said .

in germany , just over a dozen female imams work in their communities .
yet more women are urgently needed in the mosques for counseling and integration aid . they lead prayers , give koran lessons and offer counseling .
whether it 's new york , berlin , cairo or istanbul : female imams are currently high in demand . zeynep cesen is one of the very few female imams who came to germany from turkey to specifically help women in muslim communities .
even when friday prayers continue to be the domain of her male counterparts , cesen 's range of responsibilities is very diverse , but she mainly helps women with their problems . " it 's generally young women who came here from turkey , " cesen said .
" we listen to their problems and try to find solutions . " due to her close contact to women of all ages , cesen reaches circles which a male imam in germany never could .
this is one of the reasons why the turkish-islamic union ditib employs female imams , said speaker ayse aydin . " religious services and human needs ca n't always be separated , " aydin said .
ditib 's goal is serving the needs of the community .
this included consciously addressing women , answering their questions and giving them the possibility to feel secure in the community , she said . supporting integration efforts when cesen came to germany at the beginning of the 1990s , her position was initially limited to six years .
today , she counsels up to 100 women per day . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : women and girls of all ages seek cesen 's advice in addition to her counseling tasks , she has developed her own form of preaching .
she said she answers religious questions " not down from the pulpit " but rather in discussion rounds with different women 's groups .
and daily problems are not excluded . women of all ages and with various social and personal problems turn to her .
many women would not open up to a male imam . " there are many things that women only want to share with women , " cesen said , adding that a warm and friendly atmosphere was necessary in order to share certain problems and issues . cesen said she reaches many turkish families through her intensive counseling work with women .
she said she wants to show them possibilities to access german society .
she said integration problems of mainly young turks in schools and training facilities require urgent action , cesen said . cesen said she urged both turkish businesses as well as german companies to create more training opportunities for young people .
in addition , much more needed to be done for women of turkish descent in order for their integration to succeed . dialog with christians when cesen speaks , many people in her community are all ears - even non-muslims . " she is often consulted from outside , too , " said ditib speaker aydin .
" we are proud of the work which our imam does here . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : integrating turks into german society still faces many problems cesen said she sees her contribution in an interchange with the neighborhood . " we need one another in good times as well as in bad times , " she said .
" so we need a good dialog with our german friends . " cesen said she therefore needed to be a good role model and encourage her community to do the same .
this included , for example , that muslims and christians wish each other happy holidays , no matter if it 's christmas or ramadan .
or that you go visit neighbors who are ill . the 50-year-old cesen is one of only 13 female imams currently working in turkish mosques in germany .
this is in part due to the lack of theological training for imams in germany .
the turkish-islamic union would like to have theologians trained in germany and foremost , ones who speak german well . cesen studied at the faculty for islamic theology in izmir and worked as an imam in turkey for 18 years before coming to germany in 1994 .
here , she initially served 51 mosque communities in cologne and the surrounding areas .
today , she works solely for ditib . diyanet , the state authority for religious affairs in turkey , helps select female theologians for the ditib communities .
since 2002 , there has been a more intensive preparation for female and male imams who are to be employed in germany .
they are prepared for their new tasks with german courses and cultural studies at the goethe institute in ankara .
after all , they are supposed to help their fellow countrymen and women to better integrate themselves in germany . whether the union can raise the current number of female imams for germany is unclear .
many turkish mosques in germany would like to have a woman in their ranks .

in germany , just over a dozen female imams work in their communities .
yet more women are urgently needed in the mosques for counseling and integration aid . they lead prayers , give koran lessons and offer counseling .
whether it 's new york , berlin , cairo or istanbul : female imams are currently high in demand . zeynep cesen is one of the very few female imams who came to germany from turkey to specifically help women in muslim communities .
even when friday prayers continue to be the domain of her male counterparts , cesen 's range of responsibilities is very diverse , but she mainly helps women with their problems . " it 's generally young women who came here from turkey , " cesen said .
" we listen to their problems and try to find solutions . " due to her close contact to women of all ages , cesen reaches circles which a male imam in germany never could .
this is one of the reasons why the turkish-islamic union ditib employs female imams , said speaker ayse aydin . " religious services and human needs ca n't always be separated , " aydin said .
ditib 's goal is serving the needs of the community .
this included consciously addressing women , answering their questions and giving them the possibility to feel secure in the community , she said . supporting integration efforts when cesen came to germany at the beginning of the 1990s , her position was initially limited to six years .
today , she counsels up to 100 women per day . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : women and girls of all ages seek cesen 's advice in addition to her counseling tasks , she has developed her own form of preaching .
she said she answers religious questions " not down from the pulpit " but rather in discussion rounds with different women 's groups .
and daily problems are not excluded . women of all ages and with various social and personal problems turn to her .
many women would not open up to a male imam . " there are many things that women only want to share with women , " cesen said , adding that a warm and friendly atmosphere was necessary in order to share certain problems and issues . cesen said she reaches many turkish families through her intensive counseling work with women .
she said she wants to show them possibilities to access german society .
she said integration problems of mainly young turks in schools and training facilities require urgent action , cesen said . cesen said she urged both turkish businesses as well as german companies to create more training opportunities for young people .
in addition , much more needed to be done for women of turkish descent in order for their integration to succeed . dialog with christians when cesen speaks , many people in her community are all ears - even non-muslims . " she is often consulted from outside , too , " said ditib speaker aydin .
" we are proud of the work which our imam does here . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : integrating turks into german society still faces many problems cesen said she sees her contribution in an interchange with the neighborhood . " we need one another in good times as well as in bad times , " she said .
" so we need a good dialog with our german friends . " cesen said she therefore needed to be a good role model and encourage her community to do the same .
this included , for example , that muslims and christians wish each other happy holidays , no matter if it 's christmas or ramadan .
or that you go visit neighbors who are ill . the 50-year-old cesen is one of only 13 female imams currently working in turkish mosques in germany .
this is in part due to the lack of theological training for imams in germany .
the turkish-islamic union would like to have theologians trained in germany and foremost , ones who speak german well . cesen studied at the faculty for islamic theology in izmir and worked as an imam in turkey for 18 years before coming to germany in 1994 .
here , she initially served 51 mosque communities in cologne and the surrounding areas .
today , she works solely for ditib . diyanet , the state authority for religious affairs in turkey , helps select female theologians for the ditib communities .
since 2002 , there has been a more intensive preparation for female and male imams who are to be employed in germany .
they are prepared for their new tasks with german courses and cultural studies at the goethe institute in ankara .
after all , they are supposed to help their fellow countrymen and women to better integrate themselves in germany . whether the union can raise the current number of female imams for germany is unclear .

9 , the horrific violence unleashed 70 years ago against jews in germany on the night of broken glass , and from rome , pope benedict xvi , appealed for vigilance against anti-semitism . germans can not be indifferent to anti-semitism , chancellor angela merkel said sunday , nov .
9 , at a berlin ceremony to recall a 1938 pogrom against jewish residents of germany . " indifference is the first step towards endangering essential values , " merkel said during germany 's national memorial ceremony at the old synagogue in berlin 's rykestrasse .
" xenophobia , racism and anti-semitism must never be given an opportunity in europe again . " she added that germany needs to encourage moral courage in the face of racism and anti-semitism . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel said germans must not be indifferent to xenophobia , racism or anti-semitism " there was no storm of protest against the nazi , but silence , shrugged shoulders and people looking away - from individual citizens to large parts of the church , " she said .
" we can not be silent , we can not be indifferent when jewish cemeteries are desecrated and rabbis are insulted on the street . " it is a mistake to think it does n't affect you when your neighbors are affected , " merkel added .
" this mistake just leads us further and further into evil . " in an annual symbol of how jewish life is flowering again in germany , yet another community opened a synagogue on sunday . the building is a half-timbered village synagogue that was in use from 1825 to 1937 and was carefully moved to its new site in the central city of goettingen and renovated . in another city , speyer , the jewish community was laying the foundation stone for a new synagogue . pope recalls horror of kristallnacht bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : pope benedict spoke of a deep solidarity with the jews pope benedict , who is german , spoke out after public prayers sunday in rome on the horrific legacy of the 1938 violence . he said vigilance was needed against anti-semitism and every form of discrimination .
he said he spoke " in deep solidarity with the jewish world . " at the national ceremony , in the synagogue first opened in 1904 in berlin 's rykestrasse and re-inaugurated two years ago , emotion overwhelmed charlotte knobloch , 76 , president of germany 's central council of jews . she recalled being led through munich as a child by her father and seeing the destruction and indifferent lookers-on in 1938 . at the end of her speech , she sobbed for a moment before she could read her closing line , based on a remark by henrik mandelbaum , who survived the nazis ' auschwitz death camp . " i beg you not to ever let anyone talk you into whom you have to love and whom you have to hate , " she said . the late november 9 , 1938 pogrom , a precursor to the holocaust , ultimately led to more than 1,300 deaths from injuries , by suicide or in concentration camps , official historians have said . vicious pogrom a precursor for holocaust flames leapt into the sky across germany when the nazis gave a foretaste of the holocaust in the vicious pogrom against the jewish community .
by the time the rampage had ended , thousands of jewish homes , businesses and synagogues had been burned down or looted by thugs as police and fire brigades looked on . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the day after the night of broken glass " everything said about it is harmless compared to the reality of what actually happened , " said one berlin woman whose recollections are documented at the central jewish information office . another witness from dusseldorf described how jews , " dragged from their beds in pajamas and nightgowns , " were forced " to walk through the broken glass without any footwear .

" germany must , should and will take on responsibility , " she said .
but in remarks to supporters a day later , the limits to german willingness were clear .
germany has not forgotten an obama speech in berlin in june during which he called on the germans to take on more of the fighting burden in afghanistan , where german soldiers have rarely fought the taliban .
merkel told the youth section of her christian democratic union -lrb- cdu -rrb- that berlin would not accede to any request from the next us administration to send troops to southern afghanistan , the scene of most fighting .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel will give obama the same message as she gave bush " wherever germany commits itself , a wholeness of military and civilian assistance should be visible , " she said .
she would be able to tell obama that " just as well " as she had said it to president george w. bush .
german forces , the third-biggest component in the international security assistance force -lrb- isaf -rrb- , are based in safer northern afghanistan .
other armies have borne the brunt of the fighting in the south .
merkel may gain her chance to tell obama fairly soon when she attends a g20 summit in washington at the end of this week .
world leaders hope to see obama during their stay .
enthusiasm for obama has been huge in berlin most of this year : that helped ensure a crowd of 200,000 heard his speech in a city park on july 24 .
former defense minister expects pressure from obama the social democrats -lrb- spd -rrb- , the other main party in the merkel federal coalition , have claimed obama 's election as vindication for their own centre-left policies , but have also had an undertone of caution about afghanistan .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : obama is expected to ask for troops to help the us peter struck , who heads the spd parliamentary caucus and is a former german defense minister , told a sunday newspaper , bild am sonntag , he expected obama to seek more from nato and its european members .
but if obama requested german fighting troops in the south , " i would resist that most resolutely , " he said .
" there are limits . "
he said germany was already sending an extra 1,000 men to the north and offering advance-warning aircraft .
foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier , the social democrat who is to challenge merkel next year for the chancellorship , has already begun staking out that german position in diplomatic language .
he told a german newspaper , the hamburger abendblatt , on saturday that obama " highly appreciated " germany 's current contribution in afghanistan .
obama would not just seek more troops but also more reconstruction aid .
" we are very close to obama on this , " he said .
both merkel and steinmeier are driven on the troops issue by voter concerns about the afghan war .
german leaders wary as elections loom on horizon bildunterschrift : chancellor-candidate steinmeier is picking his words carefully on troop deployments with an election coming up in september , neither camp wants a surge in german casualties , including those from suicide attackers , to trigger a new round of anguish over the deployment .
surveys show most germans think the country is doing enough in afghanistan .
a forsa poll found 80 percent agree a us request for more troops should be refused and only 15 percent disagree .
however neither main party wants to upset obama at this stage by criticizing him .
the germans are eager to move forward with washington on many issues " in a spirit of togetherness , " merkel said .
she told the bild am sonntag on sunday those issues included " stabilizing afghanistan , " fixing the global financial crisis , fighting global warming and improving human rights .
steinmeier has already begun plans to demonstrate goodwill on another front , setting up plans to pay a call on the us-backed government in iraq next year and asking aides to draw up substantive aid plans for iraq .

" germany must , should and will take on responsibility , " she said .
but in remarks to supporters a day later , the limits to german willingness were clear .
germany has not forgotten an obama speech in berlin in june during which he called on the germans to take on more of the fighting burden in afghanistan , where german soldiers have rarely fought the taliban .
merkel told the youth section of her christian democratic union -lrb- cdu -rrb- that berlin would not accede to any request from the next us administration to send troops to southern afghanistan , the scene of most fighting .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel will give obama the same message as she gave bush " wherever germany commits itself , a wholeness of military and civilian assistance should be visible , " she said .
she would be able to tell obama that " just as well " as she had said it to president george w. bush .
german forces , the third-biggest component in the international security assistance force -lrb- isaf -rrb- , are based in safer northern afghanistan .
other armies have borne the brunt of the fighting in the south .
merkel may gain her chance to tell obama fairly soon when she attends a g20 summit in washington at the end of this week .
world leaders hope to see obama during their stay .
enthusiasm for obama has been huge in berlin most of this year : that helped ensure a crowd of 200,000 heard his speech in a city park on july 24 .
former defense minister expects pressure from obama the social democrats -lrb- spd -rrb- , the other main party in the merkel federal coalition , have claimed obama 's election as vindication for their own centre-left policies , but have also had an undertone of caution about afghanistan .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : obama is expected to ask for troops to help the us peter struck , who heads the spd parliamentary caucus and is a former german defense minister , told a sunday newspaper , bild am sonntag , he expected obama to seek more from nato and its european members .
but if obama requested german fighting troops in the south , " i would resist that most resolutely , " he said .
" there are limits . "
he said germany was already sending an extra 1,000 men to the north and offering advance-warning aircraft .
foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier , the social democrat who is to challenge merkel next year for the chancellorship , has already begun staking out that german position in diplomatic language .
he told a german newspaper , the hamburger abendblatt , on saturday that obama " highly appreciated " germany 's current contribution in afghanistan .
obama would not just seek more troops but also more reconstruction aid .
" we are very close to obama on this , " he said .
both merkel and steinmeier are driven on the troops issue by voter concerns about the afghan war .
german leaders wary as elections loom on horizon bildunterschrift : chancellor-candidate steinmeier is picking his words carefully on troop deployments with an election coming up in september , neither camp wants a surge in german casualties , including those from suicide attackers , to trigger a new round of anguish over the deployment .
surveys show most germans think the country is doing enough in afghanistan .
a forsa poll found 80 percent agree a us request for more troops should be refused and only 15 percent disagree .
however neither main party wants to upset obama at this stage by criticizing him .
the germans are eager to move forward with washington on many issues " in a spirit of togetherness , " merkel said .
she told the bild am sonntag on sunday those issues included " stabilizing afghanistan , " fixing the global financial crisis , fighting global warming and improving human rights .
steinmeier has already begun plans to demonstrate goodwill on another front , setting up plans to pay a call on the us-backed government in iraq next year and asking aides to draw up substantive aid plans for iraq .
that in itself is remarkable , since steinmeier , as chief of staff to former german chancellor gerhard schroeder , was a leading figure in germany 's refusal to assist the united states in the 2003 gulf war . dpa news agency -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" he is a very modern and innovative coach , and we are convinced of the fact that we will celebrate plenty of successes with him . "
although bayern were fourth before sunday 's game , some bayern fans remain unconvinced klinsmann is the right man after munich 's poor start to the league which saw them 11th last month after defeat 's to werder bremen and hanover .
" we are already seeing improvement and his philosophy works , " insisted rummenigge .
" we can be confident of the future . "

meanwhile , bayern will be without injured pair bastian schweinsteiger and lukas podolski against schalke as both are struggling with knocks received in last wednesday 's champions league 1-1 draw at fiorentina .
" lukas has back problems which makes his involvement not possible and bastian continues to suffer from the bruised leg he picked up against fiorentina , " said klinsmann on the bayern website .

both players have both been called up for maradona 's first match in charge , the meeting with scotland on november 19 at hampden park , glasgow .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : new argentina coach maradona is on a world tour " he wanted to establish a personal relationship with us and outline his plans , " said said demichelis , who admitted maradona was a child-hood hero .
" i 've previously met maradona , but that 's the first time i 've spoken to him for any length of time .

we could put out three or four strong teams .

7 , club chairman karl-heinz rummenigge has leapt to his defense . " we are convinced jurgen is the right coach for bayern , " rummenigge told the club 's agm in munich on friday night after klinsmann received whistles before sunday 's bundesliga clash with schalke 04 in gelsenkirchen .
" he is a very modern and innovative coach , and we are convinced of the fact that we will celebrate plenty of successes with him . "
although bayern were fourth before sunday 's game , some bayern fans remain unconvinced klinsmann is the right man after munich 's poor start to the league which saw them 11th last month after defeat 's to werder bremen and hanover .
" we are already seeing improvement and his philosophy works , " insisted rummenigge .
" we can be confident of the future . "
bayern captain mark van bommel said the german giants feel the pressure at the munich club where failure is not an option .
" it is a requirement at bayern that we win titles , third place is not the goal , " said the dutch hard-man .
munich faces schalke without injured stars bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : podolski is nursing a back injury - from sitting too long ?
meanwhile , bayern will be without injured pair bastian schweinsteiger and lukas podolski against schalke as both are struggling with knocks received in last wednesday 's champions league 1-1 draw at fiorentina .
" lukas has back problems which makes his involvement not possible and bastian continues to suffer from the bruised leg he picked up against fiorentina , " said klinsmann on the bayern website .
but italian world cup winner luca toni is back in the team and the striker will play from the start .
klinsmann said germany defender philipp lahm is back in training after picking up an ankle injury a fortnight ago , but will not feature against schalke .
bayern 's argentina internationals meet maradona meanwhile , bayern 's argentine internationals martin demichelis and jose ernesto sosa admit they were impressed new national coach diego maradona flew to see them .
the pair met maradona in a munich hotel for nearly an hour on thursday as part of his tour of european-based players to discuss tactics in the run up to the 2010 world cup .
both players have both been called up for maradona 's first match in charge , the meeting with scotland on november 19 at hampden park , glasgow .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : new argentina coach maradona is on a world tour " he wanted to establish a personal relationship with us and outline his plans , " said said demichelis , who admitted maradona was a child-hood hero .
" i 've previously met maradona , but that 's the first time i 've spoken to him for any length of time .
that was a gift from football , and a moment i 'll never forget .
" his presence is enough to motivate you to new heights .
you ca n't ask for more than having the greatest idol and the last world cup winning coach come to munich just to see jose and me .
" around 80 argentine players are performing at the highest level with european clubs .
we could put out three or four strong teams .
making it into the national side is incredibly difficult . "
the fact that maradona came to munich solely to see demichelis and sosa was a sign of the duo 's importance , according to klinsmann .
" he 's doing what i did four years ago , " said ex-germany boss klinsmann , who also sought early contact with his best players after taking the national hot seat in 2004 . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" we , both of us , affirmed that we will continue in these negotiations and that we will not stop even as israel prepares to go for elections , " abbas told a joint news conference with livni .
" our meetings will continue as usual , " he added .
for her part , livni said that the continued talks , aimed at forging an israeli-palestinian peace resulting in a palestinian state , would continue the framework agreed on at last year 's annapolis peace summit , when the sides agreed to rekindle the negotiations after a seven-year hiatus .
" the annapolis process serves the interest of both parties , the israeli and palestinian , " she said .

"
renewed officially at the turn of the year , the negotiations , headed by livni for the israelis and former-premier ahmed quriea for the palestinians , have been conducted amid a virtual media blackout , with concomitant conflicting reports of the progress being made .

both israelis and palestinians say they need more time to agree .
east jerusalem is proving to be an especially tough issue to settle , and an israeli trial balloon , to conclude a partial agreement without it , was quickly shot down by the palestinians .
in sharm el-sheikh on sunday , neither livni nor abbas expressed any indication of how much longer the two sides would need to conclude an agreement according to the annapolis framework , but both agreed and said that nothing is done until it is actually done .
abbas and livni did not take any questions from the press .
however , speaking privately their aides said that each side was more or less satisfied with the outcome of the sharm el-sheikh meeting .
the israelis said that they were pleased with the consensus they have with the palestinians and the international community as represented in the quartet to " stick to the annapolis process " .
" it is important that we do n't keep seeing new initiatives being offered every day .
this will complicate matters , " said one israeli source who spoke on condition of anonymity to the dpa news agency .
livni had called on the international community not to intervene in the talks by submitting " bridging proposals and initiatives which do not suit reality . "
the palestinians said they were also pleased with the understanding the quartet demonstrated for their determination to secure a comprehensive settlement .
" we can not go back to our people with bits and pieces .
the palestinians have suffered for a long time and now they want to see the final peace deal and their state , " said a palestinian source , who asked not to be named .

7 , club chairman karl-heinz rummenigge has leapt to his defense . " we are convinced jurgen is the right coach for bayern , " rummenigge told the club 's agm in munich on friday night after klinsmann received whistles before sunday 's bundesliga clash with schalke 04 in gelsenkirchen .
" he is a very modern and innovative coach , and we are convinced of the fact that we will celebrate plenty of successes with him . "
although bayern were fourth before sunday 's game , some bayern fans remain unconvinced klinsmann is the right man after munich 's poor start to the league which saw them 11th last month after defeat 's to werder bremen and hanover .
" we are already seeing improvement and his philosophy works , " insisted rummenigge .
" we can be confident of the future . "
bayern captain mark van bommel said the german giants feel the pressure at the munich club where failure is not an option .
" it is a requirement at bayern that we win titles , third place is not the goal , " said the dutch hard-man .
munich faces schalke without injured stars bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : podolski is nursing a back injury - from sitting too long ?
meanwhile , bayern will be without injured pair bastian schweinsteiger and lukas podolski against schalke as both are struggling with knocks received in last wednesday 's champions league 1-1 draw at fiorentina .
" lukas has back problems which makes his involvement not possible and bastian continues to suffer from the bruised leg he picked up against fiorentina , " said klinsmann on the bayern website .
but italian world cup winner luca toni is back in the team and the striker will play from the start .
klinsmann said germany defender philipp lahm is back in training after picking up an ankle injury a fortnight ago , but will not feature against schalke .
bayern 's argentina internationals meet maradona meanwhile , bayern 's argentine internationals martin demichelis and jose ernesto sosa admit they were impressed new national coach diego maradona flew to see them .
the pair met maradona in a munich hotel for nearly an hour on thursday as part of his tour of european-based players to discuss tactics in the run up to the 2010 world cup .
both players have both been called up for maradona 's first match in charge , the meeting with scotland on november 19 at hampden park , glasgow .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : new argentina coach maradona is on a world tour " he wanted to establish a personal relationship with us and outline his plans , " said said demichelis , who admitted maradona was a child-hood hero .
" i 've previously met maradona , but that 's the first time i 've spoken to him for any length of time .
that was a gift from football , and a moment i 'll never forget .
" his presence is enough to motivate you to new heights .
you ca n't ask for more than having the greatest idol and the last world cup winning coach come to munich just to see jose and me .
" around 80 argentine players are performing at the highest level with european clubs .
we could put out three or four strong teams .
making it into the national side is incredibly difficult . "
the fact that maradona came to munich solely to see demichelis and sosa was a sign of the duo 's importance , according to klinsmann .
" he 's doing what i did four years ago , " said ex-germany boss klinsmann , who also sought early contact with his best players after taking the national hot seat in 2004 . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" germany must , should and will take on responsibility , " she said .
but in remarks to supporters a day later , the limits to german willingness were clear .
germany has not forgotten an obama speech in berlin in june during which he called on the germans to take on more of the fighting burden in afghanistan , where german soldiers have rarely fought the taliban .
merkel told the youth section of her christian democratic union -lrb- cdu -rrb- that berlin would not accede to any request from the next us administration to send troops to southern afghanistan , the scene of most fighting .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel will give obama the same message as she gave bush " wherever germany commits itself , a wholeness of military and civilian assistance should be visible , " she said .
she would be able to tell obama that " just as well " as she had said it to president george w. bush .
german forces , the third-biggest component in the international security assistance force -lrb- isaf -rrb- , are based in safer northern afghanistan .
other armies have borne the brunt of the fighting in the south .
merkel may gain her chance to tell obama fairly soon when she attends a g20 summit in washington at the end of this week .
world leaders hope to see obama during their stay .
enthusiasm for obama has been huge in berlin most of this year : that helped ensure a crowd of 200,000 heard his speech in a city park on july 24 .
former defense minister expects pressure from obama the social democrats -lrb- spd -rrb- , the other main party in the merkel federal coalition , have claimed obama 's election as vindication for their own centre-left policies , but have also had an undertone of caution about afghanistan .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : obama is expected to ask for troops to help the us peter struck , who heads the spd parliamentary caucus and is a former german defense minister , told a sunday newspaper , bild am sonntag , he expected obama to seek more from nato and its european members .
but if obama requested german fighting troops in the south , " i would resist that most resolutely , " he said .
" there are limits . "
he said germany was already sending an extra 1,000 men to the north and offering advance-warning aircraft .
foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier , the social democrat who is to challenge merkel next year for the chancellorship , has already begun staking out that german position in diplomatic language .
he told a german newspaper , the hamburger abendblatt , on saturday that obama " highly appreciated " germany 's current contribution in afghanistan .
obama would not just seek more troops but also more reconstruction aid .
" we are very close to obama on this , " he said .
both merkel and steinmeier are driven on the troops issue by voter concerns about the afghan war .
german leaders wary as elections loom on horizon bildunterschrift : chancellor-candidate steinmeier is picking his words carefully on troop deployments with an election coming up in september , neither camp wants a surge in german casualties , including those from suicide attackers , to trigger a new round of anguish over the deployment .

" germany must , should and will take on responsibility , " she said .
but in remarks to supporters a day later , the limits to german willingness were clear .
germany has not forgotten an obama speech in berlin in june during which he called on the germans to take on more of the fighting burden in afghanistan , where german soldiers have rarely fought the taliban .
merkel told the youth section of her christian democratic union -lrb- cdu -rrb- that berlin would not accede to any request from the next us administration to send troops to southern afghanistan , the scene of most fighting .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel will give obama the same message as she gave bush " wherever germany commits itself , a wholeness of military and civilian assistance should be visible , " she said .
she would be able to tell obama that " just as well " as she had said it to president george w. bush .
german forces , the third-biggest component in the international security assistance force -lrb- isaf -rrb- , are based in safer northern afghanistan .
other armies have borne the brunt of the fighting in the south .
merkel may gain her chance to tell obama fairly soon when she attends a g20 summit in washington at the end of this week .
world leaders hope to see obama during their stay .
enthusiasm for obama has been huge in berlin most of this year : that helped ensure a crowd of 200,000 heard his speech in a city park on july 24 .
former defense minister expects pressure from obama the social democrats -lrb- spd -rrb- , the other main party in the merkel federal coalition , have claimed obama 's election as vindication for their own centre-left policies , but have also had an undertone of caution about afghanistan .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : obama is expected to ask for troops to help the us peter struck , who heads the spd parliamentary caucus and is a former german defense minister , told a sunday newspaper , bild am sonntag , he expected obama to seek more from nato and its european members .
but if obama requested german fighting troops in the south , " i would resist that most resolutely , " he said .
" there are limits . "
he said germany was already sending an extra 1,000 men to the north and offering advance-warning aircraft .
foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier , the social democrat who is to challenge merkel next year for the chancellorship , has already begun staking out that german position in diplomatic language .
he told a german newspaper , the hamburger abendblatt , on saturday that obama " highly appreciated " germany 's current contribution in afghanistan .
obama would not just seek more troops but also more reconstruction aid .
" we are very close to obama on this , " he said .
both merkel and steinmeier are driven on the troops issue by voter concerns about the afghan war .
german leaders wary as elections loom on horizon bildunterschrift : chancellor-candidate steinmeier is picking his words carefully on troop deployments with an election coming up in september , neither camp wants a surge in german casualties , including those from suicide attackers , to trigger a new round of anguish over the deployment .
surveys show most germans think the country is doing enough in afghanistan .
a forsa poll found 80 percent agree a us request for more troops should be refused and only 15 percent disagree .
however neither main party wants to upset obama at this stage by criticizing him .

9 , the horrific violence unleashed 70 years ago against jews in germany on the night of broken glass , and from rome , pope benedict xvi , appealed for vigilance against anti-semitism . germans can not be indifferent to anti-semitism , chancellor angela merkel said sunday , nov .
9 , at a berlin ceremony to recall a 1938 pogrom against jewish residents of germany . " indifference is the first step towards endangering essential values , " merkel said during germany 's national memorial ceremony at the old synagogue in berlin 's rykestrasse .
" xenophobia , racism and anti-semitism must never be given an opportunity in europe again . " she added that germany needs to encourage moral courage in the face of racism and anti-semitism . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel said germans must not be indifferent to xenophobia , racism or anti-semitism " there was no storm of protest against the nazi , but silence , shrugged shoulders and people looking away - from individual citizens to large parts of the church , " she said .
" we can not be silent , we can not be indifferent when jewish cemeteries are desecrated and rabbis are insulted on the street . " it is a mistake to think it does n't affect you when your neighbors are affected , " merkel added .
" this mistake just leads us further and further into evil . " in an annual symbol of how jewish life is flowering again in germany , yet another community opened a synagogue on sunday . the building is a half-timbered village synagogue that was in use from 1825 to 1937 and was carefully moved to its new site in the central city of goettingen and renovated . in another city , speyer , the jewish community was laying the foundation stone for a new synagogue . pope recalls horror of kristallnacht bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : pope benedict spoke of a deep solidarity with the jews pope benedict , who is german , spoke out after public prayers sunday in rome on the horrific legacy of the 1938 violence . he said vigilance was needed against anti-semitism and every form of discrimination .
he said he spoke " in deep solidarity with the jewish world . " at the national ceremony , in the synagogue first opened in 1904 in berlin 's rykestrasse and re-inaugurated two years ago , emotion overwhelmed charlotte knobloch , 76 , president of germany 's central council of jews . she recalled being led through munich as a child by her father and seeing the destruction and indifferent lookers-on in 1938 . at the end of her speech , she sobbed for a moment before she could read her closing line , based on a remark by henrik mandelbaum , who survived the nazis ' auschwitz death camp . " i beg you not to ever let anyone talk you into whom you have to love and whom you have to hate , " she said . the late november 9 , 1938 pogrom , a precursor to the holocaust , ultimately led to more than 1,300 deaths from injuries , by suicide or in concentration camps , official historians have said . vicious pogrom a precursor for holocaust flames leapt into the sky across germany when the nazis gave a foretaste of the holocaust in the vicious pogrom against the jewish community .
by the time the rampage had ended , thousands of jewish homes , businesses and synagogues had been burned down or looted by thugs as police and fire brigades looked on . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the day after the night of broken glass " everything said about it is harmless compared to the reality of what actually happened , " said one berlin woman whose recollections are documented at the central jewish information office . another witness from dusseldorf described how jews , " dragged from their beds in pajamas and nightgowns , " were forced " to walk through the broken glass without any footwear . " more than 400 people were beaten to death , shot or driven to suicide , records show .
more than 30,000 were rounded up and packed off to concentration camps . the tyranny marked a turning point in the anti-semitic policies pursued after hitler took power in 1933 and which eventually led to the holocaust , the systematic state-sponsored killing of jews . new anti-semitism resolution adopted bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkl 's government agreed a new resolution against anti-semitism germany 's parliament adopted a resolution against anti-semitism to mark sunday 's 70th anniversary of the pogrom after a dispute over whether a far-left party should be included . chancellor angela merkel 's christian democrats lobbied to have the left excluded because of its cooperation with " extremists hostile to jews " - a reference to the palestinian movement hamas . merkel herself will represent the government at a remembrance ceremony held together with the central council of jews in germany at the country 's largest synagogue , located in berlin . built in 1904 , the ryke street synagogue was badly damaged in the 1938 pogrom , but was not burned down , apparently because the nazis feared damage would be caused to adjacent buildings . it was reopened in august 2007 after being restored to its original glory at a cost of $ 7 million . some 600,000 jews lived in germany before the war , but the figure declined to around 12,000 after 1945 .
today , there are more than 110,000 jews or people of jewish origin , giving germany one of the largest jewish populations of any country in europe . a growing mood of anti-semitism in germany despite a revival of jewish culture , there is a growing mood of anti-semitism in germany , according to the german-israeli society , which held its annual meeting over the weekend . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the national democratic party -lrb- npd -rrb- is accused of being anti-semitic and xenophobic figures disclosed by the government on tuesday showed there were nearly 800 anti-semitic crimes committed during the first nine months of this year , resulting in injuries to 27 people . among the events is being held in berlin and other cities to mark the anniversary of the pogrom is an exhibition called " it 's burning - anti-jewish terror in 1938 . " the display at the capital 's neue synagogue contains little known photographs that underscore the extent of the violence and the public humiliation of jews during the third reich . at the same time , the first museum to honor germans who helped jews survive nazi persecution during the holocaust has just opened in central berlin . on show are photographs , letters and other documents from more than 250 " silent heroes " who risked their lives by providing food , shelter and other assistance to jews from 1938-45 . seven decades on , an israeli journalist has been sifting for remnants of the night of broken glass in a rubbish dump an hour 's drive northeast of berlin in the german state of brandenburg . following a tip from locals , yaron svoray , 54 , discovered a bottle imprinted with a star of david and part of a backrest that might have been used in synagogues around that time . experts are expected to be called in to investigate the site in schorfheide , where hitler 's designated successor , hermann goering , maintained his country residence . dw staff -lrb- nda / sms -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

yet more women are urgently needed in the mosques for counseling and integration aid . they lead prayers , give koran lessons and offer counseling .
whether it 's new york , berlin , cairo or istanbul : female imams are currently high in demand . zeynep cesen is one of the very few female imams who came to germany from turkey to specifically help women in muslim communities .
even when friday prayers continue to be the domain of her male counterparts , cesen 's range of responsibilities is very diverse , but she mainly helps women with their problems . " it 's generally young women who came here from turkey , " cesen said .
" we listen to their problems and try to find solutions . " due to her close contact to women of all ages , cesen reaches circles which a male imam in germany never could .
this is one of the reasons why the turkish-islamic union ditib employs female imams , said speaker ayse aydin . " religious services and human needs ca n't always be separated , " aydin said .
ditib 's goal is serving the needs of the community .
this included consciously addressing women , answering their questions and giving them the possibility to feel secure in the community , she said . supporting integration efforts when cesen came to germany at the beginning of the 1990s , her position was initially limited to six years .
today , she counsels up to 100 women per day . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : women and girls of all ages seek cesen 's advice in addition to her counseling tasks , she has developed her own form of preaching .
she said she answers religious questions " not down from the pulpit " but rather in discussion rounds with different women 's groups .
and daily problems are not excluded . women of all ages and with various social and personal problems turn to her .
many women would not open up to a male imam . " there are many things that women only want to share with women , " cesen said , adding that a warm and friendly atmosphere was necessary in order to share certain problems and issues . cesen said she reaches many turkish families through her intensive counseling work with women .
she said she wants to show them possibilities to access german society .
she said integration problems of mainly young turks in schools and training facilities require urgent action , cesen said . cesen said she urged both turkish businesses as well as german companies to create more training opportunities for young people .
in addition , much more needed to be done for women of turkish descent in order for their integration to succeed . dialog with christians when cesen speaks , many people in her community are all ears - even non-muslims . " she is often consulted from outside , too , " said ditib speaker aydin .
" we are proud of the work which our imam does here . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : integrating turks into german society still faces many problems cesen said she sees her contribution in an interchange with the neighborhood . " we need one another in good times as well as in bad times , " she said .
" so we need a good dialog with our german friends . " cesen said she therefore needed to be a good role model and encourage her community to do the same .
this included , for example , that muslims and christians wish each other happy holidays , no matter if it 's christmas or ramadan .
or that you go visit neighbors who are ill . the 50-year-old cesen is one of only 13 female imams currently working in turkish mosques in germany .
this is in part due to the lack of theological training for imams in germany .
the turkish-islamic union would like to have theologians trained in germany and foremost , ones who speak german well . cesen studied at the faculty for islamic theology in izmir and worked as an imam in turkey for 18 years before coming to germany in 1994 .
here , she initially served 51 mosque communities in cologne and the surrounding areas .
today , she works solely for ditib . diyanet , the state authority for religious affairs in turkey , helps select female theologians for the ditib communities .
since 2002 , there has been a more intensive preparation for female and male imams who are to be employed in germany .
they are prepared for their new tasks with german courses and cultural studies at the goethe institute in ankara .
after all , they are supposed to help their fellow countrymen and women to better integrate themselves in germany . whether the union can raise the current number of female imams for germany is unclear .
many turkish mosques in germany would like to have a woman in their ranks .
it would be a measure which would unburden cesen and her female colleagues . ulrike hummel -lrb- sac -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

this included consciously addressing women , answering their questions and giving them the possibility to feel secure in the community , she said . supporting integration efforts when cesen came to germany at the beginning of the 1990s , her position was initially limited to six years .
today , she counsels up to 100 women per day . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : women and girls of all ages seek cesen 's advice in addition to her counseling tasks , she has developed her own form of preaching .
she said she answers religious questions " not down from the pulpit " but rather in discussion rounds with different women 's groups .
and daily problems are not excluded . women of all ages and with various social and personal problems turn to her .
many women would not open up to a male imam . " there are many things that women only want to share with women , " cesen said , adding that a warm and friendly atmosphere was necessary in order to share certain problems and issues . cesen said she reaches many turkish families through her intensive counseling work with women .
she said she wants to show them possibilities to access german society .
she said integration problems of mainly young turks in schools and training facilities require urgent action , cesen said . cesen said she urged both turkish businesses as well as german companies to create more training opportunities for young people .
in addition , much more needed to be done for women of turkish descent in order for their integration to succeed . dialog with christians when cesen speaks , many people in her community are all ears - even non-muslims . " she is often consulted from outside , too , " said ditib speaker aydin .
" we are proud of the work which our imam does here . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : integrating turks into german society still faces many problems cesen said she sees her contribution in an interchange with the neighborhood . " we need one another in good times as well as in bad times , " she said .
" so we need a good dialog with our german friends . " cesen said she therefore needed to be a good role model and encourage her community to do the same .
this included , for example , that muslims and christians wish each other happy holidays , no matter if it 's christmas or ramadan .
or that you go visit neighbors who are ill . the 50-year-old cesen is one of only 13 female imams currently working in turkish mosques in germany .
this is in part due to the lack of theological training for imams in germany .
the turkish-islamic union would like to have theologians trained in germany and foremost , ones who speak german well . cesen studied at the faculty for islamic theology in izmir and worked as an imam in turkey for 18 years before coming to germany in 1994 .
here , she initially served 51 mosque communities in cologne and the surrounding areas .
today , she works solely for ditib . diyanet , the state authority for religious affairs in turkey , helps select female theologians for the ditib communities .
since 2002 , there has been a more intensive preparation for female and male imams who are to be employed in germany .
they are prepared for their new tasks with german courses and cultural studies at the goethe institute in ankara .
after all , they are supposed to help their fellow countrymen and women to better integrate themselves in germany . whether the union can raise the current number of female imams for germany is unclear .
many turkish mosques in germany would like to have a woman in their ranks .
it would be a measure which would unburden cesen and her female colleagues . ulrike hummel -lrb- sac -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

he said the news from dr congo was " particularly disappointing . " as the forum met , the leaders of dr congo and rwanda were at a meeting in kenya to try to negotiate an end to the fighting in eastern dr congo . koehler noted that civilians bore the brunt of the impact of africa 's battles .
speaking from prepared comments , he said a self- aware africa with equal rights for all must live up to its responsibility to guarantee " security and peace on its own continent . "
he called on african leaders to pursue more transparent politics and to ensure that the profits from raw material mining benefited the entire population .
at the same time , he urged european leaders to seek international trade mechanisms that factor in the needs of africa . that would include an " international raw materials strategy , that gives all exporters of raw materials a fair chance to participate in the market , " the former imf head said . violence in congo bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : civilians are hardest hit by violence , koehler said koehler 's appeals for peace come as fighting broke out among rebels and pro-government militia in congo on sunday , un sources said .

" she added that germany needs to encourage moral courage in the face of racism and anti-semitism . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel said germans must not be indifferent to xenophobia , racism or anti-semitism " there was no storm of protest against the nazi , but silence , shrugged shoulders and people looking away - from individual citizens to large parts of the church , " she said .
" we can not be silent , we can not be indifferent when jewish cemeteries are desecrated and rabbis are insulted on the street . " it is a mistake to think it does n't affect you when your neighbors are affected , " merkel added .
" this mistake just leads us further and further into evil . " in an annual symbol of how jewish life is flowering again in germany , yet another community opened a synagogue on sunday . the building is a half-timbered village synagogue that was in use from 1825 to 1937 and was carefully moved to its new site in the central city of goettingen and renovated . in another city , speyer , the jewish community was laying the foundation stone for a new synagogue . pope recalls horror of kristallnacht bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : pope benedict spoke of a deep solidarity with the jews pope benedict , who is german , spoke out after public prayers sunday in rome on the horrific legacy of the 1938 violence . he said vigilance was needed against anti-semitism and every form of discrimination .

7 , club chairman karl-heinz rummenigge has leapt to his defense . " we are convinced jurgen is the right coach for bayern , " rummenigge told the club 's agm in munich on friday night after klinsmann received whistles before sunday 's bundesliga clash with schalke 04 in gelsenkirchen .
" he is a very modern and innovative coach , and we are convinced of the fact that we will celebrate plenty of successes with him . "
although bayern were fourth before sunday 's game , some bayern fans remain unconvinced klinsmann is the right man after munich 's poor start to the league which saw them 11th last month after defeat 's to werder bremen and hanover .
" we are already seeing improvement and his philosophy works , " insisted rummenigge .
" we can be confident of the future . "
bayern captain mark van bommel said the german giants feel the pressure at the munich club where failure is not an option .
" it is a requirement at bayern that we win titles , third place is not the goal , " said the dutch hard-man .
munich faces schalke without injured stars bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : podolski is nursing a back injury - from sitting too long ?
meanwhile , bayern will be without injured pair bastian schweinsteiger and lukas podolski against schalke as both are struggling with knocks received in last wednesday 's champions league 1-1 draw at fiorentina .
" lukas has back problems which makes his involvement not possible and bastian continues to suffer from the bruised leg he picked up against fiorentina , " said klinsmann on the bayern website .
but italian world cup winner luca toni is back in the team and the striker will play from the start .
klinsmann said germany defender philipp lahm is back in training after picking up an ankle injury a fortnight ago , but will not feature against schalke .
bayern 's argentina internationals meet maradona meanwhile , bayern 's argentine internationals martin demichelis and jose ernesto sosa admit they were impressed new national coach diego maradona flew to see them .
the pair met maradona in a munich hotel for nearly an hour on thursday as part of his tour of european-based players to discuss tactics in the run up to the 2010 world cup .
both players have both been called up for maradona 's first match in charge , the meeting with scotland on november 19 at hampden park , glasgow .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : new argentina coach maradona is on a world tour " he wanted to establish a personal relationship with us and outline his plans , " said said demichelis , who admitted maradona was a child-hood hero .
" i 've previously met maradona , but that 's the first time i 've spoken to him for any length of time .
that was a gift from football , and a moment i 'll never forget .
" his presence is enough to motivate you to new heights .
you ca n't ask for more than having the greatest idol and the last world cup winning coach come to munich just to see jose and me .
" around 80 argentine players are performing at the highest level with european clubs .
we could put out three or four strong teams .
making it into the national side is incredibly difficult . "
the fact that maradona came to munich solely to see demichelis and sosa was a sign of the duo 's importance , according to klinsmann .
" he 's doing what i did four years ago , " said ex-germany boss klinsmann , who also sought early contact with his best players after taking the national hot seat in 2004 . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" germany must , should and will take on responsibility , " she said .
but in remarks to supporters a day later , the limits to german willingness were clear .
germany has not forgotten an obama speech in berlin in june during which he called on the germans to take on more of the fighting burden in afghanistan , where german soldiers have rarely fought the taliban .
merkel told the youth section of her christian democratic union -lrb- cdu -rrb- that berlin would not accede to any request from the next us administration to send troops to southern afghanistan , the scene of most fighting .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel will give obama the same message as she gave bush " wherever germany commits itself , a wholeness of military and civilian assistance should be visible , " she said .
she would be able to tell obama that " just as well " as she had said it to president george w. bush .

merkel may gain her chance to tell obama fairly soon when she attends a g20 summit in washington at the end of this week .
world leaders hope to see obama during their stay .
enthusiasm for obama has been huge in berlin most of this year : that helped ensure a crowd of 200,000 heard his speech in a city park on july 24 .
former defense minister expects pressure from obama the social democrats -lrb- spd -rrb- , the other main party in the merkel federal coalition , have claimed obama 's election as vindication for their own centre-left policies , but have also had an undertone of caution about afghanistan .

but if obama requested german fighting troops in the south , " i would resist that most resolutely , " he said .
" there are limits . "
he said germany was already sending an extra 1,000 men to the north and offering advance-warning aircraft .
foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier , the social democrat who is to challenge merkel next year for the chancellorship , has already begun staking out that german position in diplomatic language .
he told a german newspaper , the hamburger abendblatt , on saturday that obama " highly appreciated " germany 's current contribution in afghanistan .
obama would not just seek more troops but also more reconstruction aid .
" we are very close to obama on this , " he said .
both merkel and steinmeier are driven on the troops issue by voter concerns about the afghan war .

in germany , just over a dozen female imams work in their communities .
yet more women are urgently needed in the mosques for counseling and integration aid . they lead prayers , give koran lessons and offer counseling .
whether it 's new york , berlin , cairo or istanbul : female imams are currently high in demand . zeynep cesen is one of the very few female imams who came to germany from turkey to specifically help women in muslim communities .
even when friday prayers continue to be the domain of her male counterparts , cesen 's range of responsibilities is very diverse , but she mainly helps women with their problems . " it 's generally young women who came here from turkey , " cesen said .
" we listen to their problems and try to find solutions . " due to her close contact to women of all ages , cesen reaches circles which a male imam in germany never could .
this is one of the reasons why the turkish-islamic union ditib employs female imams , said speaker ayse aydin . " religious services and human needs ca n't always be separated , " aydin said .
ditib 's goal is serving the needs of the community .
this included consciously addressing women , answering their questions and giving them the possibility to feel secure in the community , she said . supporting integration efforts when cesen came to germany at the beginning of the 1990s , her position was initially limited to six years .
today , she counsels up to 100 women per day . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : women and girls of all ages seek cesen 's advice in addition to her counseling tasks , she has developed her own form of preaching .
she said she answers religious questions " not down from the pulpit " but rather in discussion rounds with different women 's groups .
and daily problems are not excluded . women of all ages and with various social and personal problems turn to her .
many women would not open up to a male imam . " there are many things that women only want to share with women , " cesen said , adding that a warm and friendly atmosphere was necessary in order to share certain problems and issues . cesen said she reaches many turkish families through her intensive counseling work with women .
she said she wants to show them possibilities to access german society .
she said integration problems of mainly young turks in schools and training facilities require urgent action , cesen said . cesen said she urged both turkish businesses as well as german companies to create more training opportunities for young people .
in addition , much more needed to be done for women of turkish descent in order for their integration to succeed . dialog with christians when cesen speaks , many people in her community are all ears - even non-muslims . " she is often consulted from outside , too , " said ditib speaker aydin .
" we are proud of the work which our imam does here . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : integrating turks into german society still faces many problems cesen said she sees her contribution in an interchange with the neighborhood . " we need one another in good times as well as in bad times , " she said .
" so we need a good dialog with our german friends . " cesen said she therefore needed to be a good role model and encourage her community to do the same .
this included , for example , that muslims and christians wish each other happy holidays , no matter if it 's christmas or ramadan .
or that you go visit neighbors who are ill . the 50-year-old cesen is one of only 13 female imams currently working in turkish mosques in germany .
this is in part due to the lack of theological training for imams in germany .
the turkish-islamic union would like to have theologians trained in germany and foremost , ones who speak german well . cesen studied at the faculty for islamic theology in izmir and worked as an imam in turkey for 18 years before coming to germany in 1994 .
here , she initially served 51 mosque communities in cologne and the surrounding areas .
today , she works solely for ditib . diyanet , the state authority for religious affairs in turkey , helps select female theologians for the ditib communities .
since 2002 , there has been a more intensive preparation for female and male imams who are to be employed in germany .
they are prepared for their new tasks with german courses and cultural studies at the goethe institute in ankara .
after all , they are supposed to help their fellow countrymen and women to better integrate themselves in germany . whether the union can raise the current number of female imams for germany is unclear .
many turkish mosques in germany would like to have a woman in their ranks .
it would be a measure which would unburden cesen and her female colleagues . ulrike hummel -lrb- sac -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

in germany , just over a dozen female imams work in their communities .
yet more women are urgently needed in the mosques for counseling and integration aid . they lead prayers , give koran lessons and offer counseling .
whether it 's new york , berlin , cairo or istanbul : female imams are currently high in demand . zeynep cesen is one of the very few female imams who came to germany from turkey to specifically help women in muslim communities .
even when friday prayers continue to be the domain of her male counterparts , cesen 's range of responsibilities is very diverse , but she mainly helps women with their problems . " it 's generally young women who came here from turkey , " cesen said .
" we listen to their problems and try to find solutions . " due to her close contact to women of all ages , cesen reaches circles which a male imam in germany never could .
this is one of the reasons why the turkish-islamic union ditib employs female imams , said speaker ayse aydin . " religious services and human needs ca n't always be separated , " aydin said .
ditib 's goal is serving the needs of the community .
this included consciously addressing women , answering their questions and giving them the possibility to feel secure in the community , she said . supporting integration efforts when cesen came to germany at the beginning of the 1990s , her position was initially limited to six years .
today , she counsels up to 100 women per day . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : women and girls of all ages seek cesen 's advice in addition to her counseling tasks , she has developed her own form of preaching .
she said she answers religious questions " not down from the pulpit " but rather in discussion rounds with different women 's groups .
and daily problems are not excluded . women of all ages and with various social and personal problems turn to her .
many women would not open up to a male imam . " there are many things that women only want to share with women , " cesen said , adding that a warm and friendly atmosphere was necessary in order to share certain problems and issues . cesen said she reaches many turkish families through her intensive counseling work with women .
she said she wants to show them possibilities to access german society .
she said integration problems of mainly young turks in schools and training facilities require urgent action , cesen said . cesen said she urged both turkish businesses as well as german companies to create more training opportunities for young people .
in addition , much more needed to be done for women of turkish descent in order for their integration to succeed . dialog with christians when cesen speaks , many people in her community are all ears - even non-muslims . " she is often consulted from outside , too , " said ditib speaker aydin .
" we are proud of the work which our imam does here . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : integrating turks into german society still faces many problems cesen said she sees her contribution in an interchange with the neighborhood . " we need one another in good times as well as in bad times , " she said .
" so we need a good dialog with our german friends . " cesen said she therefore needed to be a good role model and encourage her community to do the same .
this included , for example , that muslims and christians wish each other happy holidays , no matter if it 's christmas or ramadan .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de integration -pipe- 09.11.2008 female imams reach out into german communities großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : leading friday prayers continues to be the domain of men religious leaders in mosques are for the large part men .
in germany , just over a dozen female imams work in their communities .
yet more women are urgently needed in the mosques for counseling and integration aid . they lead prayers , give koran lessons and offer counseling .
whether it 's new york , berlin , cairo or istanbul : female imams are currently high in demand . zeynep cesen is one of the very few female imams who came to germany from turkey to specifically help women in muslim communities .
even when friday prayers continue to be the domain of her male counterparts , cesen 's range of responsibilities is very diverse , but she mainly helps women with their problems . " it 's generally young women who came here from turkey , " cesen said .
" we listen to their problems and try to find solutions . " due to her close contact to women of all ages , cesen reaches circles which a male imam in germany never could .
this is one of the reasons why the turkish-islamic union ditib employs female imams , said speaker ayse aydin . " religious services and human needs ca n't always be separated , " aydin said .
ditib 's goal is serving the needs of the community .
this included consciously addressing women , answering their questions and giving them the possibility to feel secure in the community , she said . supporting integration efforts when cesen came to germany at the beginning of the 1990s , her position was initially limited to six years .
today , she counsels up to 100 women per day . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : women and girls of all ages seek cesen 's advice in addition to her counseling tasks , she has developed her own form of preaching .
she said she answers religious questions " not down from the pulpit " but rather in discussion rounds with different women 's groups .
and daily problems are not excluded . women of all ages and with various social and personal problems turn to her .
many women would not open up to a male imam . " there are many things that women only want to share with women , " cesen said , adding that a warm and friendly atmosphere was necessary in order to share certain problems and issues . cesen said she reaches many turkish families through her intensive counseling work with women .
she said she wants to show them possibilities to access german society .
she said integration problems of mainly young turks in schools and training facilities require urgent action , cesen said . cesen said she urged both turkish businesses as well as german companies to create more training opportunities for young people .
in addition , much more needed to be done for women of turkish descent in order for their integration to succeed . dialog with christians when cesen speaks , many people in her community are all ears - even non-muslims . " she is often consulted from outside , too , " said ditib speaker aydin .
" we are proud of the work which our imam does here . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : integrating turks into german society still faces many problems cesen said she sees her contribution in an interchange with the neighborhood . " we need one another in good times as well as in bad times , " she said .
" so we need a good dialog with our german friends . " cesen said she therefore needed to be a good role model and encourage her community to do the same .
this included , for example , that muslims and christians wish each other happy holidays , no matter if it 's christmas or ramadan .
or that you go visit neighbors who are ill . the 50-year-old cesen is one of only 13 female imams currently working in turkish mosques in germany .
this is in part due to the lack of theological training for imams in germany .
the turkish-islamic union would like to have theologians trained in germany and foremost , ones who speak german well . cesen studied at the faculty for islamic theology in izmir and worked as an imam in turkey for 18 years before coming to germany in 1994 .
here , she initially served 51 mosque communities in cologne and the surrounding areas .
today , she works solely for ditib . diyanet , the state authority for religious affairs in turkey , helps select female theologians for the ditib communities .
since 2002 , there has been a more intensive preparation for female and male imams who are to be employed in germany .
they are prepared for their new tasks with german courses and cultural studies at the goethe institute in ankara .
after all , they are supposed to help their fellow countrymen and women to better integrate themselves in germany . whether the union can raise the current number of female imams for germany is unclear .
many turkish mosques in germany would like to have a woman in their ranks .
it would be a measure which would unburden cesen and her female colleagues . ulrike hummel -lrb- sac -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" germany must , should and will take on responsibility , " she said .
but in remarks to supporters a day later , the limits to german willingness were clear .
germany has not forgotten an obama speech in berlin in june during which he called on the germans to take on more of the fighting burden in afghanistan , where german soldiers have rarely fought the taliban .
merkel told the youth section of her christian democratic union -lrb- cdu -rrb- that berlin would not accede to any request from the next us administration to send troops to southern afghanistan , the scene of most fighting .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel will give obama the same message as she gave bush " wherever germany commits itself , a wholeness of military and civilian assistance should be visible , " she said .
she would be able to tell obama that " just as well " as she had said it to president george w. bush .
german forces , the third-biggest component in the international security assistance force -lrb- isaf -rrb- , are based in safer northern afghanistan .
other armies have borne the brunt of the fighting in the south .
merkel may gain her chance to tell obama fairly soon when she attends a g20 summit in washington at the end of this week .
world leaders hope to see obama during their stay .
enthusiasm for obama has been huge in berlin most of this year : that helped ensure a crowd of 200,000 heard his speech in a city park on july 24 .
former defense minister expects pressure from obama the social democrats -lrb- spd -rrb- , the other main party in the merkel federal coalition , have claimed obama 's election as vindication for their own centre-left policies , but have also had an undertone of caution about afghanistan .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : obama is expected to ask for troops to help the us peter struck , who heads the spd parliamentary caucus and is a former german defense minister , told a sunday newspaper , bild am sonntag , he expected obama to seek more from nato and its european members .
but if obama requested german fighting troops in the south , " i would resist that most resolutely , " he said .
" there are limits . "
he said germany was already sending an extra 1,000 men to the north and offering advance-warning aircraft .
foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier , the social democrat who is to challenge merkel next year for the chancellorship , has already begun staking out that german position in diplomatic language .
he told a german newspaper , the hamburger abendblatt , on saturday that obama " highly appreciated " germany 's current contribution in afghanistan .
obama would not just seek more troops but also more reconstruction aid .
" we are very close to obama on this , " he said .
both merkel and steinmeier are driven on the troops issue by voter concerns about the afghan war .
german leaders wary as elections loom on horizon bildunterschrift : chancellor-candidate steinmeier is picking his words carefully on troop deployments with an election coming up in september , neither camp wants a surge in german casualties , including those from suicide attackers , to trigger a new round of anguish over the deployment .
surveys show most germans think the country is doing enough in afghanistan .
a forsa poll found 80 percent agree a us request for more troops should be refused and only 15 percent disagree .
however neither main party wants to upset obama at this stage by criticizing him .
the germans are eager to move forward with washington on many issues " in a spirit of togetherness , " merkel said .
she told the bild am sonntag on sunday those issues included " stabilizing afghanistan , " fixing the global financial crisis , fighting global warming and improving human rights .
steinmeier has already begun plans to demonstrate goodwill on another front , setting up plans to pay a call on the us-backed government in iraq next year and asking aides to draw up substantive aid plans for iraq .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de trans-atlantic relations -pipe- 09.11.2008 germany to obama : we will resist calls for more troops großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : obama and merkel were all smiles in july but he may face a sterner face in future mingled with germany 's welcome for barack obama , warnings have been issued over the past couple of days to the next us administration : do not request more german troops to fight in afghanistan . chancellor angela merkel said she had agreed with the president-elect in a telephone conversation thursday that their two nations must act in union to solve the world 's problems .
" germany must , should and will take on responsibility , " she said .
but in remarks to supporters a day later , the limits to german willingness were clear .
germany has not forgotten an obama speech in berlin in june during which he called on the germans to take on more of the fighting burden in afghanistan , where german soldiers have rarely fought the taliban .
merkel told the youth section of her christian democratic union -lrb- cdu -rrb- that berlin would not accede to any request from the next us administration to send troops to southern afghanistan , the scene of most fighting .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel will give obama the same message as she gave bush " wherever germany commits itself , a wholeness of military and civilian assistance should be visible , " she said .
she would be able to tell obama that " just as well " as she had said it to president george w. bush .
german forces , the third-biggest component in the international security assistance force -lrb- isaf -rrb- , are based in safer northern afghanistan .
other armies have borne the brunt of the fighting in the south .
merkel may gain her chance to tell obama fairly soon when she attends a g20 summit in washington at the end of this week .
world leaders hope to see obama during their stay .
enthusiasm for obama has been huge in berlin most of this year : that helped ensure a crowd of 200,000 heard his speech in a city park on july 24 .
former defense minister expects pressure from obama the social democrats -lrb- spd -rrb- , the other main party in the merkel federal coalition , have claimed obama 's election as vindication for their own centre-left policies , but have also had an undertone of caution about afghanistan .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : obama is expected to ask for troops to help the us peter struck , who heads the spd parliamentary caucus and is a former german defense minister , told a sunday newspaper , bild am sonntag , he expected obama to seek more from nato and its european members .
but if obama requested german fighting troops in the south , " i would resist that most resolutely , " he said .
" there are limits . "
he said germany was already sending an extra 1,000 men to the north and offering advance-warning aircraft .
foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier , the social democrat who is to challenge merkel next year for the chancellorship , has already begun staking out that german position in diplomatic language .
he told a german newspaper , the hamburger abendblatt , on saturday that obama " highly appreciated " germany 's current contribution in afghanistan .
obama would not just seek more troops but also more reconstruction aid .
" we are very close to obama on this , " he said .
both merkel and steinmeier are driven on the troops issue by voter concerns about the afghan war .
german leaders wary as elections loom on horizon bildunterschrift : chancellor-candidate steinmeier is picking his words carefully on troop deployments with an election coming up in september , neither camp wants a surge in german casualties , including those from suicide attackers , to trigger a new round of anguish over the deployment .
surveys show most germans think the country is doing enough in afghanistan .
a forsa poll found 80 percent agree a us request for more troops should be refused and only 15 percent disagree .
however neither main party wants to upset obama at this stage by criticizing him .
the germans are eager to move forward with washington on many issues " in a spirit of togetherness , " merkel said .
she told the bild am sonntag on sunday those issues included " stabilizing afghanistan , " fixing the global financial crisis , fighting global warming and improving human rights .
steinmeier has already begun plans to demonstrate goodwill on another front , setting up plans to pay a call on the us-backed government in iraq next year and asking aides to draw up substantive aid plans for iraq .
that in itself is remarkable , since steinmeier , as chief of staff to former german chancellor gerhard schroeder , was a leading figure in germany 's refusal to assist the united states in the 2003 gulf war . dpa news agency -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de middle east -pipe- 09.11.2008 middle east quartet hears of progress from israel , palestinians großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : israeli foreign minister livni and palestinian president abbas said peace was still achievable wrapping up a briefing to the sponsors of the israeli-palestinian peace process , palestinian president mahmoud abbas and israeli foreign minister tzipi livni said sunday , november 9 they will keep negotiating . the news of continued negotiations comes as the peace process goes through a lull due to the political changes in the us and israel .
" we , both of us , affirmed that we will continue in these negotiations and that we will not stop even as israel prepares to go for elections , " abbas told a joint news conference with livni .
" our meetings will continue as usual , " he added .
for her part , livni said that the continued talks , aimed at forging an israeli-palestinian peace resulting in a palestinian state , would continue the framework agreed on at last year 's annapolis peace summit , when the sides agreed to rekindle the negotiations after a seven-year hiatus .
" the annapolis process serves the interest of both parties , the israeli and palestinian , " she said .
quartet pledges further support bildunterschrift : the middle east quartet - the us , eu , un and russia - offer its continued support the process ' sponsors - the so-called quartet of the us , russia , the european union and the united nations - said in a statement that they would continue their commitment supporting the parties efforts and also pledged to " respect the bilateral and confidential nature of the negotiations . "
renewed officially at the turn of the year , the negotiations , headed by livni for the israelis and former-premier ahmed quriea for the palestinians , have been conducted amid a virtual media blackout , with concomitant conflicting reports of the progress being made .
but according to an israeli foreign ministry communiqué , livni told the quartet sunday that " real and intensive progress " has been made , and the sides believed they had the elements , guiding principles and trust needed to create a good basis for a deal .
at annapolis abbas and israeli prime minister ehud olmert pledged to try and secure a treaty by the end of the year , but on thursday us secretary of state condoleezza rice conceded that this is unlikely to happen , as israel heads for elections early next year .
fears have also been expressed that the transition period in the us , as president-elect barack obama prepares to take office , may affect the momentum of the talks .
tough issues under negotiation bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : rice , solana and lavrov heard the report in sharm el-sheikh officials from both sides have said that it is proving difficult to reach agreement on the many tough issues that are under negotiations which include the future of east jerusalem , the fate of palestinian refugees , the borders and management of natural resources , especially water .
both israelis and palestinians say they need more time to agree .
east jerusalem is proving to be an especially tough issue to settle , and an israeli trial balloon , to conclude a partial agreement without it , was quickly shot down by the palestinians .
in sharm el-sheikh on sunday , neither livni nor abbas expressed any indication of how much longer the two sides would need to conclude an agreement according to the annapolis framework , but both agreed and said that nothing is done until it is actually done .
abbas and livni did not take any questions from the press .
however , speaking privately their aides said that each side was more or less satisfied with the outcome of the sharm el-sheikh meeting .
the israelis said that they were pleased with the consensus they have with the palestinians and the international community as represented in the quartet to " stick to the annapolis process " .
" it is important that we do n't keep seeing new initiatives being offered every day .
this will complicate matters , " said one israeli source who spoke on condition of anonymity to the dpa news agency .
livni had called on the international community not to intervene in the talks by submitting " bridging proposals and initiatives which do not suit reality . "
the palestinians said they were also pleased with the understanding the quartet demonstrated for their determination to secure a comprehensive settlement .
" we can not go back to our people with bits and pieces .
the palestinians have suffered for a long time and now they want to see the final peace deal and their state , " said a palestinian source , who asked not to be named .
israel also received more assurances from the palestinians , the egyptian host of the meeting and the quartet members that all efforts will be duly exerted to observe their security concerns , diplomatic sources said .
envoy blair promises continued economic aid bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : quartet envoy blair said funding would continue the palestinians received promises that economic aid will be sustained .
tony blair , the quartet envoy to the middle east , who is in charge of observing the flow of international financial aid to the palestinians said sunday that he would continue to work for the support of palestinian economy and for the upgrade of palestinian security .
the palestinians , however , did not get a mechanism they demanded , to be in charge of following up on israeli commitments to ease economic and security sanctions on palestinian territories .
un secretary-general ban ki-moon said sunday in a press conference that " the quartet is the mechanism . " dpa news agency -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" we , both of us , affirmed that we will continue in these negotiations and that we will not stop even as israel prepares to go for elections , " abbas told a joint news conference with livni .
" our meetings will continue as usual , " he added .
for her part , livni said that the continued talks , aimed at forging an israeli-palestinian peace resulting in a palestinian state , would continue the framework agreed on at last year 's annapolis peace summit , when the sides agreed to rekindle the negotiations after a seven-year hiatus .
" the annapolis process serves the interest of both parties , the israeli and palestinian , " she said .

"
renewed officially at the turn of the year , the negotiations , headed by livni for the israelis and former-premier ahmed quriea for the palestinians , have been conducted amid a virtual media blackout , with concomitant conflicting reports of the progress being made .

at annapolis abbas and israeli prime minister ehud olmert pledged to try and secure a treaty by the end of the year , but on thursday us secretary of state condoleezza rice conceded that this is unlikely to happen , as israel heads for elections early next year .

east jerusalem is proving to be an especially tough issue to settle , and an israeli trial balloon , to conclude a partial agreement without it , was quickly shot down by the palestinians .
in sharm el-sheikh on sunday , neither livni nor abbas expressed any indication of how much longer the two sides would need to conclude an agreement according to the annapolis framework , but both agreed and said that nothing is done until it is actually done .
abbas and livni did not take any questions from the press .
however , speaking privately their aides said that each side was more or less satisfied with the outcome of the sharm el-sheikh meeting .
the israelis said that they were pleased with the consensus they have with the palestinians and the international community as represented in the quartet to " stick to the annapolis process " .
" it is important that we do n't keep seeing new initiatives being offered every day .
this will complicate matters , " said one israeli source who spoke on condition of anonymity to the dpa news agency .
livni had called on the international community not to intervene in the talks by submitting " bridging proposals and initiatives which do not suit reality . "
the palestinians said they were also pleased with the understanding the quartet demonstrated for their determination to secure a comprehensive settlement .
" we can not go back to our people with bits and pieces .
the palestinians have suffered for a long time and now they want to see the final peace deal and their state , " said a palestinian source , who asked not to be named .
israel also received more assurances from the palestinians , the egyptian host of the meeting and the quartet members that all efforts will be duly exerted to observe their security concerns , diplomatic sources said .

" we , both of us , affirmed that we will continue in these negotiations and that we will not stop even as israel prepares to go for elections , " abbas told a joint news conference with livni .
" our meetings will continue as usual , " he added .
for her part , livni said that the continued talks , aimed at forging an israeli-palestinian peace resulting in a palestinian state , would continue the framework agreed on at last year 's annapolis peace summit , when the sides agreed to rekindle the negotiations after a seven-year hiatus .
" the annapolis process serves the interest of both parties , the israeli and palestinian , " she said .
quartet pledges further support bildunterschrift : the middle east quartet - the us , eu , un and russia - offer its continued support the process ' sponsors - the so-called quartet of the us , russia , the european union and the united nations - said in a statement that they would continue their commitment supporting the parties efforts and also pledged to " respect the bilateral and confidential nature of the negotiations . "
renewed officially at the turn of the year , the negotiations , headed by livni for the israelis and former-premier ahmed quriea for the palestinians , have been conducted amid a virtual media blackout , with concomitant conflicting reports of the progress being made .
but according to an israeli foreign ministry communiqué , livni told the quartet sunday that " real and intensive progress " has been made , and the sides believed they had the elements , guiding principles and trust needed to create a good basis for a deal .
at annapolis abbas and israeli prime minister ehud olmert pledged to try and secure a treaty by the end of the year , but on thursday us secretary of state condoleezza rice conceded that this is unlikely to happen , as israel heads for elections early next year .
fears have also been expressed that the transition period in the us , as president-elect barack obama prepares to take office , may affect the momentum of the talks .
tough issues under negotiation bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : rice , solana and lavrov heard the report in sharm el-sheikh officials from both sides have said that it is proving difficult to reach agreement on the many tough issues that are under negotiations which include the future of east jerusalem , the fate of palestinian refugees , the borders and management of natural resources , especially water .
both israelis and palestinians say they need more time to agree .
east jerusalem is proving to be an especially tough issue to settle , and an israeli trial balloon , to conclude a partial agreement without it , was quickly shot down by the palestinians .
in sharm el-sheikh on sunday , neither livni nor abbas expressed any indication of how much longer the two sides would need to conclude an agreement according to the annapolis framework , but both agreed and said that nothing is done until it is actually done .
abbas and livni did not take any questions from the press .
however , speaking privately their aides said that each side was more or less satisfied with the outcome of the sharm el-sheikh meeting .
the israelis said that they were pleased with the consensus they have with the palestinians and the international community as represented in the quartet to " stick to the annapolis process " .
" it is important that we do n't keep seeing new initiatives being offered every day .
this will complicate matters , " said one israeli source who spoke on condition of anonymity to the dpa news agency .
livni had called on the international community not to intervene in the talks by submitting " bridging proposals and initiatives which do not suit reality . "
the palestinians said they were also pleased with the understanding the quartet demonstrated for their determination to secure a comprehensive settlement .
" we can not go back to our people with bits and pieces .
the palestinians have suffered for a long time and now they want to see the final peace deal and their state , " said a palestinian source , who asked not to be named .
israel also received more assurances from the palestinians , the egyptian host of the meeting and the quartet members that all efforts will be duly exerted to observe their security concerns , diplomatic sources said .
envoy blair promises continued economic aid bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : quartet envoy blair said funding would continue the palestinians received promises that economic aid will be sustained .
tony blair , the quartet envoy to the middle east , who is in charge of observing the flow of international financial aid to the palestinians said sunday that he would continue to work for the support of palestinian economy and for the upgrade of palestinian security .
the palestinians , however , did not get a mechanism they demanded , to be in charge of following up on israeli commitments to ease economic and security sanctions on palestinian territories .
un secretary-general ban ki-moon said sunday in a press conference that " the quartet is the mechanism . " dpa news agency -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" he is a very modern and innovative coach , and we are convinced of the fact that we will celebrate plenty of successes with him . "
although bayern were fourth before sunday 's game , some bayern fans remain unconvinced klinsmann is the right man after munich 's poor start to the league which saw them 11th last month after defeat 's to werder bremen and hanover .
" we are already seeing improvement and his philosophy works , " insisted rummenigge .
" we can be confident of the future . "

" lukas has back problems which makes his involvement not possible and bastian continues to suffer from the bruised leg he picked up against fiorentina , " said klinsmann on the bayern website .

" around 80 argentine players are performing at the highest level with european clubs .
we could put out three or four strong teams .
making it into the national side is incredibly difficult . "

just behind the cinema is a store called berlinerklamotten that offers more than just a single designer 's line .
in fact about 140 fashion designers are represented on the ground floor of the factory-like building . every table and every rack has a different notion of fashion .

in germany , just over a dozen female imams work in their communities .
yet more women are urgently needed in the mosques for counseling and integration aid . they lead prayers , give koran lessons and offer counseling .
whether it 's new york , berlin , cairo or istanbul : female imams are currently high in demand . zeynep cesen is one of the very few female imams who came to germany from turkey to specifically help women in muslim communities .
even when friday prayers continue to be the domain of her male counterparts , cesen 's range of responsibilities is very diverse , but she mainly helps women with their problems . " it 's generally young women who came here from turkey , " cesen said .
" we listen to their problems and try to find solutions . " due to her close contact to women of all ages , cesen reaches circles which a male imam in germany never could .
this is one of the reasons why the turkish-islamic union ditib employs female imams , said speaker ayse aydin . " religious services and human needs ca n't always be separated , " aydin said .
ditib 's goal is serving the needs of the community .
this included consciously addressing women , answering their questions and giving them the possibility to feel secure in the community , she said . supporting integration efforts when cesen came to germany at the beginning of the 1990s , her position was initially limited to six years .
today , she counsels up to 100 women per day . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : women and girls of all ages seek cesen 's advice in addition to her counseling tasks , she has developed her own form of preaching .
she said she answers religious questions " not down from the pulpit " but rather in discussion rounds with different women 's groups .
and daily problems are not excluded . women of all ages and with various social and personal problems turn to her .
many women would not open up to a male imam . " there are many things that women only want to share with women , " cesen said , adding that a warm and friendly atmosphere was necessary in order to share certain problems and issues . cesen said she reaches many turkish families through her intensive counseling work with women .
she said she wants to show them possibilities to access german society .
she said integration problems of mainly young turks in schools and training facilities require urgent action , cesen said . cesen said she urged both turkish businesses as well as german companies to create more training opportunities for young people .
in addition , much more needed to be done for women of turkish descent in order for their integration to succeed . dialog with christians when cesen speaks , many people in her community are all ears - even non-muslims . " she is often consulted from outside , too , " said ditib speaker aydin .
" we are proud of the work which our imam does here . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : integrating turks into german society still faces many problems cesen said she sees her contribution in an interchange with the neighborhood . " we need one another in good times as well as in bad times , " she said .
" so we need a good dialog with our german friends . " cesen said she therefore needed to be a good role model and encourage her community to do the same .
this included , for example , that muslims and christians wish each other happy holidays , no matter if it 's christmas or ramadan .
or that you go visit neighbors who are ill . the 50-year-old cesen is one of only 13 female imams currently working in turkish mosques in germany .
this is in part due to the lack of theological training for imams in germany .
the turkish-islamic union would like to have theologians trained in germany and foremost , ones who speak german well . cesen studied at the faculty for islamic theology in izmir and worked as an imam in turkey for 18 years before coming to germany in 1994 .
here , she initially served 51 mosque communities in cologne and the surrounding areas .
today , she works solely for ditib . diyanet , the state authority for religious affairs in turkey , helps select female theologians for the ditib communities .
since 2002 , there has been a more intensive preparation for female and male imams who are to be employed in germany .
they are prepared for their new tasks with german courses and cultural studies at the goethe institute in ankara .
after all , they are supposed to help their fellow countrymen and women to better integrate themselves in germany . whether the union can raise the current number of female imams for germany is unclear .
many turkish mosques in germany would like to have a woman in their ranks .

in germany , just over a dozen female imams work in their communities .
yet more women are urgently needed in the mosques for counseling and integration aid . they lead prayers , give koran lessons and offer counseling .
whether it 's new york , berlin , cairo or istanbul : female imams are currently high in demand . zeynep cesen is one of the very few female imams who came to germany from turkey to specifically help women in muslim communities .
even when friday prayers continue to be the domain of her male counterparts , cesen 's range of responsibilities is very diverse , but she mainly helps women with their problems . " it 's generally young women who came here from turkey , " cesen said .
" we listen to their problems and try to find solutions . " due to her close contact to women of all ages , cesen reaches circles which a male imam in germany never could .
this is one of the reasons why the turkish-islamic union ditib employs female imams , said speaker ayse aydin . " religious services and human needs ca n't always be separated , " aydin said .
ditib 's goal is serving the needs of the community .
this included consciously addressing women , answering their questions and giving them the possibility to feel secure in the community , she said . supporting integration efforts when cesen came to germany at the beginning of the 1990s , her position was initially limited to six years .
today , she counsels up to 100 women per day . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : women and girls of all ages seek cesen 's advice in addition to her counseling tasks , she has developed her own form of preaching .
she said she answers religious questions " not down from the pulpit " but rather in discussion rounds with different women 's groups .
and daily problems are not excluded . women of all ages and with various social and personal problems turn to her .
many women would not open up to a male imam . " there are many things that women only want to share with women , " cesen said , adding that a warm and friendly atmosphere was necessary in order to share certain problems and issues . cesen said she reaches many turkish families through her intensive counseling work with women .
she said she wants to show them possibilities to access german society .
she said integration problems of mainly young turks in schools and training facilities require urgent action , cesen said . cesen said she urged both turkish businesses as well as german companies to create more training opportunities for young people .
in addition , much more needed to be done for women of turkish descent in order for their integration to succeed . dialog with christians when cesen speaks , many people in her community are all ears - even non-muslims . " she is often consulted from outside , too , " said ditib speaker aydin .
" we are proud of the work which our imam does here . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : integrating turks into german society still faces many problems cesen said she sees her contribution in an interchange with the neighborhood . " we need one another in good times as well as in bad times , " she said .
" so we need a good dialog with our german friends . " cesen said she therefore needed to be a good role model and encourage her community to do the same .
this included , for example , that muslims and christians wish each other happy holidays , no matter if it 's christmas or ramadan .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de integration -pipe- 09.11.2008 female imams reach out into german communities großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : leading friday prayers continues to be the domain of men religious leaders in mosques are for the large part men .
in germany , just over a dozen female imams work in their communities .
yet more women are urgently needed in the mosques for counseling and integration aid . they lead prayers , give koran lessons and offer counseling .
whether it 's new york , berlin , cairo or istanbul : female imams are currently high in demand . zeynep cesen is one of the very few female imams who came to germany from turkey to specifically help women in muslim communities .
even when friday prayers continue to be the domain of her male counterparts , cesen 's range of responsibilities is very diverse , but she mainly helps women with their problems . " it 's generally young women who came here from turkey , " cesen said .
" we listen to their problems and try to find solutions . " due to her close contact to women of all ages , cesen reaches circles which a male imam in germany never could .
this is one of the reasons why the turkish-islamic union ditib employs female imams , said speaker ayse aydin . " religious services and human needs ca n't always be separated , " aydin said .
ditib 's goal is serving the needs of the community .
this included consciously addressing women , answering their questions and giving them the possibility to feel secure in the community , she said . supporting integration efforts when cesen came to germany at the beginning of the 1990s , her position was initially limited to six years .
today , she counsels up to 100 women per day . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : women and girls of all ages seek cesen 's advice in addition to her counseling tasks , she has developed her own form of preaching .
she said she answers religious questions " not down from the pulpit " but rather in discussion rounds with different women 's groups .
and daily problems are not excluded . women of all ages and with various social and personal problems turn to her .
many women would not open up to a male imam . " there are many things that women only want to share with women , " cesen said , adding that a warm and friendly atmosphere was necessary in order to share certain problems and issues . cesen said she reaches many turkish families through her intensive counseling work with women .
she said she wants to show them possibilities to access german society .
she said integration problems of mainly young turks in schools and training facilities require urgent action , cesen said . cesen said she urged both turkish businesses as well as german companies to create more training opportunities for young people .
in addition , much more needed to be done for women of turkish descent in order for their integration to succeed . dialog with christians when cesen speaks , many people in her community are all ears - even non-muslims . " she is often consulted from outside , too , " said ditib speaker aydin .
" we are proud of the work which our imam does here . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : integrating turks into german society still faces many problems cesen said she sees her contribution in an interchange with the neighborhood . " we need one another in good times as well as in bad times , " she said .
" so we need a good dialog with our german friends . " cesen said she therefore needed to be a good role model and encourage her community to do the same .
this included , for example , that muslims and christians wish each other happy holidays , no matter if it 's christmas or ramadan .
or that you go visit neighbors who are ill . the 50-year-old cesen is one of only 13 female imams currently working in turkish mosques in germany .
this is in part due to the lack of theological training for imams in germany .
the turkish-islamic union would like to have theologians trained in germany and foremost , ones who speak german well . cesen studied at the faculty for islamic theology in izmir and worked as an imam in turkey for 18 years before coming to germany in 1994 .
here , she initially served 51 mosque communities in cologne and the surrounding areas .
today , she works solely for ditib . diyanet , the state authority for religious affairs in turkey , helps select female theologians for the ditib communities .
since 2002 , there has been a more intensive preparation for female and male imams who are to be employed in germany .
they are prepared for their new tasks with german courses and cultural studies at the goethe institute in ankara .
after all , they are supposed to help their fellow countrymen and women to better integrate themselves in germany . whether the union can raise the current number of female imams for germany is unclear .
many turkish mosques in germany would like to have a woman in their ranks .
it would be a measure which would unburden cesen and her female colleagues . ulrike hummel -lrb- sac -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

even when friday prayers continue to be the domain of her male counterparts , cesen 's range of responsibilities is very diverse , but she mainly helps women with their problems . " it 's generally young women who came here from turkey , " cesen said .
" we listen to their problems and try to find solutions . " due to her close contact to women of all ages , cesen reaches circles which a male imam in germany never could .
this is one of the reasons why the turkish-islamic union ditib employs female imams , said speaker ayse aydin . " religious services and human needs ca n't always be separated , " aydin said .
ditib 's goal is serving the needs of the community .
this included consciously addressing women , answering their questions and giving them the possibility to feel secure in the community , she said . supporting integration efforts when cesen came to germany at the beginning of the 1990s , her position was initially limited to six years .
today , she counsels up to 100 women per day . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : women and girls of all ages seek cesen 's advice in addition to her counseling tasks , she has developed her own form of preaching .
she said she answers religious questions " not down from the pulpit " but rather in discussion rounds with different women 's groups .
and daily problems are not excluded . women of all ages and with various social and personal problems turn to her .
many women would not open up to a male imam . " there are many things that women only want to share with women , " cesen said , adding that a warm and friendly atmosphere was necessary in order to share certain problems and issues . cesen said she reaches many turkish families through her intensive counseling work with women .
she said she wants to show them possibilities to access german society .
she said integration problems of mainly young turks in schools and training facilities require urgent action , cesen said . cesen said she urged both turkish businesses as well as german companies to create more training opportunities for young people .
in addition , much more needed to be done for women of turkish descent in order for their integration to succeed . dialog with christians when cesen speaks , many people in her community are all ears - even non-muslims . " she is often consulted from outside , too , " said ditib speaker aydin .
" we are proud of the work which our imam does here . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : integrating turks into german society still faces many problems cesen said she sees her contribution in an interchange with the neighborhood . " we need one another in good times as well as in bad times , " she said .
" so we need a good dialog with our german friends . " cesen said she therefore needed to be a good role model and encourage her community to do the same .
this included , for example , that muslims and christians wish each other happy holidays , no matter if it 's christmas or ramadan .
or that you go visit neighbors who are ill . the 50-year-old cesen is one of only 13 female imams currently working in turkish mosques in germany .
this is in part due to the lack of theological training for imams in germany .
the turkish-islamic union would like to have theologians trained in germany and foremost , ones who speak german well . cesen studied at the faculty for islamic theology in izmir and worked as an imam in turkey for 18 years before coming to germany in 1994 .
here , she initially served 51 mosque communities in cologne and the surrounding areas .
today , she works solely for ditib . diyanet , the state authority for religious affairs in turkey , helps select female theologians for the ditib communities .
since 2002 , there has been a more intensive preparation for female and male imams who are to be employed in germany .
they are prepared for their new tasks with german courses and cultural studies at the goethe institute in ankara .
after all , they are supposed to help their fellow countrymen and women to better integrate themselves in germany . whether the union can raise the current number of female imams for germany is unclear .

in germany , just over a dozen female imams work in their communities .
yet more women are urgently needed in the mosques for counseling and integration aid . they lead prayers , give koran lessons and offer counseling .
whether it 's new york , berlin , cairo or istanbul : female imams are currently high in demand . zeynep cesen is one of the very few female imams who came to germany from turkey to specifically help women in muslim communities .
even when friday prayers continue to be the domain of her male counterparts , cesen 's range of responsibilities is very diverse , but she mainly helps women with their problems . " it 's generally young women who came here from turkey , " cesen said .
" we listen to their problems and try to find solutions . " due to her close contact to women of all ages , cesen reaches circles which a male imam in germany never could .
this is one of the reasons why the turkish-islamic union ditib employs female imams , said speaker ayse aydin . " religious services and human needs ca n't always be separated , " aydin said .
ditib 's goal is serving the needs of the community .
this included consciously addressing women , answering their questions and giving them the possibility to feel secure in the community , she said . supporting integration efforts when cesen came to germany at the beginning of the 1990s , her position was initially limited to six years .
today , she counsels up to 100 women per day . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : women and girls of all ages seek cesen 's advice in addition to her counseling tasks , she has developed her own form of preaching .
she said she answers religious questions " not down from the pulpit " but rather in discussion rounds with different women 's groups .
and daily problems are not excluded . women of all ages and with various social and personal problems turn to her .
many women would not open up to a male imam . " there are many things that women only want to share with women , " cesen said , adding that a warm and friendly atmosphere was necessary in order to share certain problems and issues . cesen said she reaches many turkish families through her intensive counseling work with women .

" she added that germany needs to encourage moral courage in the face of racism and anti-semitism . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel said germans must not be indifferent to xenophobia , racism or anti-semitism " there was no storm of protest against the nazi , but silence , shrugged shoulders and people looking away - from individual citizens to large parts of the church , " she said .

" germany must , should and will take on responsibility , " she said .
but in remarks to supporters a day later , the limits to german willingness were clear .
germany has not forgotten an obama speech in berlin in june during which he called on the germans to take on more of the fighting burden in afghanistan , where german soldiers have rarely fought the taliban .
merkel told the youth section of her christian democratic union -lrb- cdu -rrb- that berlin would not accede to any request from the next us administration to send troops to southern afghanistan , the scene of most fighting .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel will give obama the same message as she gave bush " wherever germany commits itself , a wholeness of military and civilian assistance should be visible , " she said .
she would be able to tell obama that " just as well " as she had said it to president george w. bush .
german forces , the third-biggest component in the international security assistance force -lrb- isaf -rrb- , are based in safer northern afghanistan .
other armies have borne the brunt of the fighting in the south .
merkel may gain her chance to tell obama fairly soon when she attends a g20 summit in washington at the end of this week .
world leaders hope to see obama during their stay .
enthusiasm for obama has been huge in berlin most of this year : that helped ensure a crowd of 200,000 heard his speech in a city park on july 24 .
former defense minister expects pressure from obama the social democrats -lrb- spd -rrb- , the other main party in the merkel federal coalition , have claimed obama 's election as vindication for their own centre-left policies , but have also had an undertone of caution about afghanistan .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : obama is expected to ask for troops to help the us peter struck , who heads the spd parliamentary caucus and is a former german defense minister , told a sunday newspaper , bild am sonntag , he expected obama to seek more from nato and its european members .
but if obama requested german fighting troops in the south , " i would resist that most resolutely , " he said .
" there are limits . "
he said germany was already sending an extra 1,000 men to the north and offering advance-warning aircraft .
foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier , the social democrat who is to challenge merkel next year for the chancellorship , has already begun staking out that german position in diplomatic language .
he told a german newspaper , the hamburger abendblatt , on saturday that obama " highly appreciated " germany 's current contribution in afghanistan .
obama would not just seek more troops but also more reconstruction aid .
" we are very close to obama on this , " he said .
both merkel and steinmeier are driven on the troops issue by voter concerns about the afghan war .
german leaders wary as elections loom on horizon bildunterschrift : chancellor-candidate steinmeier is picking his words carefully on troop deployments with an election coming up in september , neither camp wants a surge in german casualties , including those from suicide attackers , to trigger a new round of anguish over the deployment .
surveys show most germans think the country is doing enough in afghanistan .
a forsa poll found 80 percent agree a us request for more troops should be refused and only 15 percent disagree .
however neither main party wants to upset obama at this stage by criticizing him .
the germans are eager to move forward with washington on many issues " in a spirit of togetherness , " merkel said .
she told the bild am sonntag on sunday those issues included " stabilizing afghanistan , " fixing the global financial crisis , fighting global warming and improving human rights .
steinmeier has already begun plans to demonstrate goodwill on another front , setting up plans to pay a call on the us-backed government in iraq next year and asking aides to draw up substantive aid plans for iraq .

" germany must , should and will take on responsibility , " she said .
but in remarks to supporters a day later , the limits to german willingness were clear .
germany has not forgotten an obama speech in berlin in june during which he called on the germans to take on more of the fighting burden in afghanistan , where german soldiers have rarely fought the taliban .
merkel told the youth section of her christian democratic union -lrb- cdu -rrb- that berlin would not accede to any request from the next us administration to send troops to southern afghanistan , the scene of most fighting .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel will give obama the same message as she gave bush " wherever germany commits itself , a wholeness of military and civilian assistance should be visible , " she said .
she would be able to tell obama that " just as well " as she had said it to president george w. bush .
german forces , the third-biggest component in the international security assistance force -lrb- isaf -rrb- , are based in safer northern afghanistan .
other armies have borne the brunt of the fighting in the south .
merkel may gain her chance to tell obama fairly soon when she attends a g20 summit in washington at the end of this week .
world leaders hope to see obama during their stay .
enthusiasm for obama has been huge in berlin most of this year : that helped ensure a crowd of 200,000 heard his speech in a city park on july 24 .
former defense minister expects pressure from obama the social democrats -lrb- spd -rrb- , the other main party in the merkel federal coalition , have claimed obama 's election as vindication for their own centre-left policies , but have also had an undertone of caution about afghanistan .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : obama is expected to ask for troops to help the us peter struck , who heads the spd parliamentary caucus and is a former german defense minister , told a sunday newspaper , bild am sonntag , he expected obama to seek more from nato and its european members .
but if obama requested german fighting troops in the south , " i would resist that most resolutely , " he said .
" there are limits . "
he said germany was already sending an extra 1,000 men to the north and offering advance-warning aircraft .
foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier , the social democrat who is to challenge merkel next year for the chancellorship , has already begun staking out that german position in diplomatic language .
he told a german newspaper , the hamburger abendblatt , on saturday that obama " highly appreciated " germany 's current contribution in afghanistan .
obama would not just seek more troops but also more reconstruction aid .
" we are very close to obama on this , " he said .
both merkel and steinmeier are driven on the troops issue by voter concerns about the afghan war .
german leaders wary as elections loom on horizon bildunterschrift : chancellor-candidate steinmeier is picking his words carefully on troop deployments with an election coming up in september , neither camp wants a surge in german casualties , including those from suicide attackers , to trigger a new round of anguish over the deployment .
surveys show most germans think the country is doing enough in afghanistan .
a forsa poll found 80 percent agree a us request for more troops should be refused and only 15 percent disagree .
however neither main party wants to upset obama at this stage by criticizing him .
the germans are eager to move forward with washington on many issues " in a spirit of togetherness , " merkel said .
she told the bild am sonntag on sunday those issues included " stabilizing afghanistan , " fixing the global financial crisis , fighting global warming and improving human rights .
steinmeier has already begun plans to demonstrate goodwill on another front , setting up plans to pay a call on the us-backed government in iraq next year and asking aides to draw up substantive aid plans for iraq .
that in itself is remarkable , since steinmeier , as chief of staff to former german chancellor gerhard schroeder , was a leading figure in germany 's refusal to assist the united states in the 2003 gulf war . dpa news agency -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

9 , in the east of the democratic republic of congo , german president horst koehler urged all african nations to put an end to their disputes . " this must have an end , " said koehler , speaking at the german-sponsored fourth africa forum in the nigerian capital of abuja on saturday .
he said the news from dr congo was " particularly disappointing . " as the forum met , the leaders of dr congo and rwanda were at a meeting in kenya to try to negotiate an end to the fighting in eastern dr congo . koehler noted that civilians bore the brunt of the impact of africa 's battles .
speaking from prepared comments , he said a self- aware africa with equal rights for all must live up to its responsibility to guarantee " security and peace on its own continent . "
he called on african leaders to pursue more transparent politics and to ensure that the profits from raw material mining benefited the entire population .
at the same time , he urged european leaders to seek international trade mechanisms that factor in the needs of africa . that would include an " international raw materials strategy , that gives all exporters of raw materials a fair chance to participate in the market , " the former imf head said . violence in congo bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : civilians are hardest hit by violence , koehler said koehler 's appeals for peace come as fighting broke out among rebels and pro-government militia in congo on sunday , un sources said .

" we , both of us , affirmed that we will continue in these negotiations and that we will not stop even as israel prepares to go for elections , " abbas told a joint news conference with livni .
" our meetings will continue as usual , " he added .
for her part , livni said that the continued talks , aimed at forging an israeli-palestinian peace resulting in a palestinian state , would continue the framework agreed on at last year 's annapolis peace summit , when the sides agreed to rekindle the negotiations after a seven-year hiatus .
" the annapolis process serves the interest of both parties , the israeli and palestinian , " she said .

"
renewed officially at the turn of the year , the negotiations , headed by livni for the israelis and former-premier ahmed quriea for the palestinians , have been conducted amid a virtual media blackout , with concomitant conflicting reports of the progress being made .

tough issues under negotiation bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : rice , solana and lavrov heard the report in sharm el-sheikh officials from both sides have said that it is proving difficult to reach agreement on the many tough issues that are under negotiations which include the future of east jerusalem , the fate of palestinian refugees , the borders and management of natural resources , especially water .
both israelis and palestinians say they need more time to agree .
east jerusalem is proving to be an especially tough issue to settle , and an israeli trial balloon , to conclude a partial agreement without it , was quickly shot down by the palestinians .
in sharm el-sheikh on sunday , neither livni nor abbas expressed any indication of how much longer the two sides would need to conclude an agreement according to the annapolis framework , but both agreed and said that nothing is done until it is actually done .
abbas and livni did not take any questions from the press .
however , speaking privately their aides said that each side was more or less satisfied with the outcome of the sharm el-sheikh meeting .
the israelis said that they were pleased with the consensus they have with the palestinians and the international community as represented in the quartet to " stick to the annapolis process " .
" it is important that we do n't keep seeing new initiatives being offered every day .
this will complicate matters , " said one israeli source who spoke on condition of anonymity to the dpa news agency .
livni had called on the international community not to intervene in the talks by submitting " bridging proposals and initiatives which do not suit reality . "
the palestinians said they were also pleased with the understanding the quartet demonstrated for their determination to secure a comprehensive settlement .
" we can not go back to our people with bits and pieces .
the palestinians have suffered for a long time and now they want to see the final peace deal and their state , " said a palestinian source , who asked not to be named .
israel also received more assurances from the palestinians , the egyptian host of the meeting and the quartet members that all efforts will be duly exerted to observe their security concerns , diplomatic sources said .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de trans-atlantic relations -pipe- 09.11.2008 germany to obama : we will resist calls for more troops großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : obama and merkel were all smiles in july but he may face a sterner face in future mingled with germany 's welcome for barack obama , warnings have been issued over the past couple of days to the next us administration : do not request more german troops to fight in afghanistan . chancellor angela merkel said she had agreed with the president-elect in a telephone conversation thursday that their two nations must act in union to solve the world 's problems .
" germany must , should and will take on responsibility , " she said .
but in remarks to supporters a day later , the limits to german willingness were clear .
germany has not forgotten an obama speech in berlin in june during which he called on the germans to take on more of the fighting burden in afghanistan , where german soldiers have rarely fought the taliban .
merkel told the youth section of her christian democratic union -lrb- cdu -rrb- that berlin would not accede to any request from the next us administration to send troops to southern afghanistan , the scene of most fighting .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel will give obama the same message as she gave bush " wherever germany commits itself , a wholeness of military and civilian assistance should be visible , " she said .
she would be able to tell obama that " just as well " as she had said it to president george w. bush .
german forces , the third-biggest component in the international security assistance force -lrb- isaf -rrb- , are based in safer northern afghanistan .
other armies have borne the brunt of the fighting in the south .
merkel may gain her chance to tell obama fairly soon when she attends a g20 summit in washington at the end of this week .
world leaders hope to see obama during their stay .
enthusiasm for obama has been huge in berlin most of this year : that helped ensure a crowd of 200,000 heard his speech in a city park on july 24 .
former defense minister expects pressure from obama the social democrats -lrb- spd -rrb- , the other main party in the merkel federal coalition , have claimed obama 's election as vindication for their own centre-left policies , but have also had an undertone of caution about afghanistan .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : obama is expected to ask for troops to help the us peter struck , who heads the spd parliamentary caucus and is a former german defense minister , told a sunday newspaper , bild am sonntag , he expected obama to seek more from nato and its european members .
but if obama requested german fighting troops in the south , " i would resist that most resolutely , " he said .
" there are limits . "
he said germany was already sending an extra 1,000 men to the north and offering advance-warning aircraft .
foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier , the social democrat who is to challenge merkel next year for the chancellorship , has already begun staking out that german position in diplomatic language .
he told a german newspaper , the hamburger abendblatt , on saturday that obama " highly appreciated " germany 's current contribution in afghanistan .
obama would not just seek more troops but also more reconstruction aid .
" we are very close to obama on this , " he said .
both merkel and steinmeier are driven on the troops issue by voter concerns about the afghan war .
german leaders wary as elections loom on horizon bildunterschrift : chancellor-candidate steinmeier is picking his words carefully on troop deployments with an election coming up in september , neither camp wants a surge in german casualties , including those from suicide attackers , to trigger a new round of anguish over the deployment .
surveys show most germans think the country is doing enough in afghanistan .
a forsa poll found 80 percent agree a us request for more troops should be refused and only 15 percent disagree .
however neither main party wants to upset obama at this stage by criticizing him .
the germans are eager to move forward with washington on many issues " in a spirit of togetherness , " merkel said .
she told the bild am sonntag on sunday those issues included " stabilizing afghanistan , " fixing the global financial crisis , fighting global warming and improving human rights .
steinmeier has already begun plans to demonstrate goodwill on another front , setting up plans to pay a call on the us-backed government in iraq next year and asking aides to draw up substantive aid plans for iraq .
that in itself is remarkable , since steinmeier , as chief of staff to former german chancellor gerhard schroeder , was a leading figure in germany 's refusal to assist the united states in the 2003 gulf war . dpa news agency -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

7 , club chairman karl-heinz rummenigge has leapt to his defense . " we are convinced jurgen is the right coach for bayern , " rummenigge told the club 's agm in munich on friday night after klinsmann received whistles before sunday 's bundesliga clash with schalke 04 in gelsenkirchen .
" he is a very modern and innovative coach , and we are convinced of the fact that we will celebrate plenty of successes with him . "
although bayern were fourth before sunday 's game , some bayern fans remain unconvinced klinsmann is the right man after munich 's poor start to the league which saw them 11th last month after defeat 's to werder bremen and hanover .
" we are already seeing improvement and his philosophy works , " insisted rummenigge .
" we can be confident of the future . "
bayern captain mark van bommel said the german giants feel the pressure at the munich club where failure is not an option .
" it is a requirement at bayern that we win titles , third place is not the goal , " said the dutch hard-man .
munich faces schalke without injured stars bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : podolski is nursing a back injury - from sitting too long ?
meanwhile , bayern will be without injured pair bastian schweinsteiger and lukas podolski against schalke as both are struggling with knocks received in last wednesday 's champions league 1-1 draw at fiorentina .
" lukas has back problems which makes his involvement not possible and bastian continues to suffer from the bruised leg he picked up against fiorentina , " said klinsmann on the bayern website .
but italian world cup winner luca toni is back in the team and the striker will play from the start .
klinsmann said germany defender philipp lahm is back in training after picking up an ankle injury a fortnight ago , but will not feature against schalke .
bayern 's argentina internationals meet maradona meanwhile , bayern 's argentine internationals martin demichelis and jose ernesto sosa admit they were impressed new national coach diego maradona flew to see them .
the pair met maradona in a munich hotel for nearly an hour on thursday as part of his tour of european-based players to discuss tactics in the run up to the 2010 world cup .
both players have both been called up for maradona 's first match in charge , the meeting with scotland on november 19 at hampden park , glasgow .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : new argentina coach maradona is on a world tour " he wanted to establish a personal relationship with us and outline his plans , " said said demichelis , who admitted maradona was a child-hood hero .
" i 've previously met maradona , but that 's the first time i 've spoken to him for any length of time .
that was a gift from football , and a moment i 'll never forget .
" his presence is enough to motivate you to new heights .
you ca n't ask for more than having the greatest idol and the last world cup winning coach come to munich just to see jose and me .
" around 80 argentine players are performing at the highest level with european clubs .
we could put out three or four strong teams .
making it into the national side is incredibly difficult . "
the fact that maradona came to munich solely to see demichelis and sosa was a sign of the duo 's importance , according to klinsmann .
" he 's doing what i did four years ago , " said ex-germany boss klinsmann , who also sought early contact with his best players after taking the national hot seat in 2004 . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" he is a very modern and innovative coach , and we are convinced of the fact that we will celebrate plenty of successes with him . "
although bayern were fourth before sunday 's game , some bayern fans remain unconvinced klinsmann is the right man after munich 's poor start to the league which saw them 11th last month after defeat 's to werder bremen and hanover .
" we are already seeing improvement and his philosophy works , " insisted rummenigge .
" we can be confident of the future . "

7 , club chairman karl-heinz rummenigge has leapt to his defense . " we are convinced jurgen is the right coach for bayern , " rummenigge told the club 's agm in munich on friday night after klinsmann received whistles before sunday 's bundesliga clash with schalke 04 in gelsenkirchen .
" he is a very modern and innovative coach , and we are convinced of the fact that we will celebrate plenty of successes with him . "
although bayern were fourth before sunday 's game , some bayern fans remain unconvinced klinsmann is the right man after munich 's poor start to the league which saw them 11th last month after defeat 's to werder bremen and hanover .
" we are already seeing improvement and his philosophy works , " insisted rummenigge .
" we can be confident of the future . "
bayern captain mark van bommel said the german giants feel the pressure at the munich club where failure is not an option .
" it is a requirement at bayern that we win titles , third place is not the goal , " said the dutch hard-man .
munich faces schalke without injured stars bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : podolski is nursing a back injury - from sitting too long ?
meanwhile , bayern will be without injured pair bastian schweinsteiger and lukas podolski against schalke as both are struggling with knocks received in last wednesday 's champions league 1-1 draw at fiorentina .
" lukas has back problems which makes his involvement not possible and bastian continues to suffer from the bruised leg he picked up against fiorentina , " said klinsmann on the bayern website .
but italian world cup winner luca toni is back in the team and the striker will play from the start .
klinsmann said germany defender philipp lahm is back in training after picking up an ankle injury a fortnight ago , but will not feature against schalke .
bayern 's argentina internationals meet maradona meanwhile , bayern 's argentine internationals martin demichelis and jose ernesto sosa admit they were impressed new national coach diego maradona flew to see them .
the pair met maradona in a munich hotel for nearly an hour on thursday as part of his tour of european-based players to discuss tactics in the run up to the 2010 world cup .
both players have both been called up for maradona 's first match in charge , the meeting with scotland on november 19 at hampden park , glasgow .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : new argentina coach maradona is on a world tour " he wanted to establish a personal relationship with us and outline his plans , " said said demichelis , who admitted maradona was a child-hood hero .
" i 've previously met maradona , but that 's the first time i 've spoken to him for any length of time .
that was a gift from football , and a moment i 'll never forget .
" his presence is enough to motivate you to new heights .
you ca n't ask for more than having the greatest idol and the last world cup winning coach come to munich just to see jose and me .
" around 80 argentine players are performing at the highest level with european clubs .
we could put out three or four strong teams .
making it into the national side is incredibly difficult . "

7 , club chairman karl-heinz rummenigge has leapt to his defense . " we are convinced jurgen is the right coach for bayern , " rummenigge told the club 's agm in munich on friday night after klinsmann received whistles before sunday 's bundesliga clash with schalke 04 in gelsenkirchen .
" he is a very modern and innovative coach , and we are convinced of the fact that we will celebrate plenty of successes with him . "
although bayern were fourth before sunday 's game , some bayern fans remain unconvinced klinsmann is the right man after munich 's poor start to the league which saw them 11th last month after defeat 's to werder bremen and hanover .
" we are already seeing improvement and his philosophy works , " insisted rummenigge .
" we can be confident of the future . "
bayern captain mark van bommel said the german giants feel the pressure at the munich club where failure is not an option .
" it is a requirement at bayern that we win titles , third place is not the goal , " said the dutch hard-man .
munich faces schalke without injured stars bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : podolski is nursing a back injury - from sitting too long ?
meanwhile , bayern will be without injured pair bastian schweinsteiger and lukas podolski against schalke as both are struggling with knocks received in last wednesday 's champions league 1-1 draw at fiorentina .
" lukas has back problems which makes his involvement not possible and bastian continues to suffer from the bruised leg he picked up against fiorentina , " said klinsmann on the bayern website .
but italian world cup winner luca toni is back in the team and the striker will play from the start .
klinsmann said germany defender philipp lahm is back in training after picking up an ankle injury a fortnight ago , but will not feature against schalke .
bayern 's argentina internationals meet maradona meanwhile , bayern 's argentine internationals martin demichelis and jose ernesto sosa admit they were impressed new national coach diego maradona flew to see them .
the pair met maradona in a munich hotel for nearly an hour on thursday as part of his tour of european-based players to discuss tactics in the run up to the 2010 world cup .
both players have both been called up for maradona 's first match in charge , the meeting with scotland on november 19 at hampden park , glasgow .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : new argentina coach maradona is on a world tour " he wanted to establish a personal relationship with us and outline his plans , " said said demichelis , who admitted maradona was a child-hood hero .
" i 've previously met maradona , but that 's the first time i 've spoken to him for any length of time .
that was a gift from football , and a moment i 'll never forget .
" his presence is enough to motivate you to new heights .
you ca n't ask for more than having the greatest idol and the last world cup winning coach come to munich just to see jose and me .
" around 80 argentine players are performing at the highest level with european clubs .
we could put out three or four strong teams .
making it into the national side is incredibly difficult . "
the fact that maradona came to munich solely to see demichelis and sosa was a sign of the duo 's importance , according to klinsmann .

by the time the rampage had ended , thousands of jewish homes , businesses and synagogues had been burned down or looted by thugs as police and fire brigades looked on . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the day after the night of broken glass " everything said about it is harmless compared to the reality of what actually happened , " said one berlin woman whose recollections are documented at the central jewish information office . another witness from dusseldorf described how jews , " dragged from their beds in pajamas and nightgowns , " were forced " to walk through the broken glass without any footwear . " more than 400 people were beaten to death , shot or driven to suicide , records show .
more than 30,000 were rounded up and packed off to concentration camps . the tyranny marked a turning point in the anti-semitic policies pursued after hitler took power in 1933 and which eventually led to the holocaust , the systematic state-sponsored killing of jews . new anti-semitism resolution adopted bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkl 's government agreed a new resolution against anti-semitism germany 's parliament adopted a resolution against anti-semitism to mark sunday 's 70th anniversary of the pogrom after a dispute over whether a far-left party should be included . chancellor angela merkel 's christian democrats lobbied to have the left excluded because of its cooperation with " extremists hostile to jews " - a reference to the palestinian movement hamas . merkel herself will represent the government at a remembrance ceremony held together with the central council of jews in germany at the country 's largest synagogue , located in berlin . built in 1904 , the ryke street synagogue was badly damaged in the 1938 pogrom , but was not burned down , apparently because the nazis feared damage would be caused to adjacent buildings . it was reopened in august 2007 after being restored to its original glory at a cost of $ 7 million . some 600,000 jews lived in germany before the war , but the figure declined to around 12,000 after 1945 .
today , there are more than 110,000 jews or people of jewish origin , giving germany one of the largest jewish populations of any country in europe . a growing mood of anti-semitism in germany despite a revival of jewish culture , there is a growing mood of anti-semitism in germany , according to the german-israeli society , which held its annual meeting over the weekend . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the national democratic party -lrb- npd -rrb- is accused of being anti-semitic and xenophobic figures disclosed by the government on tuesday showed there were nearly 800 anti-semitic crimes committed during the first nine months of this year , resulting in injuries to 27 people . among the events is being held in berlin and other cities to mark the anniversary of the pogrom is an exhibition called " it 's burning - anti-jewish terror in 1938 . " the display at the capital 's neue synagogue contains little known photographs that underscore the extent of the violence and the public humiliation of jews during the third reich . at the same time , the first museum to honor germans who helped jews survive nazi persecution during the holocaust has just opened in central berlin . on show are photographs , letters and other documents from more than 250 " silent heroes " who risked their lives by providing food , shelter and other assistance to jews from 1938-45 . seven decades on , an israeli journalist has been sifting for remnants of the night of broken glass in a rubbish dump an hour 's drive northeast of berlin in the german state of brandenburg . following a tip from locals , yaron svoray , 54 , discovered a bottle imprinted with a star of david and part of a backrest that might have been used in synagogues around that time . experts are expected to be called in to investigate the site in schorfheide , where hitler 's designated successor , hermann goering , maintained his country residence . dw staff -lrb- nda / sms -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" germany must , should and will take on responsibility , " she said .
but in remarks to supporters a day later , the limits to german willingness were clear .
germany has not forgotten an obama speech in berlin in june during which he called on the germans to take on more of the fighting burden in afghanistan , where german soldiers have rarely fought the taliban .
merkel told the youth section of her christian democratic union -lrb- cdu -rrb- that berlin would not accede to any request from the next us administration to send troops to southern afghanistan , the scene of most fighting .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel will give obama the same message as she gave bush " wherever germany commits itself , a wholeness of military and civilian assistance should be visible , " she said .
she would be able to tell obama that " just as well " as she had said it to president george w. bush .
german forces , the third-biggest component in the international security assistance force -lrb- isaf -rrb- , are based in safer northern afghanistan .
other armies have borne the brunt of the fighting in the south .
merkel may gain her chance to tell obama fairly soon when she attends a g20 summit in washington at the end of this week .
world leaders hope to see obama during their stay .
enthusiasm for obama has been huge in berlin most of this year : that helped ensure a crowd of 200,000 heard his speech in a city park on july 24 .
former defense minister expects pressure from obama the social democrats -lrb- spd -rrb- , the other main party in the merkel federal coalition , have claimed obama 's election as vindication for their own centre-left policies , but have also had an undertone of caution about afghanistan .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : obama is expected to ask for troops to help the us peter struck , who heads the spd parliamentary caucus and is a former german defense minister , told a sunday newspaper , bild am sonntag , he expected obama to seek more from nato and its european members .
but if obama requested german fighting troops in the south , " i would resist that most resolutely , " he said .
" there are limits . "
he said germany was already sending an extra 1,000 men to the north and offering advance-warning aircraft .
foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier , the social democrat who is to challenge merkel next year for the chancellorship , has already begun staking out that german position in diplomatic language .
he told a german newspaper , the hamburger abendblatt , on saturday that obama " highly appreciated " germany 's current contribution in afghanistan .
obama would not just seek more troops but also more reconstruction aid .
" we are very close to obama on this , " he said .
both merkel and steinmeier are driven on the troops issue by voter concerns about the afghan war .
german leaders wary as elections loom on horizon bildunterschrift : chancellor-candidate steinmeier is picking his words carefully on troop deployments with an election coming up in september , neither camp wants a surge in german casualties , including those from suicide attackers , to trigger a new round of anguish over the deployment .
surveys show most germans think the country is doing enough in afghanistan .
a forsa poll found 80 percent agree a us request for more troops should be refused and only 15 percent disagree .
however neither main party wants to upset obama at this stage by criticizing him .
the germans are eager to move forward with washington on many issues " in a spirit of togetherness , " merkel said .
she told the bild am sonntag on sunday those issues included " stabilizing afghanistan , " fixing the global financial crisis , fighting global warming and improving human rights .
steinmeier has already begun plans to demonstrate goodwill on another front , setting up plans to pay a call on the us-backed government in iraq next year and asking aides to draw up substantive aid plans for iraq .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de middle east -pipe- 09.11.2008 middle east quartet hears of progress from israel , palestinians großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : israeli foreign minister livni and palestinian president abbas said peace was still achievable wrapping up a briefing to the sponsors of the israeli-palestinian peace process , palestinian president mahmoud abbas and israeli foreign minister tzipi livni said sunday , november 9 they will keep negotiating . the news of continued negotiations comes as the peace process goes through a lull due to the political changes in the us and israel .
" we , both of us , affirmed that we will continue in these negotiations and that we will not stop even as israel prepares to go for elections , " abbas told a joint news conference with livni .
" our meetings will continue as usual , " he added .
for her part , livni said that the continued talks , aimed at forging an israeli-palestinian peace resulting in a palestinian state , would continue the framework agreed on at last year 's annapolis peace summit , when the sides agreed to rekindle the negotiations after a seven-year hiatus .
" the annapolis process serves the interest of both parties , the israeli and palestinian , " she said .
quartet pledges further support bildunterschrift : the middle east quartet - the us , eu , un and russia - offer its continued support the process ' sponsors - the so-called quartet of the us , russia , the european union and the united nations - said in a statement that they would continue their commitment supporting the parties efforts and also pledged to " respect the bilateral and confidential nature of the negotiations . "
renewed officially at the turn of the year , the negotiations , headed by livni for the israelis and former-premier ahmed quriea for the palestinians , have been conducted amid a virtual media blackout , with concomitant conflicting reports of the progress being made .
but according to an israeli foreign ministry communiqué , livni told the quartet sunday that " real and intensive progress " has been made , and the sides believed they had the elements , guiding principles and trust needed to create a good basis for a deal .
at annapolis abbas and israeli prime minister ehud olmert pledged to try and secure a treaty by the end of the year , but on thursday us secretary of state condoleezza rice conceded that this is unlikely to happen , as israel heads for elections early next year .
fears have also been expressed that the transition period in the us , as president-elect barack obama prepares to take office , may affect the momentum of the talks .
tough issues under negotiation bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : rice , solana and lavrov heard the report in sharm el-sheikh officials from both sides have said that it is proving difficult to reach agreement on the many tough issues that are under negotiations which include the future of east jerusalem , the fate of palestinian refugees , the borders and management of natural resources , especially water .
both israelis and palestinians say they need more time to agree .
east jerusalem is proving to be an especially tough issue to settle , and an israeli trial balloon , to conclude a partial agreement without it , was quickly shot down by the palestinians .
in sharm el-sheikh on sunday , neither livni nor abbas expressed any indication of how much longer the two sides would need to conclude an agreement according to the annapolis framework , but both agreed and said that nothing is done until it is actually done .
abbas and livni did not take any questions from the press .
however , speaking privately their aides said that each side was more or less satisfied with the outcome of the sharm el-sheikh meeting .
the israelis said that they were pleased with the consensus they have with the palestinians and the international community as represented in the quartet to " stick to the annapolis process " .
" it is important that we do n't keep seeing new initiatives being offered every day .
this will complicate matters , " said one israeli source who spoke on condition of anonymity to the dpa news agency .
livni had called on the international community not to intervene in the talks by submitting " bridging proposals and initiatives which do not suit reality . "
the palestinians said they were also pleased with the understanding the quartet demonstrated for their determination to secure a comprehensive settlement .
" we can not go back to our people with bits and pieces .
the palestinians have suffered for a long time and now they want to see the final peace deal and their state , " said a palestinian source , who asked not to be named .
israel also received more assurances from the palestinians , the egyptian host of the meeting and the quartet members that all efforts will be duly exerted to observe their security concerns , diplomatic sources said .
envoy blair promises continued economic aid bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : quartet envoy blair said funding would continue the palestinians received promises that economic aid will be sustained .
tony blair , the quartet envoy to the middle east , who is in charge of observing the flow of international financial aid to the palestinians said sunday that he would continue to work for the support of palestinian economy and for the upgrade of palestinian security .
the palestinians , however , did not get a mechanism they demanded , to be in charge of following up on israeli commitments to ease economic and security sanctions on palestinian territories .
un secretary-general ban ki-moon said sunday in a press conference that " the quartet is the mechanism . " dpa news agency -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" he is a very modern and innovative coach , and we are convinced of the fact that we will celebrate plenty of successes with him . "

7 , club chairman karl-heinz rummenigge has leapt to his defense . " we are convinced jurgen is the right coach for bayern , " rummenigge told the club 's agm in munich on friday night after klinsmann received whistles before sunday 's bundesliga clash with schalke 04 in gelsenkirchen .
" he is a very modern and innovative coach , and we are convinced of the fact that we will celebrate plenty of successes with him . "
although bayern were fourth before sunday 's game , some bayern fans remain unconvinced klinsmann is the right man after munich 's poor start to the league which saw them 11th last month after defeat 's to werder bremen and hanover .
" we are already seeing improvement and his philosophy works , " insisted rummenigge .
" we can be confident of the future . "
bayern captain mark van bommel said the german giants feel the pressure at the munich club where failure is not an option .
" it is a requirement at bayern that we win titles , third place is not the goal , " said the dutch hard-man .
munich faces schalke without injured stars bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : podolski is nursing a back injury - from sitting too long ?
meanwhile , bayern will be without injured pair bastian schweinsteiger and lukas podolski against schalke as both are struggling with knocks received in last wednesday 's champions league 1-1 draw at fiorentina .
" lukas has back problems which makes his involvement not possible and bastian continues to suffer from the bruised leg he picked up against fiorentina , " said klinsmann on the bayern website .
but italian world cup winner luca toni is back in the team and the striker will play from the start .
klinsmann said germany defender philipp lahm is back in training after picking up an ankle injury a fortnight ago , but will not feature against schalke .

the pair met maradona in a munich hotel for nearly an hour on thursday as part of his tour of european-based players to discuss tactics in the run up to the 2010 world cup .
both players have both been called up for maradona 's first match in charge , the meeting with scotland on november 19 at hampden park , glasgow .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : new argentina coach maradona is on a world tour " he wanted to establish a personal relationship with us and outline his plans , " said said demichelis , who admitted maradona was a child-hood hero .
" i 've previously met maradona , but that 's the first time i 've spoken to him for any length of time .
that was a gift from football , and a moment i 'll never forget .
" his presence is enough to motivate you to new heights .
you ca n't ask for more than having the greatest idol and the last world cup winning coach come to munich just to see jose and me .
" around 80 argentine players are performing at the highest level with european clubs .
we could put out three or four strong teams .
making it into the national side is incredibly difficult . "
the fact that maradona came to munich solely to see demichelis and sosa was a sign of the duo 's importance , according to klinsmann .

munich faces schalke without injured stars bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : podolski is nursing a back injury - from sitting too long ?
meanwhile , bayern will be without injured pair bastian schweinsteiger and lukas podolski against schalke as both are struggling with knocks received in last wednesday 's champions league 1-1 draw at fiorentina .
" lukas has back problems which makes his involvement not possible and bastian continues to suffer from the bruised leg he picked up against fiorentina , " said klinsmann on the bayern website .
but italian world cup winner luca toni is back in the team and the striker will play from the start .
klinsmann said germany defender philipp lahm is back in training after picking up an ankle injury a fortnight ago , but will not feature against schalke .
bayern 's argentina internationals meet maradona meanwhile , bayern 's argentine internationals martin demichelis and jose ernesto sosa admit they were impressed new national coach diego maradona flew to see them .
the pair met maradona in a munich hotel for nearly an hour on thursday as part of his tour of european-based players to discuss tactics in the run up to the 2010 world cup .
both players have both been called up for maradona 's first match in charge , the meeting with scotland on november 19 at hampden park , glasgow .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : new argentina coach maradona is on a world tour " he wanted to establish a personal relationship with us and outline his plans , " said said demichelis , who admitted maradona was a child-hood hero .
" i 've previously met maradona , but that 's the first time i 've spoken to him for any length of time .
that was a gift from football , and a moment i 'll never forget .
" his presence is enough to motivate you to new heights .
you ca n't ask for more than having the greatest idol and the last world cup winning coach come to munich just to see jose and me .
" around 80 argentine players are performing at the highest level with european clubs .
we could put out three or four strong teams .
making it into the national side is incredibly difficult . "
the fact that maradona came to munich solely to see demichelis and sosa was a sign of the duo 's importance , according to klinsmann .
" he 's doing what i did four years ago , " said ex-germany boss klinsmann , who also sought early contact with his best players after taking the national hot seat in 2004 . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

9 , at a berlin ceremony to recall a 1938 pogrom against jewish residents of germany . " indifference is the first step towards endangering essential values , " merkel said during germany 's national memorial ceremony at the old synagogue in berlin 's rykestrasse .
" xenophobia , racism and anti-semitism must never be given an opportunity in europe again . " she added that germany needs to encourage moral courage in the face of racism and anti-semitism . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel said germans must not be indifferent to xenophobia , racism or anti-semitism " there was no storm of protest against the nazi , but silence , shrugged shoulders and people looking away - from individual citizens to large parts of the church , " she said .
" we can not be silent , we can not be indifferent when jewish cemeteries are desecrated and rabbis are insulted on the street . " it is a mistake to think it does n't affect you when your neighbors are affected , " merkel added .
" this mistake just leads us further and further into evil . " in an annual symbol of how jewish life is flowering again in germany , yet another community opened a synagogue on sunday . the building is a half-timbered village synagogue that was in use from 1825 to 1937 and was carefully moved to its new site in the central city of goettingen and renovated . in another city , speyer , the jewish community was laying the foundation stone for a new synagogue . pope recalls horror of kristallnacht bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : pope benedict spoke of a deep solidarity with the jews pope benedict , who is german , spoke out after public prayers sunday in rome on the horrific legacy of the 1938 violence . he said vigilance was needed against anti-semitism and every form of discrimination .
he said he spoke " in deep solidarity with the jewish world . " at the national ceremony , in the synagogue first opened in 1904 in berlin 's rykestrasse and re-inaugurated two years ago , emotion overwhelmed charlotte knobloch , 76 , president of germany 's central council of jews . she recalled being led through munich as a child by her father and seeing the destruction and indifferent lookers-on in 1938 . at the end of her speech , she sobbed for a moment before she could read her closing line , based on a remark by henrik mandelbaum , who survived the nazis ' auschwitz death camp . " i beg you not to ever let anyone talk you into whom you have to love and whom you have to hate , " she said . the late november 9 , 1938 pogrom , a precursor to the holocaust , ultimately led to more than 1,300 deaths from injuries , by suicide or in concentration camps , official historians have said . vicious pogrom a precursor for holocaust flames leapt into the sky across germany when the nazis gave a foretaste of the holocaust in the vicious pogrom against the jewish community .
by the time the rampage had ended , thousands of jewish homes , businesses and synagogues had been burned down or looted by thugs as police and fire brigades looked on . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the day after the night of broken glass " everything said about it is harmless compared to the reality of what actually happened , " said one berlin woman whose recollections are documented at the central jewish information office . another witness from dusseldorf described how jews , " dragged from their beds in pajamas and nightgowns , " were forced " to walk through the broken glass without any footwear . " more than 400 people were beaten to death , shot or driven to suicide , records show .
more than 30,000 were rounded up and packed off to concentration camps . the tyranny marked a turning point in the anti-semitic policies pursued after hitler took power in 1933 and which eventually led to the holocaust , the systematic state-sponsored killing of jews . new anti-semitism resolution adopted bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkl 's government agreed a new resolution against anti-semitism germany 's parliament adopted a resolution against anti-semitism to mark sunday 's 70th anniversary of the pogrom after a dispute over whether a far-left party should be included . chancellor angela merkel 's christian democrats lobbied to have the left excluded because of its cooperation with " extremists hostile to jews " - a reference to the palestinian movement hamas . merkel herself will represent the government at a remembrance ceremony held together with the central council of jews in germany at the country 's largest synagogue , located in berlin . built in 1904 , the ryke street synagogue was badly damaged in the 1938 pogrom , but was not burned down , apparently because the nazis feared damage would be caused to adjacent buildings . it was reopened in august 2007 after being restored to its original glory at a cost of $ 7 million . some 600,000 jews lived in germany before the war , but the figure declined to around 12,000 after 1945 .
today , there are more than 110,000 jews or people of jewish origin , giving germany one of the largest jewish populations of any country in europe . a growing mood of anti-semitism in germany despite a revival of jewish culture , there is a growing mood of anti-semitism in germany , according to the german-israeli society , which held its annual meeting over the weekend . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the national democratic party -lrb- npd -rrb- is accused of being anti-semitic and xenophobic figures disclosed by the government on tuesday showed there were nearly 800 anti-semitic crimes committed during the first nine months of this year , resulting in injuries to 27 people . among the events is being held in berlin and other cities to mark the anniversary of the pogrom is an exhibition called " it 's burning - anti-jewish terror in 1938 . " the display at the capital 's neue synagogue contains little known photographs that underscore the extent of the violence and the public humiliation of jews during the third reich . at the same time , the first museum to honor germans who helped jews survive nazi persecution during the holocaust has just opened in central berlin . on show are photographs , letters and other documents from more than 250 " silent heroes " who risked their lives by providing food , shelter and other assistance to jews from 1938-45 . seven decades on , an israeli journalist has been sifting for remnants of the night of broken glass in a rubbish dump an hour 's drive northeast of berlin in the german state of brandenburg . following a tip from locals , yaron svoray , 54 , discovered a bottle imprinted with a star of david and part of a backrest that might have been used in synagogues around that time . experts are expected to be called in to investigate the site in schorfheide , where hitler 's designated successor , hermann goering , maintained his country residence . dw staff -lrb- nda / sms -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" we , both of us , affirmed that we will continue in these negotiations and that we will not stop even as israel prepares to go for elections , " abbas told a joint news conference with livni .
" our meetings will continue as usual , " he added .
for her part , livni said that the continued talks , aimed at forging an israeli-palestinian peace resulting in a palestinian state , would continue the framework agreed on at last year 's annapolis peace summit , when the sides agreed to rekindle the negotiations after a seven-year hiatus .
" the annapolis process serves the interest of both parties , the israeli and palestinian , " she said .
quartet pledges further support bildunterschrift : the middle east quartet - the us , eu , un and russia - offer its continued support the process ' sponsors - the so-called quartet of the us , russia , the european union and the united nations - said in a statement that they would continue their commitment supporting the parties efforts and also pledged to " respect the bilateral and confidential nature of the negotiations . "
renewed officially at the turn of the year , the negotiations , headed by livni for the israelis and former-premier ahmed quriea for the palestinians , have been conducted amid a virtual media blackout , with concomitant conflicting reports of the progress being made .
but according to an israeli foreign ministry communiqué , livni told the quartet sunday that " real and intensive progress " has been made , and the sides believed they had the elements , guiding principles and trust needed to create a good basis for a deal .
at annapolis abbas and israeli prime minister ehud olmert pledged to try and secure a treaty by the end of the year , but on thursday us secretary of state condoleezza rice conceded that this is unlikely to happen , as israel heads for elections early next year .
fears have also been expressed that the transition period in the us , as president-elect barack obama prepares to take office , may affect the momentum of the talks .
tough issues under negotiation bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : rice , solana and lavrov heard the report in sharm el-sheikh officials from both sides have said that it is proving difficult to reach agreement on the many tough issues that are under negotiations which include the future of east jerusalem , the fate of palestinian refugees , the borders and management of natural resources , especially water .
both israelis and palestinians say they need more time to agree .
east jerusalem is proving to be an especially tough issue to settle , and an israeli trial balloon , to conclude a partial agreement without it , was quickly shot down by the palestinians .
in sharm el-sheikh on sunday , neither livni nor abbas expressed any indication of how much longer the two sides would need to conclude an agreement according to the annapolis framework , but both agreed and said that nothing is done until it is actually done .
abbas and livni did not take any questions from the press .

" we , both of us , affirmed that we will continue in these negotiations and that we will not stop even as israel prepares to go for elections , " abbas told a joint news conference with livni .
" our meetings will continue as usual , " he added .
for her part , livni said that the continued talks , aimed at forging an israeli-palestinian peace resulting in a palestinian state , would continue the framework agreed on at last year 's annapolis peace summit , when the sides agreed to rekindle the negotiations after a seven-year hiatus .
" the annapolis process serves the interest of both parties , the israeli and palestinian , " she said .
quartet pledges further support bildunterschrift : the middle east quartet - the us , eu , un and russia - offer its continued support the process ' sponsors - the so-called quartet of the us , russia , the european union and the united nations - said in a statement that they would continue their commitment supporting the parties efforts and also pledged to " respect the bilateral and confidential nature of the negotiations . "
renewed officially at the turn of the year , the negotiations , headed by livni for the israelis and former-premier ahmed quriea for the palestinians , have been conducted amid a virtual media blackout , with concomitant conflicting reports of the progress being made .
but according to an israeli foreign ministry communiqué , livni told the quartet sunday that " real and intensive progress " has been made , and the sides believed they had the elements , guiding principles and trust needed to create a good basis for a deal .
at annapolis abbas and israeli prime minister ehud olmert pledged to try and secure a treaty by the end of the year , but on thursday us secretary of state condoleezza rice conceded that this is unlikely to happen , as israel heads for elections early next year .
fears have also been expressed that the transition period in the us , as president-elect barack obama prepares to take office , may affect the momentum of the talks .
tough issues under negotiation bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : rice , solana and lavrov heard the report in sharm el-sheikh officials from both sides have said that it is proving difficult to reach agreement on the many tough issues that are under negotiations which include the future of east jerusalem , the fate of palestinian refugees , the borders and management of natural resources , especially water .
both israelis and palestinians say they need more time to agree .
east jerusalem is proving to be an especially tough issue to settle , and an israeli trial balloon , to conclude a partial agreement without it , was quickly shot down by the palestinians .
in sharm el-sheikh on sunday , neither livni nor abbas expressed any indication of how much longer the two sides would need to conclude an agreement according to the annapolis framework , but both agreed and said that nothing is done until it is actually done .
abbas and livni did not take any questions from the press .
however , speaking privately their aides said that each side was more or less satisfied with the outcome of the sharm el-sheikh meeting .

east jerusalem is proving to be an especially tough issue to settle , and an israeli trial balloon , to conclude a partial agreement without it , was quickly shot down by the palestinians .
in sharm el-sheikh on sunday , neither livni nor abbas expressed any indication of how much longer the two sides would need to conclude an agreement according to the annapolis framework , but both agreed and said that nothing is done until it is actually done .
abbas and livni did not take any questions from the press .
however , speaking privately their aides said that each side was more or less satisfied with the outcome of the sharm el-sheikh meeting .
the israelis said that they were pleased with the consensus they have with the palestinians and the international community as represented in the quartet to " stick to the annapolis process " .
" it is important that we do n't keep seeing new initiatives being offered every day .
this will complicate matters , " said one israeli source who spoke on condition of anonymity to the dpa news agency .
livni had called on the international community not to intervene in the talks by submitting " bridging proposals and initiatives which do not suit reality . "
the palestinians said they were also pleased with the understanding the quartet demonstrated for their determination to secure a comprehensive settlement .
" we can not go back to our people with bits and pieces .
the palestinians have suffered for a long time and now they want to see the final peace deal and their state , " said a palestinian source , who asked not to be named .
israel also received more assurances from the palestinians , the egyptian host of the meeting and the quartet members that all efforts will be duly exerted to observe their security concerns , diplomatic sources said .

" we , both of us , affirmed that we will continue in these negotiations and that we will not stop even as israel prepares to go for elections , " abbas told a joint news conference with livni .
" our meetings will continue as usual , " he added .
for her part , livni said that the continued talks , aimed at forging an israeli-palestinian peace resulting in a palestinian state , would continue the framework agreed on at last year 's annapolis peace summit , when the sides agreed to rekindle the negotiations after a seven-year hiatus .
" the annapolis process serves the interest of both parties , the israeli and palestinian , " she said .
quartet pledges further support bildunterschrift : the middle east quartet - the us , eu , un and russia - offer its continued support the process ' sponsors - the so-called quartet of the us , russia , the european union and the united nations - said in a statement that they would continue their commitment supporting the parties efforts and also pledged to " respect the bilateral and confidential nature of the negotiations . "
renewed officially at the turn of the year , the negotiations , headed by livni for the israelis and former-premier ahmed quriea for the palestinians , have been conducted amid a virtual media blackout , with concomitant conflicting reports of the progress being made .
but according to an israeli foreign ministry communiqué , livni told the quartet sunday that " real and intensive progress " has been made , and the sides believed they had the elements , guiding principles and trust needed to create a good basis for a deal .
at annapolis abbas and israeli prime minister ehud olmert pledged to try and secure a treaty by the end of the year , but on thursday us secretary of state condoleezza rice conceded that this is unlikely to happen , as israel heads for elections early next year .
fears have also been expressed that the transition period in the us , as president-elect barack obama prepares to take office , may affect the momentum of the talks .

but this is where the city 's young fashion scene pulsates in row after row of designer shops . the area near the hackesche hoefe in the mitte district has become so well-known in the fashion world that it has boosted berlin 's reputation as one of europe 's most important fashion centers to a position on par with paris , milan and london . tourists who explore the area just north of downtown berlin will find that they can both admire the newest styles and buy them . reunification marked revival bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the districts of prenzlauer berg and friedrichshain are also fashion meccas " berlin 's fashion scene has a very long tradition .
it was already enigmatic and glamorous at the beginning of the 20th century , " said fashion journalist and book author nadine barth .
but this culture was destroyed by world war ii , and berlin , as a divided city , did not rebound from the blow .
that finally changed in 1989 . " the fall of the berlin wall strengthened the city 's arts community and reproduced the modern , sizzling , creative fashion scene , " said barth . michael michalsky - one of the big new names in german fashion - moved to berlin a few years ago .
michalsky has his own stores featuring his own collection and his name is associated with many top brands . " right now there 's no city more interesting than berlin , " said michalsky .
" berlin is not only the heart of new europe , but also an indicator of new social trends , which is important for the fashion world . " art schools have responded to the trend bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : british fashion guru vivienne westwood taught in berlin that 's a fact also recognized by berlin 's schools , which in recent years have founded numerous fashion study programs .
vivienne westwood taught for a long time at berlin university of the arts and students at the fashion school esmod profit from the city 's international networks spanning the world of fashion .
this school attracts young designers who stay in berlin after finishing their education . one of the best examples of this is sisi wasabi , a label with a mix of casual street clothes and elements borrowed from traditional german costumes .
berlin is not just a place to work for zerlina von dem bussche , owner of the sisi wasabi label . " berlin is a city that is tremendously inspiring through incessant change , " said von dem bussche . berlin draws fashion industry names bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : berlin now has its very own fashion week this boom in creativity has led even names that really count in the fashion industry to stalk the city .
events like berlin fashion week attract thousands of people who work in the fashion industry .
as a result berlin is not just a place where fashion is created , but also a place where it is vigorously bought and sold . tourists have taken notice .
they do n't have to search long because the large renowned stores have discovered new berlin fashion also .
galeries lafayette , in the friedrich street , is the ritzy offshoot of the same-named parisian department store and has set aside a corner for young designers . visitors to the upper floors find berlinomat where the latest styles in belts , bags , shirts and evening wear by various designers are available amid black lacquered walls .
but the biggest fashion discovery is the area around the hackesche hoefe .
while many tourists simply stroll in awe through the courtyard shopping area , fashion conscious visitors find clothes like no other here . " the area is a fashion bermuda triangle , " said barth , comparing the mysterious geographical region in the atlantic ocean to the shape formed by alte schoenhauser , mulack and rosenthaler streets form on the city map . the hackesche hoefe makes for an ideal starting point for a fashion tour of the area .
just behind the cinema is a store called berlinerklamotten that offers more than just a single designer 's line .
in fact about 140 fashion designers are represented on the ground floor of the factory-like building . every table and every rack has a different notion of fashion .
there are shiny sack purses reminiscent of the kind seen in children 's books , t-shirts with filigree motifs of the city , casual woolen jackets and colorfully-patterned overshirts . prices can be described as halfway toward moderate : about 40 euros -lrb- $ 52 -rrb- will buy you an unusual top and a unique pair of trousers cost around 120 euros . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : berlin label miroike showcased its work at the 2008 show anyone in the mood for a more extensive shopping spree should walk down neue schoenhauser street to where it turns into alte schoenhauser street .
wander past the dozens of stores there and then turn left onto mulack street .
there 's also one young designer store after another here .
in bless , for example , the collections are numbered like art objects , in van reimersdahl there are prints and lala berlin has knitted hats , scarves and hand warmers .
at some point , turn left onto rosenthaler street and go south toward the city center to complete the triangle . dpa news agency -lrb- jg -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the car lurches to a halt in the usual tangle of traffic during morning rush hour in kabul .
out of the window , i see sights that no longer surprise me : a man stripping furred skin from a hanging calf , blood pouring into a pool on the uneven road .
on a table nearby lie a neat row of severed , yellowing , animal hooves .
the beaten-up car in front of me bulges with cauliflowers , stacked high in the boot , on its way to market .
but if i look up , i see the majestic mountains that encircle the city , already dusted with the first snows .
the mountains reach around the city with a protective clasp , perhaps holding in this expanding metropolis , perhaps trying to hold back the erupting violence .
in less than two weeks , there have been more than two abductions of foreigners from the very heart of the city , the murder of a young british woman on her way to work , the shooting of two dhl employees in a criminal attack , and a suicide bomb at the ministry of culture , as well as countless other acts of crime on ordinary afghans .
these frightening events are happening all around me , and there is an increasing sense that it could be me , this time , next time , another time .
soon .
how far am i from the film-sequence that we all imagine and dread ?
yet i remain sanguine .
i grew up in london and i know that the underbelly of all big cities seethes with crime and violence .
although foreign deaths and fears steal the headlines , the impact of a corrupt and almost lawless state is far greater on the afghan people , who are trying to rebuild their lives yet again .
despite foreign billions , the electricity sputters on and off , unpredictably , across the city , and most roads are rubble and holes .
accomplished drivers enjoy the slalom .
there are police check-points at almost every central interchange , but nobody has much faith in the local police .
they 'll take your money quicker than protect your money .
and not far away , less than 15 miles out of the city , there is a war , or several wars , in which many foreign troops , including my compatriots , and far too many afghans , are dying daily .
it 's remembrance sunday , and yet the british parades , sombre suits and respectful radio monotone of david dimbleby seem so far away from here .
people talk of war memorials and remembering the dead in new peace-building and reconciliation initiatives , but here it 's hard to memorialise the dead when death lurks around every corner , and every morning there is somebody new to be mourned .
instead each day rolls forward , chaotically , with cauliflowers in car boots , sheep sifting through rubbish heaps , traffic jams and hot tempers , observed by the still mountains , kabul 's immutable witnesses .
and if i am lucky i will suddenly see the balloon man glide by , an unintentional symbol of hope .
a man on a bicycle , bobbing along the road , one arm holding a cloud of brightly coloured orbs , framed by the clear blue sky .

susanna miller , whose brother dan was killed in the attacks , said the execution transformed the men into martyrs , making " a mockery of justice . "
imam samudra , amrozi nurhasyim and ali ghufron -lrb- mukhlas -rrb- were shot at 0015 -lrb- 1715 gmt on saturday -rrb- , officials said .
they were convicted of planning attacks on nightclubs in the resort of kuta .
' mockery of justice ' ms miller , who is a member of the bali bombings victims ' group , said : " justice is supposed to have two strands to it .
one is to pay recompense for the crime committed and the other is a deterrent .
" if you undermine the deterrent by effectively encouraging , allowing these people to be seen as martyrs and encouraging the islamist cause , then no it makes a mockery of justice . "
she told the bbc : " can we be clear ?
they did n't kill my brother ...
they were secondary to the bombing plot and the most important person in relation to the plot is currently held in guantanamo bay . "
the executions of the bali bombers may create martyrs whose memory risks increasing support and recruitment to their cause sam zarifi , amnesty international indonesia executes bali bombers ms miller pointed out that the only member of the ira commonly remembered in england is bobby sands , who killed himself by hunger strike .
tobias ellwood mp , who lost his brother jonathan , 37 , in the attacks , said there were still questions that needed to be answered before he could put the memory of his brother to rest .
firstly , he said. there had been no explanation as to why hambali , the attacks ' mastermind , who is currently held at guantanamo bay , had not been brought to trial .
secondly , it was unacceptable that no british citizens affected by the attack had been paid compensation by the uk government , despite the fact that compensation was given to victims of the 7/7 attacks in london - he went on .
' horrific atrocity ' and thirdly , mr ellwood said that despite mi5 intelligence ahead of the bombings , the threat level for bali was not changed .
" the threat level to british citizens should have been raised to ' high ' ...
failure to update the threat level meant many travel plans , including my brother 's , went unchanged , " mr ellwood said .
amnesty international condemned the executions .
sam zarifi , the organisation 's asia-pacific director , said : " the bali bombers perpetrated a horrific atrocity but to continue to cycle of violence through state sanctioned killings is to answer the violation of human rights with further violations . "
he said amnesty recognised the need to bring criminals to justice , but that it was not clear that capital punishment was an effective deterrent .
reprisal concerns mr zarifi added that in fact : " the executions of the bali bombers may create martyrs whose memory risks increasing support and recruitment to their cause . "
the three men were shot at the island prison of nusakambangan , officials said .
the bbc 's lucy williamson , in cilacap , near the prison , says the execution took place in the darkness surrounded by forest and with a handful of witnesses .
later , a spokesman for the attorney-general 's office confirmed that the three men had been shot .
security forces are on alert across the country amid fears of reprisal attacks .
but according to our correspondent , the deaths will not evoke much sympathy in indonesia , where most people supported the sentence and believed the executions should have been carried out much sooner .
