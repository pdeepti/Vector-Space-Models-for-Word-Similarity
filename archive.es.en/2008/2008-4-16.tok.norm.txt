according to the latest reports from the newsmagazine that broke the story about lidl , it 's happening at companies all over germany . german news weekly stern reported on wednesday that invasive employee monitoring is common practice at other retailers , including penny , netto , norma , edeka , plus , rewe , hagebau and famila .
as was the case with lidl , the retailers routinely printed up pages of notes detailing intimate aspects of their employee 's lives . the magazine said that , nationwide , detective agencies have sprung up which specialize in helping employers spy on their staff , including " detailed written observation reports . " stern quoted the manager of a supermarket discounter who said that the detective agencies are extremely competitive . " many try to set themselves apart by offering additional services , " the manager was quoted as saying .
" i was offered such protocols more times than i can count . " the manager confirmed that spying efforts were intensified when there were suspicions that certain employees were attempting to organize a union . " every measure is used in order to prevent a works council from forming , " the source told stern . workers outside the retail sector also have reason to fear for their privacy .

but some politicians doubt whether the proposed law meets strict rules mandated by the country 's highest court . germany 's social democrats -lrb- spd -rrb- parliamentary group said it would not blindly pass a law formulating new guidelines for the surveillance of personal computers in cases of suspected terrorism or other serious crimes . " we are going to carefully review whether the legislative draft corresponds with the restrictive parameters laid out by germany 's constitutional court , and reserve the right to veto , " the group 's expert on domestic affairs , klaus-uwe benneter , told the daily berliner zeitung on wednesday , april 16 . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : authorities wo n't be allowed to handle suspects ' computers to install spy software he said regular , careful monitoring would have to occur to ensure that the proposed law is properly applied .
he also said those who have been under surveillance must also be informed that their computers were examined . staying the course germany 's christian democrats -lrb- cdu -rrb- , with whom the social democrats are in a ruling coalition , have called on the spd to agree to the guidelines .
wolfgang bosbach , the cdu 's deputy parliamentary leader , told the newspaper , " when the spd continues to stir things up , people would begin throwing up their hands in frustration - they would n't understand it . " bosbach said the cdu had already met the spd half-way .
interior minister wolfgang schauble , a cdu member , had already conceded by revoking his wish to allow police to enter suspects ' apartments to install spy software on their computers , bosbach told public broadcaster ard tuesday evening . the spd had rejected that measure , which did not make it into the final version of the proposed law . opposition parties also issued their displeasure with the proposal . " piece by piece , our privacy is obviously dying , " green party member hans-christian stroebele told ard . only under special circumstances in february , the nation 's highest court established that the privacy of data stored or exchanged on personal computers is a basic right protected by the constitution ; surveillance is therefore permitted only in exceptional cases . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the cdu 's bosbach said the spd should stay the agreed-to course interior minister wolfgang schaeuble and justice minister brigitte zypries said on tuesday that they had agreed on the new framework to conform with that legal ruling from the court . it was the last hurdle in putting together new guidelines for germany 's domestic intelligence services , which will now be sent to the country 's states for further discussion . schaeuble 's spokesperson said that once the drafted law had gone to the states , it could then be presented to the cabinet before the summer recess . dw staff -lrb- als -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

there 's a strong sense here that together , the united states and the catholic church overcame communism .
john paul ii is particularly admired .
his election is seen in relation to solidarnosc in poland , gorbachev , the fall of the berlin wall , a unified europe and victory over the warsaw pact . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : michael schapfel is pastor to german-speaking christians in washington greater washington is home to a very traditional church for german standards .
it takes its cue from rome and listens to what is said there .
the community was very happy about the election of the new pope , and is now waiting to see what message he brings to the united states . is the fact that pope benedict xvi is a german particularly important for the german congregation in washington ? yes , it plays a big role for a lot of our people .
many of them come from bavaria and even the region where he was born .
but the pope is n't coming to the usa to visit us germans .
the german congregation in washington does not have a special role to play in the visit . what is the make-up of your congregation ? there 's quite a large , lively community of german-speaking catholics in washington .
it 's mainly made up of two different groups .
there are those people who have worked here for many years or even decades , or who 've married someone here or plan on spending the rest of their lives here .
then there are those who are only here for a few years .
that group is mostly diplomats , army personnel or business people .

the catholic church is universal .
the celebration of mass , the sacraments and the teachings are the same all over the world .
only the language is different .
but in comparison to other local american churches , people often say they find our german community more relaxed , open , and maybe more strongly family and youth-oriented .
but that comes from the fact that our community has a different age structure . what is your view on ecumenism ? american catholics always notice how we germans see it as natural for catholics and other christians to be in touch with each other , visit each other and take part in events together .
and here in our community , ecumenism is perhaps even more pronounced than it is in germany , because the local german congregation does n't want to separate everything according to confession .
the close relationship between catholic and protestant christians has a lot to do with our history .

but what are the real prospects ? maliki spent the morning of wednesday , april 16 , conferring with various eu officials . " we do hope this meeting will result in new steps of cooperation between iraq and eu countries , especially regarding contributing to our oil and gas sectors , " al-maliki said . the eu is , after the us , the second-largest importer of iraqi oil and natural gas .
but despite the country 's immense natural resources , iraq 's energy sector is still struggling to recover from years of sanctions and damage wrought by war - including , of course , the us-led invasion of 2003 . eu officials welcomed al-maliki 's remarks . " regardless of what attitudes one held at the beginning of the iraq war , we now have a joint duty to contribute to the establishment of a peaceful and democratic iraq , " said eu parliament president hans-gert poettering after meeting the prime minister . and the head of the european commission jose manuel barroso said a deal may not take long .
" it 's only a matter of some weeks i believe to conclude these negotiations , " barroso told reporters at a joint press conference with al-maliki .
" there are already very concrete details now . "
pipeline plans bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the eu needs reliable supplies for a planned pipeline through turkey the eu 's interest in iraq goes well beyond idealistic talk about peace and democracy .
brussels is looking to the country to help diversify its own energy supplies - in particular for its planned nabucco pipeline from turkey to austria . the eu hopes that the pipeline , which is scheduled to come online in 2013 , will help ease its dependency on russia , from which the bloc currently gets roughly a quarter of its natural gas . but in order for the pipeline to be commercially viable , the eu must ensure it receives sufficient supplies of gas from the middle east .
russia is skeptical about the bloc 's ability to do that . " the only way to fill nabucco is to rely on iranian gas , " russia 's ambassador to the eu , vladimir chizov , told reporters ahead of al-maliki 's visit .
" but then it 's up to west to make up its mind how to deal with iran - either bomb iran or buy its gas . " but the eu hopes that iraq will become politically stable enough to connect up gas fields in the west of the country , enabling baghdad to supply gas to nabucco . al-maliki told eu parliamentarians on wednesday that iraq 's policy of national reconciliation was proving a success and that he did not expect a sudden withdrawal of us forces , which might plunge iraq into chaos . he also that his country would soon pass long-awaited national gas and oil legislation that could provide the legal framework for closer ties between iraq and the eu on energy . dw staff -lrb- jc -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

but what are the real prospects ? maliki spent the morning of wednesday , april 16 , conferring with various eu officials . " we do hope this meeting will result in new steps of cooperation between iraq and eu countries , especially regarding contributing to our oil and gas sectors , " al-maliki said . the eu is , after the us , the second-largest importer of iraqi oil and natural gas .
but despite the country 's immense natural resources , iraq 's energy sector is still struggling to recover from years of sanctions and damage wrought by war - including , of course , the us-led invasion of 2003 . eu officials welcomed al-maliki 's remarks . " regardless of what attitudes one held at the beginning of the iraq war , we now have a joint duty to contribute to the establishment of a peaceful and democratic iraq , " said eu parliament president hans-gert poettering after meeting the prime minister . and the head of the european commission jose manuel barroso said a deal may not take long .
" it 's only a matter of some weeks i believe to conclude these negotiations , " barroso told reporters at a joint press conference with al-maliki .
" there are already very concrete details now . "
pipeline plans bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the eu needs reliable supplies for a planned pipeline through turkey the eu 's interest in iraq goes well beyond idealistic talk about peace and democracy .
brussels is looking to the country to help diversify its own energy supplies - in particular for its planned nabucco pipeline from turkey to austria . the eu hopes that the pipeline , which is scheduled to come online in 2013 , will help ease its dependency on russia , from which the bloc currently gets roughly a quarter of its natural gas . but in order for the pipeline to be commercially viable , the eu must ensure it receives sufficient supplies of gas from the middle east .
russia is skeptical about the bloc 's ability to do that . " the only way to fill nabucco is to rely on iranian gas , " russia 's ambassador to the eu , vladimir chizov , told reporters ahead of al-maliki 's visit .
" but then it 's up to west to make up its mind how to deal with iran - either bomb iran or buy its gas . " but the eu hopes that iraq will become politically stable enough to connect up gas fields in the west of the country , enabling baghdad to supply gas to nabucco . al-maliki told eu parliamentarians on wednesday that iraq 's policy of national reconciliation was proving a success and that he did not expect a sudden withdrawal of us forces , which might plunge iraq into chaos . he also that his country would soon pass long-awaited national gas and oil legislation that could provide the legal framework for closer ties between iraq and the eu on energy . dw staff -lrb- jc -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de iraq -pipe- 16.04.2008 bundestag to examine us-german intelligence fiasco on iraq großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : an iraqi refugee to germany with the codename " curveball " provided false info about iraq on april 23 , a committee of german lawmakers will examine how false information passed on by the german intelligence service helped the us justify the war in iraq .
dw-world.de spoke with the committee 's vice chairman . earlier this month , the german news magazine der spiegel published a series of articles revealing that a german source was behind erroneous information about mobile chemical weapons factories in iraq under saddam hussein . the information , famously used by colin powell in his 2003 speech to the un laying out the bush administration 's case for war with iraq , came from an iraqi refugee to germany , who was given the retrospectively ironic codename " curveball . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the source , an iraqi refugee , fabricated a story about mobile chemical weapons factories curveball claimed to have been a chemical engineer but was actually a fake .
nonetheless the german intelligence service , the bnd , passed on what he said to washington .
was this a case of germany publicly opposing the war while placating the us behind-the-scenes by providing the bush government with a pretense for commencing hostilities ? the vice-chairman of the bundestag 's supervisory committee for the bnd , free democrat max stadler , is one of the parliamentarians who will try to resolve that question .
but , as he told dw-world.de , answers and possible action are a long way off . dw-world.de : who is the committee planning to interview in this affair ? stadler : no one .
the way this committee works is that the government reports on all matters relevant to the german intelligence service .
the curveball affair attracted a lot of attention in the press so that will , of course , be part of the report .
we are n't having witnesses testify .
that right is reserved for a special investigations committee , not the supervisory committee . the spiegel report gives the impression that the bnd gave washington information it suspected might be unreliable .
is that your impression as well ?
that 's precisely the reason , in my opinion , that the affair needs to be taken up in the supervisory committee .
this impression has in fact been made in the press .
on the other hand , the reports also state that the bnd under the previous german government sent a letter to the effect that the information from curveball had n't been checked out or confirmed by a second source .
the letter said , insofar as i understand it , that -lsb- the german government -rsb- could not guarantee the information was reliable .
the committee is going to take another look at that .
but what you said about the general impression one gets from the media reports is correct . lawrence wilkerson , the chief of staff to former secretary of state colin powell , has accused the bnd of hindering cia attempts to question curveball and of therefore being partially responsible for the iraq war .
that 's a fairly serious charge , is n't it ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : colin powell cited the bogus info in urging for war i do n't know precisely how things developed .
i 'll have to wait for the hearing next week before i can say anything about that .
but i would say , generally speaking , that the iraq war was a long time coming .
much of the opinion in the us had been formed before the curveball testimony .
i personally can not imagine that one intelligence report from germany would have been the all-decisive factor for the american government back then . german officially refused to join the us-led coalition in iraq .
but reports repeatedly surface about germany sharing intelligence with the us and thereby helping america in that conflict .
does that amount to taking part in the war via the back door ? that 's precisely what the bnd investigations committee is looking into .
the issue came up two years ago , when it became known that two bnd officials were active in baghdad .
the government said they were acting in the national interest .
but the government also said the officials reported back information to their central headquarters that was then passed on to the americans .
the government says that 's perfectly normal .
my personal opinion is that this does represent , if only marginally , an intervention in the iraq war - and it certainly contrasts with what the previous spd-green government was telling the public at the time .
and precisely the question of whether the government said one thing while doing another will be a question for the investigation committee .
germany 's participation may have been slight , confined to the passing-on of information .
but when you consider how heavily the governing coalition back then featured opposition to the war in their election campaign , the two things do n't really add up . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some estimates say the war has killed more than a million people what can the supervisory committee do , if it concludes that the bnd or the government acted improperly ? in principle , the supervisory committee is pledged to secrecy .
even in cases of impropriety , we are n't allowed to make public statements .
but there is an exception .
if two-thirds of the committee members think it 's necessary , we can issue a public evaluation .
members of the opposition parties , though , are not particularly happy about this rule .
we think members of opposition parties should have also have the opportunity to issue dissenting evaluations .
but we 'll see after the meeting whether there is a two-thirds majority for making such a public statement . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : stadler is the supervisory committee 's vice chairman so the basic function of the supervisory committee is to make recommendations to the government . yes , our recommendations go straight to the government and are not usually made public .
but recently the committee has made more and more use of the two-thirds option .
and that could well be the case again . generally speaking , intelligence services - and especially us intelligence services - did n't do a very good job getting quality information about iraq .
how can this situation be improved so that in the future we do n't wage war because of non-existent weapons of mass destruction ? i think it 's high time that politicians recognize that intelligence services have a servile function .
they 're supposed to deliver information that makes it easier to take decisions .
but the politicians are the ones who ultimately have to decide .

" i urge the russian federation to reverse these measures , and call on the georgian authorities to continue to show restraint , " he added . earlier in the day , russian president vladimir putin ordered his government to boost ties to abkhazia and south ossetia , including recognizing businesses and organizations registered in the regions .
russia 's backyard " this is an attempt to legalize the annexation of two georgian regions , " georgian foreign minister david bakradze said in a statement .
" it contradicts all international laws .
georgia will use all diplomatic , political and legal tools to stop this process , which destabilizes the situation in the region . "

they are economically dependent on russia . moscow 's move comes two weeks after nato provoked the kremlin 's anger by agreeing at a summit in bucharest that georgia would eventually join the alliance .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de iraq -pipe- 16.04.2008 bundestag to examine us-german intelligence fiasco on iraq großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : an iraqi refugee to germany with the codename " curveball " provided false info about iraq on april 23 , a committee of german lawmakers will examine how false information passed on by the german intelligence service helped the us justify the war in iraq .
dw-world.de spoke with the committee 's vice chairman . earlier this month , the german news magazine der spiegel published a series of articles revealing that a german source was behind erroneous information about mobile chemical weapons factories in iraq under saddam hussein . the information , famously used by colin powell in his 2003 speech to the un laying out the bush administration 's case for war with iraq , came from an iraqi refugee to germany , who was given the retrospectively ironic codename " curveball . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the source , an iraqi refugee , fabricated a story about mobile chemical weapons factories curveball claimed to have been a chemical engineer but was actually a fake .
nonetheless the german intelligence service , the bnd , passed on what he said to washington .
was this a case of germany publicly opposing the war while placating the us behind-the-scenes by providing the bush government with a pretense for commencing hostilities ? the vice-chairman of the bundestag 's supervisory committee for the bnd , free democrat max stadler , is one of the parliamentarians who will try to resolve that question .
but , as he told dw-world.de , answers and possible action are a long way off . dw-world.de : who is the committee planning to interview in this affair ? stadler : no one .
the way this committee works is that the government reports on all matters relevant to the german intelligence service .
the curveball affair attracted a lot of attention in the press so that will , of course , be part of the report .
we are n't having witnesses testify .
that right is reserved for a special investigations committee , not the supervisory committee . the spiegel report gives the impression that the bnd gave washington information it suspected might be unreliable .
is that your impression as well ?
that 's precisely the reason , in my opinion , that the affair needs to be taken up in the supervisory committee .
this impression has in fact been made in the press .
on the other hand , the reports also state that the bnd under the previous german government sent a letter to the effect that the information from curveball had n't been checked out or confirmed by a second source .
the letter said , insofar as i understand it , that -lsb- the german government -rsb- could not guarantee the information was reliable .
the committee is going to take another look at that .
but what you said about the general impression one gets from the media reports is correct . lawrence wilkerson , the chief of staff to former secretary of state colin powell , has accused the bnd of hindering cia attempts to question curveball and of therefore being partially responsible for the iraq war .
that 's a fairly serious charge , is n't it ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : colin powell cited the bogus info in urging for war i do n't know precisely how things developed .
i 'll have to wait for the hearing next week before i can say anything about that .
but i would say , generally speaking , that the iraq war was a long time coming .
much of the opinion in the us had been formed before the curveball testimony .
i personally can not imagine that one intelligence report from germany would have been the all-decisive factor for the american government back then . german officially refused to join the us-led coalition in iraq .
but reports repeatedly surface about germany sharing intelligence with the us and thereby helping america in that conflict .
does that amount to taking part in the war via the back door ? that 's precisely what the bnd investigations committee is looking into .
the issue came up two years ago , when it became known that two bnd officials were active in baghdad .
the government said they were acting in the national interest .
but the government also said the officials reported back information to their central headquarters that was then passed on to the americans .
the government says that 's perfectly normal .
my personal opinion is that this does represent , if only marginally , an intervention in the iraq war - and it certainly contrasts with what the previous spd-green government was telling the public at the time .
and precisely the question of whether the government said one thing while doing another will be a question for the investigation committee .
germany 's participation may have been slight , confined to the passing-on of information .
but when you consider how heavily the governing coalition back then featured opposition to the war in their election campaign , the two things do n't really add up . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some estimates say the war has killed more than a million people what can the supervisory committee do , if it concludes that the bnd or the government acted improperly ? in principle , the supervisory committee is pledged to secrecy .
even in cases of impropriety , we are n't allowed to make public statements .
but there is an exception .
if two-thirds of the committee members think it 's necessary , we can issue a public evaluation .
members of the opposition parties , though , are not particularly happy about this rule .
we think members of opposition parties should have also have the opportunity to issue dissenting evaluations .
but we 'll see after the meeting whether there is a two-thirds majority for making such a public statement . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : stadler is the supervisory committee 's vice chairman so the basic function of the supervisory committee is to make recommendations to the government . yes , our recommendations go straight to the government and are not usually made public .
but recently the committee has made more and more use of the two-thirds option .
and that could well be the case again . generally speaking , intelligence services - and especially us intelligence services - did n't do a very good job getting quality information about iraq .
how can this situation be improved so that in the future we do n't wage war because of non-existent weapons of mass destruction ? i think it 's high time that politicians recognize that intelligence services have a servile function .
they 're supposed to deliver information that makes it easier to take decisions .
but the politicians are the ones who ultimately have to decide .
and maybe they should treat the analyses they get from intelligence services with a bit more scepticism - instead of using them as excuse by saying " we had no other options given the intelligence at our disposal . "

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de iraq -pipe- 16.04.2008 bundestag to examine us-german intelligence fiasco on iraq großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : an iraqi refugee to germany with the codename " curveball " provided false info about iraq on april 23 , a committee of german lawmakers will examine how false information passed on by the german intelligence service helped the us justify the war in iraq .
dw-world.de spoke with the committee 's vice chairman . earlier this month , the german news magazine der spiegel published a series of articles revealing that a german source was behind erroneous information about mobile chemical weapons factories in iraq under saddam hussein . the information , famously used by colin powell in his 2003 speech to the un laying out the bush administration 's case for war with iraq , came from an iraqi refugee to germany , who was given the retrospectively ironic codename " curveball . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the source , an iraqi refugee , fabricated a story about mobile chemical weapons factories curveball claimed to have been a chemical engineer but was actually a fake .
nonetheless the german intelligence service , the bnd , passed on what he said to washington .
was this a case of germany publicly opposing the war while placating the us behind-the-scenes by providing the bush government with a pretense for commencing hostilities ? the vice-chairman of the bundestag 's supervisory committee for the bnd , free democrat max stadler , is one of the parliamentarians who will try to resolve that question .
but , as he told dw-world.de , answers and possible action are a long way off . dw-world.de : who is the committee planning to interview in this affair ? stadler : no one .
the way this committee works is that the government reports on all matters relevant to the german intelligence service .
the curveball affair attracted a lot of attention in the press so that will , of course , be part of the report .
we are n't having witnesses testify .
that right is reserved for a special investigations committee , not the supervisory committee . the spiegel report gives the impression that the bnd gave washington information it suspected might be unreliable .
is that your impression as well ?
that 's precisely the reason , in my opinion , that the affair needs to be taken up in the supervisory committee .
this impression has in fact been made in the press .
on the other hand , the reports also state that the bnd under the previous german government sent a letter to the effect that the information from curveball had n't been checked out or confirmed by a second source .
the letter said , insofar as i understand it , that -lsb- the german government -rsb- could not guarantee the information was reliable .
the committee is going to take another look at that .
but what you said about the general impression one gets from the media reports is correct . lawrence wilkerson , the chief of staff to former secretary of state colin powell , has accused the bnd of hindering cia attempts to question curveball and of therefore being partially responsible for the iraq war .
that 's a fairly serious charge , is n't it ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : colin powell cited the bogus info in urging for war i do n't know precisely how things developed .
i 'll have to wait for the hearing next week before i can say anything about that .
but i would say , generally speaking , that the iraq war was a long time coming .
much of the opinion in the us had been formed before the curveball testimony .
i personally can not imagine that one intelligence report from germany would have been the all-decisive factor for the american government back then . german officially refused to join the us-led coalition in iraq .
but reports repeatedly surface about germany sharing intelligence with the us and thereby helping america in that conflict .
does that amount to taking part in the war via the back door ? that 's precisely what the bnd investigations committee is looking into .
the issue came up two years ago , when it became known that two bnd officials were active in baghdad .
the government said they were acting in the national interest .
but the government also said the officials reported back information to their central headquarters that was then passed on to the americans .
the government says that 's perfectly normal .
my personal opinion is that this does represent , if only marginally , an intervention in the iraq war - and it certainly contrasts with what the previous spd-green government was telling the public at the time .
and precisely the question of whether the government said one thing while doing another will be a question for the investigation committee .
germany 's participation may have been slight , confined to the passing-on of information .
but when you consider how heavily the governing coalition back then featured opposition to the war in their election campaign , the two things do n't really add up . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some estimates say the war has killed more than a million people what can the supervisory committee do , if it concludes that the bnd or the government acted improperly ? in principle , the supervisory committee is pledged to secrecy .
even in cases of impropriety , we are n't allowed to make public statements .
but there is an exception .
if two-thirds of the committee members think it 's necessary , we can issue a public evaluation .
members of the opposition parties , though , are not particularly happy about this rule .
we think members of opposition parties should have also have the opportunity to issue dissenting evaluations .
but we 'll see after the meeting whether there is a two-thirds majority for making such a public statement . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : stadler is the supervisory committee 's vice chairman so the basic function of the supervisory committee is to make recommendations to the government . yes , our recommendations go straight to the government and are not usually made public .
but recently the committee has made more and more use of the two-thirds option .
and that could well be the case again . generally speaking , intelligence services - and especially us intelligence services - did n't do a very good job getting quality information about iraq .
how can this situation be improved so that in the future we do n't wage war because of non-existent weapons of mass destruction ? i think it 's high time that politicians recognize that intelligence services have a servile function .
they 're supposed to deliver information that makes it easier to take decisions .
but the politicians are the ones who ultimately have to decide .
and maybe they should treat the analyses they get from intelligence services with a bit more scepticism - instead of using them as excuse by saying " we had no other options given the intelligence at our disposal . "
ultimately , politicians are always free to make up their own minds . jefferson chase send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

they 're still interested in german companies for their reliability , know-how and state-of-the-art technology .

perhaps germans would have more sex if they knocked off the heavy foods . early in his career , britain 's jamie oliver was known as the " naked chef " for his love of simple , stripped-down food .
but in an interview with the german edition of men 's health magazine , oliver offered his views not just on cuisine , but coitus .
when asked what he would cook for a hot date , oliver said it did n't really matter as long as the main dish was n't heavy .
" you wo n't get anywhere afterward if you 've eaten a huge curry or a stew with dumplings , " the star chef opined .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hey , oliver , whose dumplings are you running down ?
come again , readers in germany must be thinking .
the next thing you 'll be telling us is that beer is bad for your sex life .
germans are particularly fond of their dumplings , called alternately kloesse or knoedel - which are balls of grated potatoes or bread held together with egg yolk and other sticky stuff .
according to oliver , you 're better off lightly dining on greens before a roll in the hay rather than stuffing your face with carbohydrates .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : sauerkraut and dumplings - a form of birth control there was no immediate word on whether portly men around germany had taken umbrage at oliver casting aspersions on their , er , knoedel , but maybe central europeans should listen to the chef 's advice .
with birth rates plummeting , germans need all the help they can get to get in the sack more often .
and oliver is not only a famous television chef .
he 's also married to a model .

the catholic church is universal .
the celebration of mass , the sacraments and the teachings are the same all over the world .

but in comparison to other local american churches , people often say they find our german community more relaxed , open , and maybe more strongly family and youth-oriented .

nato 's secretary general called on moscow to reverse the measures . " we are concerned about these unilateral decisions , we have always supported georgia 's territorial integrity , " said christina gallach , european union foreign policy chief javier solana 's spokeswoman , on wednesday , april 16 . nato secretary general jaap de hoop scheffer went further , calling on russia to roll back its plans . " i am deeply concerned by the actions russia has taken to establish legal links with the georgian regions of abkhazia and south ossetia , " de hoop scheffer said in a statement .
" i urge the russian federation to reverse these measures , and call on the georgian authorities to continue to show restraint , " he added . earlier in the day , russian president vladimir putin ordered his government to boost ties to abkhazia and south ossetia , including recognizing businesses and organizations registered in the regions .
russia 's backyard " this is an attempt to legalize the annexation of two georgian regions , " georgian foreign minister david bakradze said in a statement .
" it contradicts all international laws .
georgia will use all diplomatic , political and legal tools to stop this process , which destabilizes the situation in the region . "

but some politicians doubt whether the proposed law meets strict rules mandated by the country 's highest court . germany 's social democrats -lrb- spd -rrb- parliamentary group said it would not blindly pass a law formulating new guidelines for the surveillance of personal computers in cases of suspected terrorism or other serious crimes . " we are going to carefully review whether the legislative draft corresponds with the restrictive parameters laid out by germany 's constitutional court , and reserve the right to veto , " the group 's expert on domestic affairs , klaus-uwe benneter , told the daily berliner zeitung on wednesday , april 16 . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : authorities wo n't be allowed to handle suspects ' computers to install spy software he said regular , careful monitoring would have to occur to ensure that the proposed law is properly applied .
he also said those who have been under surveillance must also be informed that their computers were examined . staying the course germany 's christian democrats -lrb- cdu -rrb- , with whom the social democrats are in a ruling coalition , have called on the spd to agree to the guidelines .
wolfgang bosbach , the cdu 's deputy parliamentary leader , told the newspaper , " when the spd continues to stir things up , people would begin throwing up their hands in frustration - they would n't understand it . " bosbach said the cdu had already met the spd half-way .
interior minister wolfgang schauble , a cdu member , had already conceded by revoking his wish to allow police to enter suspects ' apartments to install spy software on their computers , bosbach told public broadcaster ard tuesday evening . the spd had rejected that measure , which did not make it into the final version of the proposed law . opposition parties also issued their displeasure with the proposal . " piece by piece , our privacy is obviously dying , " green party member hans-christian stroebele told ard . only under special circumstances in february , the nation 's highest court established that the privacy of data stored or exchanged on personal computers is a basic right protected by the constitution ; surveillance is therefore permitted only in exceptional cases . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the cdu 's bosbach said the spd should stay the agreed-to course interior minister wolfgang schaeuble and justice minister brigitte zypries said on tuesday that they had agreed on the new framework to conform with that legal ruling from the court . it was the last hurdle in putting together new guidelines for germany 's domestic intelligence services , which will now be sent to the country 's states for further discussion . schaeuble 's spokesperson said that once the drafted law had gone to the states , it could then be presented to the cabinet before the summer recess . dw staff -lrb- als -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de iraq -pipe- 16.04.2008 bundestag to examine us-german intelligence fiasco on iraq großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : an iraqi refugee to germany with the codename " curveball " provided false info about iraq on april 23 , a committee of german lawmakers will examine how false information passed on by the german intelligence service helped the us justify the war in iraq .
dw-world.de spoke with the committee 's vice chairman . earlier this month , the german news magazine der spiegel published a series of articles revealing that a german source was behind erroneous information about mobile chemical weapons factories in iraq under saddam hussein . the information , famously used by colin powell in his 2003 speech to the un laying out the bush administration 's case for war with iraq , came from an iraqi refugee to germany , who was given the retrospectively ironic codename " curveball . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the source , an iraqi refugee , fabricated a story about mobile chemical weapons factories curveball claimed to have been a chemical engineer but was actually a fake .
nonetheless the german intelligence service , the bnd , passed on what he said to washington .
was this a case of germany publicly opposing the war while placating the us behind-the-scenes by providing the bush government with a pretense for commencing hostilities ? the vice-chairman of the bundestag 's supervisory committee for the bnd , free democrat max stadler , is one of the parliamentarians who will try to resolve that question .
but , as he told dw-world.de , answers and possible action are a long way off . dw-world.de : who is the committee planning to interview in this affair ? stadler : no one .
the way this committee works is that the government reports on all matters relevant to the german intelligence service .
the curveball affair attracted a lot of attention in the press so that will , of course , be part of the report .
we are n't having witnesses testify .
that right is reserved for a special investigations committee , not the supervisory committee . the spiegel report gives the impression that the bnd gave washington information it suspected might be unreliable .
is that your impression as well ?
that 's precisely the reason , in my opinion , that the affair needs to be taken up in the supervisory committee .
this impression has in fact been made in the press .
on the other hand , the reports also state that the bnd under the previous german government sent a letter to the effect that the information from curveball had n't been checked out or confirmed by a second source .
the letter said , insofar as i understand it , that -lsb- the german government -rsb- could not guarantee the information was reliable .
the committee is going to take another look at that .
but what you said about the general impression one gets from the media reports is correct . lawrence wilkerson , the chief of staff to former secretary of state colin powell , has accused the bnd of hindering cia attempts to question curveball and of therefore being partially responsible for the iraq war .
that 's a fairly serious charge , is n't it ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : colin powell cited the bogus info in urging for war i do n't know precisely how things developed .
i 'll have to wait for the hearing next week before i can say anything about that .
but i would say , generally speaking , that the iraq war was a long time coming .
much of the opinion in the us had been formed before the curveball testimony .
i personally can not imagine that one intelligence report from germany would have been the all-decisive factor for the american government back then . german officially refused to join the us-led coalition in iraq .
but reports repeatedly surface about germany sharing intelligence with the us and thereby helping america in that conflict .
does that amount to taking part in the war via the back door ? that 's precisely what the bnd investigations committee is looking into .
the issue came up two years ago , when it became known that two bnd officials were active in baghdad .
the government said they were acting in the national interest .
but the government also said the officials reported back information to their central headquarters that was then passed on to the americans .
the government says that 's perfectly normal .
my personal opinion is that this does represent , if only marginally , an intervention in the iraq war - and it certainly contrasts with what the previous spd-green government was telling the public at the time .
and precisely the question of whether the government said one thing while doing another will be a question for the investigation committee .
germany 's participation may have been slight , confined to the passing-on of information .
but when you consider how heavily the governing coalition back then featured opposition to the war in their election campaign , the two things do n't really add up . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some estimates say the war has killed more than a million people what can the supervisory committee do , if it concludes that the bnd or the government acted improperly ? in principle , the supervisory committee is pledged to secrecy .
even in cases of impropriety , we are n't allowed to make public statements .
but there is an exception .
if two-thirds of the committee members think it 's necessary , we can issue a public evaluation .
members of the opposition parties , though , are not particularly happy about this rule .
we think members of opposition parties should have also have the opportunity to issue dissenting evaluations .
but we 'll see after the meeting whether there is a two-thirds majority for making such a public statement . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : stadler is the supervisory committee 's vice chairman so the basic function of the supervisory committee is to make recommendations to the government . yes , our recommendations go straight to the government and are not usually made public .
but recently the committee has made more and more use of the two-thirds option .
and that could well be the case again . generally speaking , intelligence services - and especially us intelligence services - did n't do a very good job getting quality information about iraq .
how can this situation be improved so that in the future we do n't wage war because of non-existent weapons of mass destruction ? i think it 's high time that politicians recognize that intelligence services have a servile function .
they 're supposed to deliver information that makes it easier to take decisions .
but the politicians are the ones who ultimately have to decide .
and maybe they should treat the analyses they get from intelligence services with a bit more scepticism - instead of using them as excuse by saying " we had no other options given the intelligence at our disposal . "

germans are particularly fond of their dumplings , called alternately kloesse or knoedel - which are balls of grated potatoes or bread held together with egg yolk and other sticky stuff .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de iraq -pipe- 16.04.2008 bundestag to examine us-german intelligence fiasco on iraq großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : an iraqi refugee to germany with the codename " curveball " provided false info about iraq on april 23 , a committee of german lawmakers will examine how false information passed on by the german intelligence service helped the us justify the war in iraq .
dw-world.de spoke with the committee 's vice chairman . earlier this month , the german news magazine der spiegel published a series of articles revealing that a german source was behind erroneous information about mobile chemical weapons factories in iraq under saddam hussein . the information , famously used by colin powell in his 2003 speech to the un laying out the bush administration 's case for war with iraq , came from an iraqi refugee to germany , who was given the retrospectively ironic codename " curveball . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the source , an iraqi refugee , fabricated a story about mobile chemical weapons factories curveball claimed to have been a chemical engineer but was actually a fake .
nonetheless the german intelligence service , the bnd , passed on what he said to washington .
was this a case of germany publicly opposing the war while placating the us behind-the-scenes by providing the bush government with a pretense for commencing hostilities ? the vice-chairman of the bundestag 's supervisory committee for the bnd , free democrat max stadler , is one of the parliamentarians who will try to resolve that question .
but , as he told dw-world.de , answers and possible action are a long way off . dw-world.de : who is the committee planning to interview in this affair ? stadler : no one .
the way this committee works is that the government reports on all matters relevant to the german intelligence service .
the curveball affair attracted a lot of attention in the press so that will , of course , be part of the report .
we are n't having witnesses testify .
that right is reserved for a special investigations committee , not the supervisory committee . the spiegel report gives the impression that the bnd gave washington information it suspected might be unreliable .
is that your impression as well ?
that 's precisely the reason , in my opinion , that the affair needs to be taken up in the supervisory committee .
this impression has in fact been made in the press .
on the other hand , the reports also state that the bnd under the previous german government sent a letter to the effect that the information from curveball had n't been checked out or confirmed by a second source .
the letter said , insofar as i understand it , that -lsb- the german government -rsb- could not guarantee the information was reliable .
the committee is going to take another look at that .
but what you said about the general impression one gets from the media reports is correct . lawrence wilkerson , the chief of staff to former secretary of state colin powell , has accused the bnd of hindering cia attempts to question curveball and of therefore being partially responsible for the iraq war .
that 's a fairly serious charge , is n't it ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : colin powell cited the bogus info in urging for war i do n't know precisely how things developed .
i 'll have to wait for the hearing next week before i can say anything about that .
but i would say , generally speaking , that the iraq war was a long time coming .
much of the opinion in the us had been formed before the curveball testimony .
i personally can not imagine that one intelligence report from germany would have been the all-decisive factor for the american government back then . german officially refused to join the us-led coalition in iraq .
but reports repeatedly surface about germany sharing intelligence with the us and thereby helping america in that conflict .
does that amount to taking part in the war via the back door ? that 's precisely what the bnd investigations committee is looking into .
the issue came up two years ago , when it became known that two bnd officials were active in baghdad .
the government said they were acting in the national interest .
but the government also said the officials reported back information to their central headquarters that was then passed on to the americans .
the government says that 's perfectly normal .
my personal opinion is that this does represent , if only marginally , an intervention in the iraq war - and it certainly contrasts with what the previous spd-green government was telling the public at the time .
and precisely the question of whether the government said one thing while doing another will be a question for the investigation committee .
germany 's participation may have been slight , confined to the passing-on of information .
but when you consider how heavily the governing coalition back then featured opposition to the war in their election campaign , the two things do n't really add up . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some estimates say the war has killed more than a million people what can the supervisory committee do , if it concludes that the bnd or the government acted improperly ? in principle , the supervisory committee is pledged to secrecy .
even in cases of impropriety , we are n't allowed to make public statements .
but there is an exception .
if two-thirds of the committee members think it 's necessary , we can issue a public evaluation .
members of the opposition parties , though , are not particularly happy about this rule .
we think members of opposition parties should have also have the opportunity to issue dissenting evaluations .
but we 'll see after the meeting whether there is a two-thirds majority for making such a public statement . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : stadler is the supervisory committee 's vice chairman so the basic function of the supervisory committee is to make recommendations to the government . yes , our recommendations go straight to the government and are not usually made public .
but recently the committee has made more and more use of the two-thirds option .
and that could well be the case again . generally speaking , intelligence services - and especially us intelligence services - did n't do a very good job getting quality information about iraq .
how can this situation be improved so that in the future we do n't wage war because of non-existent weapons of mass destruction ? i think it 's high time that politicians recognize that intelligence services have a servile function .
they 're supposed to deliver information that makes it easier to take decisions .
but the politicians are the ones who ultimately have to decide .
and maybe they should treat the analyses they get from intelligence services with a bit more scepticism - instead of using them as excuse by saying " we had no other options given the intelligence at our disposal . "

dw-world.de spoke with the committee 's vice chairman . earlier this month , the german news magazine der spiegel published a series of articles revealing that a german source was behind erroneous information about mobile chemical weapons factories in iraq under saddam hussein . the information , famously used by colin powell in his 2003 speech to the un laying out the bush administration 's case for war with iraq , came from an iraqi refugee to germany , who was given the retrospectively ironic codename " curveball . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the source , an iraqi refugee , fabricated a story about mobile chemical weapons factories curveball claimed to have been a chemical engineer but was actually a fake .
nonetheless the german intelligence service , the bnd , passed on what he said to washington .
was this a case of germany publicly opposing the war while placating the us behind-the-scenes by providing the bush government with a pretense for commencing hostilities ? the vice-chairman of the bundestag 's supervisory committee for the bnd , free democrat max stadler , is one of the parliamentarians who will try to resolve that question .
but , as he told dw-world.de , answers and possible action are a long way off . dw-world.de : who is the committee planning to interview in this affair ? stadler : no one .
the way this committee works is that the government reports on all matters relevant to the german intelligence service .
the curveball affair attracted a lot of attention in the press so that will , of course , be part of the report .
we are n't having witnesses testify .
that right is reserved for a special investigations committee , not the supervisory committee . the spiegel report gives the impression that the bnd gave washington information it suspected might be unreliable .
is that your impression as well ?
that 's precisely the reason , in my opinion , that the affair needs to be taken up in the supervisory committee .
this impression has in fact been made in the press .
on the other hand , the reports also state that the bnd under the previous german government sent a letter to the effect that the information from curveball had n't been checked out or confirmed by a second source .
the letter said , insofar as i understand it , that -lsb- the german government -rsb- could not guarantee the information was reliable .
the committee is going to take another look at that .
but what you said about the general impression one gets from the media reports is correct . lawrence wilkerson , the chief of staff to former secretary of state colin powell , has accused the bnd of hindering cia attempts to question curveball and of therefore being partially responsible for the iraq war .
that 's a fairly serious charge , is n't it ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : colin powell cited the bogus info in urging for war i do n't know precisely how things developed .
i 'll have to wait for the hearing next week before i can say anything about that .
but i would say , generally speaking , that the iraq war was a long time coming .
much of the opinion in the us had been formed before the curveball testimony .
i personally can not imagine that one intelligence report from germany would have been the all-decisive factor for the american government back then . german officially refused to join the us-led coalition in iraq .
but reports repeatedly surface about germany sharing intelligence with the us and thereby helping america in that conflict .
does that amount to taking part in the war via the back door ? that 's precisely what the bnd investigations committee is looking into .
the issue came up two years ago , when it became known that two bnd officials were active in baghdad .
the government said they were acting in the national interest .
but the government also said the officials reported back information to their central headquarters that was then passed on to the americans .
the government says that 's perfectly normal .
my personal opinion is that this does represent , if only marginally , an intervention in the iraq war - and it certainly contrasts with what the previous spd-green government was telling the public at the time .
and precisely the question of whether the government said one thing while doing another will be a question for the investigation committee .
germany 's participation may have been slight , confined to the passing-on of information .
but when you consider how heavily the governing coalition back then featured opposition to the war in their election campaign , the two things do n't really add up . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some estimates say the war has killed more than a million people what can the supervisory committee do , if it concludes that the bnd or the government acted improperly ? in principle , the supervisory committee is pledged to secrecy .
even in cases of impropriety , we are n't allowed to make public statements .
but there is an exception .
if two-thirds of the committee members think it 's necessary , we can issue a public evaluation .
members of the opposition parties , though , are not particularly happy about this rule .
we think members of opposition parties should have also have the opportunity to issue dissenting evaluations .
but we 'll see after the meeting whether there is a two-thirds majority for making such a public statement . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : stadler is the supervisory committee 's vice chairman so the basic function of the supervisory committee is to make recommendations to the government . yes , our recommendations go straight to the government and are not usually made public .
but recently the committee has made more and more use of the two-thirds option .
and that could well be the case again . generally speaking , intelligence services - and especially us intelligence services - did n't do a very good job getting quality information about iraq .
how can this situation be improved so that in the future we do n't wage war because of non-existent weapons of mass destruction ? i think it 's high time that politicians recognize that intelligence services have a servile function .
they 're supposed to deliver information that makes it easier to take decisions .
but the politicians are the ones who ultimately have to decide .
and maybe they should treat the analyses they get from intelligence services with a bit more scepticism - instead of using them as excuse by saying " we had no other options given the intelligence at our disposal . "
ultimately , politicians are always free to make up their own minds . jefferson chase send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

according to the latest reports from the newsmagazine that broke the story about lidl , it 's happening at companies all over germany . german news weekly stern reported on wednesday that invasive employee monitoring is common practice at other retailers , including penny , netto , norma , edeka , plus , rewe , hagebau and famila .
as was the case with lidl , the retailers routinely printed up pages of notes detailing intimate aspects of their employee 's lives . the magazine said that , nationwide , detective agencies have sprung up which specialize in helping employers spy on their staff , including " detailed written observation reports . " stern quoted the manager of a supermarket discounter who said that the detective agencies are extremely competitive . " many try to set themselves apart by offering additional services , " the manager was quoted as saying .
" i was offered such protocols more times than i can count . " the manager confirmed that spying efforts were intensified when there were suspicions that certain employees were attempting to organize a union . " every measure is used in order to prevent a works council from forming , " the source told stern . workers outside the retail sector also have reason to fear for their privacy .
according to a study by mummert consulting , every third office computer in germany is subject to some sort of monitoring . germany 's federal association of detectives also admitted that 60 to 70 percent of their contracts come from companies , and that the most common request is for the detective to observe employee behavior . dw staff -lrb- dc -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de religion -pipe- 16.04.2008 german catholics in us eager to hear pope 's message großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : pope benedict xvi will discuss the iraq war and immigration in talks with us president bush as pope benedict xvi began his six-day visit to the united states , dw-world.de spoke with michael schapfel , pastor of washington 's german-speaking catholic community , about german catholics ' expectations for the trip . dw-world.de : reverend schapfel , what are your expectations of the papal visit to the united states ? michael schapfel : many catholic and anglican christians in washington are excited to see the pope .
there 's a strong sense here that together , the united states and the catholic church overcame communism .
john paul ii is particularly admired .
his election is seen in relation to solidarnosc in poland , gorbachev , the fall of the berlin wall , a unified europe and victory over the warsaw pact . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : michael schapfel is pastor to german-speaking christians in washington greater washington is home to a very traditional church for german standards .
it takes its cue from rome and listens to what is said there .
the community was very happy about the election of the new pope , and is now waiting to see what message he brings to the united states . is the fact that pope benedict xvi is a german particularly important for the german congregation in washington ? yes , it plays a big role for a lot of our people .
many of them come from bavaria and even the region where he was born .
but the pope is n't coming to the usa to visit us germans .
the german congregation in washington does not have a special role to play in the visit . what is the make-up of your congregation ? there 's quite a large , lively community of german-speaking catholics in washington .
it 's mainly made up of two different groups .
there are those people who have worked here for many years or even decades , or who 've married someone here or plan on spending the rest of their lives here .
then there are those who are only here for a few years .
that group is mostly diplomats , army personnel or business people .
so we have a firm basis for the community , as well as a regular influx of new faces . how does german catholicism differ from catholicism in the us ? it probably does n't differ as much as you might think .
the catholic church is universal .

perhaps germans would have more sex if they knocked off the heavy foods . early in his career , britain 's jamie oliver was known as the " naked chef " for his love of simple , stripped-down food .
but in an interview with the german edition of men 's health magazine , oliver offered his views not just on cuisine , but coitus .
when asked what he would cook for a hot date , oliver said it did n't really matter as long as the main dish was n't heavy .
" you wo n't get anywhere afterward if you 've eaten a huge curry or a stew with dumplings , " the star chef opined .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hey , oliver , whose dumplings are you running down ?
come again , readers in germany must be thinking .
the next thing you 'll be telling us is that beer is bad for your sex life .
germans are particularly fond of their dumplings , called alternately kloesse or knoedel - which are balls of grated potatoes or bread held together with egg yolk and other sticky stuff .
according to oliver , you 're better off lightly dining on greens before a roll in the hay rather than stuffing your face with carbohydrates .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : sauerkraut and dumplings - a form of birth control there was no immediate word on whether portly men around germany had taken umbrage at oliver casting aspersions on their , er , knoedel , but maybe central europeans should listen to the chef 's advice .
with birth rates plummeting , germans need all the help they can get to get in the sack more often .
and oliver is not only a famous television chef .
he 's also married to a model .
no questioning his kloesse . dw staff -lrb- jc -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

perhaps germans would have more sex if they knocked off the heavy foods . early in his career , britain 's jamie oliver was known as the " naked chef " for his love of simple , stripped-down food .
but in an interview with the german edition of men 's health magazine , oliver offered his views not just on cuisine , but coitus .
when asked what he would cook for a hot date , oliver said it did n't really matter as long as the main dish was n't heavy .
" you wo n't get anywhere afterward if you 've eaten a huge curry or a stew with dumplings , " the star chef opined .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hey , oliver , whose dumplings are you running down ?
come again , readers in germany must be thinking .
the next thing you 'll be telling us is that beer is bad for your sex life .
germans are particularly fond of their dumplings , called alternately kloesse or knoedel - which are balls of grated potatoes or bread held together with egg yolk and other sticky stuff .
according to oliver , you 're better off lightly dining on greens before a roll in the hay rather than stuffing your face with carbohydrates .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : sauerkraut and dumplings - a form of birth control there was no immediate word on whether portly men around germany had taken umbrage at oliver casting aspersions on their , er , knoedel , but maybe central europeans should listen to the chef 's advice .
with birth rates plummeting , germans need all the help they can get to get in the sack more often .
and oliver is not only a famous television chef .
he 's also married to a model .

they 're still interested in german companies for their reliability , know-how and state-of-the-art technology .

" they feel that the west in general fails to understand the chinese perspective .

but some politicians doubt whether the proposed law meets strict rules mandated by the country 's highest court . germany 's social democrats -lrb- spd -rrb- parliamentary group said it would not blindly pass a law formulating new guidelines for the surveillance of personal computers in cases of suspected terrorism or other serious crimes . " we are going to carefully review whether the legislative draft corresponds with the restrictive parameters laid out by germany 's constitutional court , and reserve the right to veto , " the group 's expert on domestic affairs , klaus-uwe benneter , told the daily berliner zeitung on wednesday , april 16 . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : authorities wo n't be allowed to handle suspects ' computers to install spy software he said regular , careful monitoring would have to occur to ensure that the proposed law is properly applied .

wolfgang bosbach , the cdu 's deputy parliamentary leader , told the newspaper , " when the spd continues to stir things up , people would begin throwing up their hands in frustration - they would n't understand it . " bosbach said the cdu had already met the spd half-way .
interior minister wolfgang schauble , a cdu member , had already conceded by revoking his wish to allow police to enter suspects ' apartments to install spy software on their computers , bosbach told public broadcaster ard tuesday evening . the spd had rejected that measure , which did not make it into the final version of the proposed law . opposition parties also issued their displeasure with the proposal . " piece by piece , our privacy is obviously dying , " green party member hans-christian stroebele told ard . only under special circumstances in february , the nation 's highest court established that the privacy of data stored or exchanged on personal computers is a basic right protected by the constitution ; surveillance is therefore permitted only in exceptional cases . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the cdu 's bosbach said the spd should stay the agreed-to course interior minister wolfgang schaeuble and justice minister brigitte zypries said on tuesday that they had agreed on the new framework to conform with that legal ruling from the court . it was the last hurdle in putting together new guidelines for germany 's domestic intelligence services , which will now be sent to the country 's states for further discussion . schaeuble 's spokesperson said that once the drafted law had gone to the states , it could then be presented to the cabinet before the summer recess . dw staff -lrb- als -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de religion -pipe- 16.04.2008 german catholics in us eager to hear pope 's message großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : pope benedict xvi will discuss the iraq war and immigration in talks with us president bush as pope benedict xvi began his six-day visit to the united states , dw-world.de spoke with michael schapfel , pastor of washington 's german-speaking catholic community , about german catholics ' expectations for the trip . dw-world.de : reverend schapfel , what are your expectations of the papal visit to the united states ? michael schapfel : many catholic and anglican christians in washington are excited to see the pope .
there 's a strong sense here that together , the united states and the catholic church overcame communism .
john paul ii is particularly admired .
his election is seen in relation to solidarnosc in poland , gorbachev , the fall of the berlin wall , a unified europe and victory over the warsaw pact . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : michael schapfel is pastor to german-speaking christians in washington greater washington is home to a very traditional church for german standards .
it takes its cue from rome and listens to what is said there .
the community was very happy about the election of the new pope , and is now waiting to see what message he brings to the united states . is the fact that pope benedict xvi is a german particularly important for the german congregation in washington ? yes , it plays a big role for a lot of our people .
many of them come from bavaria and even the region where he was born .
but the pope is n't coming to the usa to visit us germans .
the german congregation in washington does not have a special role to play in the visit . what is the make-up of your congregation ? there 's quite a large , lively community of german-speaking catholics in washington .
it 's mainly made up of two different groups .
there are those people who have worked here for many years or even decades , or who 've married someone here or plan on spending the rest of their lives here .
then there are those who are only here for a few years .
that group is mostly diplomats , army personnel or business people .
so we have a firm basis for the community , as well as a regular influx of new faces . how does german catholicism differ from catholicism in the us ? it probably does n't differ as much as you might think .
the catholic church is universal .
the celebration of mass , the sacraments and the teachings are the same all over the world .
only the language is different .
but in comparison to other local american churches , people often say they find our german community more relaxed , open , and maybe more strongly family and youth-oriented .
but that comes from the fact that our community has a different age structure . what is your view on ecumenism ? american catholics always notice how we germans see it as natural for catholics and other christians to be in touch with each other , visit each other and take part in events together .
and here in our community , ecumenism is perhaps even more pronounced than it is in germany , because the local german congregation does n't want to separate everything according to confession .
the close relationship between catholic and protestant christians has a lot to do with our history .
after all , we come from the country of the reformation . interview : victoria von gottberg -lrb- dc -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de iraq -pipe- 16.04.2008 bundestag to examine us-german intelligence fiasco on iraq großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : an iraqi refugee to germany with the codename " curveball " provided false info about iraq on april 23 , a committee of german lawmakers will examine how false information passed on by the german intelligence service helped the us justify the war in iraq .
dw-world.de spoke with the committee 's vice chairman . earlier this month , the german news magazine der spiegel published a series of articles revealing that a german source was behind erroneous information about mobile chemical weapons factories in iraq under saddam hussein . the information , famously used by colin powell in his 2003 speech to the un laying out the bush administration 's case for war with iraq , came from an iraqi refugee to germany , who was given the retrospectively ironic codename " curveball . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the source , an iraqi refugee , fabricated a story about mobile chemical weapons factories curveball claimed to have been a chemical engineer but was actually a fake .
nonetheless the german intelligence service , the bnd , passed on what he said to washington .
was this a case of germany publicly opposing the war while placating the us behind-the-scenes by providing the bush government with a pretense for commencing hostilities ? the vice-chairman of the bundestag 's supervisory committee for the bnd , free democrat max stadler , is one of the parliamentarians who will try to resolve that question .
but , as he told dw-world.de , answers and possible action are a long way off . dw-world.de : who is the committee planning to interview in this affair ? stadler : no one .
the way this committee works is that the government reports on all matters relevant to the german intelligence service .
the curveball affair attracted a lot of attention in the press so that will , of course , be part of the report .
we are n't having witnesses testify .
that right is reserved for a special investigations committee , not the supervisory committee . the spiegel report gives the impression that the bnd gave washington information it suspected might be unreliable .
is that your impression as well ?
that 's precisely the reason , in my opinion , that the affair needs to be taken up in the supervisory committee .
this impression has in fact been made in the press .
on the other hand , the reports also state that the bnd under the previous german government sent a letter to the effect that the information from curveball had n't been checked out or confirmed by a second source .
the letter said , insofar as i understand it , that -lsb- the german government -rsb- could not guarantee the information was reliable .
the committee is going to take another look at that .
but what you said about the general impression one gets from the media reports is correct . lawrence wilkerson , the chief of staff to former secretary of state colin powell , has accused the bnd of hindering cia attempts to question curveball and of therefore being partially responsible for the iraq war .
that 's a fairly serious charge , is n't it ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : colin powell cited the bogus info in urging for war i do n't know precisely how things developed .
i 'll have to wait for the hearing next week before i can say anything about that .
but i would say , generally speaking , that the iraq war was a long time coming .
much of the opinion in the us had been formed before the curveball testimony .
i personally can not imagine that one intelligence report from germany would have been the all-decisive factor for the american government back then . german officially refused to join the us-led coalition in iraq .
but reports repeatedly surface about germany sharing intelligence with the us and thereby helping america in that conflict .
does that amount to taking part in the war via the back door ? that 's precisely what the bnd investigations committee is looking into .
the issue came up two years ago , when it became known that two bnd officials were active in baghdad .
the government said they were acting in the national interest .
but the government also said the officials reported back information to their central headquarters that was then passed on to the americans .
the government says that 's perfectly normal .
my personal opinion is that this does represent , if only marginally , an intervention in the iraq war - and it certainly contrasts with what the previous spd-green government was telling the public at the time .
and precisely the question of whether the government said one thing while doing another will be a question for the investigation committee .
germany 's participation may have been slight , confined to the passing-on of information .
but when you consider how heavily the governing coalition back then featured opposition to the war in their election campaign , the two things do n't really add up . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some estimates say the war has killed more than a million people what can the supervisory committee do , if it concludes that the bnd or the government acted improperly ? in principle , the supervisory committee is pledged to secrecy .
even in cases of impropriety , we are n't allowed to make public statements .
but there is an exception .
if two-thirds of the committee members think it 's necessary , we can issue a public evaluation .
members of the opposition parties , though , are not particularly happy about this rule .
we think members of opposition parties should have also have the opportunity to issue dissenting evaluations .
but we 'll see after the meeting whether there is a two-thirds majority for making such a public statement . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : stadler is the supervisory committee 's vice chairman so the basic function of the supervisory committee is to make recommendations to the government . yes , our recommendations go straight to the government and are not usually made public .
but recently the committee has made more and more use of the two-thirds option .
and that could well be the case again . generally speaking , intelligence services - and especially us intelligence services - did n't do a very good job getting quality information about iraq .
how can this situation be improved so that in the future we do n't wage war because of non-existent weapons of mass destruction ? i think it 's high time that politicians recognize that intelligence services have a servile function .
they 're supposed to deliver information that makes it easier to take decisions .
but the politicians are the ones who ultimately have to decide .
and maybe they should treat the analyses they get from intelligence services with a bit more scepticism - instead of using them as excuse by saying " we had no other options given the intelligence at our disposal . "
ultimately , politicians are always free to make up their own minds . jefferson chase send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de iraq -pipe- 16.04.2008 bundestag to examine us-german intelligence fiasco on iraq großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : an iraqi refugee to germany with the codename " curveball " provided false info about iraq on april 23 , a committee of german lawmakers will examine how false information passed on by the german intelligence service helped the us justify the war in iraq .
dw-world.de spoke with the committee 's vice chairman . earlier this month , the german news magazine der spiegel published a series of articles revealing that a german source was behind erroneous information about mobile chemical weapons factories in iraq under saddam hussein . the information , famously used by colin powell in his 2003 speech to the un laying out the bush administration 's case for war with iraq , came from an iraqi refugee to germany , who was given the retrospectively ironic codename " curveball . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the source , an iraqi refugee , fabricated a story about mobile chemical weapons factories curveball claimed to have been a chemical engineer but was actually a fake .
nonetheless the german intelligence service , the bnd , passed on what he said to washington .
was this a case of germany publicly opposing the war while placating the us behind-the-scenes by providing the bush government with a pretense for commencing hostilities ? the vice-chairman of the bundestag 's supervisory committee for the bnd , free democrat max stadler , is one of the parliamentarians who will try to resolve that question .
but , as he told dw-world.de , answers and possible action are a long way off . dw-world.de : who is the committee planning to interview in this affair ? stadler : no one .
the way this committee works is that the government reports on all matters relevant to the german intelligence service .
the curveball affair attracted a lot of attention in the press so that will , of course , be part of the report .
we are n't having witnesses testify .
that right is reserved for a special investigations committee , not the supervisory committee . the spiegel report gives the impression that the bnd gave washington information it suspected might be unreliable .
is that your impression as well ?
that 's precisely the reason , in my opinion , that the affair needs to be taken up in the supervisory committee .
this impression has in fact been made in the press .
on the other hand , the reports also state that the bnd under the previous german government sent a letter to the effect that the information from curveball had n't been checked out or confirmed by a second source .
the letter said , insofar as i understand it , that -lsb- the german government -rsb- could not guarantee the information was reliable .
the committee is going to take another look at that .
but what you said about the general impression one gets from the media reports is correct . lawrence wilkerson , the chief of staff to former secretary of state colin powell , has accused the bnd of hindering cia attempts to question curveball and of therefore being partially responsible for the iraq war .
that 's a fairly serious charge , is n't it ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : colin powell cited the bogus info in urging for war i do n't know precisely how things developed .
i 'll have to wait for the hearing next week before i can say anything about that .
but i would say , generally speaking , that the iraq war was a long time coming .
much of the opinion in the us had been formed before the curveball testimony .
i personally can not imagine that one intelligence report from germany would have been the all-decisive factor for the american government back then . german officially refused to join the us-led coalition in iraq .
but reports repeatedly surface about germany sharing intelligence with the us and thereby helping america in that conflict .
does that amount to taking part in the war via the back door ? that 's precisely what the bnd investigations committee is looking into .
the issue came up two years ago , when it became known that two bnd officials were active in baghdad .
the government said they were acting in the national interest .
but the government also said the officials reported back information to their central headquarters that was then passed on to the americans .
the government says that 's perfectly normal .
my personal opinion is that this does represent , if only marginally , an intervention in the iraq war - and it certainly contrasts with what the previous spd-green government was telling the public at the time .
and precisely the question of whether the government said one thing while doing another will be a question for the investigation committee .
germany 's participation may have been slight , confined to the passing-on of information .
but when you consider how heavily the governing coalition back then featured opposition to the war in their election campaign , the two things do n't really add up . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some estimates say the war has killed more than a million people what can the supervisory committee do , if it concludes that the bnd or the government acted improperly ? in principle , the supervisory committee is pledged to secrecy .
even in cases of impropriety , we are n't allowed to make public statements .
but there is an exception .
if two-thirds of the committee members think it 's necessary , we can issue a public evaluation .
members of the opposition parties , though , are not particularly happy about this rule .
we think members of opposition parties should have also have the opportunity to issue dissenting evaluations .
but we 'll see after the meeting whether there is a two-thirds majority for making such a public statement . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : stadler is the supervisory committee 's vice chairman so the basic function of the supervisory committee is to make recommendations to the government . yes , our recommendations go straight to the government and are not usually made public .
but recently the committee has made more and more use of the two-thirds option .
and that could well be the case again . generally speaking , intelligence services - and especially us intelligence services - did n't do a very good job getting quality information about iraq .
how can this situation be improved so that in the future we do n't wage war because of non-existent weapons of mass destruction ? i think it 's high time that politicians recognize that intelligence services have a servile function .
they 're supposed to deliver information that makes it easier to take decisions .
but the politicians are the ones who ultimately have to decide .
and maybe they should treat the analyses they get from intelligence services with a bit more scepticism - instead of using them as excuse by saying " we had no other options given the intelligence at our disposal . "

my personal opinion is that this does represent , if only marginally , an intervention in the iraq war - and it certainly contrasts with what the previous spd-green government was telling the public at the time .
and precisely the question of whether the government said one thing while doing another will be a question for the investigation committee .
germany 's participation may have been slight , confined to the passing-on of information .
but when you consider how heavily the governing coalition back then featured opposition to the war in their election campaign , the two things do n't really add up . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some estimates say the war has killed more than a million people what can the supervisory committee do , if it concludes that the bnd or the government acted improperly ? in principle , the supervisory committee is pledged to secrecy .
even in cases of impropriety , we are n't allowed to make public statements .
but there is an exception .
if two-thirds of the committee members think it 's necessary , we can issue a public evaluation .
members of the opposition parties , though , are not particularly happy about this rule .
we think members of opposition parties should have also have the opportunity to issue dissenting evaluations .
but we 'll see after the meeting whether there is a two-thirds majority for making such a public statement . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : stadler is the supervisory committee 's vice chairman so the basic function of the supervisory committee is to make recommendations to the government . yes , our recommendations go straight to the government and are not usually made public .
but recently the committee has made more and more use of the two-thirds option .
and that could well be the case again . generally speaking , intelligence services - and especially us intelligence services - did n't do a very good job getting quality information about iraq .
how can this situation be improved so that in the future we do n't wage war because of non-existent weapons of mass destruction ? i think it 's high time that politicians recognize that intelligence services have a servile function .
they 're supposed to deliver information that makes it easier to take decisions .
but the politicians are the ones who ultimately have to decide .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de iraq -pipe- 16.04.2008 bundestag to examine us-german intelligence fiasco on iraq großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : an iraqi refugee to germany with the codename " curveball " provided false info about iraq on april 23 , a committee of german lawmakers will examine how false information passed on by the german intelligence service helped the us justify the war in iraq .
dw-world.de spoke with the committee 's vice chairman . earlier this month , the german news magazine der spiegel published a series of articles revealing that a german source was behind erroneous information about mobile chemical weapons factories in iraq under saddam hussein . the information , famously used by colin powell in his 2003 speech to the un laying out the bush administration 's case for war with iraq , came from an iraqi refugee to germany , who was given the retrospectively ironic codename " curveball . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the source , an iraqi refugee , fabricated a story about mobile chemical weapons factories curveball claimed to have been a chemical engineer but was actually a fake .
nonetheless the german intelligence service , the bnd , passed on what he said to washington .
was this a case of germany publicly opposing the war while placating the us behind-the-scenes by providing the bush government with a pretense for commencing hostilities ? the vice-chairman of the bundestag 's supervisory committee for the bnd , free democrat max stadler , is one of the parliamentarians who will try to resolve that question .
but , as he told dw-world.de , answers and possible action are a long way off . dw-world.de : who is the committee planning to interview in this affair ? stadler : no one .
the way this committee works is that the government reports on all matters relevant to the german intelligence service .
the curveball affair attracted a lot of attention in the press so that will , of course , be part of the report .
we are n't having witnesses testify .
that right is reserved for a special investigations committee , not the supervisory committee . the spiegel report gives the impression that the bnd gave washington information it suspected might be unreliable .
is that your impression as well ?
that 's precisely the reason , in my opinion , that the affair needs to be taken up in the supervisory committee .
this impression has in fact been made in the press .
on the other hand , the reports also state that the bnd under the previous german government sent a letter to the effect that the information from curveball had n't been checked out or confirmed by a second source .
the letter said , insofar as i understand it , that -lsb- the german government -rsb- could not guarantee the information was reliable .
the committee is going to take another look at that .
but what you said about the general impression one gets from the media reports is correct . lawrence wilkerson , the chief of staff to former secretary of state colin powell , has accused the bnd of hindering cia attempts to question curveball and of therefore being partially responsible for the iraq war .
that 's a fairly serious charge , is n't it ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : colin powell cited the bogus info in urging for war i do n't know precisely how things developed .
i 'll have to wait for the hearing next week before i can say anything about that .
but i would say , generally speaking , that the iraq war was a long time coming .
much of the opinion in the us had been formed before the curveball testimony .
i personally can not imagine that one intelligence report from germany would have been the all-decisive factor for the american government back then . german officially refused to join the us-led coalition in iraq .
but reports repeatedly surface about germany sharing intelligence with the us and thereby helping america in that conflict .
does that amount to taking part in the war via the back door ? that 's precisely what the bnd investigations committee is looking into .
the issue came up two years ago , when it became known that two bnd officials were active in baghdad .
the government said they were acting in the national interest .
but the government also said the officials reported back information to their central headquarters that was then passed on to the americans .
the government says that 's perfectly normal .
my personal opinion is that this does represent , if only marginally , an intervention in the iraq war - and it certainly contrasts with what the previous spd-green government was telling the public at the time .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de energy -pipe- 16.04.2008 iraq pushes for closer energy ties with eu großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : iraqi prime minister nuri al-maliki says iraq can help europe more on energy on his first visit to brussels as iraqi prime minister , nuri al-maliki said his country could help the eu break its reliance on russian gas .
but what are the real prospects ? maliki spent the morning of wednesday , april 16 , conferring with various eu officials . " we do hope this meeting will result in new steps of cooperation between iraq and eu countries , especially regarding contributing to our oil and gas sectors , " al-maliki said . the eu is , after the us , the second-largest importer of iraqi oil and natural gas .
but despite the country 's immense natural resources , iraq 's energy sector is still struggling to recover from years of sanctions and damage wrought by war - including , of course , the us-led invasion of 2003 . eu officials welcomed al-maliki 's remarks . " regardless of what attitudes one held at the beginning of the iraq war , we now have a joint duty to contribute to the establishment of a peaceful and democratic iraq , " said eu parliament president hans-gert poettering after meeting the prime minister . and the head of the european commission jose manuel barroso said a deal may not take long .
" it 's only a matter of some weeks i believe to conclude these negotiations , " barroso told reporters at a joint press conference with al-maliki .
" there are already very concrete details now . "
pipeline plans bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the eu needs reliable supplies for a planned pipeline through turkey the eu 's interest in iraq goes well beyond idealistic talk about peace and democracy .
brussels is looking to the country to help diversify its own energy supplies - in particular for its planned nabucco pipeline from turkey to austria . the eu hopes that the pipeline , which is scheduled to come online in 2013 , will help ease its dependency on russia , from which the bloc currently gets roughly a quarter of its natural gas . but in order for the pipeline to be commercially viable , the eu must ensure it receives sufficient supplies of gas from the middle east .
russia is skeptical about the bloc 's ability to do that . " the only way to fill nabucco is to rely on iranian gas , " russia 's ambassador to the eu , vladimir chizov , told reporters ahead of al-maliki 's visit .
" but then it 's up to west to make up its mind how to deal with iran - either bomb iran or buy its gas . " but the eu hopes that iraq will become politically stable enough to connect up gas fields in the west of the country , enabling baghdad to supply gas to nabucco . al-maliki told eu parliamentarians on wednesday that iraq 's policy of national reconciliation was proving a success and that he did not expect a sudden withdrawal of us forces , which might plunge iraq into chaos . he also that his country would soon pass long-awaited national gas and oil legislation that could provide the legal framework for closer ties between iraq and the eu on energy . dw staff -lrb- jc -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

but what are the real prospects ? maliki spent the morning of wednesday , april 16 , conferring with various eu officials . " we do hope this meeting will result in new steps of cooperation between iraq and eu countries , especially regarding contributing to our oil and gas sectors , " al-maliki said . the eu is , after the us , the second-largest importer of iraqi oil and natural gas .
but despite the country 's immense natural resources , iraq 's energy sector is still struggling to recover from years of sanctions and damage wrought by war - including , of course , the us-led invasion of 2003 . eu officials welcomed al-maliki 's remarks . " regardless of what attitudes one held at the beginning of the iraq war , we now have a joint duty to contribute to the establishment of a peaceful and democratic iraq , " said eu parliament president hans-gert poettering after meeting the prime minister . and the head of the european commission jose manuel barroso said a deal may not take long .

pipeline plans bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the eu needs reliable supplies for a planned pipeline through turkey the eu 's interest in iraq goes well beyond idealistic talk about peace and democracy .
brussels is looking to the country to help diversify its own energy supplies - in particular for its planned nabucco pipeline from turkey to austria . the eu hopes that the pipeline , which is scheduled to come online in 2013 , will help ease its dependency on russia , from which the bloc currently gets roughly a quarter of its natural gas . but in order for the pipeline to be commercially viable , the eu must ensure it receives sufficient supplies of gas from the middle east .
russia is skeptical about the bloc 's ability to do that . " the only way to fill nabucco is to rely on iranian gas , " russia 's ambassador to the eu , vladimir chizov , told reporters ahead of al-maliki 's visit .
" but then it 's up to west to make up its mind how to deal with iran - either bomb iran or buy its gas . " but the eu hopes that iraq will become politically stable enough to connect up gas fields in the west of the country , enabling baghdad to supply gas to nabucco . al-maliki told eu parliamentarians on wednesday that iraq 's policy of national reconciliation was proving a success and that he did not expect a sudden withdrawal of us forces , which might plunge iraq into chaos . he also that his country would soon pass long-awaited national gas and oil legislation that could provide the legal framework for closer ties between iraq and the eu on energy . dw staff -lrb- jc -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

but some politicians doubt whether the proposed law meets strict rules mandated by the country 's highest court . germany 's social democrats -lrb- spd -rrb- parliamentary group said it would not blindly pass a law formulating new guidelines for the surveillance of personal computers in cases of suspected terrorism or other serious crimes . " we are going to carefully review whether the legislative draft corresponds with the restrictive parameters laid out by germany 's constitutional court , and reserve the right to veto , " the group 's expert on domestic affairs , klaus-uwe benneter , told the daily berliner zeitung on wednesday , april 16 . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : authorities wo n't be allowed to handle suspects ' computers to install spy software he said regular , careful monitoring would have to occur to ensure that the proposed law is properly applied .
he also said those who have been under surveillance must also be informed that their computers were examined . staying the course germany 's christian democrats -lrb- cdu -rrb- , with whom the social democrats are in a ruling coalition , have called on the spd to agree to the guidelines .
wolfgang bosbach , the cdu 's deputy parliamentary leader , told the newspaper , " when the spd continues to stir things up , people would begin throwing up their hands in frustration - they would n't understand it . " bosbach said the cdu had already met the spd half-way .
interior minister wolfgang schauble , a cdu member , had already conceded by revoking his wish to allow police to enter suspects ' apartments to install spy software on their computers , bosbach told public broadcaster ard tuesday evening . the spd had rejected that measure , which did not make it into the final version of the proposed law . opposition parties also issued their displeasure with the proposal . " piece by piece , our privacy is obviously dying , " green party member hans-christian stroebele told ard . only under special circumstances in february , the nation 's highest court established that the privacy of data stored or exchanged on personal computers is a basic right protected by the constitution ; surveillance is therefore permitted only in exceptional cases . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the cdu 's bosbach said the spd should stay the agreed-to course interior minister wolfgang schaeuble and justice minister brigitte zypries said on tuesday that they had agreed on the new framework to conform with that legal ruling from the court . it was the last hurdle in putting together new guidelines for germany 's domestic intelligence services , which will now be sent to the country 's states for further discussion . schaeuble 's spokesperson said that once the drafted law had gone to the states , it could then be presented to the cabinet before the summer recess . dw staff -lrb- als -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

but some politicians doubt whether the proposed law meets strict rules mandated by the country 's highest court . germany 's social democrats -lrb- spd -rrb- parliamentary group said it would not blindly pass a law formulating new guidelines for the surveillance of personal computers in cases of suspected terrorism or other serious crimes . " we are going to carefully review whether the legislative draft corresponds with the restrictive parameters laid out by germany 's constitutional court , and reserve the right to veto , " the group 's expert on domestic affairs , klaus-uwe benneter , told the daily berliner zeitung on wednesday , april 16 . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : authorities wo n't be allowed to handle suspects ' computers to install spy software he said regular , careful monitoring would have to occur to ensure that the proposed law is properly applied .
he also said those who have been under surveillance must also be informed that their computers were examined . staying the course germany 's christian democrats -lrb- cdu -rrb- , with whom the social democrats are in a ruling coalition , have called on the spd to agree to the guidelines .
wolfgang bosbach , the cdu 's deputy parliamentary leader , told the newspaper , " when the spd continues to stir things up , people would begin throwing up their hands in frustration - they would n't understand it . " bosbach said the cdu had already met the spd half-way .
interior minister wolfgang schauble , a cdu member , had already conceded by revoking his wish to allow police to enter suspects ' apartments to install spy software on their computers , bosbach told public broadcaster ard tuesday evening . the spd had rejected that measure , which did not make it into the final version of the proposed law . opposition parties also issued their displeasure with the proposal . " piece by piece , our privacy is obviously dying , " green party member hans-christian stroebele told ard . only under special circumstances in february , the nation 's highest court established that the privacy of data stored or exchanged on personal computers is a basic right protected by the constitution ; surveillance is therefore permitted only in exceptional cases . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the cdu 's bosbach said the spd should stay the agreed-to course interior minister wolfgang schaeuble and justice minister brigitte zypries said on tuesday that they had agreed on the new framework to conform with that legal ruling from the court . it was the last hurdle in putting together new guidelines for germany 's domestic intelligence services , which will now be sent to the country 's states for further discussion . schaeuble 's spokesperson said that once the drafted law had gone to the states , it could then be presented to the cabinet before the summer recess . dw staff -lrb- als -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

there 's a strong sense here that together , the united states and the catholic church overcame communism .
john paul ii is particularly admired .
his election is seen in relation to solidarnosc in poland , gorbachev , the fall of the berlin wall , a unified europe and victory over the warsaw pact . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : michael schapfel is pastor to german-speaking christians in washington greater washington is home to a very traditional church for german standards .
it takes its cue from rome and listens to what is said there .
the community was very happy about the election of the new pope , and is now waiting to see what message he brings to the united states . is the fact that pope benedict xvi is a german particularly important for the german congregation in washington ? yes , it plays a big role for a lot of our people .
many of them come from bavaria and even the region where he was born .
but the pope is n't coming to the usa to visit us germans .
the german congregation in washington does not have a special role to play in the visit . what is the make-up of your congregation ? there 's quite a large , lively community of german-speaking catholics in washington .
it 's mainly made up of two different groups .
there are those people who have worked here for many years or even decades , or who 've married someone here or plan on spending the rest of their lives here .
then there are those who are only here for a few years .
that group is mostly diplomats , army personnel or business people .
so we have a firm basis for the community , as well as a regular influx of new faces . how does german catholicism differ from catholicism in the us ? it probably does n't differ as much as you might think .
the catholic church is universal .
the celebration of mass , the sacraments and the teachings are the same all over the world .
only the language is different .
but in comparison to other local american churches , people often say they find our german community more relaxed , open , and maybe more strongly family and youth-oriented .
but that comes from the fact that our community has a different age structure . what is your view on ecumenism ? american catholics always notice how we germans see it as natural for catholics and other christians to be in touch with each other , visit each other and take part in events together .
and here in our community , ecumenism is perhaps even more pronounced than it is in germany , because the local german congregation does n't want to separate everything according to confession .
the close relationship between catholic and protestant christians has a lot to do with our history .
after all , we come from the country of the reformation . interview : victoria von gottberg -lrb- dc -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

but the pope is n't coming to the usa to visit us germans .
the german congregation in washington does not have a special role to play in the visit . what is the make-up of your congregation ? there 's quite a large , lively community of german-speaking catholics in washington .
it 's mainly made up of two different groups .
there are those people who have worked here for many years or even decades , or who 've married someone here or plan on spending the rest of their lives here .
then there are those who are only here for a few years .
that group is mostly diplomats , army personnel or business people .
so we have a firm basis for the community , as well as a regular influx of new faces . how does german catholicism differ from catholicism in the us ? it probably does n't differ as much as you might think .
the catholic church is universal .
the celebration of mass , the sacraments and the teachings are the same all over the world .
only the language is different .
but in comparison to other local american churches , people often say they find our german community more relaxed , open , and maybe more strongly family and youth-oriented .
but that comes from the fact that our community has a different age structure . what is your view on ecumenism ? american catholics always notice how we germans see it as natural for catholics and other christians to be in touch with each other , visit each other and take part in events together .
and here in our community , ecumenism is perhaps even more pronounced than it is in germany , because the local german congregation does n't want to separate everything according to confession .
the close relationship between catholic and protestant christians has a lot to do with our history .

" many try to set themselves apart by offering additional services , " the manager was quoted as saying .
" i was offered such protocols more times than i can count .

but what are the real prospects ? maliki spent the morning of wednesday , april 16 , conferring with various eu officials . " we do hope this meeting will result in new steps of cooperation between iraq and eu countries , especially regarding contributing to our oil and gas sectors , " al-maliki said . the eu is , after the us , the second-largest importer of iraqi oil and natural gas .
but despite the country 's immense natural resources , iraq 's energy sector is still struggling to recover from years of sanctions and damage wrought by war - including , of course , the us-led invasion of 2003 . eu officials welcomed al-maliki 's remarks . " regardless of what attitudes one held at the beginning of the iraq war , we now have a joint duty to contribute to the establishment of a peaceful and democratic iraq , " said eu parliament president hans-gert poettering after meeting the prime minister . and the head of the european commission jose manuel barroso said a deal may not take long .

brussels is looking to the country to help diversify its own energy supplies - in particular for its planned nabucco pipeline from turkey to austria . the eu hopes that the pipeline , which is scheduled to come online in 2013 , will help ease its dependency on russia , from which the bloc currently gets roughly a quarter of its natural gas . but in order for the pipeline to be commercially viable , the eu must ensure it receives sufficient supplies of gas from the middle east .
russia is skeptical about the bloc 's ability to do that . " the only way to fill nabucco is to rely on iranian gas , " russia 's ambassador to the eu , vladimir chizov , told reporters ahead of al-maliki 's visit .
" but then it 's up to west to make up its mind how to deal with iran - either bomb iran or buy its gas . " but the eu hopes that iraq will become politically stable enough to connect up gas fields in the west of the country , enabling baghdad to supply gas to nabucco . al-maliki told eu parliamentarians on wednesday that iraq 's policy of national reconciliation was proving a success and that he did not expect a sudden withdrawal of us forces , which might plunge iraq into chaos . he also that his country would soon pass long-awaited national gas and oil legislation that could provide the legal framework for closer ties between iraq and the eu on energy . dw staff -lrb- jc -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

but what are the real prospects ? maliki spent the morning of wednesday , april 16 , conferring with various eu officials . " we do hope this meeting will result in new steps of cooperation between iraq and eu countries , especially regarding contributing to our oil and gas sectors , " al-maliki said . the eu is , after the us , the second-largest importer of iraqi oil and natural gas .
but despite the country 's immense natural resources , iraq 's energy sector is still struggling to recover from years of sanctions and damage wrought by war - including , of course , the us-led invasion of 2003 . eu officials welcomed al-maliki 's remarks . " regardless of what attitudes one held at the beginning of the iraq war , we now have a joint duty to contribute to the establishment of a peaceful and democratic iraq , " said eu parliament president hans-gert poettering after meeting the prime minister . and the head of the european commission jose manuel barroso said a deal may not take long .
" it 's only a matter of some weeks i believe to conclude these negotiations , " barroso told reporters at a joint press conference with al-maliki .
" there are already very concrete details now . "
pipeline plans bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the eu needs reliable supplies for a planned pipeline through turkey the eu 's interest in iraq goes well beyond idealistic talk about peace and democracy .
brussels is looking to the country to help diversify its own energy supplies - in particular for its planned nabucco pipeline from turkey to austria . the eu hopes that the pipeline , which is scheduled to come online in 2013 , will help ease its dependency on russia , from which the bloc currently gets roughly a quarter of its natural gas . but in order for the pipeline to be commercially viable , the eu must ensure it receives sufficient supplies of gas from the middle east .
russia is skeptical about the bloc 's ability to do that . " the only way to fill nabucco is to rely on iranian gas , " russia 's ambassador to the eu , vladimir chizov , told reporters ahead of al-maliki 's visit .
" but then it 's up to west to make up its mind how to deal with iran - either bomb iran or buy its gas . " but the eu hopes that iraq will become politically stable enough to connect up gas fields in the west of the country , enabling baghdad to supply gas to nabucco . al-maliki told eu parliamentarians on wednesday that iraq 's policy of national reconciliation was proving a success and that he did not expect a sudden withdrawal of us forces , which might plunge iraq into chaos . he also that his country would soon pass long-awaited national gas and oil legislation that could provide the legal framework for closer ties between iraq and the eu on energy . dw staff -lrb- jc -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

there 's a strong sense here that together , the united states and the catholic church overcame communism .
john paul ii is particularly admired .
his election is seen in relation to solidarnosc in poland , gorbachev , the fall of the berlin wall , a unified europe and victory over the warsaw pact . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : michael schapfel is pastor to german-speaking christians in washington greater washington is home to a very traditional church for german standards .
it takes its cue from rome and listens to what is said there .
the community was very happy about the election of the new pope , and is now waiting to see what message he brings to the united states . is the fact that pope benedict xvi is a german particularly important for the german congregation in washington ? yes , it plays a big role for a lot of our people .
many of them come from bavaria and even the region where he was born .
but the pope is n't coming to the usa to visit us germans .
the german congregation in washington does not have a special role to play in the visit . what is the make-up of your congregation ? there 's quite a large , lively community of german-speaking catholics in washington .
it 's mainly made up of two different groups .
there are those people who have worked here for many years or even decades , or who 've married someone here or plan on spending the rest of their lives here .
then there are those who are only here for a few years .
that group is mostly diplomats , army personnel or business people .
so we have a firm basis for the community , as well as a regular influx of new faces . how does german catholicism differ from catholicism in the us ? it probably does n't differ as much as you might think .
the catholic church is universal .
the celebration of mass , the sacraments and the teachings are the same all over the world .
only the language is different .
but in comparison to other local american churches , people often say they find our german community more relaxed , open , and maybe more strongly family and youth-oriented .
but that comes from the fact that our community has a different age structure . what is your view on ecumenism ? american catholics always notice how we germans see it as natural for catholics and other christians to be in touch with each other , visit each other and take part in events together .
and here in our community , ecumenism is perhaps even more pronounced than it is in germany , because the local german congregation does n't want to separate everything according to confession .
the close relationship between catholic and protestant christians has a lot to do with our history .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de iraq -pipe- 16.04.2008 bundestag to examine us-german intelligence fiasco on iraq großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : an iraqi refugee to germany with the codename " curveball " provided false info about iraq on april 23 , a committee of german lawmakers will examine how false information passed on by the german intelligence service helped the us justify the war in iraq .
dw-world.de spoke with the committee 's vice chairman . earlier this month , the german news magazine der spiegel published a series of articles revealing that a german source was behind erroneous information about mobile chemical weapons factories in iraq under saddam hussein . the information , famously used by colin powell in his 2003 speech to the un laying out the bush administration 's case for war with iraq , came from an iraqi refugee to germany , who was given the retrospectively ironic codename " curveball . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the source , an iraqi refugee , fabricated a story about mobile chemical weapons factories curveball claimed to have been a chemical engineer but was actually a fake .
nonetheless the german intelligence service , the bnd , passed on what he said to washington .
was this a case of germany publicly opposing the war while placating the us behind-the-scenes by providing the bush government with a pretense for commencing hostilities ? the vice-chairman of the bundestag 's supervisory committee for the bnd , free democrat max stadler , is one of the parliamentarians who will try to resolve that question .
but , as he told dw-world.de , answers and possible action are a long way off . dw-world.de : who is the committee planning to interview in this affair ? stadler : no one .
the way this committee works is that the government reports on all matters relevant to the german intelligence service .
the curveball affair attracted a lot of attention in the press so that will , of course , be part of the report .
we are n't having witnesses testify .
that right is reserved for a special investigations committee , not the supervisory committee . the spiegel report gives the impression that the bnd gave washington information it suspected might be unreliable .
is that your impression as well ?
that 's precisely the reason , in my opinion , that the affair needs to be taken up in the supervisory committee .
this impression has in fact been made in the press .
on the other hand , the reports also state that the bnd under the previous german government sent a letter to the effect that the information from curveball had n't been checked out or confirmed by a second source .
the letter said , insofar as i understand it , that -lsb- the german government -rsb- could not guarantee the information was reliable .
the committee is going to take another look at that .
but what you said about the general impression one gets from the media reports is correct . lawrence wilkerson , the chief of staff to former secretary of state colin powell , has accused the bnd of hindering cia attempts to question curveball and of therefore being partially responsible for the iraq war .
that 's a fairly serious charge , is n't it ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : colin powell cited the bogus info in urging for war i do n't know precisely how things developed .
i 'll have to wait for the hearing next week before i can say anything about that .
but i would say , generally speaking , that the iraq war was a long time coming .
much of the opinion in the us had been formed before the curveball testimony .
i personally can not imagine that one intelligence report from germany would have been the all-decisive factor for the american government back then . german officially refused to join the us-led coalition in iraq .
but reports repeatedly surface about germany sharing intelligence with the us and thereby helping america in that conflict .
does that amount to taking part in the war via the back door ? that 's precisely what the bnd investigations committee is looking into .
the issue came up two years ago , when it became known that two bnd officials were active in baghdad .
the government said they were acting in the national interest .
but the government also said the officials reported back information to their central headquarters that was then passed on to the americans .
the government says that 's perfectly normal .
my personal opinion is that this does represent , if only marginally , an intervention in the iraq war - and it certainly contrasts with what the previous spd-green government was telling the public at the time .
and precisely the question of whether the government said one thing while doing another will be a question for the investigation committee .
germany 's participation may have been slight , confined to the passing-on of information .
but when you consider how heavily the governing coalition back then featured opposition to the war in their election campaign , the two things do n't really add up . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some estimates say the war has killed more than a million people what can the supervisory committee do , if it concludes that the bnd or the government acted improperly ? in principle , the supervisory committee is pledged to secrecy .
even in cases of impropriety , we are n't allowed to make public statements .
but there is an exception .
if two-thirds of the committee members think it 's necessary , we can issue a public evaluation .
members of the opposition parties , though , are not particularly happy about this rule .
we think members of opposition parties should have also have the opportunity to issue dissenting evaluations .
but we 'll see after the meeting whether there is a two-thirds majority for making such a public statement . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : stadler is the supervisory committee 's vice chairman so the basic function of the supervisory committee is to make recommendations to the government . yes , our recommendations go straight to the government and are not usually made public .
but recently the committee has made more and more use of the two-thirds option .
and that could well be the case again . generally speaking , intelligence services - and especially us intelligence services - did n't do a very good job getting quality information about iraq .
how can this situation be improved so that in the future we do n't wage war because of non-existent weapons of mass destruction ? i think it 's high time that politicians recognize that intelligence services have a servile function .
they 're supposed to deliver information that makes it easier to take decisions .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de iraq -pipe- 16.04.2008 bundestag to examine us-german intelligence fiasco on iraq großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : an iraqi refugee to germany with the codename " curveball " provided false info about iraq on april 23 , a committee of german lawmakers will examine how false information passed on by the german intelligence service helped the us justify the war in iraq .
dw-world.de spoke with the committee 's vice chairman . earlier this month , the german news magazine der spiegel published a series of articles revealing that a german source was behind erroneous information about mobile chemical weapons factories in iraq under saddam hussein . the information , famously used by colin powell in his 2003 speech to the un laying out the bush administration 's case for war with iraq , came from an iraqi refugee to germany , who was given the retrospectively ironic codename " curveball . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the source , an iraqi refugee , fabricated a story about mobile chemical weapons factories curveball claimed to have been a chemical engineer but was actually a fake .
nonetheless the german intelligence service , the bnd , passed on what he said to washington .
was this a case of germany publicly opposing the war while placating the us behind-the-scenes by providing the bush government with a pretense for commencing hostilities ? the vice-chairman of the bundestag 's supervisory committee for the bnd , free democrat max stadler , is one of the parliamentarians who will try to resolve that question .
but , as he told dw-world.de , answers and possible action are a long way off . dw-world.de : who is the committee planning to interview in this affair ? stadler : no one .
the way this committee works is that the government reports on all matters relevant to the german intelligence service .
the curveball affair attracted a lot of attention in the press so that will , of course , be part of the report .
we are n't having witnesses testify .
that right is reserved for a special investigations committee , not the supervisory committee . the spiegel report gives the impression that the bnd gave washington information it suspected might be unreliable .
is that your impression as well ?
that 's precisely the reason , in my opinion , that the affair needs to be taken up in the supervisory committee .
this impression has in fact been made in the press .
on the other hand , the reports also state that the bnd under the previous german government sent a letter to the effect that the information from curveball had n't been checked out or confirmed by a second source .
the letter said , insofar as i understand it , that -lsb- the german government -rsb- could not guarantee the information was reliable .
the committee is going to take another look at that .
but what you said about the general impression one gets from the media reports is correct . lawrence wilkerson , the chief of staff to former secretary of state colin powell , has accused the bnd of hindering cia attempts to question curveball and of therefore being partially responsible for the iraq war .
that 's a fairly serious charge , is n't it ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : colin powell cited the bogus info in urging for war i do n't know precisely how things developed .
i 'll have to wait for the hearing next week before i can say anything about that .
but i would say , generally speaking , that the iraq war was a long time coming .
much of the opinion in the us had been formed before the curveball testimony .
i personally can not imagine that one intelligence report from germany would have been the all-decisive factor for the american government back then . german officially refused to join the us-led coalition in iraq .
but reports repeatedly surface about germany sharing intelligence with the us and thereby helping america in that conflict .
does that amount to taking part in the war via the back door ? that 's precisely what the bnd investigations committee is looking into .
the issue came up two years ago , when it became known that two bnd officials were active in baghdad .
the government said they were acting in the national interest .
but the government also said the officials reported back information to their central headquarters that was then passed on to the americans .
the government says that 's perfectly normal .
my personal opinion is that this does represent , if only marginally , an intervention in the iraq war - and it certainly contrasts with what the previous spd-green government was telling the public at the time .
and precisely the question of whether the government said one thing while doing another will be a question for the investigation committee .
germany 's participation may have been slight , confined to the passing-on of information .
but when you consider how heavily the governing coalition back then featured opposition to the war in their election campaign , the two things do n't really add up . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some estimates say the war has killed more than a million people what can the supervisory committee do , if it concludes that the bnd or the government acted improperly ? in principle , the supervisory committee is pledged to secrecy .
even in cases of impropriety , we are n't allowed to make public statements .
but there is an exception .
if two-thirds of the committee members think it 's necessary , we can issue a public evaluation .
members of the opposition parties , though , are not particularly happy about this rule .
we think members of opposition parties should have also have the opportunity to issue dissenting evaluations .
but we 'll see after the meeting whether there is a two-thirds majority for making such a public statement . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : stadler is the supervisory committee 's vice chairman so the basic function of the supervisory committee is to make recommendations to the government . yes , our recommendations go straight to the government and are not usually made public .
but recently the committee has made more and more use of the two-thirds option .
and that could well be the case again . generally speaking , intelligence services - and especially us intelligence services - did n't do a very good job getting quality information about iraq .
how can this situation be improved so that in the future we do n't wage war because of non-existent weapons of mass destruction ? i think it 's high time that politicians recognize that intelligence services have a servile function .
they 're supposed to deliver information that makes it easier to take decisions .
but the politicians are the ones who ultimately have to decide .
and maybe they should treat the analyses they get from intelligence services with a bit more scepticism - instead of using them as excuse by saying " we had no other options given the intelligence at our disposal . "

dw-world.de spoke with the committee 's vice chairman . earlier this month , the german news magazine der spiegel published a series of articles revealing that a german source was behind erroneous information about mobile chemical weapons factories in iraq under saddam hussein . the information , famously used by colin powell in his 2003 speech to the un laying out the bush administration 's case for war with iraq , came from an iraqi refugee to germany , who was given the retrospectively ironic codename " curveball . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the source , an iraqi refugee , fabricated a story about mobile chemical weapons factories curveball claimed to have been a chemical engineer but was actually a fake .
nonetheless the german intelligence service , the bnd , passed on what he said to washington .
was this a case of germany publicly opposing the war while placating the us behind-the-scenes by providing the bush government with a pretense for commencing hostilities ? the vice-chairman of the bundestag 's supervisory committee for the bnd , free democrat max stadler , is one of the parliamentarians who will try to resolve that question .
but , as he told dw-world.de , answers and possible action are a long way off . dw-world.de : who is the committee planning to interview in this affair ? stadler : no one .
the way this committee works is that the government reports on all matters relevant to the german intelligence service .
the curveball affair attracted a lot of attention in the press so that will , of course , be part of the report .
we are n't having witnesses testify .
that right is reserved for a special investigations committee , not the supervisory committee . the spiegel report gives the impression that the bnd gave washington information it suspected might be unreliable .
is that your impression as well ?
that 's precisely the reason , in my opinion , that the affair needs to be taken up in the supervisory committee .
this impression has in fact been made in the press .
on the other hand , the reports also state that the bnd under the previous german government sent a letter to the effect that the information from curveball had n't been checked out or confirmed by a second source .
the letter said , insofar as i understand it , that -lsb- the german government -rsb- could not guarantee the information was reliable .
the committee is going to take another look at that .
but what you said about the general impression one gets from the media reports is correct . lawrence wilkerson , the chief of staff to former secretary of state colin powell , has accused the bnd of hindering cia attempts to question curveball and of therefore being partially responsible for the iraq war .
that 's a fairly serious charge , is n't it ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : colin powell cited the bogus info in urging for war i do n't know precisely how things developed .
i 'll have to wait for the hearing next week before i can say anything about that .
but i would say , generally speaking , that the iraq war was a long time coming .
much of the opinion in the us had been formed before the curveball testimony .
i personally can not imagine that one intelligence report from germany would have been the all-decisive factor for the american government back then . german officially refused to join the us-led coalition in iraq .
but reports repeatedly surface about germany sharing intelligence with the us and thereby helping america in that conflict .
does that amount to taking part in the war via the back door ? that 's precisely what the bnd investigations committee is looking into .
the issue came up two years ago , when it became known that two bnd officials were active in baghdad .
the government said they were acting in the national interest .
but the government also said the officials reported back information to their central headquarters that was then passed on to the americans .
the government says that 's perfectly normal .
my personal opinion is that this does represent , if only marginally , an intervention in the iraq war - and it certainly contrasts with what the previous spd-green government was telling the public at the time .
and precisely the question of whether the government said one thing while doing another will be a question for the investigation committee .
germany 's participation may have been slight , confined to the passing-on of information .
but when you consider how heavily the governing coalition back then featured opposition to the war in their election campaign , the two things do n't really add up . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some estimates say the war has killed more than a million people what can the supervisory committee do , if it concludes that the bnd or the government acted improperly ? in principle , the supervisory committee is pledged to secrecy .
even in cases of impropriety , we are n't allowed to make public statements .
but there is an exception .
if two-thirds of the committee members think it 's necessary , we can issue a public evaluation .
members of the opposition parties , though , are not particularly happy about this rule .
we think members of opposition parties should have also have the opportunity to issue dissenting evaluations .
but we 'll see after the meeting whether there is a two-thirds majority for making such a public statement . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : stadler is the supervisory committee 's vice chairman so the basic function of the supervisory committee is to make recommendations to the government . yes , our recommendations go straight to the government and are not usually made public .
but recently the committee has made more and more use of the two-thirds option .
and that could well be the case again . generally speaking , intelligence services - and especially us intelligence services - did n't do a very good job getting quality information about iraq .
how can this situation be improved so that in the future we do n't wage war because of non-existent weapons of mass destruction ? i think it 's high time that politicians recognize that intelligence services have a servile function .
they 're supposed to deliver information that makes it easier to take decisions .
but the politicians are the ones who ultimately have to decide .
and maybe they should treat the analyses they get from intelligence services with a bit more scepticism - instead of using them as excuse by saying " we had no other options given the intelligence at our disposal . "
ultimately , politicians are always free to make up their own minds . jefferson chase send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

nato 's secretary general called on moscow to reverse the measures . " we are concerned about these unilateral decisions , we have always supported georgia 's territorial integrity , " said christina gallach , european union foreign policy chief javier solana 's spokeswoman , on wednesday , april 16 . nato secretary general jaap de hoop scheffer went further , calling on russia to roll back its plans . " i am deeply concerned by the actions russia has taken to establish legal links with the georgian regions of abkhazia and south ossetia , " de hoop scheffer said in a statement .
" i urge the russian federation to reverse these measures , and call on the georgian authorities to continue to show restraint , " he added . earlier in the day , russian president vladimir putin ordered his government to boost ties to abkhazia and south ossetia , including recognizing businesses and organizations registered in the regions .
russia 's backyard " this is an attempt to legalize the annexation of two georgian regions , " georgian foreign minister david bakradze said in a statement .
" it contradicts all international laws .

they are economically dependent on russia . moscow 's move comes two weeks after nato provoked the kremlin 's anger by agreeing at a summit in bucharest that georgia would eventually join the alliance .

but what are the real prospects ? maliki spent the morning of wednesday , april 16 , conferring with various eu officials . " we do hope this meeting will result in new steps of cooperation between iraq and eu countries , especially regarding contributing to our oil and gas sectors , " al-maliki said . the eu is , after the us , the second-largest importer of iraqi oil and natural gas .
but despite the country 's immense natural resources , iraq 's energy sector is still struggling to recover from years of sanctions and damage wrought by war - including , of course , the us-led invasion of 2003 . eu officials welcomed al-maliki 's remarks . " regardless of what attitudes one held at the beginning of the iraq war , we now have a joint duty to contribute to the establishment of a peaceful and democratic iraq , " said eu parliament president hans-gert poettering after meeting the prime minister . and the head of the european commission jose manuel barroso said a deal may not take long .
" it 's only a matter of some weeks i believe to conclude these negotiations , " barroso told reporters at a joint press conference with al-maliki .
" there are already very concrete details now . "
pipeline plans bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the eu needs reliable supplies for a planned pipeline through turkey the eu 's interest in iraq goes well beyond idealistic talk about peace and democracy .
brussels is looking to the country to help diversify its own energy supplies - in particular for its planned nabucco pipeline from turkey to austria . the eu hopes that the pipeline , which is scheduled to come online in 2013 , will help ease its dependency on russia , from which the bloc currently gets roughly a quarter of its natural gas . but in order for the pipeline to be commercially viable , the eu must ensure it receives sufficient supplies of gas from the middle east .
russia is skeptical about the bloc 's ability to do that . " the only way to fill nabucco is to rely on iranian gas , " russia 's ambassador to the eu , vladimir chizov , told reporters ahead of al-maliki 's visit .
" but then it 's up to west to make up its mind how to deal with iran - either bomb iran or buy its gas . " but the eu hopes that iraq will become politically stable enough to connect up gas fields in the west of the country , enabling baghdad to supply gas to nabucco . al-maliki told eu parliamentarians on wednesday that iraq 's policy of national reconciliation was proving a success and that he did not expect a sudden withdrawal of us forces , which might plunge iraq into chaos . he also that his country would soon pass long-awaited national gas and oil legislation that could provide the legal framework for closer ties between iraq and the eu on energy . dw staff -lrb- jc -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

but some politicians doubt whether the proposed law meets strict rules mandated by the country 's highest court . germany 's social democrats -lrb- spd -rrb- parliamentary group said it would not blindly pass a law formulating new guidelines for the surveillance of personal computers in cases of suspected terrorism or other serious crimes . " we are going to carefully review whether the legislative draft corresponds with the restrictive parameters laid out by germany 's constitutional court , and reserve the right to veto , " the group 's expert on domestic affairs , klaus-uwe benneter , told the daily berliner zeitung on wednesday , april 16 . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : authorities wo n't be allowed to handle suspects ' computers to install spy software he said regular , careful monitoring would have to occur to ensure that the proposed law is properly applied .
he also said those who have been under surveillance must also be informed that their computers were examined . staying the course germany 's christian democrats -lrb- cdu -rrb- , with whom the social democrats are in a ruling coalition , have called on the spd to agree to the guidelines .
wolfgang bosbach , the cdu 's deputy parliamentary leader , told the newspaper , " when the spd continues to stir things up , people would begin throwing up their hands in frustration - they would n't understand it . " bosbach said the cdu had already met the spd half-way .
interior minister wolfgang schauble , a cdu member , had already conceded by revoking his wish to allow police to enter suspects ' apartments to install spy software on their computers , bosbach told public broadcaster ard tuesday evening . the spd had rejected that measure , which did not make it into the final version of the proposed law . opposition parties also issued their displeasure with the proposal . " piece by piece , our privacy is obviously dying , " green party member hans-christian stroebele told ard . only under special circumstances in february , the nation 's highest court established that the privacy of data stored or exchanged on personal computers is a basic right protected by the constitution ; surveillance is therefore permitted only in exceptional cases . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the cdu 's bosbach said the spd should stay the agreed-to course interior minister wolfgang schaeuble and justice minister brigitte zypries said on tuesday that they had agreed on the new framework to conform with that legal ruling from the court . it was the last hurdle in putting together new guidelines for germany 's domestic intelligence services , which will now be sent to the country 's states for further discussion . schaeuble 's spokesperson said that once the drafted law had gone to the states , it could then be presented to the cabinet before the summer recess . dw staff -lrb- als -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

there 's a strong sense here that together , the united states and the catholic church overcame communism .
john paul ii is particularly admired .
his election is seen in relation to solidarnosc in poland , gorbachev , the fall of the berlin wall , a unified europe and victory over the warsaw pact . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : michael schapfel is pastor to german-speaking christians in washington greater washington is home to a very traditional church for german standards .
it takes its cue from rome and listens to what is said there .
the community was very happy about the election of the new pope , and is now waiting to see what message he brings to the united states . is the fact that pope benedict xvi is a german particularly important for the german congregation in washington ? yes , it plays a big role for a lot of our people .
many of them come from bavaria and even the region where he was born .
but the pope is n't coming to the usa to visit us germans .
the german congregation in washington does not have a special role to play in the visit . what is the make-up of your congregation ? there 's quite a large , lively community of german-speaking catholics in washington .
it 's mainly made up of two different groups .
there are those people who have worked here for many years or even decades , or who 've married someone here or plan on spending the rest of their lives here .
then there are those who are only here for a few years .
that group is mostly diplomats , army personnel or business people .
so we have a firm basis for the community , as well as a regular influx of new faces . how does german catholicism differ from catholicism in the us ? it probably does n't differ as much as you might think .
the catholic church is universal .
the celebration of mass , the sacraments and the teachings are the same all over the world .
only the language is different .
but in comparison to other local american churches , people often say they find our german community more relaxed , open , and maybe more strongly family and youth-oriented .
but that comes from the fact that our community has a different age structure . what is your view on ecumenism ? american catholics always notice how we germans see it as natural for catholics and other christians to be in touch with each other , visit each other and take part in events together .
and here in our community , ecumenism is perhaps even more pronounced than it is in germany , because the local german congregation does n't want to separate everything according to confession .
the close relationship between catholic and protestant christians has a lot to do with our history .
after all , we come from the country of the reformation . interview : victoria von gottberg -lrb- dc -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

beijing 's reaction to the protests in tibet has prompted germans to call for a boycott of the olympics and economic sanctions .
business representatives are now asking people to consider the consequences of such a move . so far , alexandra voss has n't noticed a mood change among her chinese business partners .
they 're still interested in german companies for their reliability , know-how and state-of-the-art technology .
on a private level , however , the executive director of the german chamber of commerce in the southern chinese city of guangzhou sees things differently . " my chinese acquaintances are a little irritated , " she said .
" they feel that the west in general fails to understand the chinese perspective . " it 's a sentiment that could soon spread and lead to lasting damage in sino-german business ties - and bilateral relations in general , should german calls for an olympic boycott and economic sanctions continue , according to some of germany 's business leaders . " curtailing business ties would clearly hurt the german economy , and therefore all of us , " juergen hambrecht , the head of chemical giant basf , told german daily handelsblatt . hurting the small guy hambrecht clearly has an interest in good relations with china .
his company is already one of the biggest foreign investors in the country and just announced plans to invest billions more in the coming years .
more than 3,000 german firms are currently doing business in china , and german exports to the country amounted to 54 billion euros -lrb- $ 85.9 billion -rrb- in 2007 . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : prices for shoes made in china are hard to beat but rather than mainly hurt german companies looking for business opportunities in the world 's most populous nation , consumers looking for anything from toothbrushes to televisions would also have to bear the brunt of a boycott . " prices for consumer goods would rise in germany , " said tim glaser , the executive director of the german-chinese business association .
" an economic boycott would n't hurt china . " promoting human rights - but how ? some say that people will have to be willing to pay higher prices to take a stand on human rights . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : should germans avoid spending their money on products made in china ?
" a consumer can show solidarity and say : yes , i 'm ready to do my part and pay more to put pressure on china , " thomas mann , a european parliamentarian and member of german chancellor angela merkel 's christian democratic union , told german daily die welt . but boycotting products " made in china " is not necessarily the best way to do that , said petra herkert , a business professor and head of the china institute at furtwangen university in southwestern germany . " german companies in china certainly take steps , such as providing clean toilets and paying decent wages , to show that they 're supporting human rights within the country , " she said . room for improvement while it was certainly appropriate to consider economic sanctions in cases of blatant illegal activity , such as forced labor or product piracy , a political approach would be a much better way right now , herkert added . " we should n't risk pushing china into a new isolation , " she said . glaser of the german-chinese business association also said that rather than focusing on the current problems in tibet , the west should acknowledge china 's achievements over the past 30 years and help china improve the situation . " people should realize that china has become a victim of its own success , " said glaser , whose organization has about 350 members . " china is on the right track .
of course there is room for improvement , but public accusations will likely lead to a hardening of the chinese position . " keep talking that 's also a concern for monika staerk , the executive director of the german asia-pacific business association -lrb- oav -rrb- , a privately held organization that supports german companies doing business in asia . " we 're in the process of gambling away a lot right now , " staerk said .
" this is n't just about limiting sales losses .
we 're smashing trust , reputation and mutual respect in terms of a political and societal dialog . " bildunterschrift : german chancellor angela merkel 's reportedly had some frank discussions with her chinese counterpart back in guangzhou , voss also said that germany should continue to lobby for a peaceful solution to the situation in tibet .
but telling chinese leaders to meet with the dalai lama ahead of the olympics , as german education minister annette schavan recently did on a trip to beijing , was not the smartest thing to do , she added . " i do n't think that 's very helpful , " voss said .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de iraq -pipe- 16.04.2008 bundestag to examine us-german intelligence fiasco on iraq großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : an iraqi refugee to germany with the codename " curveball " provided false info about iraq on april 23 , a committee of german lawmakers will examine how false information passed on by the german intelligence service helped the us justify the war in iraq .
dw-world.de spoke with the committee 's vice chairman . earlier this month , the german news magazine der spiegel published a series of articles revealing that a german source was behind erroneous information about mobile chemical weapons factories in iraq under saddam hussein . the information , famously used by colin powell in his 2003 speech to the un laying out the bush administration 's case for war with iraq , came from an iraqi refugee to germany , who was given the retrospectively ironic codename " curveball . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the source , an iraqi refugee , fabricated a story about mobile chemical weapons factories curveball claimed to have been a chemical engineer but was actually a fake .
nonetheless the german intelligence service , the bnd , passed on what he said to washington .
was this a case of germany publicly opposing the war while placating the us behind-the-scenes by providing the bush government with a pretense for commencing hostilities ? the vice-chairman of the bundestag 's supervisory committee for the bnd , free democrat max stadler , is one of the parliamentarians who will try to resolve that question .
but , as he told dw-world.de , answers and possible action are a long way off . dw-world.de : who is the committee planning to interview in this affair ? stadler : no one .
the way this committee works is that the government reports on all matters relevant to the german intelligence service .
the curveball affair attracted a lot of attention in the press so that will , of course , be part of the report .
we are n't having witnesses testify .
that right is reserved for a special investigations committee , not the supervisory committee . the spiegel report gives the impression that the bnd gave washington information it suspected might be unreliable .
is that your impression as well ?
that 's precisely the reason , in my opinion , that the affair needs to be taken up in the supervisory committee .
this impression has in fact been made in the press .
on the other hand , the reports also state that the bnd under the previous german government sent a letter to the effect that the information from curveball had n't been checked out or confirmed by a second source .
the letter said , insofar as i understand it , that -lsb- the german government -rsb- could not guarantee the information was reliable .
the committee is going to take another look at that .
but what you said about the general impression one gets from the media reports is correct . lawrence wilkerson , the chief of staff to former secretary of state colin powell , has accused the bnd of hindering cia attempts to question curveball and of therefore being partially responsible for the iraq war .
that 's a fairly serious charge , is n't it ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : colin powell cited the bogus info in urging for war i do n't know precisely how things developed .
i 'll have to wait for the hearing next week before i can say anything about that .
but i would say , generally speaking , that the iraq war was a long time coming .
much of the opinion in the us had been formed before the curveball testimony .
i personally can not imagine that one intelligence report from germany would have been the all-decisive factor for the american government back then . german officially refused to join the us-led coalition in iraq .
but reports repeatedly surface about germany sharing intelligence with the us and thereby helping america in that conflict .
does that amount to taking part in the war via the back door ? that 's precisely what the bnd investigations committee is looking into .
the issue came up two years ago , when it became known that two bnd officials were active in baghdad .
the government said they were acting in the national interest .
but the government also said the officials reported back information to their central headquarters that was then passed on to the americans .
the government says that 's perfectly normal .
my personal opinion is that this does represent , if only marginally , an intervention in the iraq war - and it certainly contrasts with what the previous spd-green government was telling the public at the time .
and precisely the question of whether the government said one thing while doing another will be a question for the investigation committee .
germany 's participation may have been slight , confined to the passing-on of information .
but when you consider how heavily the governing coalition back then featured opposition to the war in their election campaign , the two things do n't really add up . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some estimates say the war has killed more than a million people what can the supervisory committee do , if it concludes that the bnd or the government acted improperly ? in principle , the supervisory committee is pledged to secrecy .
even in cases of impropriety , we are n't allowed to make public statements .
but there is an exception .
if two-thirds of the committee members think it 's necessary , we can issue a public evaluation .
members of the opposition parties , though , are not particularly happy about this rule .
we think members of opposition parties should have also have the opportunity to issue dissenting evaluations .
but we 'll see after the meeting whether there is a two-thirds majority for making such a public statement . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : stadler is the supervisory committee 's vice chairman so the basic function of the supervisory committee is to make recommendations to the government . yes , our recommendations go straight to the government and are not usually made public .
but recently the committee has made more and more use of the two-thirds option .
and that could well be the case again . generally speaking , intelligence services - and especially us intelligence services - did n't do a very good job getting quality information about iraq .
how can this situation be improved so that in the future we do n't wage war because of non-existent weapons of mass destruction ? i think it 's high time that politicians recognize that intelligence services have a servile function .
they 're supposed to deliver information that makes it easier to take decisions .
but the politicians are the ones who ultimately have to decide .
and maybe they should treat the analyses they get from intelligence services with a bit more scepticism - instead of using them as excuse by saying " we had no other options given the intelligence at our disposal . "
ultimately , politicians are always free to make up their own minds . jefferson chase send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

that 's a fairly serious charge , is n't it ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : colin powell cited the bogus info in urging for war i do n't know precisely how things developed .
i 'll have to wait for the hearing next week before i can say anything about that .
but i would say , generally speaking , that the iraq war was a long time coming .
much of the opinion in the us had been formed before the curveball testimony .
i personally can not imagine that one intelligence report from germany would have been the all-decisive factor for the american government back then . german officially refused to join the us-led coalition in iraq .
but reports repeatedly surface about germany sharing intelligence with the us and thereby helping america in that conflict .
does that amount to taking part in the war via the back door ? that 's precisely what the bnd investigations committee is looking into .
the issue came up two years ago , when it became known that two bnd officials were active in baghdad .
the government said they were acting in the national interest .
but the government also said the officials reported back information to their central headquarters that was then passed on to the americans .
the government says that 's perfectly normal .
my personal opinion is that this does represent , if only marginally , an intervention in the iraq war - and it certainly contrasts with what the previous spd-green government was telling the public at the time .
and precisely the question of whether the government said one thing while doing another will be a question for the investigation committee .
germany 's participation may have been slight , confined to the passing-on of information .
but when you consider how heavily the governing coalition back then featured opposition to the war in their election campaign , the two things do n't really add up . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some estimates say the war has killed more than a million people what can the supervisory committee do , if it concludes that the bnd or the government acted improperly ? in principle , the supervisory committee is pledged to secrecy .
even in cases of impropriety , we are n't allowed to make public statements .
but there is an exception .
if two-thirds of the committee members think it 's necessary , we can issue a public evaluation .
members of the opposition parties , though , are not particularly happy about this rule .
we think members of opposition parties should have also have the opportunity to issue dissenting evaluations .
but we 'll see after the meeting whether there is a two-thirds majority for making such a public statement . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : stadler is the supervisory committee 's vice chairman so the basic function of the supervisory committee is to make recommendations to the government . yes , our recommendations go straight to the government and are not usually made public .
but recently the committee has made more and more use of the two-thirds option .
and that could well be the case again . generally speaking , intelligence services - and especially us intelligence services - did n't do a very good job getting quality information about iraq .
how can this situation be improved so that in the future we do n't wage war because of non-existent weapons of mass destruction ? i think it 's high time that politicians recognize that intelligence services have a servile function .
they 're supposed to deliver information that makes it easier to take decisions .
but the politicians are the ones who ultimately have to decide .
and maybe they should treat the analyses they get from intelligence services with a bit more scepticism - instead of using them as excuse by saying " we had no other options given the intelligence at our disposal . "
ultimately , politicians are always free to make up their own minds . jefferson chase send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

there 's a strong sense here that together , the united states and the catholic church overcame communism .
john paul ii is particularly admired .
his election is seen in relation to solidarnosc in poland , gorbachev , the fall of the berlin wall , a unified europe and victory over the warsaw pact . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : michael schapfel is pastor to german-speaking christians in washington greater washington is home to a very traditional church for german standards .
it takes its cue from rome and listens to what is said there .
the community was very happy about the election of the new pope , and is now waiting to see what message he brings to the united states . is the fact that pope benedict xvi is a german particularly important for the german congregation in washington ? yes , it plays a big role for a lot of our people .
many of them come from bavaria and even the region where he was born .
but the pope is n't coming to the usa to visit us germans .
the german congregation in washington does not have a special role to play in the visit . what is the make-up of your congregation ? there 's quite a large , lively community of german-speaking catholics in washington .
it 's mainly made up of two different groups .
there are those people who have worked here for many years or even decades , or who 've married someone here or plan on spending the rest of their lives here .
then there are those who are only here for a few years .
that group is mostly diplomats , army personnel or business people .
so we have a firm basis for the community , as well as a regular influx of new faces . how does german catholicism differ from catholicism in the us ? it probably does n't differ as much as you might think .
the catholic church is universal .
the celebration of mass , the sacraments and the teachings are the same all over the world .
only the language is different .
but in comparison to other local american churches , people often say they find our german community more relaxed , open , and maybe more strongly family and youth-oriented .
but that comes from the fact that our community has a different age structure . what is your view on ecumenism ? american catholics always notice how we germans see it as natural for catholics and other christians to be in touch with each other , visit each other and take part in events together .
and here in our community , ecumenism is perhaps even more pronounced than it is in germany , because the local german congregation does n't want to separate everything according to confession .
the close relationship between catholic and protestant christians has a lot to do with our history .
after all , we come from the country of the reformation . interview : victoria von gottberg -lrb- dc -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

according to the latest reports from the newsmagazine that broke the story about lidl , it 's happening at companies all over germany . german news weekly stern reported on wednesday that invasive employee monitoring is common practice at other retailers , including penny , netto , norma , edeka , plus , rewe , hagebau and famila .
as was the case with lidl , the retailers routinely printed up pages of notes detailing intimate aspects of their employee 's lives . the magazine said that , nationwide , detective agencies have sprung up which specialize in helping employers spy on their staff , including " detailed written observation reports . " stern quoted the manager of a supermarket discounter who said that the detective agencies are extremely competitive . " many try to set themselves apart by offering additional services , " the manager was quoted as saying .
" i was offered such protocols more times than i can count . " the manager confirmed that spying efforts were intensified when there were suspicions that certain employees were attempting to organize a union . " every measure is used in order to prevent a works council from forming , " the source told stern . workers outside the retail sector also have reason to fear for their privacy .

perhaps germans would have more sex if they knocked off the heavy foods . early in his career , britain 's jamie oliver was known as the " naked chef " for his love of simple , stripped-down food .
but in an interview with the german edition of men 's health magazine , oliver offered his views not just on cuisine , but coitus .
when asked what he would cook for a hot date , oliver said it did n't really matter as long as the main dish was n't heavy .
" you wo n't get anywhere afterward if you 've eaten a huge curry or a stew with dumplings , " the star chef opined .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hey , oliver , whose dumplings are you running down ?
come again , readers in germany must be thinking .
the next thing you 'll be telling us is that beer is bad for your sex life .
germans are particularly fond of their dumplings , called alternately kloesse or knoedel - which are balls of grated potatoes or bread held together with egg yolk and other sticky stuff .
according to oliver , you 're better off lightly dining on greens before a roll in the hay rather than stuffing your face with carbohydrates .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : sauerkraut and dumplings - a form of birth control there was no immediate word on whether portly men around germany had taken umbrage at oliver casting aspersions on their , er , knoedel , but maybe central europeans should listen to the chef 's advice .
with birth rates plummeting , germans need all the help they can get to get in the sack more often .
and oliver is not only a famous television chef .
he 's also married to a model .

there 's a strong sense here that together , the united states and the catholic church overcame communism .
john paul ii is particularly admired .
his election is seen in relation to solidarnosc in poland , gorbachev , the fall of the berlin wall , a unified europe and victory over the warsaw pact . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : michael schapfel is pastor to german-speaking christians in washington greater washington is home to a very traditional church for german standards .
it takes its cue from rome and listens to what is said there .
the community was very happy about the election of the new pope , and is now waiting to see what message he brings to the united states . is the fact that pope benedict xvi is a german particularly important for the german congregation in washington ? yes , it plays a big role for a lot of our people .
many of them come from bavaria and even the region where he was born .
but the pope is n't coming to the usa to visit us germans .
the german congregation in washington does not have a special role to play in the visit . what is the make-up of your congregation ? there 's quite a large , lively community of german-speaking catholics in washington .
it 's mainly made up of two different groups .
there are those people who have worked here for many years or even decades , or who 've married someone here or plan on spending the rest of their lives here .
then there are those who are only here for a few years .
that group is mostly diplomats , army personnel or business people .
so we have a firm basis for the community , as well as a regular influx of new faces . how does german catholicism differ from catholicism in the us ? it probably does n't differ as much as you might think .
the catholic church is universal .
the celebration of mass , the sacraments and the teachings are the same all over the world .
only the language is different .
but in comparison to other local american churches , people often say they find our german community more relaxed , open , and maybe more strongly family and youth-oriented .
but that comes from the fact that our community has a different age structure . what is your view on ecumenism ? american catholics always notice how we germans see it as natural for catholics and other christians to be in touch with each other , visit each other and take part in events together .
and here in our community , ecumenism is perhaps even more pronounced than it is in germany , because the local german congregation does n't want to separate everything according to confession .
the close relationship between catholic and protestant christians has a lot to do with our history .
after all , we come from the country of the reformation . interview : victoria von gottberg -lrb- dc -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de iraq -pipe- 16.04.2008 bundestag to examine us-german intelligence fiasco on iraq großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : an iraqi refugee to germany with the codename " curveball " provided false info about iraq on april 23 , a committee of german lawmakers will examine how false information passed on by the german intelligence service helped the us justify the war in iraq .
dw-world.de spoke with the committee 's vice chairman . earlier this month , the german news magazine der spiegel published a series of articles revealing that a german source was behind erroneous information about mobile chemical weapons factories in iraq under saddam hussein . the information , famously used by colin powell in his 2003 speech to the un laying out the bush administration 's case for war with iraq , came from an iraqi refugee to germany , who was given the retrospectively ironic codename " curveball . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the source , an iraqi refugee , fabricated a story about mobile chemical weapons factories curveball claimed to have been a chemical engineer but was actually a fake .
nonetheless the german intelligence service , the bnd , passed on what he said to washington .
was this a case of germany publicly opposing the war while placating the us behind-the-scenes by providing the bush government with a pretense for commencing hostilities ? the vice-chairman of the bundestag 's supervisory committee for the bnd , free democrat max stadler , is one of the parliamentarians who will try to resolve that question .
but , as he told dw-world.de , answers and possible action are a long way off . dw-world.de : who is the committee planning to interview in this affair ? stadler : no one .
the way this committee works is that the government reports on all matters relevant to the german intelligence service .
the curveball affair attracted a lot of attention in the press so that will , of course , be part of the report .
we are n't having witnesses testify .
that right is reserved for a special investigations committee , not the supervisory committee . the spiegel report gives the impression that the bnd gave washington information it suspected might be unreliable .
is that your impression as well ?
that 's precisely the reason , in my opinion , that the affair needs to be taken up in the supervisory committee .
this impression has in fact been made in the press .
on the other hand , the reports also state that the bnd under the previous german government sent a letter to the effect that the information from curveball had n't been checked out or confirmed by a second source .
the letter said , insofar as i understand it , that -lsb- the german government -rsb- could not guarantee the information was reliable .
the committee is going to take another look at that .
but what you said about the general impression one gets from the media reports is correct . lawrence wilkerson , the chief of staff to former secretary of state colin powell , has accused the bnd of hindering cia attempts to question curveball and of therefore being partially responsible for the iraq war .
that 's a fairly serious charge , is n't it ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : colin powell cited the bogus info in urging for war i do n't know precisely how things developed .
i 'll have to wait for the hearing next week before i can say anything about that .
but i would say , generally speaking , that the iraq war was a long time coming .
much of the opinion in the us had been formed before the curveball testimony .
i personally can not imagine that one intelligence report from germany would have been the all-decisive factor for the american government back then . german officially refused to join the us-led coalition in iraq .
but reports repeatedly surface about germany sharing intelligence with the us and thereby helping america in that conflict .
does that amount to taking part in the war via the back door ? that 's precisely what the bnd investigations committee is looking into .
the issue came up two years ago , when it became known that two bnd officials were active in baghdad .
the government said they were acting in the national interest .
but the government also said the officials reported back information to their central headquarters that was then passed on to the americans .
the government says that 's perfectly normal .
my personal opinion is that this does represent , if only marginally , an intervention in the iraq war - and it certainly contrasts with what the previous spd-green government was telling the public at the time .
and precisely the question of whether the government said one thing while doing another will be a question for the investigation committee .
germany 's participation may have been slight , confined to the passing-on of information .
but when you consider how heavily the governing coalition back then featured opposition to the war in their election campaign , the two things do n't really add up . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some estimates say the war has killed more than a million people what can the supervisory committee do , if it concludes that the bnd or the government acted improperly ? in principle , the supervisory committee is pledged to secrecy .
even in cases of impropriety , we are n't allowed to make public statements .
but there is an exception .
if two-thirds of the committee members think it 's necessary , we can issue a public evaluation .
members of the opposition parties , though , are not particularly happy about this rule .
we think members of opposition parties should have also have the opportunity to issue dissenting evaluations .
but we 'll see after the meeting whether there is a two-thirds majority for making such a public statement . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : stadler is the supervisory committee 's vice chairman so the basic function of the supervisory committee is to make recommendations to the government . yes , our recommendations go straight to the government and are not usually made public .
but recently the committee has made more and more use of the two-thirds option .
and that could well be the case again . generally speaking , intelligence services - and especially us intelligence services - did n't do a very good job getting quality information about iraq .
how can this situation be improved so that in the future we do n't wage war because of non-existent weapons of mass destruction ? i think it 's high time that politicians recognize that intelligence services have a servile function .
they 're supposed to deliver information that makes it easier to take decisions .
but the politicians are the ones who ultimately have to decide .
and maybe they should treat the analyses they get from intelligence services with a bit more scepticism - instead of using them as excuse by saying " we had no other options given the intelligence at our disposal . "
ultimately , politicians are always free to make up their own minds . jefferson chase send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

beijing 's reaction to the protests in tibet has prompted germans to call for a boycott of the olympics and economic sanctions .
business representatives are now asking people to consider the consequences of such a move . so far , alexandra voss has n't noticed a mood change among her chinese business partners .
they 're still interested in german companies for their reliability , know-how and state-of-the-art technology .
on a private level , however , the executive director of the german chamber of commerce in the southern chinese city of guangzhou sees things differently . " my chinese acquaintances are a little irritated , " she said .
" they feel that the west in general fails to understand the chinese perspective . " it 's a sentiment that could soon spread and lead to lasting damage in sino-german business ties - and bilateral relations in general , should german calls for an olympic boycott and economic sanctions continue , according to some of germany 's business leaders . " curtailing business ties would clearly hurt the german economy , and therefore all of us , " juergen hambrecht , the head of chemical giant basf , told german daily handelsblatt . hurting the small guy hambrecht clearly has an interest in good relations with china .
his company is already one of the biggest foreign investors in the country and just announced plans to invest billions more in the coming years .
more than 3,000 german firms are currently doing business in china , and german exports to the country amounted to 54 billion euros -lrb- $ 85.9 billion -rrb- in 2007 . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : prices for shoes made in china are hard to beat but rather than mainly hurt german companies looking for business opportunities in the world 's most populous nation , consumers looking for anything from toothbrushes to televisions would also have to bear the brunt of a boycott . " prices for consumer goods would rise in germany , " said tim glaser , the executive director of the german-chinese business association .
" an economic boycott would n't hurt china . " promoting human rights - but how ? some say that people will have to be willing to pay higher prices to take a stand on human rights . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : should germans avoid spending their money on products made in china ?
" a consumer can show solidarity and say : yes , i 'm ready to do my part and pay more to put pressure on china , " thomas mann , a european parliamentarian and member of german chancellor angela merkel 's christian democratic union , told german daily die welt . but boycotting products " made in china " is not necessarily the best way to do that , said petra herkert , a business professor and head of the china institute at furtwangen university in southwestern germany . " german companies in china certainly take steps , such as providing clean toilets and paying decent wages , to show that they 're supporting human rights within the country , " she said . room for improvement while it was certainly appropriate to consider economic sanctions in cases of blatant illegal activity , such as forced labor or product piracy , a political approach would be a much better way right now , herkert added . " we should n't risk pushing china into a new isolation , " she said . glaser of the german-chinese business association also said that rather than focusing on the current problems in tibet , the west should acknowledge china 's achievements over the past 30 years and help china improve the situation . " people should realize that china has become a victim of its own success , " said glaser , whose organization has about 350 members . " china is on the right track .
of course there is room for improvement , but public accusations will likely lead to a hardening of the chinese position . " keep talking that 's also a concern for monika staerk , the executive director of the german asia-pacific business association -lrb- oav -rrb- , a privately held organization that supports german companies doing business in asia . " we 're in the process of gambling away a lot right now , " staerk said .
" this is n't just about limiting sales losses .
we 're smashing trust , reputation and mutual respect in terms of a political and societal dialog . " bildunterschrift : german chancellor angela merkel 's reportedly had some frank discussions with her chinese counterpart back in guangzhou , voss also said that germany should continue to lobby for a peaceful solution to the situation in tibet .
but telling chinese leaders to meet with the dalai lama ahead of the olympics , as german education minister annette schavan recently did on a trip to beijing , was not the smartest thing to do , she added . " i do n't think that 's very helpful , " voss said .

but what are the real prospects ? maliki spent the morning of wednesday , april 16 , conferring with various eu officials . " we do hope this meeting will result in new steps of cooperation between iraq and eu countries , especially regarding contributing to our oil and gas sectors , " al-maliki said . the eu is , after the us , the second-largest importer of iraqi oil and natural gas .
but despite the country 's immense natural resources , iraq 's energy sector is still struggling to recover from years of sanctions and damage wrought by war - including , of course , the us-led invasion of 2003 . eu officials welcomed al-maliki 's remarks . " regardless of what attitudes one held at the beginning of the iraq war , we now have a joint duty to contribute to the establishment of a peaceful and democratic iraq , " said eu parliament president hans-gert poettering after meeting the prime minister . and the head of the european commission jose manuel barroso said a deal may not take long .

" there are already very concrete details now . "
pipeline plans bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the eu needs reliable supplies for a planned pipeline through turkey the eu 's interest in iraq goes well beyond idealistic talk about peace and democracy .
brussels is looking to the country to help diversify its own energy supplies - in particular for its planned nabucco pipeline from turkey to austria . the eu hopes that the pipeline , which is scheduled to come online in 2013 , will help ease its dependency on russia , from which the bloc currently gets roughly a quarter of its natural gas . but in order for the pipeline to be commercially viable , the eu must ensure it receives sufficient supplies of gas from the middle east .
russia is skeptical about the bloc 's ability to do that . " the only way to fill nabucco is to rely on iranian gas , " russia 's ambassador to the eu , vladimir chizov , told reporters ahead of al-maliki 's visit .
" but then it 's up to west to make up its mind how to deal with iran - either bomb iran or buy its gas . " but the eu hopes that iraq will become politically stable enough to connect up gas fields in the west of the country , enabling baghdad to supply gas to nabucco . al-maliki told eu parliamentarians on wednesday that iraq 's policy of national reconciliation was proving a success and that he did not expect a sudden withdrawal of us forces , which might plunge iraq into chaos . he also that his country would soon pass long-awaited national gas and oil legislation that could provide the legal framework for closer ties between iraq and the eu on energy . dw staff -lrb- jc -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de religion -pipe- 16.04.2008 german catholics in us eager to hear pope 's message großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : pope benedict xvi will discuss the iraq war and immigration in talks with us president bush as pope benedict xvi began his six-day visit to the united states , dw-world.de spoke with michael schapfel , pastor of washington 's german-speaking catholic community , about german catholics ' expectations for the trip . dw-world.de : reverend schapfel , what are your expectations of the papal visit to the united states ? michael schapfel : many catholic and anglican christians in washington are excited to see the pope .
there 's a strong sense here that together , the united states and the catholic church overcame communism .
john paul ii is particularly admired .
his election is seen in relation to solidarnosc in poland , gorbachev , the fall of the berlin wall , a unified europe and victory over the warsaw pact . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : michael schapfel is pastor to german-speaking christians in washington greater washington is home to a very traditional church for german standards .
it takes its cue from rome and listens to what is said there .
the community was very happy about the election of the new pope , and is now waiting to see what message he brings to the united states . is the fact that pope benedict xvi is a german particularly important for the german congregation in washington ? yes , it plays a big role for a lot of our people .
many of them come from bavaria and even the region where he was born .
but the pope is n't coming to the usa to visit us germans .
the german congregation in washington does not have a special role to play in the visit . what is the make-up of your congregation ? there 's quite a large , lively community of german-speaking catholics in washington .
it 's mainly made up of two different groups .
there are those people who have worked here for many years or even decades , or who 've married someone here or plan on spending the rest of their lives here .
then there are those who are only here for a few years .
that group is mostly diplomats , army personnel or business people .
so we have a firm basis for the community , as well as a regular influx of new faces . how does german catholicism differ from catholicism in the us ? it probably does n't differ as much as you might think .
the catholic church is universal .
the celebration of mass , the sacraments and the teachings are the same all over the world .
only the language is different .
but in comparison to other local american churches , people often say they find our german community more relaxed , open , and maybe more strongly family and youth-oriented .
but that comes from the fact that our community has a different age structure . what is your view on ecumenism ? american catholics always notice how we germans see it as natural for catholics and other christians to be in touch with each other , visit each other and take part in events together .

according to the latest reports from the newsmagazine that broke the story about lidl , it 's happening at companies all over germany . german news weekly stern reported on wednesday that invasive employee monitoring is common practice at other retailers , including penny , netto , norma , edeka , plus , rewe , hagebau and famila .
as was the case with lidl , the retailers routinely printed up pages of notes detailing intimate aspects of their employee 's lives . the magazine said that , nationwide , detective agencies have sprung up which specialize in helping employers spy on their staff , including " detailed written observation reports . " stern quoted the manager of a supermarket discounter who said that the detective agencies are extremely competitive . " many try to set themselves apart by offering additional services , " the manager was quoted as saying .
" i was offered such protocols more times than i can count . " the manager confirmed that spying efforts were intensified when there were suspicions that certain employees were attempting to organize a union . " every measure is used in order to prevent a works council from forming , " the source told stern . workers outside the retail sector also have reason to fear for their privacy .
according to a study by mummert consulting , every third office computer in germany is subject to some sort of monitoring . germany 's federal association of detectives also admitted that 60 to 70 percent of their contracts come from companies , and that the most common request is for the detective to observe employee behavior . dw staff -lrb- dc -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

but what are the real prospects ? maliki spent the morning of wednesday , april 16 , conferring with various eu officials . " we do hope this meeting will result in new steps of cooperation between iraq and eu countries , especially regarding contributing to our oil and gas sectors , " al-maliki said . the eu is , after the us , the second-largest importer of iraqi oil and natural gas .
but despite the country 's immense natural resources , iraq 's energy sector is still struggling to recover from years of sanctions and damage wrought by war - including , of course , the us-led invasion of 2003 . eu officials welcomed al-maliki 's remarks . " regardless of what attitudes one held at the beginning of the iraq war , we now have a joint duty to contribute to the establishment of a peaceful and democratic iraq , " said eu parliament president hans-gert poettering after meeting the prime minister . and the head of the european commission jose manuel barroso said a deal may not take long .
" it 's only a matter of some weeks i believe to conclude these negotiations , " barroso told reporters at a joint press conference with al-maliki .

brussels is looking to the country to help diversify its own energy supplies - in particular for its planned nabucco pipeline from turkey to austria . the eu hopes that the pipeline , which is scheduled to come online in 2013 , will help ease its dependency on russia , from which the bloc currently gets roughly a quarter of its natural gas . but in order for the pipeline to be commercially viable , the eu must ensure it receives sufficient supplies of gas from the middle east .
russia is skeptical about the bloc 's ability to do that . " the only way to fill nabucco is to rely on iranian gas , " russia 's ambassador to the eu , vladimir chizov , told reporters ahead of al-maliki 's visit .
" but then it 's up to west to make up its mind how to deal with iran - either bomb iran or buy its gas . " but the eu hopes that iraq will become politically stable enough to connect up gas fields in the west of the country , enabling baghdad to supply gas to nabucco . al-maliki told eu parliamentarians on wednesday that iraq 's policy of national reconciliation was proving a success and that he did not expect a sudden withdrawal of us forces , which might plunge iraq into chaos . he also that his country would soon pass long-awaited national gas and oil legislation that could provide the legal framework for closer ties between iraq and the eu on energy . dw staff -lrb- jc -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de iraq -pipe- 16.04.2008 bundestag to examine us-german intelligence fiasco on iraq großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : an iraqi refugee to germany with the codename " curveball " provided false info about iraq on april 23 , a committee of german lawmakers will examine how false information passed on by the german intelligence service helped the us justify the war in iraq .
dw-world.de spoke with the committee 's vice chairman . earlier this month , the german news magazine der spiegel published a series of articles revealing that a german source was behind erroneous information about mobile chemical weapons factories in iraq under saddam hussein . the information , famously used by colin powell in his 2003 speech to the un laying out the bush administration 's case for war with iraq , came from an iraqi refugee to germany , who was given the retrospectively ironic codename " curveball . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the source , an iraqi refugee , fabricated a story about mobile chemical weapons factories curveball claimed to have been a chemical engineer but was actually a fake .
nonetheless the german intelligence service , the bnd , passed on what he said to washington .
was this a case of germany publicly opposing the war while placating the us behind-the-scenes by providing the bush government with a pretense for commencing hostilities ? the vice-chairman of the bundestag 's supervisory committee for the bnd , free democrat max stadler , is one of the parliamentarians who will try to resolve that question .
but , as he told dw-world.de , answers and possible action are a long way off . dw-world.de : who is the committee planning to interview in this affair ? stadler : no one .
the way this committee works is that the government reports on all matters relevant to the german intelligence service .
the curveball affair attracted a lot of attention in the press so that will , of course , be part of the report .
we are n't having witnesses testify .
that right is reserved for a special investigations committee , not the supervisory committee . the spiegel report gives the impression that the bnd gave washington information it suspected might be unreliable .
is that your impression as well ?
that 's precisely the reason , in my opinion , that the affair needs to be taken up in the supervisory committee .
this impression has in fact been made in the press .
on the other hand , the reports also state that the bnd under the previous german government sent a letter to the effect that the information from curveball had n't been checked out or confirmed by a second source .
the letter said , insofar as i understand it , that -lsb- the german government -rsb- could not guarantee the information was reliable .
the committee is going to take another look at that .
but what you said about the general impression one gets from the media reports is correct . lawrence wilkerson , the chief of staff to former secretary of state colin powell , has accused the bnd of hindering cia attempts to question curveball and of therefore being partially responsible for the iraq war .
that 's a fairly serious charge , is n't it ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : colin powell cited the bogus info in urging for war i do n't know precisely how things developed .
i 'll have to wait for the hearing next week before i can say anything about that .
but i would say , generally speaking , that the iraq war was a long time coming .
much of the opinion in the us had been formed before the curveball testimony .
i personally can not imagine that one intelligence report from germany would have been the all-decisive factor for the american government back then . german officially refused to join the us-led coalition in iraq .
but reports repeatedly surface about germany sharing intelligence with the us and thereby helping america in that conflict .
does that amount to taking part in the war via the back door ? that 's precisely what the bnd investigations committee is looking into .
the issue came up two years ago , when it became known that two bnd officials were active in baghdad .
the government said they were acting in the national interest .
but the government also said the officials reported back information to their central headquarters that was then passed on to the americans .
the government says that 's perfectly normal .
my personal opinion is that this does represent , if only marginally , an intervention in the iraq war - and it certainly contrasts with what the previous spd-green government was telling the public at the time .
and precisely the question of whether the government said one thing while doing another will be a question for the investigation committee .
germany 's participation may have been slight , confined to the passing-on of information .
but when you consider how heavily the governing coalition back then featured opposition to the war in their election campaign , the two things do n't really add up . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some estimates say the war has killed more than a million people what can the supervisory committee do , if it concludes that the bnd or the government acted improperly ? in principle , the supervisory committee is pledged to secrecy .
even in cases of impropriety , we are n't allowed to make public statements .
but there is an exception .
if two-thirds of the committee members think it 's necessary , we can issue a public evaluation .
members of the opposition parties , though , are not particularly happy about this rule .
we think members of opposition parties should have also have the opportunity to issue dissenting evaluations .
but we 'll see after the meeting whether there is a two-thirds majority for making such a public statement . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : stadler is the supervisory committee 's vice chairman so the basic function of the supervisory committee is to make recommendations to the government . yes , our recommendations go straight to the government and are not usually made public .
but recently the committee has made more and more use of the two-thirds option .
and that could well be the case again . generally speaking , intelligence services - and especially us intelligence services - did n't do a very good job getting quality information about iraq .
how can this situation be improved so that in the future we do n't wage war because of non-existent weapons of mass destruction ? i think it 's high time that politicians recognize that intelligence services have a servile function .
they 're supposed to deliver information that makes it easier to take decisions .
but the politicians are the ones who ultimately have to decide .
and maybe they should treat the analyses they get from intelligence services with a bit more scepticism - instead of using them as excuse by saying " we had no other options given the intelligence at our disposal . "

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de iraq -pipe- 16.04.2008 bundestag to examine us-german intelligence fiasco on iraq großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : an iraqi refugee to germany with the codename " curveball " provided false info about iraq on april 23 , a committee of german lawmakers will examine how false information passed on by the german intelligence service helped the us justify the war in iraq .
dw-world.de spoke with the committee 's vice chairman . earlier this month , the german news magazine der spiegel published a series of articles revealing that a german source was behind erroneous information about mobile chemical weapons factories in iraq under saddam hussein . the information , famously used by colin powell in his 2003 speech to the un laying out the bush administration 's case for war with iraq , came from an iraqi refugee to germany , who was given the retrospectively ironic codename " curveball . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the source , an iraqi refugee , fabricated a story about mobile chemical weapons factories curveball claimed to have been a chemical engineer but was actually a fake .
nonetheless the german intelligence service , the bnd , passed on what he said to washington .
was this a case of germany publicly opposing the war while placating the us behind-the-scenes by providing the bush government with a pretense for commencing hostilities ? the vice-chairman of the bundestag 's supervisory committee for the bnd , free democrat max stadler , is one of the parliamentarians who will try to resolve that question .
but , as he told dw-world.de , answers and possible action are a long way off . dw-world.de : who is the committee planning to interview in this affair ? stadler : no one .
the way this committee works is that the government reports on all matters relevant to the german intelligence service .
the curveball affair attracted a lot of attention in the press so that will , of course , be part of the report .
we are n't having witnesses testify .
that right is reserved for a special investigations committee , not the supervisory committee . the spiegel report gives the impression that the bnd gave washington information it suspected might be unreliable .
is that your impression as well ?
that 's precisely the reason , in my opinion , that the affair needs to be taken up in the supervisory committee .
this impression has in fact been made in the press .
on the other hand , the reports also state that the bnd under the previous german government sent a letter to the effect that the information from curveball had n't been checked out or confirmed by a second source .
the letter said , insofar as i understand it , that -lsb- the german government -rsb- could not guarantee the information was reliable .
the committee is going to take another look at that .
but what you said about the general impression one gets from the media reports is correct . lawrence wilkerson , the chief of staff to former secretary of state colin powell , has accused the bnd of hindering cia attempts to question curveball and of therefore being partially responsible for the iraq war .
that 's a fairly serious charge , is n't it ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : colin powell cited the bogus info in urging for war i do n't know precisely how things developed .
i 'll have to wait for the hearing next week before i can say anything about that .
but i would say , generally speaking , that the iraq war was a long time coming .
much of the opinion in the us had been formed before the curveball testimony .
i personally can not imagine that one intelligence report from germany would have been the all-decisive factor for the american government back then . german officially refused to join the us-led coalition in iraq .
but reports repeatedly surface about germany sharing intelligence with the us and thereby helping america in that conflict .
does that amount to taking part in the war via the back door ? that 's precisely what the bnd investigations committee is looking into .
the issue came up two years ago , when it became known that two bnd officials were active in baghdad .
the government said they were acting in the national interest .
but the government also said the officials reported back information to their central headquarters that was then passed on to the americans .
the government says that 's perfectly normal .
my personal opinion is that this does represent , if only marginally , an intervention in the iraq war - and it certainly contrasts with what the previous spd-green government was telling the public at the time .
and precisely the question of whether the government said one thing while doing another will be a question for the investigation committee .
germany 's participation may have been slight , confined to the passing-on of information .
but when you consider how heavily the governing coalition back then featured opposition to the war in their election campaign , the two things do n't really add up . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some estimates say the war has killed more than a million people what can the supervisory committee do , if it concludes that the bnd or the government acted improperly ? in principle , the supervisory committee is pledged to secrecy .
even in cases of impropriety , we are n't allowed to make public statements .
but there is an exception .
if two-thirds of the committee members think it 's necessary , we can issue a public evaluation .
members of the opposition parties , though , are not particularly happy about this rule .
we think members of opposition parties should have also have the opportunity to issue dissenting evaluations .
but we 'll see after the meeting whether there is a two-thirds majority for making such a public statement . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : stadler is the supervisory committee 's vice chairman so the basic function of the supervisory committee is to make recommendations to the government . yes , our recommendations go straight to the government and are not usually made public .
but recently the committee has made more and more use of the two-thirds option .
and that could well be the case again . generally speaking , intelligence services - and especially us intelligence services - did n't do a very good job getting quality information about iraq .
how can this situation be improved so that in the future we do n't wage war because of non-existent weapons of mass destruction ? i think it 's high time that politicians recognize that intelligence services have a servile function .
they 're supposed to deliver information that makes it easier to take decisions .
but the politicians are the ones who ultimately have to decide .
and maybe they should treat the analyses they get from intelligence services with a bit more scepticism - instead of using them as excuse by saying " we had no other options given the intelligence at our disposal . "
ultimately , politicians are always free to make up their own minds . jefferson chase send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" we do hope this meeting will result in new steps of cooperation between iraq and eu countries , especially regarding contributing to our oil and gas sectors , " al-maliki said . the eu is , after the us , the second-largest importer of iraqi oil and natural gas .

brussels is looking to the country to help diversify its own energy supplies - in particular for its planned nabucco pipeline from turkey to austria . the eu hopes that the pipeline , which is scheduled to come online in 2013 , will help ease its dependency on russia , from which the bloc currently gets roughly a quarter of its natural gas . but in order for the pipeline to be commercially viable , the eu must ensure it receives sufficient supplies of gas from the middle east .
russia is skeptical about the bloc 's ability to do that . " the only way to fill nabucco is to rely on iranian gas , " russia 's ambassador to the eu , vladimir chizov , told reporters ahead of al-maliki 's visit .
" but then it 's up to west to make up its mind how to deal with iran - either bomb iran or buy its gas . " but the eu hopes that iraq will become politically stable enough to connect up gas fields in the west of the country , enabling baghdad to supply gas to nabucco . al-maliki told eu parliamentarians on wednesday that iraq 's policy of national reconciliation was proving a success and that he did not expect a sudden withdrawal of us forces , which might plunge iraq into chaos . he also that his country would soon pass long-awaited national gas and oil legislation that could provide the legal framework for closer ties between iraq and the eu on energy . dw staff -lrb- jc -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

there 's a strong sense here that together , the united states and the catholic church overcame communism .
john paul ii is particularly admired .
his election is seen in relation to solidarnosc in poland , gorbachev , the fall of the berlin wall , a unified europe and victory over the warsaw pact . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : michael schapfel is pastor to german-speaking christians in washington greater washington is home to a very traditional church for german standards .
it takes its cue from rome and listens to what is said there .
the community was very happy about the election of the new pope , and is now waiting to see what message he brings to the united states . is the fact that pope benedict xvi is a german particularly important for the german congregation in washington ? yes , it plays a big role for a lot of our people .
many of them come from bavaria and even the region where he was born .
but the pope is n't coming to the usa to visit us germans .
the german congregation in washington does not have a special role to play in the visit . what is the make-up of your congregation ? there 's quite a large , lively community of german-speaking catholics in washington .
it 's mainly made up of two different groups .
there are those people who have worked here for many years or even decades , or who 've married someone here or plan on spending the rest of their lives here .
then there are those who are only here for a few years .
that group is mostly diplomats , army personnel or business people .
so we have a firm basis for the community , as well as a regular influx of new faces . how does german catholicism differ from catholicism in the us ? it probably does n't differ as much as you might think .
the catholic church is universal .
the celebration of mass , the sacraments and the teachings are the same all over the world .
only the language is different .
but in comparison to other local american churches , people often say they find our german community more relaxed , open , and maybe more strongly family and youth-oriented .
but that comes from the fact that our community has a different age structure . what is your view on ecumenism ? american catholics always notice how we germans see it as natural for catholics and other christians to be in touch with each other , visit each other and take part in events together .
and here in our community , ecumenism is perhaps even more pronounced than it is in germany , because the local german congregation does n't want to separate everything according to confession .
the close relationship between catholic and protestant christians has a lot to do with our history .
after all , we come from the country of the reformation . interview : victoria von gottberg -lrb- dc -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de iraq -pipe- 16.04.2008 bundestag to examine us-german intelligence fiasco on iraq großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : an iraqi refugee to germany with the codename " curveball " provided false info about iraq on april 23 , a committee of german lawmakers will examine how false information passed on by the german intelligence service helped the us justify the war in iraq .
dw-world.de spoke with the committee 's vice chairman . earlier this month , the german news magazine der spiegel published a series of articles revealing that a german source was behind erroneous information about mobile chemical weapons factories in iraq under saddam hussein . the information , famously used by colin powell in his 2003 speech to the un laying out the bush administration 's case for war with iraq , came from an iraqi refugee to germany , who was given the retrospectively ironic codename " curveball . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the source , an iraqi refugee , fabricated a story about mobile chemical weapons factories curveball claimed to have been a chemical engineer but was actually a fake .
nonetheless the german intelligence service , the bnd , passed on what he said to washington .
was this a case of germany publicly opposing the war while placating the us behind-the-scenes by providing the bush government with a pretense for commencing hostilities ? the vice-chairman of the bundestag 's supervisory committee for the bnd , free democrat max stadler , is one of the parliamentarians who will try to resolve that question .
but , as he told dw-world.de , answers and possible action are a long way off . dw-world.de : who is the committee planning to interview in this affair ? stadler : no one .
the way this committee works is that the government reports on all matters relevant to the german intelligence service .
the curveball affair attracted a lot of attention in the press so that will , of course , be part of the report .
we are n't having witnesses testify .
that right is reserved for a special investigations committee , not the supervisory committee . the spiegel report gives the impression that the bnd gave washington information it suspected might be unreliable .
is that your impression as well ?
that 's precisely the reason , in my opinion , that the affair needs to be taken up in the supervisory committee .
this impression has in fact been made in the press .
on the other hand , the reports also state that the bnd under the previous german government sent a letter to the effect that the information from curveball had n't been checked out or confirmed by a second source .
the letter said , insofar as i understand it , that -lsb- the german government -rsb- could not guarantee the information was reliable .
the committee is going to take another look at that .
but what you said about the general impression one gets from the media reports is correct . lawrence wilkerson , the chief of staff to former secretary of state colin powell , has accused the bnd of hindering cia attempts to question curveball and of therefore being partially responsible for the iraq war .
that 's a fairly serious charge , is n't it ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : colin powell cited the bogus info in urging for war i do n't know precisely how things developed .
i 'll have to wait for the hearing next week before i can say anything about that .
but i would say , generally speaking , that the iraq war was a long time coming .
much of the opinion in the us had been formed before the curveball testimony .
i personally can not imagine that one intelligence report from germany would have been the all-decisive factor for the american government back then . german officially refused to join the us-led coalition in iraq .
but reports repeatedly surface about germany sharing intelligence with the us and thereby helping america in that conflict .
does that amount to taking part in the war via the back door ? that 's precisely what the bnd investigations committee is looking into .
the issue came up two years ago , when it became known that two bnd officials were active in baghdad .
the government said they were acting in the national interest .
but the government also said the officials reported back information to their central headquarters that was then passed on to the americans .
the government says that 's perfectly normal .
my personal opinion is that this does represent , if only marginally , an intervention in the iraq war - and it certainly contrasts with what the previous spd-green government was telling the public at the time .
and precisely the question of whether the government said one thing while doing another will be a question for the investigation committee .
germany 's participation may have been slight , confined to the passing-on of information .
but when you consider how heavily the governing coalition back then featured opposition to the war in their election campaign , the two things do n't really add up . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some estimates say the war has killed more than a million people what can the supervisory committee do , if it concludes that the bnd or the government acted improperly ? in principle , the supervisory committee is pledged to secrecy .
even in cases of impropriety , we are n't allowed to make public statements .
but there is an exception .
if two-thirds of the committee members think it 's necessary , we can issue a public evaluation .
members of the opposition parties , though , are not particularly happy about this rule .
we think members of opposition parties should have also have the opportunity to issue dissenting evaluations .
but we 'll see after the meeting whether there is a two-thirds majority for making such a public statement . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : stadler is the supervisory committee 's vice chairman so the basic function of the supervisory committee is to make recommendations to the government . yes , our recommendations go straight to the government and are not usually made public .
but recently the committee has made more and more use of the two-thirds option .
and that could well be the case again . generally speaking , intelligence services - and especially us intelligence services - did n't do a very good job getting quality information about iraq .
how can this situation be improved so that in the future we do n't wage war because of non-existent weapons of mass destruction ? i think it 's high time that politicians recognize that intelligence services have a servile function .
they 're supposed to deliver information that makes it easier to take decisions .
but the politicians are the ones who ultimately have to decide .
and maybe they should treat the analyses they get from intelligence services with a bit more scepticism - instead of using them as excuse by saying " we had no other options given the intelligence at our disposal . "
ultimately , politicians are always free to make up their own minds . jefferson chase send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

russia 's backyard " this is an attempt to legalize the annexation of two georgian regions , " georgian foreign minister david bakradze said in a statement .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de iraq -pipe- 16.04.2008 bundestag to examine us-german intelligence fiasco on iraq großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : an iraqi refugee to germany with the codename " curveball " provided false info about iraq on april 23 , a committee of german lawmakers will examine how false information passed on by the german intelligence service helped the us justify the war in iraq .
dw-world.de spoke with the committee 's vice chairman . earlier this month , the german news magazine der spiegel published a series of articles revealing that a german source was behind erroneous information about mobile chemical weapons factories in iraq under saddam hussein . the information , famously used by colin powell in his 2003 speech to the un laying out the bush administration 's case for war with iraq , came from an iraqi refugee to germany , who was given the retrospectively ironic codename " curveball . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the source , an iraqi refugee , fabricated a story about mobile chemical weapons factories curveball claimed to have been a chemical engineer but was actually a fake .
nonetheless the german intelligence service , the bnd , passed on what he said to washington .
was this a case of germany publicly opposing the war while placating the us behind-the-scenes by providing the bush government with a pretense for commencing hostilities ? the vice-chairman of the bundestag 's supervisory committee for the bnd , free democrat max stadler , is one of the parliamentarians who will try to resolve that question .
but , as he told dw-world.de , answers and possible action are a long way off . dw-world.de : who is the committee planning to interview in this affair ? stadler : no one .
the way this committee works is that the government reports on all matters relevant to the german intelligence service .
the curveball affair attracted a lot of attention in the press so that will , of course , be part of the report .
we are n't having witnesses testify .
that right is reserved for a special investigations committee , not the supervisory committee . the spiegel report gives the impression that the bnd gave washington information it suspected might be unreliable .
is that your impression as well ?
that 's precisely the reason , in my opinion , that the affair needs to be taken up in the supervisory committee .
this impression has in fact been made in the press .
on the other hand , the reports also state that the bnd under the previous german government sent a letter to the effect that the information from curveball had n't been checked out or confirmed by a second source .
the letter said , insofar as i understand it , that -lsb- the german government -rsb- could not guarantee the information was reliable .
the committee is going to take another look at that .
but what you said about the general impression one gets from the media reports is correct . lawrence wilkerson , the chief of staff to former secretary of state colin powell , has accused the bnd of hindering cia attempts to question curveball and of therefore being partially responsible for the iraq war .
that 's a fairly serious charge , is n't it ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : colin powell cited the bogus info in urging for war i do n't know precisely how things developed .
i 'll have to wait for the hearing next week before i can say anything about that .
but i would say , generally speaking , that the iraq war was a long time coming .
much of the opinion in the us had been formed before the curveball testimony .
i personally can not imagine that one intelligence report from germany would have been the all-decisive factor for the american government back then . german officially refused to join the us-led coalition in iraq .
but reports repeatedly surface about germany sharing intelligence with the us and thereby helping america in that conflict .
does that amount to taking part in the war via the back door ? that 's precisely what the bnd investigations committee is looking into .
the issue came up two years ago , when it became known that two bnd officials were active in baghdad .
the government said they were acting in the national interest .
but the government also said the officials reported back information to their central headquarters that was then passed on to the americans .
the government says that 's perfectly normal .
my personal opinion is that this does represent , if only marginally , an intervention in the iraq war - and it certainly contrasts with what the previous spd-green government was telling the public at the time .
and precisely the question of whether the government said one thing while doing another will be a question for the investigation committee .
germany 's participation may have been slight , confined to the passing-on of information .
but when you consider how heavily the governing coalition back then featured opposition to the war in their election campaign , the two things do n't really add up . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some estimates say the war has killed more than a million people what can the supervisory committee do , if it concludes that the bnd or the government acted improperly ? in principle , the supervisory committee is pledged to secrecy .
even in cases of impropriety , we are n't allowed to make public statements .
but there is an exception .
if two-thirds of the committee members think it 's necessary , we can issue a public evaluation .
members of the opposition parties , though , are not particularly happy about this rule .
we think members of opposition parties should have also have the opportunity to issue dissenting evaluations .
but we 'll see after the meeting whether there is a two-thirds majority for making such a public statement . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : stadler is the supervisory committee 's vice chairman so the basic function of the supervisory committee is to make recommendations to the government . yes , our recommendations go straight to the government and are not usually made public .
but recently the committee has made more and more use of the two-thirds option .
and that could well be the case again . generally speaking , intelligence services - and especially us intelligence services - did n't do a very good job getting quality information about iraq .
how can this situation be improved so that in the future we do n't wage war because of non-existent weapons of mass destruction ? i think it 's high time that politicians recognize that intelligence services have a servile function .
they 're supposed to deliver information that makes it easier to take decisions .
but the politicians are the ones who ultimately have to decide .
and maybe they should treat the analyses they get from intelligence services with a bit more scepticism - instead of using them as excuse by saying " we had no other options given the intelligence at our disposal . "
ultimately , politicians are always free to make up their own minds . jefferson chase send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

but some politicians doubt whether the proposed law meets strict rules mandated by the country 's highest court . germany 's social democrats -lrb- spd -rrb- parliamentary group said it would not blindly pass a law formulating new guidelines for the surveillance of personal computers in cases of suspected terrorism or other serious crimes . " we are going to carefully review whether the legislative draft corresponds with the restrictive parameters laid out by germany 's constitutional court , and reserve the right to veto , " the group 's expert on domestic affairs , klaus-uwe benneter , told the daily berliner zeitung on wednesday , april 16 . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : authorities wo n't be allowed to handle suspects ' computers to install spy software he said regular , careful monitoring would have to occur to ensure that the proposed law is properly applied .
he also said those who have been under surveillance must also be informed that their computers were examined . staying the course germany 's christian democrats -lrb- cdu -rrb- , with whom the social democrats are in a ruling coalition , have called on the spd to agree to the guidelines .
wolfgang bosbach , the cdu 's deputy parliamentary leader , told the newspaper , " when the spd continues to stir things up , people would begin throwing up their hands in frustration - they would n't understand it . " bosbach said the cdu had already met the spd half-way .
interior minister wolfgang schauble , a cdu member , had already conceded by revoking his wish to allow police to enter suspects ' apartments to install spy software on their computers , bosbach told public broadcaster ard tuesday evening . the spd had rejected that measure , which did not make it into the final version of the proposed law . opposition parties also issued their displeasure with the proposal . " piece by piece , our privacy is obviously dying , " green party member hans-christian stroebele told ard . only under special circumstances in february , the nation 's highest court established that the privacy of data stored or exchanged on personal computers is a basic right protected by the constitution ; surveillance is therefore permitted only in exceptional cases . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the cdu 's bosbach said the spd should stay the agreed-to course interior minister wolfgang schaeuble and justice minister brigitte zypries said on tuesday that they had agreed on the new framework to conform with that legal ruling from the court . it was the last hurdle in putting together new guidelines for germany 's domestic intelligence services , which will now be sent to the country 's states for further discussion . schaeuble 's spokesperson said that once the drafted law had gone to the states , it could then be presented to the cabinet before the summer recess . dw staff -lrb- als -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

there 's a strong sense here that together , the united states and the catholic church overcame communism .
john paul ii is particularly admired .
his election is seen in relation to solidarnosc in poland , gorbachev , the fall of the berlin wall , a unified europe and victory over the warsaw pact . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : michael schapfel is pastor to german-speaking christians in washington greater washington is home to a very traditional church for german standards .
it takes its cue from rome and listens to what is said there .
the community was very happy about the election of the new pope , and is now waiting to see what message he brings to the united states . is the fact that pope benedict xvi is a german particularly important for the german congregation in washington ? yes , it plays a big role for a lot of our people .
many of them come from bavaria and even the region where he was born .
but the pope is n't coming to the usa to visit us germans .
the german congregation in washington does not have a special role to play in the visit . what is the make-up of your congregation ? there 's quite a large , lively community of german-speaking catholics in washington .
it 's mainly made up of two different groups .
there are those people who have worked here for many years or even decades , or who 've married someone here or plan on spending the rest of their lives here .
then there are those who are only here for a few years .

the future lies in using advanced robotics , miniaturisation and fabrication , said lord martin rees , the president of the royal society .
europe " should try and get a world lead in unmanned exploration " , he said .
spending funds on manned spaceflights " was not a very good use of money " , that should be left to the us , he said .
three-quarters of nasa 's money was spent " going round and round the earth 35 years after people had already walked on the moon " , lord rees said .
nasa has a budget this year of more than $ 17bn -lrb- £ 9bn ; 11bn euros -rrb- , in contrast to the uk 's annual civil space budget of £ 220m -lrb- $ 430m ; 270m euros -rrb- and the european space agency 's -lrb- esa -rrb- expenditure of 3bn euros -lrb- £ 2.5bn ; $ 5bn -rrb- .
steal a march speaking to the bbc during a week-long trip to california to promote the royal society , lord rees said manned missions were largely irrelevant . "
we in europe should try and get a world lead in space exploration and applications " lord rees president , royal society these days , no-one gets excited in the way they once did over the early apollo programme , he added .
" the space shuttle only really makes headlines when there has been a disaster , " he said .
" routine shuttle launchings do n't make headlines .
" what actually makes the newspaper headlines are the marvellous pictures from the hubble telescope and those of the surface of mars and jupiter and titan , all obtained robotically . "
lord rees , the professor of cosmology and astrophysics at cambridge 's institute of astronomy , said the unmanned part of nasa 's project was - like europe 's - hugely successful .
this , he said , was where the uk should concentrate its energies .
" if i was an american , i would be opposed to a return to the moon and going to mars , " he said .
differing views " we in europe should try and get a world lead in space exploration and applications , " said the royal society president , who also holds the position of english astronomer royal .
" manned missions are hugely more expensive and the practical case for sending people weakens with every advance in robotics and miniaturisation . "
despite his views , though , europe is pursuing a vigorous human spaceflight policy and has so far spent 5bn euros -lrb- $ 8bn ; £ 4bn -rrb- on the space station .
just last week , esa unveiled a campaign to recruit the european astronauts of tomorrow .
britain has also hinted at a change in its long-standing opposition to human space activities following several high-profile reports .
one , a specially convened government advisory panel , suggested the uk 's policy has damaged the country both scientifically and economically .
space budget while the notion of a briton in space could be inspirational for young people , it could also present all sorts of opportunities for business .
in the past , british companies have been denied the chance to bid for high-profile contracts in the human spaceflight arena .
that looks set to change .
but lord rees remains adamant there is only one path to take and that the uk and europe are wasting time trying to best the us or russia in human spaceflight .
" for historical reasons connected with superpower rivalry , space is one of the arenas where america and russia have a bigger budget for space than western europe , " he said .
" whereas in everything else , western europe is fully a match for the us .
we can be more effective in space if we focus all our budget on miniaturisation , robotics , and fabricators and avoid manned spaceflight . "

those reciting the prayers were a microcosm of the millions of latino catholics in the us .
just hours earlier , pope benedict xvi had said he would raise the plight of hispanic migrants in talks with president bush .
for those gathered here , the pope 's visit and his professed support for the millions of undocumented immigrants living illegally in the us is being seen as cause for celebration .
and , in fact , the pope expressed his solidarity with those immigrants even before leaving the vatican for washington .
clear support he issued a statement in spanish directed at the latino community , the majority of whom are roman catholic . "
his comments demonstrate once again that the church is with the poor , with the immigrants and those who are in need " carlos aquino the german pope said he would be raising the issue of immigration reform with president bush and would urge him to push for granting legal status to the illegal immigrants living in the us .
for carlos aquino , who heads the shrine of the sacred heart 's youth ministries , the pope 's words were comforting .
" i think his statement was very clear , " said mr aquino .
" his comments demonstrate once again that the church is with the poor , with the immigrants and those who are in need - as well as those 12 million people who are here looking for status or an opportunity .
" i think the pope is there for them . "
latinos are likely to make up a large part of the 40,000-strong crowd expected to attend the pope 's first open air mass in the us here in washington , and they will figure heavily when he moves on to new york this weekend .
stem the tide the pope 's other aim on the visit to the us regarding the latino community is to strengthen the church 's place in the country 's fastest growing minority group .
he wants to stem the tide of the hundreds of thousands of latinos who have left the church in recent years in search of greater spiritual inspiration from the growing hispanic evangelical movement .
the sex scandals that hit several us dioceses in recent years also contributed to that exodus of latino catholics , and the disaffection of millions more .
it is no surprise , then , that the pope would want to make a very public statement of contrition over the scandal as he did before he had even landed in washington .
as for his words of support for the legalisation of the millions of undocumented immigrants living and working in the us , these are not expected to do much more than serve as moral support .
political debate on the issue is paralysed and not expected to be taken up until the country 's new president takes office next january .

british energy , owner and operator of dungeness b , has organised a public meeting at lydd on wednesday .
it said the meeting was to discuss preparation for a new building , the site selection process across the uk , and recent government consultation .
the plans have already led to a mixed response from local residents .
some have welcomed the possibility of an economic boost to the area , while others oppose the use of nuclear energy .
decommissioned sites british energy said it was assessing a number of uk sites , including dungeness .
it said there was " still much work to be done before decisions on siting and technology are made " , but it wanted to keep people informed on the process and hear views on the impact of the plans .
a representative from the department for business enterprise and regulatory reform will also be at the meeting to explain the government 's decision on the future of nuclear power in the uk .
the dungeness a site started generating electricity into the national grid in 1965 .
it ceased generating power in 2006 .
the nearby dungeness b site will stay open until 2018 .
it is believed sites of decommissioned stations , including dungeness a , would be likely to house any new reactors .
earlier this year , it was thought that dungeness c may get the go-ahead after the government announced a formal backing of nuclear power to meet the uk 's energy needs .

a 22-year-old man held on suspicion of perverting the course of justice was bailed on tuesday night .
the remaining 11 suspects - four of whom are being held on suspicion of murder - continue to be held by police .
officers were given an extra 12 hours and have until 1900 bst on wednesday to question them .
the 11-year-old was shot in the neck as he walked home from football training in croxteth park last august .
on tuesday officers from the merseyside force arrested nine males and three females , aged between 15 and 54 , following a series of dawn raids .
two youths , aged 16 and 17 , and two men , aged 24 and 25 , were being held on suspicion of murdering rhys , who was shot by a gunman on a bicycle outside the fir tree pub on the croxteth park estate .
a 16-year-old boy has been arrested on suspicion of assisting an offender , attempting to pervert the course of justice and possession of a firearm and ammunition .
a 49-year-old man and a 15-year-old boy have been arrested on suspicion of assisting an offender and attempting to pervert the course of justice .
a youth , 17 , is also being held on suspicion of assisting an offender .
the three women , aged 50 , 54 and 21 , have been arrested on suspicion of attempting to pervert the course of justice .
detectives , who believe rhys was not the intended target of the gunman , had previously arrested 20 people since the killing on 22 august , including 17 on suspicion of murder .
although police have arrested 30 people during the investigation no-one has been charged , but some of those arrested are now being treated as witnesses .
in february , merseyside police said they believed they had found the murder weapon .
on tuesday merseyside chief constable , bernard hogan howe paid tribute to rhys 's parents .
he said : " a lot of painstaking work has gone into this investigation which continues .
" the public and rhys 's parents , melanie and stephen , have been very supportive throughout and we are grateful for their ongoing confidence in the investigation . "

jk rowling has discussed plans to write her own potter encyclopaedia mr vander ark set up the harry potter lexicon fan site , a detailed guide to the characters , spells and creatures from rowling 's magical stories , in 2000 .
he told the us district court in manhattan it was a hobby until rdr books approached him to publish a print version last year .
mr vander ark said he was initially against the idea , partly because he thought it would violate copyright law , but was reassured by rdr that they could publish legally .
the 50-year-old librarian said he had read every harry potter book " 30 or 40 times " and read every article ever written about rowling .
he also said he was working on two more books about the harry potter universe .
in response to mr vander ark 's testimony , a spokesman for rowling and warner bros said in a statement : " a fan 's affectionate enthusiasm should not obscure acts of plagiarism .
" the publishers knew what they were doing . "
' act of betrayal ' on monday , rowling told the court she had stopped work on a new novel because her legal concerns had " decimated my creative work " .
she denied the case was about money and accused mr vander ark of " an act of betrayal " in using her fiction as the basis for his guide .
" he has simply taken it and copied it , " she said .
" it is sloppy , lazy and it takes my work wholesale . "
rowling and warner bros are seeking to block publication of the harry potter lexicon and are seeking damages for copyright and federal trademark infringement .

the broads society , founded in 1956 to protect the inland waterways in norfolk and suffolk , wants the government to continue funding sea defences .
natural england have set out four options in the light of climate change .
the most controversial plan allows sea defences to collapse near the river thurne to create a large estuary which the broads society said is destructive .
dr martin george , a society committee member , said : " the area to be lost under three of the four proposals is an integral part of the broads national park .
" the society considers it completely unacceptable to allow part of it to become an open estuary . "
we believe it could well prove less expensive to provide the sea wall with additional protection against the scouring effects of the sea " dr martin george " if any of these three proposals were adopted , it would result in the loss of several hundred residential properties , destruction of hickling broad , horsey mere , heigham sound and martham north and south broads .
" several thousand acres of farm land would disappear at a time of the growing world-wide food shortages .
" valuable and fragile plant and animal life would disappear .
" this includes reed and saw-sedge fen , the habitat of the bittern , bearded tit , marsh harrier , swallowtail butterfly and nine rare or endangered species of moth . "
the broads society 's option would involve the creation of a new line of sea defences to the rear of the existing seawall and sand dunes .
they said that this would minimise the amount of land and property which would have to be surrendered to the sea , as well as safeguard hickling broad .
dr george said : " we believe it could well prove less expensive to provide the sea wall with additional protection against the scouring effects of the sea than to construct a completely new line of defences to the rear .

the broads society , founded in 1956 to protect the inland waterways in norfolk and suffolk , wants the government to continue funding sea defences .
natural england have set out four options in the light of climate change .
the most controversial plan allows sea defences to collapse near the river thurne to create a large estuary which the broads society said is destructive .
dr martin george , a society committee member , said : " the area to be lost under three of the four proposals is an integral part of the broads national park .
" the society considers it completely unacceptable to allow part of it to become an open estuary .
we believe it could well prove less expensive to provide the sea wall with additional protection against the scouring effects of the sea dr martin george " if any of these three proposals were adopted , it would result in the loss of several hundred residential properties , destruction of hickling broad , horsey mere , heigham sound and martham north and south broads .
" several thousand acres of farm land would disappear at a time of the growing world-wide food shortages .
" valuable and fragile plant and animal life would disappear .
" this includes reed and saw-sedge fen , the habitat of the bittern , bearded tit , marsh harrier , swallowtail butterfly and nine rare or endangered species of moth . "
the broads society 's option would involve the creation of a new line of sea defences to the rear of the existing seawall and sand dunes .
they said that this would minimise the amount of land and property which would have to be surrendered to the sea , as well as safeguard hickling broad .
dr george said : " we believe it could well prove less expensive to provide the sea wall with additional protection against the scouring effects of the sea than to construct a completely new line of defences to the rear .
" we believe that this issue needs to be subject to a full-scale investigation . "

the broads society , founded in 1956 to protect the inland waterways in norfolk and suffolk , wants the government to continue funding sea defences .
natural england have set out four options in the light of climate change .
the most controversial plan allows sea defences to collapse near the river thurne to create a large estuary which the broads society said is destructive .
dr martin george , a society committee member , said : " the area to be lost under three of the four proposals is an integral part of the broads national park .
" the society considers it completely unacceptable to allow part of it to become an open estuary .
we believe it could well prove less expensive to provide the sea wall with additional protection against the scouring effects of the sea dr martin george " if any of these three proposals were adopted , it would result in the loss of several hundred residential properties , destruction of hickling broad , horsey mere , heigham sound and martham north and south broads .
" several thousand acres of farm land would disappear at a time of the growing world-wide food shortages .
" valuable and fragile plant and animal life would disappear .
" this includes reed and saw-sedge fen , the habitat of the bittern , bearded tit , marsh harrier , swallowtail butterfly and nine rare or endangered species of moth . "
the broads society 's option would involve the creation of a new line of sea defences to the rear of the existing seawall and sand dunes .
they said that this would minimise the amount of land and property which would have to be surrendered to the sea , as well as safeguard hickling broad .
dr george said : " we believe it could well prove less expensive to provide the sea wall with additional protection against the scouring effects of the sea than to construct a completely new line of defences to the rear .

they face a 50 % tax when a barrel of crude is priced at $ 70 or more , rising to 60 % when average prices tops $ 110 .
it is president hugo chavez 's latest attempt to get greater control over his country 's oil .
in 2006 , he enacted laws making foreign oil firms hand over at least a 60 % share in their venezuelan operations .
the country has also begun nationalising its electricity , telecommunications and natural gas industries as part of president chavez 's drive toward " 21st century socialism " .
' diminishing opportunities ' oil prices are currently around $ 110 a barrel and income from the new tax could reach $ 9bn -lrb- £ 4.5bn -rrb- a year , according to oil minister rafael ramirez .
analysts said that the move would make foreign firms think carefully before making any further investments in venezuela , which is one of the world 's most oil-rich nations .
" their opportunities to turn a profit are diminishing , " said juan carlos sosa , editor of venezuelan oil industry magazine petroleoyv .
the tax comes months after president chavez 's nationalisation drive forced out two of the world 's largest energy companies : exxon mobil corp and conocophillips .
exxon is seeking $ 12bn in compensation from venezuela after its oilfields were nationalised last year .
last week president chavez announced the immediate nationalisation of venezuela 's entire cement industry .
he said his government could not allow private companies to export cement that was needed to tackle a severe housing shortage .
the president promised they would be paid fair compensation for the forthcoming state takeover of what he described as a strategic industry .

they face a 50 % tax when a barrel of crude is priced at $ 70 or more , rising to 60 % when average prices tops $ 110 .
it is president hugo chavez 's latest attempt to get greater control over his country 's oil .
in 2006 , he enacted laws making foreign oil firms hand over at least a 60 % share in their venezuelan operations .
the country has also begun nationalising its electricity , telecommunications and natural gas industries as part of president chavez 's drive toward " 21st century socialism " .
' diminishing opportunities ' oil prices are currently around $ 110 a barrel and income from the new tax could reach $ 9bn -lrb- £ 4.5bn -rrb- a year , according to oil minister rafael ramirez .
analysts said that the move would make foreign firms think carefully before making any further investments in venezuela , which is one of the world 's most oil-rich nations .
" their opportunities to turn a profit are diminishing , " said juan carlos sosa , editor of venezuelan oil industry magazine petroleoyv .
the tax comes months after president chavez 's nationalisation drive forced out two of the world 's largest energy companies : exxon mobil corp and conocophillips .
exxon is seeking $ 12bn in compensation from venezuela after its oilfields were nationalised last year .
last week president chavez announced the immediate nationalisation of venezuela 's entire cement industry .
he said his government could not allow private companies to export cement that was needed to tackle a severe housing shortage .
the president promised they would be paid fair compensation for the forthcoming state takeover of what he described as a strategic industry .

about 500 soldiers from the battalion - formed by the amalgamation of the royal scots and the king 's own scottish borderers - are stationed in basra .
they hope to hold a homecoming parade in dumfries on 7 june this year .
councillors have been asked to admit the royal regiment of scotland as honorary freemen of the region on the same date .
dumfries and galloway was one of the main recruiting areas for the kosb and , along with south lanarkshire , remains a recruiting area for the royal scots borderers .
the first operational deployment of the new battalion got under way last year .
they were sent to iraq to help train and mentor local security forces during a six-month tour of duty .
that tour of duty is due to end in may and it is hoped the soldiers could parade through dumfries the following month .

the bomb exploded as they were parking their car in the city of maareb , about 105 miles -lrb- 170 km -rrb- east of the yemeni capital , sanaa .
witnesses said the vehicle was totally destroyed by the blast .
the bombing follows a series of similar attacks in recent weeks , aimed at government , foreign diplomatic and commercial targets .
foreign tourists come under regular attack in yemen - attacks often claimed by al-qaeda .
the us embassy in sanaa said last week it was ordered by the state department to evacuate non-essential personnel .
in 2000 , al-qaeda targeted the navy destroyer uss cole in the southern port of aden , using a small boat packed with explosives to blow a hole in the side of the vessel , killing 17 american sailors .
