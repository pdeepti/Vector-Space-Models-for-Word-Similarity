luis aragones ' young side are hoping emulate that feat in vienna on sunday , june 29 , against germany . for a team which has become notorious for losing its bottle at the business end of tournaments and flattering to deceive on a consistent basis , spain move into their first major final in 24 years full of confidence while playing the kind of soccer they normally only reserve for the early rounds .
since they took to the field in paris to contest the 1984 european championship title against hosts france , spain have turned up for tournaments with squads full of the world 's biggest stars and the continent 's most talented players but have failed to make the latter stages .
many huge names from spanish soccer have graced the world cup and european championship stages in the shirt of the furia roja - and have shown their worth for about three games before meekly surrendering when things got serious .
normally it 's the quarter-final stage .
such has been the regularity that the spanish bow out at this stage , that it has become a bit of a mental block , if not a downright curse .
this year however , despite the fact that they were facing world champions italy at this stage , spain overcame both the italians and the psychological barrier to make it to the semis .
before earning themselves a place against italy , luis aragones ' team played their way through group d with skill and panache .
their opening game , a 4-1 thrashing of russia , got everyone believing again , while harboring all those memories of false dawns and premature celebrations .
opening game sends impressive message bildunterschrift : david villa opened his account with a hat trick against russia and got the ball rolling russia were supposed to be a new force , one with an attacking vision that could have overcome a sometimes ponderous spanish defense .
but not only did the rear guard hold firm , the spearhead proved deadly .
a david villa hat trick and a cameo goal from substitute cesc fabregas showed the world that spain had a rod of steel running from back to front , with a very sharp point at its attacking end .
the edge looked a little blunt when spain came up against the swedes in their second group match .
fernando torres got his first goal of the tournament , only to see it cancelled by zlatan ibrahimovic .
the game looked to be heading for a disappointing draw - which no doubt would have prompted questions about spain 's true quality - when that man villa popped up again to net a last gasp winner in the second minute of stoppage time .
with qualification assured , spain then finished off their group stage with a 2-1 win over already eliminated champions greece , with aragones fielding his reserves in a routine win .
spain had to come from behind to grab the points , with goals from reuben de la red and daniel guiza .
it was far from a classy performance but one which showed that spain could dig deep and regain the advantage even without a host of first-teamers on the pitch .
omens gather for quarter-final against italy then came italy .
spain had n't beaten the italians in a competitive match since a 2-0 win at the 1920 olympic games in belgium some 88 years ago .
there was also a certain amount of animosity bubbling under the surface , if the spanish press could be believed .
spain , it was claimed , were looking for revenge for the assault by mario tassotti on luis enrique which went unpunished in the quarter-final of the 1994 world cup in the united states , a match spain lost 2-1 .
whatever the motivation , spain dominated possession throughout regulation time but failed to translate their dominance into clear goal chances .
villa and david silva came close several times to breaking the tense deadlock for spain while italy offered few attacking threats .
spain 's domination continued into extra time , with italy 's keeper buffon saving from villa and santi cazorla shooting wide .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : iker casillas saves one of the penalties in the shoot-out spain may have had their horrible record in penalty shoot-outs at the back of their minds but they did n't show it .
while the spanish slotted in four of their kicks , keeper iker casillas was the hero , saving penalties from daniel de rossi and antonio di natale to put spain in the semi-finals .
the shoot-out victory also ended spain 's june 22 penalty jinx .
on june 22 , 1986 , spain lost to belgium in a dramatic world cup quarter-final shoot-out , then against england in euro 1996 on the same june date 10 years later .
and it was on june 22 , 2002 that the spaniards lost to hosts south korea in the 2002 world cup quarters .
spain raise their game to dominate russia meeting russia again in the semi-final , spain knew that their opponents had grown in confidence since their thrashing in the first game .
the return of andrei arshavin had inspired russia against sweden in the game that sealed qualification and then again in the rampant display that knocked the dutch out in the quarter-final .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : spain turned on the style to overcome russia but spain were irrepressible and arshavin was eclipsed by substitute cesc fabregas , on for the injured david villa after only 30 minutes or so of play .
fabregas delivered a midfield masterclass , pulling the strings and conducting the play as spain ran out 3-0 winners .
germany may not have fancied playing the russians , with their unpredictably marauding style , but they may not be looking forward to facing a spain team just one game away from ending 44 trophy-less years of hurt . nick amies send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the legendary formula one race course , nicknamed the green hell , is to be turned into a year-round leisure center . located 90 kilometers southwest of cologne in the heart of the eifel national park , the nürburgring has seen a lot in its 80 years : daredevil drivers , jubilant winners and too many dead . the track 's history includes more than 100 races and tragic crashes - like the fiery wreck at the 1976 grand prix , from which driver niki lauda barely escaped . now , however , the race course is quiet ; scaffolding covers the track 's start and finish lines and the main grandstands . in a major facelift meant to bring more life to the area , the track is being repurposed as a year-round leisure and business center with a promenade , an arena for small events , a convention center and a new grandstand .
four-star and a three-star hotels are entering the fray , along with a series of bungalows that will add up to 1,000 beds to the area . the nürburgring corporation plans to invest 215 million euros by spring of next year , according to ceo walter kafitz . when the formula one returns bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " rock am ring " brings in more than two million visitors annually new grand prix racetracks in abu dhabi , shanghai and singapore are more lucrative for formula one boss bernie eccleston . that means that the nürburgring has felt it must dispel the myth that it is past its prime - one reason justifying the course be flipped on its head . " when we talk about nürburgring 2009 , we 're also talking about the subsequent growth and development of the area , " said kafitz . after the renovation , the racetrack expects around 2 million per year , including the number of people coming to the world superbike championships and europe 's largest rock festival , the " rock am ring . " " new growth has to come from outside , " said kafitz .
" of course , we want to increase the interest in motorsports .

on the streets of berlin , preparations for the final match were in full swing . from chancellor angela merkel downwards , germans will be cheering on " schweini , " " poldi " and their teammates in a nation now much more comfortable with being patriotic ever since the 2006 world cup was held on home soil . in towns and cities across the country , hundreds of thousands were expected at public viewing areas to watch the match beamed in from vienna from 20:45 local time onto huge screens and tens of millions will be glued to their tvs at home . on the streets of the capital , people are gathering in beer gardens hours before the game where they 'll follow the action on large-screen televisions .
some have been seen carrying refrigerators down streets to make sure parties are fully stocked .
black , red and gold flags are everywhere . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the referee for the final of euro 2008 holds a match ball nearly half a million people watched the last game in the specially erected " fan mile " around the brandenburg gate in berlin alone , and the atmosphere will be more electric still on sunday if joachim loew 's team triumphs . according to a survey in the bild am sonntag weekely , 85 percent of the country 's 82 million population will follow the match , and for all practical purposes , the country will come to a stand-still . german automakers like daimler , volkswagen and audi plan to shut down production during the game so that their workers can follow the match before the conveyor belts and europe 's biggest economy grind back into action after the final whistle . only one in five german televisions were tuned into something else as almost 30 million viewers were glued to wednesday 's semi-final thriller against turkey , and sunday 's final was not expected to be any less of a crowd-puller . worries about ballack bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : these guys have got to be feeling the pressure despite their confidence , the country is sweating over the fact that powerhouse captain michael ballack might not take to the field after hurting his leg in training at the team 's base in southern switzerland . nevertheless , 72 percent believe their side will win the wunder von wien -lrb- the vienna miracle -rrb- , according to bild am sonntag 's poll . " ballack injured ! , " the top-selling paper 's front page screams .
" but we are going to win the cup anyway ! " only one in five took the more pessimistic view - including none other than finance minister peer steinbrueck who perhaps unwisely predicts a 3-1 hammering , the paper said .
eight percent were hedging their bets . leaders in attendance merkel herself , who was shown literally jumping for joy in basel when the winning goal against turkey hit the back of the net on wednesday , will watch the match in vienna along with president horst koehler and other ministers . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : angela merkel and national player bastian schweinsteiger merkel became a regular in the stands during the world cup .

" i am sure that our team is going to succeed , " president koehler said in a column in the top-selling bild newspaper on sunday .
" our opponent is strong ... but with the fire in their bellies the german team can beat them . " a parade has been organized in central berlin for monday for the players - even if they lose - and the city authorities have asked schools to give pupils the afternoon off so they can attend .

robert mugabe was sworn in for a new term as president of zimbabwe on sunday while the international community widely condemned the vote .
in europe , officials urged africa to play a bigger role in ending the crisis . official results released on sunday showed mugabe overwhelmingly won the country 's one-man election .
zimbabwe election officials said he received more than two million votes or about 85 percent of the vote .
opposition leader morgan tsvangirai , who pulled out of the election amid mounting violence against his supports , received about 230,000 votes .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a zimbabwean voter gets her finger dipped in purple dye to show she has voted and unable to vote again turnout for the june 27 election was put at 42 percent .
but reports have circulated that many zimbabweans were coerced into voting and that mugabe militias had applied scare tactics to anyone without the tell-tale purple fingertip proving a person had voted .
europe calls vote a farce the vote was widely condemned around the world .
german foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier denounced the election as a farce considering mugabe was the only candidate .
in a statement issued after friday 's vote , steinmeier said that germany welcomed the fact that the united nations security council was planning to discuss possible action against mugabe 's regime in the coming week .
many western leaders have urged the african union to take action at a summit in egypt on june 30 that was expected to focus on the zimbabwe election crisis . british prime minister gordon brown said the african union and the international community must work together to help bring stability to zimbabwe .
the united states has called for drawing up sanctions against zimbabwe .
the european union has said it will not rule out sanctions against " those responsible for the tragic events of recent months . "
history of defiance bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : residents of mbare line up to cast their vote in the country 's presidential election the 84-year-old veteran fighter disregarded the official results from the first-round election in march which put opposition leader morgan tsvangirai ahead . mugabe flaunted international criticism and pushed ahead with the vote , warning against outside interference in his country 's affairs and shrugging off tsvangirai 's claims of violence .
he has also said the opposition will never come to power as long as he is alive , vowing to fight to ensure it does not happen .
the zimbabwe opposition and western critics have said mugabe is a dictator who has ruined a once prosperous country .
they have sharply criticized him for applying suppression and violence against opposition supporters .
little support in africa bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : south africans demonstrate against election related violence in zimbabwe in johannesburg no african heads of state were present for the inauguration of mugabe 's sixth five-year term as president june 29 .
the head of the pan-african parliament mission told a news conference sunday that the vote was neither free nor fair and fresh polls should be held .
kenyan prime minister raila odinga , among the zimbabwean leader 's most vocal critics on the continent , called on the african union to send troops into zimbabwe and labelled mugabe " a shame to africa " .
mugabe is africa 's oldest head of state and has ruled the former british colony uninterrupted since gaining independence from britain in 1980 . dw staff -lrb- ktz -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

luis aragones ' young side are hoping emulate that feat in vienna on sunday , june 29 , against germany . for a team which has become notorious for losing its bottle at the business end of tournaments and flattering to deceive on a consistent basis , spain move into their first major final in 24 years full of confidence while playing the kind of soccer they normally only reserve for the early rounds .
since they took to the field in paris to contest the 1984 european championship title against hosts france , spain have turned up for tournaments with squads full of the world 's biggest stars and the continent 's most talented players but have failed to make the latter stages .
many huge names from spanish soccer have graced the world cup and european championship stages in the shirt of the furia roja - and have shown their worth for about three games before meekly surrendering when things got serious .
normally it 's the quarter-final stage .
such has been the regularity that the spanish bow out at this stage , that it has become a bit of a mental block , if not a downright curse .
this year however , despite the fact that they were facing world champions italy at this stage , spain overcame both the italians and the psychological barrier to make it to the semis .
before earning themselves a place against italy , luis aragones ' team played their way through group d with skill and panache .
their opening game , a 4-1 thrashing of russia , got everyone believing again , while harboring all those memories of false dawns and premature celebrations .
opening game sends impressive message bildunterschrift : david villa opened his account with a hat trick against russia and got the ball rolling russia were supposed to be a new force , one with an attacking vision that could have overcome a sometimes ponderous spanish defense .
but not only did the rear guard hold firm , the spearhead proved deadly .
a david villa hat trick and a cameo goal from substitute cesc fabregas showed the world that spain had a rod of steel running from back to front , with a very sharp point at its attacking end .
the edge looked a little blunt when spain came up against the swedes in their second group match .
fernando torres got his first goal of the tournament , only to see it cancelled by zlatan ibrahimovic .
the game looked to be heading for a disappointing draw - which no doubt would have prompted questions about spain 's true quality - when that man villa popped up again to net a last gasp winner in the second minute of stoppage time .
with qualification assured , spain then finished off their group stage with a 2-1 win over already eliminated champions greece , with aragones fielding his reserves in a routine win .
spain had to come from behind to grab the points , with goals from reuben de la red and daniel guiza .
it was far from a classy performance but one which showed that spain could dig deep and regain the advantage even without a host of first-teamers on the pitch .
omens gather for quarter-final against italy then came italy .
spain had n't beaten the italians in a competitive match since a 2-0 win at the 1920 olympic games in belgium some 88 years ago .
there was also a certain amount of animosity bubbling under the surface , if the spanish press could be believed .
spain , it was claimed , were looking for revenge for the assault by mario tassotti on luis enrique which went unpunished in the quarter-final of the 1994 world cup in the united states , a match spain lost 2-1 .
whatever the motivation , spain dominated possession throughout regulation time but failed to translate their dominance into clear goal chances .
villa and david silva came close several times to breaking the tense deadlock for spain while italy offered few attacking threats .
spain 's domination continued into extra time , with italy 's keeper buffon saving from villa and santi cazorla shooting wide .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : iker casillas saves one of the penalties in the shoot-out spain may have had their horrible record in penalty shoot-outs at the back of their minds but they did n't show it .
while the spanish slotted in four of their kicks , keeper iker casillas was the hero , saving penalties from daniel de rossi and antonio di natale to put spain in the semi-finals .
the shoot-out victory also ended spain 's june 22 penalty jinx .
on june 22 , 1986 , spain lost to belgium in a dramatic world cup quarter-final shoot-out , then against england in euro 1996 on the same june date 10 years later .
and it was on june 22 , 2002 that the spaniards lost to hosts south korea in the 2002 world cup quarters .
spain raise their game to dominate russia meeting russia again in the semi-final , spain knew that their opponents had grown in confidence since their thrashing in the first game .
the return of andrei arshavin had inspired russia against sweden in the game that sealed qualification and then again in the rampant display that knocked the dutch out in the quarter-final .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : spain turned on the style to overcome russia but spain were irrepressible and arshavin was eclipsed by substitute cesc fabregas , on for the injured david villa after only 30 minutes or so of play .
fabregas delivered a midfield masterclass , pulling the strings and conducting the play as spain ran out 3-0 winners .
germany may not have fancied playing the russians , with their unpredictably marauding style , but they may not be looking forward to facing a spain team just one game away from ending 44 trophy-less years of hurt . nick amies send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

robert mugabe was sworn in for a new term as president of zimbabwe on sunday while the international community widely condemned the vote .
in europe , officials urged africa to play a bigger role in ending the crisis . official results released on sunday showed mugabe overwhelmingly won the country 's one-man election .
zimbabwe election officials said he received more than two million votes or about 85 percent of the vote .
opposition leader morgan tsvangirai , who pulled out of the election amid mounting violence against his supports , received about 230,000 votes .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a zimbabwean voter gets her finger dipped in purple dye to show she has voted and unable to vote again turnout for the june 27 election was put at 42 percent .
but reports have circulated that many zimbabweans were coerced into voting and that mugabe militias had applied scare tactics to anyone without the tell-tale purple fingertip proving a person had voted .
europe calls vote a farce the vote was widely condemned around the world .
german foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier denounced the election as a farce considering mugabe was the only candidate .
in a statement issued after friday 's vote , steinmeier said that germany welcomed the fact that the united nations security council was planning to discuss possible action against mugabe 's regime in the coming week .
many western leaders have urged the african union to take action at a summit in egypt on june 30 that was expected to focus on the zimbabwe election crisis . british prime minister gordon brown said the african union and the international community must work together to help bring stability to zimbabwe .
the united states has called for drawing up sanctions against zimbabwe .
the european union has said it will not rule out sanctions against " those responsible for the tragic events of recent months . "

he has also said the opposition will never come to power as long as he is alive , vowing to fight to ensure it does not happen .
the zimbabwe opposition and western critics have said mugabe is a dictator who has ruined a once prosperous country .
they have sharply criticized him for applying suppression and violence against opposition supporters .
little support in africa bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : south africans demonstrate against election related violence in zimbabwe in johannesburg no african heads of state were present for the inauguration of mugabe 's sixth five-year term as president june 29 .
the head of the pan-african parliament mission told a news conference sunday that the vote was neither free nor fair and fresh polls should be held .
kenyan prime minister raila odinga , among the zimbabwean leader 's most vocal critics on the continent , called on the african union to send troops into zimbabwe and labelled mugabe " a shame to africa " .
mugabe is africa 's oldest head of state and has ruled the former british colony uninterrupted since gaining independence from britain in 1980 . dw staff -lrb- ktz -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

luis aragones ' young side are hoping emulate that feat in vienna on sunday , june 29 , against germany . for a team which has become notorious for losing its bottle at the business end of tournaments and flattering to deceive on a consistent basis , spain move into their first major final in 24 years full of confidence while playing the kind of soccer they normally only reserve for the early rounds .
since they took to the field in paris to contest the 1984 european championship title against hosts france , spain have turned up for tournaments with squads full of the world 's biggest stars and the continent 's most talented players but have failed to make the latter stages .
many huge names from spanish soccer have graced the world cup and european championship stages in the shirt of the furia roja - and have shown their worth for about three games before meekly surrendering when things got serious .
normally it 's the quarter-final stage .
such has been the regularity that the spanish bow out at this stage , that it has become a bit of a mental block , if not a downright curse .
this year however , despite the fact that they were facing world champions italy at this stage , spain overcame both the italians and the psychological barrier to make it to the semis .
before earning themselves a place against italy , luis aragones ' team played their way through group d with skill and panache .
their opening game , a 4-1 thrashing of russia , got everyone believing again , while harboring all those memories of false dawns and premature celebrations .
opening game sends impressive message bildunterschrift : david villa opened his account with a hat trick against russia and got the ball rolling russia were supposed to be a new force , one with an attacking vision that could have overcome a sometimes ponderous spanish defense .
but not only did the rear guard hold firm , the spearhead proved deadly .
a david villa hat trick and a cameo goal from substitute cesc fabregas showed the world that spain had a rod of steel running from back to front , with a very sharp point at its attacking end .
the edge looked a little blunt when spain came up against the swedes in their second group match .
fernando torres got his first goal of the tournament , only to see it cancelled by zlatan ibrahimovic .
the game looked to be heading for a disappointing draw - which no doubt would have prompted questions about spain 's true quality - when that man villa popped up again to net a last gasp winner in the second minute of stoppage time .
with qualification assured , spain then finished off their group stage with a 2-1 win over already eliminated champions greece , with aragones fielding his reserves in a routine win .
spain had to come from behind to grab the points , with goals from reuben de la red and daniel guiza .
it was far from a classy performance but one which showed that spain could dig deep and regain the advantage even without a host of first-teamers on the pitch .
omens gather for quarter-final against italy then came italy .
spain had n't beaten the italians in a competitive match since a 2-0 win at the 1920 olympic games in belgium some 88 years ago .
there was also a certain amount of animosity bubbling under the surface , if the spanish press could be believed .
spain , it was claimed , were looking for revenge for the assault by mario tassotti on luis enrique which went unpunished in the quarter-final of the 1994 world cup in the united states , a match spain lost 2-1 .
whatever the motivation , spain dominated possession throughout regulation time but failed to translate their dominance into clear goal chances .
villa and david silva came close several times to breaking the tense deadlock for spain while italy offered few attacking threats .
spain 's domination continued into extra time , with italy 's keeper buffon saving from villa and santi cazorla shooting wide .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : iker casillas saves one of the penalties in the shoot-out spain may have had their horrible record in penalty shoot-outs at the back of their minds but they did n't show it .
while the spanish slotted in four of their kicks , keeper iker casillas was the hero , saving penalties from daniel de rossi and antonio di natale to put spain in the semi-finals .
the shoot-out victory also ended spain 's june 22 penalty jinx .
on june 22 , 1986 , spain lost to belgium in a dramatic world cup quarter-final shoot-out , then against england in euro 1996 on the same june date 10 years later .
and it was on june 22 , 2002 that the spaniards lost to hosts south korea in the 2002 world cup quarters .
spain raise their game to dominate russia meeting russia again in the semi-final , spain knew that their opponents had grown in confidence since their thrashing in the first game .
the return of andrei arshavin had inspired russia against sweden in the game that sealed qualification and then again in the rampant display that knocked the dutch out in the quarter-final .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : spain turned on the style to overcome russia but spain were irrepressible and arshavin was eclipsed by substitute cesc fabregas , on for the injured david villa after only 30 minutes or so of play .
fabregas delivered a midfield masterclass , pulling the strings and conducting the play as spain ran out 3-0 winners .
germany may not have fancied playing the russians , with their unpredictably marauding style , but they may not be looking forward to facing a spain team just one game away from ending 44 trophy-less years of hurt . nick amies send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" i know spain has a lot of respect for us , " defender christoph metzelder , who earns his money at spanish champions real madrid , told a final news conference in tenero . " they have a lot of quality but this is a final .
there you need special qualities and we have some of them . " germany is the most successful team in euro history with three titles and two further finals .
spain , by contrast , won way back in 1964 and had not gone beyond the quarters since 1984 . metzelder praised spain 's consistency in the tournament and team manager oliver bierhoff named them light favorites . but the germans say they have good reason for optimism as well . a mixture of their proverbial luck and the determination never to give up saw them win 3-2 against turkey in the semi-finals although they played below par on wednesday . six days earlier germany had a classy performance in a 3-2 quarter-final win over portugal . germany face similar challenge to portugal quarter-final bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : xavi hernandez is a key player in spain 's midfield the german camp expects a very similar game to the portugal tie on sunday and is set to pack the midfield to deny xavi hernandez , andres iniesta in the same way it did with deco , cristiano ronaldo and company . " we must fight back as a team , not allow them into the game .
the spaniards do n't like it if we fight back aggressively .
we must try that and then play our own game , " said frings . bierhoff , who scored both goals when germany won the euro 1996 title against the czech republic , agreed : " you can not give them space - we must be close to them like against portugal . " the best news for germany is that frings has overcome his cracked rib and is expected to play as a starter in place of simon rolfes , although coach joachim loew is yet to announce the lineup . frings joins a midfield which also includes captain michael ballack , bastian schweinsteiger , thomas hitzlsperger and possibly also lukas podolski as against portugal and turkey - unless he is moved forward again to partner miroslav klose . " i feel really well , hardly have any problems .
i am surprised how well it went , " frings said in reference to have played the second half against turkey when rolfes got injured . " a coach frings would definitely field the player frings because i showed it does n't hamper me . " bierhoff and the players named the final a unique experience in which the team would not let itself and the country down . germans focused on chance of a lifetime bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : real madrid 's metzelder , pictured here center and without his current beard , is germany 's insider " you realize the tension is there .
it is a big match for a title , the team is very focused .
you do n't get many chances to play for a title , " said metzelder , the only expected starter who was also on the pitch when germany lost the 2002 world cup final to brazil . " we are competitive on sunday .
we can become european champions . " bierhoff said : " the motivation for the final is high .
it is important to have courage .
the players must show heart and give it all they have .
we demand concentration and dedication , the rest you ca n't influence . " looking ahead at a presentation before the german fans on monday in berlin , frings said the team did not want to meet the supporters empty-handed like in 2006 when germany came in third at the world cup . " this time we want to hold something in the air .
something was missing in 2006 .
this time we want to show more than a t-shirt saying ' thank you , " ' frings said . german team to celebrate with fans - win or lose the german team will come to berlin on monday to celebrate with the fans - regardless if they win or lose the euro 2008 final with spain . " it is very important to have the team celebrated in germany , " oliver bierhoff said on friday . jogi loew , captain michael ballack and the rest of the team are expected to arrive in the early afternoon on monday from vienna , where sunday 's final takes place . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany will be met by a huge crowd - even on a work day the presentation takes place at the fan zone in front of the brandenburg gate , where 500,000 people had gathered on wednesday to watch germany 's semi-final win over turkey .
a similar sized crowd is expected to watch the final there . germany also chose the berlin fan area to celebrate its third- place finish at the 2006 home world cup , then drawing 1.5 million people .
the euro fan zone is smaller than the one from the world cup . bierhoff said : " we know it ’ s a work day but we hope that employers and schools will allow us to have a big crowd .

robert mugabe was sworn in for a new term as president of zimbabwe on sunday while the international community widely condemned the vote .
in europe , officials urged africa to play a bigger role in ending the crisis . official results released on sunday showed mugabe overwhelmingly won the country 's one-man election .
zimbabwe election officials said he received more than two million votes or about 85 percent of the vote .
opposition leader morgan tsvangirai , who pulled out of the election amid mounting violence against his supports , received about 230,000 votes .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a zimbabwean voter gets her finger dipped in purple dye to show she has voted and unable to vote again turnout for the june 27 election was put at 42 percent .
but reports have circulated that many zimbabweans were coerced into voting and that mugabe militias had applied scare tactics to anyone without the tell-tale purple fingertip proving a person had voted .
europe calls vote a farce the vote was widely condemned around the world .
german foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier denounced the election as a farce considering mugabe was the only candidate .
in a statement issued after friday 's vote , steinmeier said that germany welcomed the fact that the united nations security council was planning to discuss possible action against mugabe 's regime in the coming week .
many western leaders have urged the african union to take action at a summit in egypt on june 30 that was expected to focus on the zimbabwe election crisis . british prime minister gordon brown said the african union and the international community must work together to help bring stability to zimbabwe .
the united states has called for drawing up sanctions against zimbabwe .
the european union has said it will not rule out sanctions against " those responsible for the tragic events of recent months . "

he has also said the opposition will never come to power as long as he is alive , vowing to fight to ensure it does not happen .
the zimbabwe opposition and western critics have said mugabe is a dictator who has ruined a once prosperous country .
they have sharply criticized him for applying suppression and violence against opposition supporters .

the head of the pan-african parliament mission told a news conference sunday that the vote was neither free nor fair and fresh polls should be held .
kenyan prime minister raila odinga , among the zimbabwean leader 's most vocal critics on the continent , called on the african union to send troops into zimbabwe and labelled mugabe " a shame to africa " .

the head of german engineering group siemens has confirmed that a major restructuring is in the works , after media reports said the firm wanted to lay off 17,000 workers . referring to the state of the world economy and the rising oil price , siemens chief executive peter loescher said it was time for germany 's biggest engineering company to act .
" we have to batten down the hatches , " before siemens caves in under the pressure , the ceo said .
in the comments which are set to be published in full on monday , loescher said siemens needed to reach a target saving of 1.2 billion euros -lrb- 1.9 billion dollars -rrb- by 2010 to remain competitive .
job cuts imminent over the weekend reports were leaked that siemens planned to cut more than 17,000 jobs from its 400,000 global workforce , including some 6,450 jobs in germany .
the amount - nearly four percent of the workforce - was considerably more than the 10,000 anticipated by trade union ig metall as part of a broad revamp of the company 's operations .

on the streets of berlin , preparations for the final match were in full swing . from chancellor angela merkel downwards , germans will be cheering on " schweini , " " poldi " and their teammates in a nation now much more comfortable with being patriotic ever since the 2006 world cup was held on home soil . in towns and cities across the country , hundreds of thousands were expected at public viewing areas to watch the match beamed in from vienna from 20:45 local time onto huge screens and tens of millions will be glued to their tvs at home . on the streets of the capital , people are gathering in beer gardens hours before the game where they 'll follow the action on large-screen televisions .
some have been seen carrying refrigerators down streets to make sure parties are fully stocked .
black , red and gold flags are everywhere . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the referee for the final of euro 2008 holds a match ball nearly half a million people watched the last game in the specially erected " fan mile " around the brandenburg gate in berlin alone , and the atmosphere will be more electric still on sunday if joachim loew 's team triumphs . according to a survey in the bild am sonntag weekely , 85 percent of the country 's 82 million population will follow the match , and for all practical purposes , the country will come to a stand-still . german automakers like daimler , volkswagen and audi plan to shut down production during the game so that their workers can follow the match before the conveyor belts and europe 's biggest economy grind back into action after the final whistle . only one in five german televisions were tuned into something else as almost 30 million viewers were glued to wednesday 's semi-final thriller against turkey , and sunday 's final was not expected to be any less of a crowd-puller . worries about ballack bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : these guys have got to be feeling the pressure despite their confidence , the country is sweating over the fact that powerhouse captain michael ballack might not take to the field after hurting his leg in training at the team 's base in southern switzerland . nevertheless , 72 percent believe their side will win the wunder von wien -lrb- the vienna miracle -rrb- , according to bild am sonntag 's poll . " ballack injured ! , " the top-selling paper 's front page screams .
" but we are going to win the cup anyway ! " only one in five took the more pessimistic view - including none other than finance minister peer steinbrueck who perhaps unwisely predicts a 3-1 hammering , the paper said .
eight percent were hedging their bets . leaders in attendance merkel herself , who was shown literally jumping for joy in basel when the winning goal against turkey hit the back of the net on wednesday , will watch the match in vienna along with president horst koehler and other ministers . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : angela merkel and national player bastian schweinsteiger merkel became a regular in the stands during the world cup .
she has even taken to giving the players some motherly advice , and after the turkey match gave an interview in the flash zone area usually reserved for players and managers . her spokesman had to keep the chancellor informed by text message of the score in the game against portugal while she was tied up with more serious matters at an eu summit on june 19 . " i am sure that our team is going to succeed , " president koehler said in a column in the top-selling bild newspaper on sunday .
" our opponent is strong ... but with the fire in their bellies the german team can beat them . " a parade has been organized in central berlin for monday for the players - even if they lose - and the city authorities have asked schools to give pupils the afternoon off so they can attend . " it is very important for us that the team will be greeted by its supporters back in germany .
berlin has become like a second home to us since the 2006 world cup , " loew said . dw staff -lrb- jam -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

there you need special qualities and we have some of them . " germany is the most successful team in euro history with three titles and two further finals .
spain , by contrast , won way back in 1964 and had not gone beyond the quarters since 1984 . metzelder praised spain 's consistency in the tournament and team manager oliver bierhoff named them light favorites . but the germans say they have good reason for optimism as well . a mixture of their proverbial luck and the determination never to give up saw them win 3-2 against turkey in the semi-finals although they played below par on wednesday . six days earlier germany had a classy performance in a 3-2 quarter-final win over portugal . germany face similar challenge to portugal quarter-final bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : xavi hernandez is a key player in spain 's midfield the german camp expects a very similar game to the portugal tie on sunday and is set to pack the midfield to deny xavi hernandez , andres iniesta in the same way it did with deco , cristiano ronaldo and company . " we must fight back as a team , not allow them into the game .
the spaniards do n't like it if we fight back aggressively .
we must try that and then play our own game , " said frings . bierhoff , who scored both goals when germany won the euro 1996 title against the czech republic , agreed : " you can not give them space - we must be close to them like against portugal . " the best news for germany is that frings has overcome his cracked rib and is expected to play as a starter in place of simon rolfes , although coach joachim loew is yet to announce the lineup . frings joins a midfield which also includes captain michael ballack , bastian schweinsteiger , thomas hitzlsperger and possibly also lukas podolski as against portugal and turkey - unless he is moved forward again to partner miroslav klose . " i feel really well , hardly have any problems .
i am surprised how well it went , " frings said in reference to have played the second half against turkey when rolfes got injured . " a coach frings would definitely field the player frings because i showed it does n't hamper me . " bierhoff and the players named the final a unique experience in which the team would not let itself and the country down . germans focused on chance of a lifetime bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : real madrid 's metzelder , pictured here center and without his current beard , is germany 's insider " you realize the tension is there .
it is a big match for a title , the team is very focused .
you do n't get many chances to play for a title , " said metzelder , the only expected starter who was also on the pitch when germany lost the 2002 world cup final to brazil . " we are competitive on sunday .
we can become european champions . " bierhoff said : " the motivation for the final is high .
it is important to have courage .
the players must show heart and give it all they have .
we demand concentration and dedication , the rest you ca n't influence . " looking ahead at a presentation before the german fans on monday in berlin , frings said the team did not want to meet the supporters empty-handed like in 2006 when germany came in third at the world cup . " this time we want to hold something in the air .
something was missing in 2006 .
this time we want to show more than a t-shirt saying ' thank you , " ' frings said . german team to celebrate with fans - win or lose the german team will come to berlin on monday to celebrate with the fans - regardless if they win or lose the euro 2008 final with spain . " it is very important to have the team celebrated in germany , " oliver bierhoff said on friday . jogi loew , captain michael ballack and the rest of the team are expected to arrive in the early afternoon on monday from vienna , where sunday 's final takes place . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany will be met by a huge crowd - even on a work day the presentation takes place at the fan zone in front of the brandenburg gate , where 500,000 people had gathered on wednesday to watch germany 's semi-final win over turkey .
a similar sized crowd is expected to watch the final there . germany also chose the berlin fan area to celebrate its third- place finish at the 2006 home world cup , then drawing 1.5 million people .
the euro fan zone is smaller than the one from the world cup . bierhoff said : " we know it ’ s a work day but we hope that employers and schools will allow us to have a big crowd .

the head of german engineering group siemens has confirmed that a major restructuring is in the works , after media reports said the firm wanted to lay off 17,000 workers . referring to the state of the world economy and the rising oil price , siemens chief executive peter loescher said it was time for germany 's biggest engineering company to act .
" we have to batten down the hatches , " before siemens caves in under the pressure , the ceo said .
in the comments which are set to be published in full on monday , loescher said siemens needed to reach a target saving of 1.2 billion euros -lrb- 1.9 billion dollars -rrb- by 2010 to remain competitive .
job cuts imminent over the weekend reports were leaked that siemens planned to cut more than 17,000 jobs from its 400,000 global workforce , including some 6,450 jobs in germany .
the amount - nearly four percent of the workforce - was considerably more than the 10,000 anticipated by trade union ig metall as part of a broad revamp of the company 's operations .
the scale of the cuts , which are expected to mainly affect administrative positions , is unprecedented in the 160-year history of the german company .
according to the sueddeutsche zeitung , the german cuts would be spread over two years and are due to be announced officially in the fall .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : peter löscher took over as ceo in 2007 in a letter to the employees , loescher called the restructuring plans the most " extensive in the last 20 years . "
he added that he hoped the job cuts would be as " socially acceptable as possible . "
siemens , which manufactures everything from hearing aids to nuclear power stations and trains in some 190 countries , posted worldwide sales last year of more than 70 billion euros .
but after problems with a range of major projects were uncovered in the early part of the year , the company has been struggling for ways to reform and streamline its production .

the head of german engineering group siemens has confirmed that a major restructuring is in the works , after media reports said the firm wanted to lay off 17,000 workers . referring to the state of the world economy and the rising oil price , siemens chief executive peter loescher said it was time for germany 's biggest engineering company to act .
" we have to batten down the hatches , " before siemens caves in under the pressure , the ceo said .
in the comments which are set to be published in full on monday , loescher said siemens needed to reach a target saving of 1.2 billion euros -lrb- 1.9 billion dollars -rrb- by 2010 to remain competitive .
job cuts imminent over the weekend reports were leaked that siemens planned to cut more than 17,000 jobs from its 400,000 global workforce , including some 6,450 jobs in germany .
the amount - nearly four percent of the workforce - was considerably more than the 10,000 anticipated by trade union ig metall as part of a broad revamp of the company 's operations .
the scale of the cuts , which are expected to mainly affect administrative positions , is unprecedented in the 160-year history of the german company .
according to the sueddeutsche zeitung , the german cuts would be spread over two years and are due to be announced officially in the fall .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : peter löscher took over as ceo in 2007 in a letter to the employees , loescher called the restructuring plans the most " extensive in the last 20 years . "
he added that he hoped the job cuts would be as " socially acceptable as possible . "
siemens , which manufactures everything from hearing aids to nuclear power stations and trains in some 190 countries , posted worldwide sales last year of more than 70 billion euros .
but after problems with a range of major projects were uncovered in the early part of the year , the company has been struggling for ways to reform and streamline its production .
peter loescher took the helm of the company in 2007 after allegations of bribery on a huge scale forced the resignation of his predecessor klaus kleinfeld and the chairman of the board heinrich von pierer . dw staff -lrb- ktz -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

-lrb- 26.06.2008 -rrb- siemens corruption trial begins after a year and a half of investigations into alleged corruption at engineering giant siemens , the first criminal trial opened on monday , may 26 .
the chief prosecutor said the massive case would send a clear message .

robert mugabe was sworn in for a new term as president of zimbabwe on sunday while the international community widely condemned the vote .
in europe , officials urged africa to play a bigger role in ending the crisis . official results released on sunday showed mugabe overwhelmingly won the country 's one-man election .
zimbabwe election officials said he received more than two million votes or about 85 percent of the vote .
opposition leader morgan tsvangirai , who pulled out of the election amid mounting violence against his supports , received about 230,000 votes .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a zimbabwean voter gets her finger dipped in purple dye to show she has voted and unable to vote again turnout for the june 27 election was put at 42 percent .
but reports have circulated that many zimbabweans were coerced into voting and that mugabe militias had applied scare tactics to anyone without the tell-tale purple fingertip proving a person had voted .
europe calls vote a farce the vote was widely condemned around the world .
german foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier denounced the election as a farce considering mugabe was the only candidate .
in a statement issued after friday 's vote , steinmeier said that germany welcomed the fact that the united nations security council was planning to discuss possible action against mugabe 's regime in the coming week .
many western leaders have urged the african union to take action at a summit in egypt on june 30 that was expected to focus on the zimbabwe election crisis . british prime minister gordon brown said the african union and the international community must work together to help bring stability to zimbabwe .
the united states has called for drawing up sanctions against zimbabwe .
the european union has said it will not rule out sanctions against " those responsible for the tragic events of recent months . "
history of defiance bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : residents of mbare line up to cast their vote in the country 's presidential election the 84-year-old veteran fighter disregarded the official results from the first-round election in march which put opposition leader morgan tsvangirai ahead . mugabe flaunted international criticism and pushed ahead with the vote , warning against outside interference in his country 's affairs and shrugging off tsvangirai 's claims of violence .
he has also said the opposition will never come to power as long as he is alive , vowing to fight to ensure it does not happen .
the zimbabwe opposition and western critics have said mugabe is a dictator who has ruined a once prosperous country .
they have sharply criticized him for applying suppression and violence against opposition supporters .
little support in africa bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : south africans demonstrate against election related violence in zimbabwe in johannesburg no african heads of state were present for the inauguration of mugabe 's sixth five-year term as president june 29 .
the head of the pan-african parliament mission told a news conference sunday that the vote was neither free nor fair and fresh polls should be held .
kenyan prime minister raila odinga , among the zimbabwean leader 's most vocal critics on the continent , called on the african union to send troops into zimbabwe and labelled mugabe " a shame to africa " .
mugabe is africa 's oldest head of state and has ruled the former british colony uninterrupted since gaining independence from britain in 1980 . dw staff -lrb- ktz -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

fernando torres scored the single goal in the intense match , which brought many german fans to tears . spain won their second european title in fine style on sunday , deservedly beating a weak germany 1-0 in vienna , on a goal from fernando torres . the handsome win culminates a stunning euro 2008 for spain , who have won five games and drawn one , scoring 12 goals and conceding just three since the european championships kicked off on june 7 in switzerland . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the spanish team in victory pose after beating germany .
sunday 's win was spain 's first international triumph since 1964 , when the european nations cup , as it was called then , was much less important than it is today . curiously , this was the first game in which spain - preferring an intelligent counter-attacking strategy - did not dominate possession from the beginning . luis aragones ' young team only had 48 percent ball possession , but nonetheless created countless chances and should have scored more goals . germany tired and frustrated germany , in contrast , failed to create a single clear chance and were clearly outclassed .
true to tradition , however , they battled until the bitter end , despite their fatigue , frustration and injuries . joachim loew 's team made an aggressive start , determined not to let spain dominate , but then the germans lacked the craft to create clear chances . spain slowly but surely got their act together and almost went ahead in the 14th minute , when german keeper jens lehmann had to keep out a deflection from defender christoph metzelder . nine minutes later torres headed a sergio ramos centre against lehmann 's post . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : fernando torres celebrates after scoring the winning goal torres scores single goal the only goal came in the 33rd minute .

the deafening sounds of cheering , klaxons and drums from the vast plaza colon , where thousands watched the match live from vienna on giant television screens , mixed with those of car horns across the city . germany fans disappointed bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a german supporter reacts after the final match between spain and germany fans of germany 's soccer team were stunned into disbelief after their team lost to spain .

fernando torres scored the single goal in the intense match , which brought many german fans to tears . spain won their second european title in fine style on sunday , deservedly beating a weak germany 1-0 in vienna , on a goal from fernando torres . the handsome win culminates a stunning euro 2008 for spain , who have won five games and drawn one , scoring 12 goals and conceding just three since the european championships kicked off on june 7 in switzerland . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the spanish team in victory pose after beating germany .
sunday 's win was spain 's first international triumph since 1964 , when the european nations cup , as it was called then , was much less important than it is today . curiously , this was the first game in which spain - preferring an intelligent counter-attacking strategy - did not dominate possession from the beginning . luis aragones ' young team only had 48 percent ball possession , but nonetheless created countless chances and should have scored more goals . germany tired and frustrated germany , in contrast , failed to create a single clear chance and were clearly outclassed .
true to tradition , however , they battled until the bitter end , despite their fatigue , frustration and injuries . joachim loew 's team made an aggressive start , determined not to let spain dominate , but then the germans lacked the craft to create clear chances . spain slowly but surely got their act together and almost went ahead in the 14th minute , when german keeper jens lehmann had to keep out a deflection from defender christoph metzelder . nine minutes later torres headed a sergio ramos centre against lehmann 's post . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : fernando torres celebrates after scoring the winning goal torres scores single goal the only goal came in the 33rd minute .
the majestic xavi hernandez played a tempting through ball for torres , who powered his way past philipp lahm and beat the lehmann with a clever chip . germany adopted a more direct approach in the second half , but with captain michael ballack not looking a hundred percent fit - and with striker lukas podolski and miroslav klose well marked and philipp lahm out with an injury - they were running more on hope than expectation . viva espana ! bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : spanish supporters cheer in plaza de colon in madrid , sunday june 29 , 2008 thousands of ecstatic spanish fans danced and chanted " viva espana " in central madrid as the country 's first major international football trophy in 44 years sparked a nationwide fiesta . the capital was awash with the red and gold national colours , as the country celebrated the euro victory in true spanish style .
the deafening sounds of cheering , klaxons and drums from the vast plaza colon , where thousands watched the match live from vienna on giant television screens , mixed with those of car horns across the city . germany fans disappointed bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a german supporter reacts after the final match between spain and germany fans of germany 's soccer team were stunned into disbelief after their team lost to spain .
the disappointment was visible on the faces of thousands who gathered in public viewing areas and fan miles to watch the match on giant screens . yet despite the loss , and the second-place finish , germany supporters applauded spain 's victory and praised germany 's solid run . dw staff -lrb- ktz -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

fernando torres scored the single goal in the intense match , which brought many german fans to tears . spain won their second european title in fine style on sunday , deservedly beating a weak germany 1-0 in vienna , on a goal from fernando torres . the handsome win culminates a stunning euro 2008 for spain , who have won five games and drawn one , scoring 12 goals and conceding just three since the european championships kicked off on june 7 in switzerland . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the spanish team in victory pose after beating germany .
sunday 's win was spain 's first international triumph since 1964 , when the european nations cup , as it was called then , was much less important than it is today . curiously , this was the first game in which spain - preferring an intelligent counter-attacking strategy - did not dominate possession from the beginning . luis aragones ' young team only had 48 percent ball possession , but nonetheless created countless chances and should have scored more goals . germany tired and frustrated germany , in contrast , failed to create a single clear chance and were clearly outclassed .
true to tradition , however , they battled until the bitter end , despite their fatigue , frustration and injuries . joachim loew 's team made an aggressive start , determined not to let spain dominate , but then the germans lacked the craft to create clear chances . spain slowly but surely got their act together and almost went ahead in the 14th minute , when german keeper jens lehmann had to keep out a deflection from defender christoph metzelder . nine minutes later torres headed a sergio ramos centre against lehmann 's post . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : fernando torres celebrates after scoring the winning goal torres scores single goal the only goal came in the 33rd minute .

robert mugabe was sworn in for a new term as president of zimbabwe on sunday while the international community widely condemned the vote .
in europe , officials urged africa to play a bigger role in ending the crisis . official results released on sunday showed mugabe overwhelmingly won the country 's one-man election .
zimbabwe election officials said he received more than two million votes or about 85 percent of the vote .
opposition leader morgan tsvangirai , who pulled out of the election amid mounting violence against his supports , received about 230,000 votes .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a zimbabwean voter gets her finger dipped in purple dye to show she has voted and unable to vote again turnout for the june 27 election was put at 42 percent .
but reports have circulated that many zimbabweans were coerced into voting and that mugabe militias had applied scare tactics to anyone without the tell-tale purple fingertip proving a person had voted .
europe calls vote a farce the vote was widely condemned around the world .
german foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier denounced the election as a farce considering mugabe was the only candidate .
in a statement issued after friday 's vote , steinmeier said that germany welcomed the fact that the united nations security council was planning to discuss possible action against mugabe 's regime in the coming week .
many western leaders have urged the african union to take action at a summit in egypt on june 30 that was expected to focus on the zimbabwe election crisis . british prime minister gordon brown said the african union and the international community must work together to help bring stability to zimbabwe .
the united states has called for drawing up sanctions against zimbabwe .
the european union has said it will not rule out sanctions against " those responsible for the tragic events of recent months . "
history of defiance bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : residents of mbare line up to cast their vote in the country 's presidential election the 84-year-old veteran fighter disregarded the official results from the first-round election in march which put opposition leader morgan tsvangirai ahead . mugabe flaunted international criticism and pushed ahead with the vote , warning against outside interference in his country 's affairs and shrugging off tsvangirai 's claims of violence .
he has also said the opposition will never come to power as long as he is alive , vowing to fight to ensure it does not happen .
the zimbabwe opposition and western critics have said mugabe is a dictator who has ruined a once prosperous country .
they have sharply criticized him for applying suppression and violence against opposition supporters .
little support in africa bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : south africans demonstrate against election related violence in zimbabwe in johannesburg no african heads of state were present for the inauguration of mugabe 's sixth five-year term as president june 29 .
the head of the pan-african parliament mission told a news conference sunday that the vote was neither free nor fair and fresh polls should be held .
kenyan prime minister raila odinga , among the zimbabwean leader 's most vocal critics on the continent , called on the african union to send troops into zimbabwe and labelled mugabe " a shame to africa " .
mugabe is africa 's oldest head of state and has ruled the former british colony uninterrupted since gaining independence from britain in 1980 . dw staff -lrb- ktz -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the head of german engineering group siemens has confirmed that a major restructuring is in the works , after media reports said the firm wanted to lay off 17,000 workers . referring to the state of the world economy and the rising oil price , siemens chief executive peter loescher said it was time for germany 's biggest engineering company to act .
" we have to batten down the hatches , " before siemens caves in under the pressure , the ceo said .
in the comments which are set to be published in full on monday , loescher said siemens needed to reach a target saving of 1.2 billion euros -lrb- 1.9 billion dollars -rrb- by 2010 to remain competitive .
job cuts imminent over the weekend reports were leaked that siemens planned to cut more than 17,000 jobs from its 400,000 global workforce , including some 6,450 jobs in germany .
the amount - nearly four percent of the workforce - was considerably more than the 10,000 anticipated by trade union ig metall as part of a broad revamp of the company 's operations .
the scale of the cuts , which are expected to mainly affect administrative positions , is unprecedented in the 160-year history of the german company .
according to the sueddeutsche zeitung , the german cuts would be spread over two years and are due to be announced officially in the fall .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : peter löscher took over as ceo in 2007 in a letter to the employees , loescher called the restructuring plans the most " extensive in the last 20 years . "
he added that he hoped the job cuts would be as " socially acceptable as possible . "
siemens , which manufactures everything from hearing aids to nuclear power stations and trains in some 190 countries , posted worldwide sales last year of more than 70 billion euros .
but after problems with a range of major projects were uncovered in the early part of the year , the company has been struggling for ways to reform and streamline its production .

fernando torres scored the single goal in the intense match , which brought many german fans to tears . spain won their second european title in fine style on sunday , deservedly beating a weak germany 1-0 in vienna , on a goal from fernando torres . the handsome win culminates a stunning euro 2008 for spain , who have won five games and drawn one , scoring 12 goals and conceding just three since the european championships kicked off on june 7 in switzerland . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the spanish team in victory pose after beating germany .
sunday 's win was spain 's first international triumph since 1964 , when the european nations cup , as it was called then , was much less important than it is today . curiously , this was the first game in which spain - preferring an intelligent counter-attacking strategy - did not dominate possession from the beginning . luis aragones ' young team only had 48 percent ball possession , but nonetheless created countless chances and should have scored more goals . germany tired and frustrated germany , in contrast , failed to create a single clear chance and were clearly outclassed .
true to tradition , however , they battled until the bitter end , despite their fatigue , frustration and injuries . joachim loew 's team made an aggressive start , determined not to let spain dominate , but then the germans lacked the craft to create clear chances . spain slowly but surely got their act together and almost went ahead in the 14th minute , when german keeper jens lehmann had to keep out a deflection from defender christoph metzelder . nine minutes later torres headed a sergio ramos centre against lehmann 's post . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : fernando torres celebrates after scoring the winning goal torres scores single goal the only goal came in the 33rd minute .

the head of german engineering group siemens has confirmed that a major restructuring is in the works , after media reports said the firm wanted to lay off 17,000 workers . referring to the state of the world economy and the rising oil price , siemens chief executive peter loescher said it was time for germany 's biggest engineering company to act .
" we have to batten down the hatches , " before siemens caves in under the pressure , the ceo said .
in the comments which are set to be published in full on monday , loescher said siemens needed to reach a target saving of 1.2 billion euros -lrb- 1.9 billion dollars -rrb- by 2010 to remain competitive .
job cuts imminent over the weekend reports were leaked that siemens planned to cut more than 17,000 jobs from its 400,000 global workforce , including some 6,450 jobs in germany .
the amount - nearly four percent of the workforce - was considerably more than the 10,000 anticipated by trade union ig metall as part of a broad revamp of the company 's operations .
the scale of the cuts , which are expected to mainly affect administrative positions , is unprecedented in the 160-year history of the german company .
according to the sueddeutsche zeitung , the german cuts would be spread over two years and are due to be announced officially in the fall .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : peter löscher took over as ceo in 2007 in a letter to the employees , loescher called the restructuring plans the most " extensive in the last 20 years . "
he added that he hoped the job cuts would be as " socially acceptable as possible . "
siemens , which manufactures everything from hearing aids to nuclear power stations and trains in some 190 countries , posted worldwide sales last year of more than 70 billion euros .
but after problems with a range of major projects were uncovered in the early part of the year , the company has been struggling for ways to reform and streamline its production .
peter loescher took the helm of the company in 2007 after allegations of bribery on a huge scale forced the resignation of his predecessor klaus kleinfeld and the chairman of the board heinrich von pierer . dw staff -lrb- ktz -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the chief prosecutor said the massive case would send a clear message .

luis aragones ' young side are hoping emulate that feat in vienna on sunday , june 29 , against germany . for a team which has become notorious for losing its bottle at the business end of tournaments and flattering to deceive on a consistent basis , spain move into their first major final in 24 years full of confidence while playing the kind of soccer they normally only reserve for the early rounds .
since they took to the field in paris to contest the 1984 european championship title against hosts france , spain have turned up for tournaments with squads full of the world 's biggest stars and the continent 's most talented players but have failed to make the latter stages .
many huge names from spanish soccer have graced the world cup and european championship stages in the shirt of the furia roja - and have shown their worth for about three games before meekly surrendering when things got serious .
normally it 's the quarter-final stage .
such has been the regularity that the spanish bow out at this stage , that it has become a bit of a mental block , if not a downright curse .
this year however , despite the fact that they were facing world champions italy at this stage , spain overcame both the italians and the psychological barrier to make it to the semis .
before earning themselves a place against italy , luis aragones ' team played their way through group d with skill and panache .
their opening game , a 4-1 thrashing of russia , got everyone believing again , while harboring all those memories of false dawns and premature celebrations .
opening game sends impressive message bildunterschrift : david villa opened his account with a hat trick against russia and got the ball rolling russia were supposed to be a new force , one with an attacking vision that could have overcome a sometimes ponderous spanish defense .
but not only did the rear guard hold firm , the spearhead proved deadly .
a david villa hat trick and a cameo goal from substitute cesc fabregas showed the world that spain had a rod of steel running from back to front , with a very sharp point at its attacking end .
the edge looked a little blunt when spain came up against the swedes in their second group match .
fernando torres got his first goal of the tournament , only to see it cancelled by zlatan ibrahimovic .
the game looked to be heading for a disappointing draw - which no doubt would have prompted questions about spain 's true quality - when that man villa popped up again to net a last gasp winner in the second minute of stoppage time .
with qualification assured , spain then finished off their group stage with a 2-1 win over already eliminated champions greece , with aragones fielding his reserves in a routine win .
spain had to come from behind to grab the points , with goals from reuben de la red and daniel guiza .
it was far from a classy performance but one which showed that spain could dig deep and regain the advantage even without a host of first-teamers on the pitch .
omens gather for quarter-final against italy then came italy .
spain had n't beaten the italians in a competitive match since a 2-0 win at the 1920 olympic games in belgium some 88 years ago .
there was also a certain amount of animosity bubbling under the surface , if the spanish press could be believed .
spain , it was claimed , were looking for revenge for the assault by mario tassotti on luis enrique which went unpunished in the quarter-final of the 1994 world cup in the united states , a match spain lost 2-1 .
whatever the motivation , spain dominated possession throughout regulation time but failed to translate their dominance into clear goal chances .
villa and david silva came close several times to breaking the tense deadlock for spain while italy offered few attacking threats .
spain 's domination continued into extra time , with italy 's keeper buffon saving from villa and santi cazorla shooting wide .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : iker casillas saves one of the penalties in the shoot-out spain may have had their horrible record in penalty shoot-outs at the back of their minds but they did n't show it .
while the spanish slotted in four of their kicks , keeper iker casillas was the hero , saving penalties from daniel de rossi and antonio di natale to put spain in the semi-finals .
the shoot-out victory also ended spain 's june 22 penalty jinx .
on june 22 , 1986 , spain lost to belgium in a dramatic world cup quarter-final shoot-out , then against england in euro 1996 on the same june date 10 years later .
and it was on june 22 , 2002 that the spaniards lost to hosts south korea in the 2002 world cup quarters .
spain raise their game to dominate russia meeting russia again in the semi-final , spain knew that their opponents had grown in confidence since their thrashing in the first game .
the return of andrei arshavin had inspired russia against sweden in the game that sealed qualification and then again in the rampant display that knocked the dutch out in the quarter-final .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : spain turned on the style to overcome russia but spain were irrepressible and arshavin was eclipsed by substitute cesc fabregas , on for the injured david villa after only 30 minutes or so of play .
fabregas delivered a midfield masterclass , pulling the strings and conducting the play as spain ran out 3-0 winners .
germany may not have fancied playing the russians , with their unpredictably marauding style , but they may not be looking forward to facing a spain team just one game away from ending 44 trophy-less years of hurt . nick amies send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the legendary formula one race course , nicknamed the green hell , is to be turned into a year-round leisure center . located 90 kilometers southwest of cologne in the heart of the eifel national park , the nürburgring has seen a lot in its 80 years : daredevil drivers , jubilant winners and too many dead . the track 's history includes more than 100 races and tragic crashes - like the fiery wreck at the 1976 grand prix , from which driver niki lauda barely escaped . now , however , the race course is quiet ; scaffolding covers the track 's start and finish lines and the main grandstands . in a major facelift meant to bring more life to the area , the track is being repurposed as a year-round leisure and business center with a promenade , an arena for small events , a convention center and a new grandstand .
four-star and a three-star hotels are entering the fray , along with a series of bungalows that will add up to 1,000 beds to the area . the nürburgring corporation plans to invest 215 million euros by spring of next year , according to ceo walter kafitz . when the formula one returns bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " rock am ring " brings in more than two million visitors annually new grand prix racetracks in abu dhabi , shanghai and singapore are more lucrative for formula one boss bernie eccleston . that means that the nürburgring has felt it must dispel the myth that it is past its prime - one reason justifying the course be flipped on its head . " when we talk about nürburgring 2009 , we 're also talking about the subsequent growth and development of the area , " said kafitz . after the renovation , the racetrack expects around 2 million per year , including the number of people coming to the world superbike championships and europe 's largest rock festival , the " rock am ring . " " new growth has to come from outside , " said kafitz .
" of course , we want to increase the interest in motorsports .
but we also do n't want to be dependent on motorsports .
we have to open up our offerings to bring people to the area from january to december . " while over half of the investments came from private investors , the " nürburgring 2009 " project is not without its critics .
some complain that the company is 90 percent owned by the state of rhineland palatinate , and they have doubts about whether their tax dollars are being put to good use . but kafitz says the ring is a business engine driving the region . according to information provided by the company , the track has invested about 100 million euros over the last 15 years in the modernization of the track and pits without considerable public support .
they say they have created 40 new jobs and promise to bring an additional 500 jobs to the region in the next two years . where managers can satisfy their need for speed bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : operators hope an 18-hole golf course will draw more tourists once construction is complete , more than half a million additional visitors are expected in the eifel each year .
at present , turnover at the ring is approximately 50 million annually - a number expected to double . nürburgring operators also expect to increase profit through the new 18-hole golf course or high-octane cars rentals to satisfy visitors ' need for speed . for companies like xerox and the italian motorcycle manufacturer ducati , which sponsor motorsports at the track , the nürburgring is a lucrative address . " we have a hotel directly on the course .
you can see the racetrack directly from your hotel room - that 's an amazing experience , " said marketing manager albert brenner . and despite all the add-ons , such as golf , motorsports will remain front and center at the ring , says kafitz . " it 's our core , " he said .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de euro 2008 -pipe- 29.06.2008 spain ready to end 44 years of hurt with euro title großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : spain were imperious against russia and head into the final in good form spain captured their only major international trophy when they won the 1964 european championship on home soil .
luis aragones ' young side are hoping emulate that feat in vienna on sunday , june 29 , against germany . for a team which has become notorious for losing its bottle at the business end of tournaments and flattering to deceive on a consistent basis , spain move into their first major final in 24 years full of confidence while playing the kind of soccer they normally only reserve for the early rounds .
since they took to the field in paris to contest the 1984 european championship title against hosts france , spain have turned up for tournaments with squads full of the world 's biggest stars and the continent 's most talented players but have failed to make the latter stages .
many huge names from spanish soccer have graced the world cup and european championship stages in the shirt of the furia roja - and have shown their worth for about three games before meekly surrendering when things got serious .
normally it 's the quarter-final stage .
such has been the regularity that the spanish bow out at this stage , that it has become a bit of a mental block , if not a downright curse .
this year however , despite the fact that they were facing world champions italy at this stage , spain overcame both the italians and the psychological barrier to make it to the semis .
before earning themselves a place against italy , luis aragones ' team played their way through group d with skill and panache .
their opening game , a 4-1 thrashing of russia , got everyone believing again , while harboring all those memories of false dawns and premature celebrations .
opening game sends impressive message bildunterschrift : david villa opened his account with a hat trick against russia and got the ball rolling russia were supposed to be a new force , one with an attacking vision that could have overcome a sometimes ponderous spanish defense .
but not only did the rear guard hold firm , the spearhead proved deadly .
a david villa hat trick and a cameo goal from substitute cesc fabregas showed the world that spain had a rod of steel running from back to front , with a very sharp point at its attacking end .
the edge looked a little blunt when spain came up against the swedes in their second group match .
fernando torres got his first goal of the tournament , only to see it cancelled by zlatan ibrahimovic .
the game looked to be heading for a disappointing draw - which no doubt would have prompted questions about spain 's true quality - when that man villa popped up again to net a last gasp winner in the second minute of stoppage time .
with qualification assured , spain then finished off their group stage with a 2-1 win over already eliminated champions greece , with aragones fielding his reserves in a routine win .
spain had to come from behind to grab the points , with goals from reuben de la red and daniel guiza .
it was far from a classy performance but one which showed that spain could dig deep and regain the advantage even without a host of first-teamers on the pitch .
omens gather for quarter-final against italy then came italy .
spain had n't beaten the italians in a competitive match since a 2-0 win at the 1920 olympic games in belgium some 88 years ago .
there was also a certain amount of animosity bubbling under the surface , if the spanish press could be believed .
spain , it was claimed , were looking for revenge for the assault by mario tassotti on luis enrique which went unpunished in the quarter-final of the 1994 world cup in the united states , a match spain lost 2-1 .
whatever the motivation , spain dominated possession throughout regulation time but failed to translate their dominance into clear goal chances .
villa and david silva came close several times to breaking the tense deadlock for spain while italy offered few attacking threats .
spain 's domination continued into extra time , with italy 's keeper buffon saving from villa and santi cazorla shooting wide .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : iker casillas saves one of the penalties in the shoot-out spain may have had their horrible record in penalty shoot-outs at the back of their minds but they did n't show it .
while the spanish slotted in four of their kicks , keeper iker casillas was the hero , saving penalties from daniel de rossi and antonio di natale to put spain in the semi-finals .
the shoot-out victory also ended spain 's june 22 penalty jinx .
on june 22 , 1986 , spain lost to belgium in a dramatic world cup quarter-final shoot-out , then against england in euro 1996 on the same june date 10 years later .
and it was on june 22 , 2002 that the spaniards lost to hosts south korea in the 2002 world cup quarters .
spain raise their game to dominate russia meeting russia again in the semi-final , spain knew that their opponents had grown in confidence since their thrashing in the first game .
the return of andrei arshavin had inspired russia against sweden in the game that sealed qualification and then again in the rampant display that knocked the dutch out in the quarter-final .

luis aragones ' young side are hoping emulate that feat in vienna on sunday , june 29 , against germany . for a team which has become notorious for losing its bottle at the business end of tournaments and flattering to deceive on a consistent basis , spain move into their first major final in 24 years full of confidence while playing the kind of soccer they normally only reserve for the early rounds .
since they took to the field in paris to contest the 1984 european championship title against hosts france , spain have turned up for tournaments with squads full of the world 's biggest stars and the continent 's most talented players but have failed to make the latter stages .
many huge names from spanish soccer have graced the world cup and european championship stages in the shirt of the furia roja - and have shown their worth for about three games before meekly surrendering when things got serious .
normally it 's the quarter-final stage .
such has been the regularity that the spanish bow out at this stage , that it has become a bit of a mental block , if not a downright curse .
this year however , despite the fact that they were facing world champions italy at this stage , spain overcame both the italians and the psychological barrier to make it to the semis .
before earning themselves a place against italy , luis aragones ' team played their way through group d with skill and panache .
their opening game , a 4-1 thrashing of russia , got everyone believing again , while harboring all those memories of false dawns and premature celebrations .
opening game sends impressive message bildunterschrift : david villa opened his account with a hat trick against russia and got the ball rolling russia were supposed to be a new force , one with an attacking vision that could have overcome a sometimes ponderous spanish defense .
but not only did the rear guard hold firm , the spearhead proved deadly .
a david villa hat trick and a cameo goal from substitute cesc fabregas showed the world that spain had a rod of steel running from back to front , with a very sharp point at its attacking end .
the edge looked a little blunt when spain came up against the swedes in their second group match .
fernando torres got his first goal of the tournament , only to see it cancelled by zlatan ibrahimovic .
the game looked to be heading for a disappointing draw - which no doubt would have prompted questions about spain 's true quality - when that man villa popped up again to net a last gasp winner in the second minute of stoppage time .
with qualification assured , spain then finished off their group stage with a 2-1 win over already eliminated champions greece , with aragones fielding his reserves in a routine win .
spain had to come from behind to grab the points , with goals from reuben de la red and daniel guiza .
it was far from a classy performance but one which showed that spain could dig deep and regain the advantage even without a host of first-teamers on the pitch .
omens gather for quarter-final against italy then came italy .
spain had n't beaten the italians in a competitive match since a 2-0 win at the 1920 olympic games in belgium some 88 years ago .
there was also a certain amount of animosity bubbling under the surface , if the spanish press could be believed .
spain , it was claimed , were looking for revenge for the assault by mario tassotti on luis enrique which went unpunished in the quarter-final of the 1994 world cup in the united states , a match spain lost 2-1 .
whatever the motivation , spain dominated possession throughout regulation time but failed to translate their dominance into clear goal chances .
villa and david silva came close several times to breaking the tense deadlock for spain while italy offered few attacking threats .
spain 's domination continued into extra time , with italy 's keeper buffon saving from villa and santi cazorla shooting wide .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : iker casillas saves one of the penalties in the shoot-out spain may have had their horrible record in penalty shoot-outs at the back of their minds but they did n't show it .
while the spanish slotted in four of their kicks , keeper iker casillas was the hero , saving penalties from daniel de rossi and antonio di natale to put spain in the semi-finals .
the shoot-out victory also ended spain 's june 22 penalty jinx .
on june 22 , 1986 , spain lost to belgium in a dramatic world cup quarter-final shoot-out , then against england in euro 1996 on the same june date 10 years later .
and it was on june 22 , 2002 that the spaniards lost to hosts south korea in the 2002 world cup quarters .
spain raise their game to dominate russia meeting russia again in the semi-final , spain knew that their opponents had grown in confidence since their thrashing in the first game .
the return of andrei arshavin had inspired russia against sweden in the game that sealed qualification and then again in the rampant display that knocked the dutch out in the quarter-final .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : spain turned on the style to overcome russia but spain were irrepressible and arshavin was eclipsed by substitute cesc fabregas , on for the injured david villa after only 30 minutes or so of play .
fabregas delivered a midfield masterclass , pulling the strings and conducting the play as spain ran out 3-0 winners .
germany may not have fancied playing the russians , with their unpredictably marauding style , but they may not be looking forward to facing a spain team just one game away from ending 44 trophy-less years of hurt . nick amies send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the legendary formula one race course , nicknamed the green hell , is to be turned into a year-round leisure center . located 90 kilometers southwest of cologne in the heart of the eifel national park , the nürburgring has seen a lot in its 80 years : daredevil drivers , jubilant winners and too many dead . the track 's history includes more than 100 races and tragic crashes - like the fiery wreck at the 1976 grand prix , from which driver niki lauda barely escaped . now , however , the race course is quiet ; scaffolding covers the track 's start and finish lines and the main grandstands . in a major facelift meant to bring more life to the area , the track is being repurposed as a year-round leisure and business center with a promenade , an arena for small events , a convention center and a new grandstand .
four-star and a three-star hotels are entering the fray , along with a series of bungalows that will add up to 1,000 beds to the area . the nürburgring corporation plans to invest 215 million euros by spring of next year , according to ceo walter kafitz . when the formula one returns bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " rock am ring " brings in more than two million visitors annually new grand prix racetracks in abu dhabi , shanghai and singapore are more lucrative for formula one boss bernie eccleston . that means that the nürburgring has felt it must dispel the myth that it is past its prime - one reason justifying the course be flipped on its head . " when we talk about nürburgring 2009 , we 're also talking about the subsequent growth and development of the area , " said kafitz . after the renovation , the racetrack expects around 2 million per year , including the number of people coming to the world superbike championships and europe 's largest rock festival , the " rock am ring . " " new growth has to come from outside , " said kafitz .
" of course , we want to increase the interest in motorsports .
but we also do n't want to be dependent on motorsports .
we have to open up our offerings to bring people to the area from january to december . " while over half of the investments came from private investors , the " nürburgring 2009 " project is not without its critics .
some complain that the company is 90 percent owned by the state of rhineland palatinate , and they have doubts about whether their tax dollars are being put to good use . but kafitz says the ring is a business engine driving the region . according to information provided by the company , the track has invested about 100 million euros over the last 15 years in the modernization of the track and pits without considerable public support .
they say they have created 40 new jobs and promise to bring an additional 500 jobs to the region in the next two years . where managers can satisfy their need for speed bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : operators hope an 18-hole golf course will draw more tourists once construction is complete , more than half a million additional visitors are expected in the eifel each year .
at present , turnover at the ring is approximately 50 million annually - a number expected to double . nürburgring operators also expect to increase profit through the new 18-hole golf course or high-octane cars rentals to satisfy visitors ' need for speed . for companies like xerox and the italian motorcycle manufacturer ducati , which sponsor motorsports at the track , the nürburgring is a lucrative address . " we have a hotel directly on the course .
you can see the racetrack directly from your hotel room - that 's an amazing experience , " said marketing manager albert brenner . and despite all the add-ons , such as golf , motorsports will remain front and center at the ring , says kafitz . " it 's our core , " he said .

robert mugabe was sworn in for a new term as president of zimbabwe on sunday while the international community widely condemned the vote .
in europe , officials urged africa to play a bigger role in ending the crisis . official results released on sunday showed mugabe overwhelmingly won the country 's one-man election .
zimbabwe election officials said he received more than two million votes or about 85 percent of the vote .
opposition leader morgan tsvangirai , who pulled out of the election amid mounting violence against his supports , received about 230,000 votes .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a zimbabwean voter gets her finger dipped in purple dye to show she has voted and unable to vote again turnout for the june 27 election was put at 42 percent .
but reports have circulated that many zimbabweans were coerced into voting and that mugabe militias had applied scare tactics to anyone without the tell-tale purple fingertip proving a person had voted .
europe calls vote a farce the vote was widely condemned around the world .
german foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier denounced the election as a farce considering mugabe was the only candidate .
in a statement issued after friday 's vote , steinmeier said that germany welcomed the fact that the united nations security council was planning to discuss possible action against mugabe 's regime in the coming week .
many western leaders have urged the african union to take action at a summit in egypt on june 30 that was expected to focus on the zimbabwe election crisis . british prime minister gordon brown said the african union and the international community must work together to help bring stability to zimbabwe .
the united states has called for drawing up sanctions against zimbabwe .
the european union has said it will not rule out sanctions against " those responsible for the tragic events of recent months . "
history of defiance bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : residents of mbare line up to cast their vote in the country 's presidential election the 84-year-old veteran fighter disregarded the official results from the first-round election in march which put opposition leader morgan tsvangirai ahead . mugabe flaunted international criticism and pushed ahead with the vote , warning against outside interference in his country 's affairs and shrugging off tsvangirai 's claims of violence .
he has also said the opposition will never come to power as long as he is alive , vowing to fight to ensure it does not happen .
the zimbabwe opposition and western critics have said mugabe is a dictator who has ruined a once prosperous country .
they have sharply criticized him for applying suppression and violence against opposition supporters .
little support in africa bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : south africans demonstrate against election related violence in zimbabwe in johannesburg no african heads of state were present for the inauguration of mugabe 's sixth five-year term as president june 29 .
the head of the pan-african parliament mission told a news conference sunday that the vote was neither free nor fair and fresh polls should be held .
kenyan prime minister raila odinga , among the zimbabwean leader 's most vocal critics on the continent , called on the african union to send troops into zimbabwe and labelled mugabe " a shame to africa " .
mugabe is africa 's oldest head of state and has ruled the former british colony uninterrupted since gaining independence from britain in 1980 . dw staff -lrb- ktz -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

robert mugabe was sworn in for a new term as president of zimbabwe on sunday while the international community widely condemned the vote .
in europe , officials urged africa to play a bigger role in ending the crisis . official results released on sunday showed mugabe overwhelmingly won the country 's one-man election .
zimbabwe election officials said he received more than two million votes or about 85 percent of the vote .
opposition leader morgan tsvangirai , who pulled out of the election amid mounting violence against his supports , received about 230,000 votes .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a zimbabwean voter gets her finger dipped in purple dye to show she has voted and unable to vote again turnout for the june 27 election was put at 42 percent .
but reports have circulated that many zimbabweans were coerced into voting and that mugabe militias had applied scare tactics to anyone without the tell-tale purple fingertip proving a person had voted .
europe calls vote a farce the vote was widely condemned around the world .
german foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier denounced the election as a farce considering mugabe was the only candidate .
in a statement issued after friday 's vote , steinmeier said that germany welcomed the fact that the united nations security council was planning to discuss possible action against mugabe 's regime in the coming week .
many western leaders have urged the african union to take action at a summit in egypt on june 30 that was expected to focus on the zimbabwe election crisis . british prime minister gordon brown said the african union and the international community must work together to help bring stability to zimbabwe .
the united states has called for drawing up sanctions against zimbabwe .
the european union has said it will not rule out sanctions against " those responsible for the tragic events of recent months . "
history of defiance bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : residents of mbare line up to cast their vote in the country 's presidential election the 84-year-old veteran fighter disregarded the official results from the first-round election in march which put opposition leader morgan tsvangirai ahead . mugabe flaunted international criticism and pushed ahead with the vote , warning against outside interference in his country 's affairs and shrugging off tsvangirai 's claims of violence .
he has also said the opposition will never come to power as long as he is alive , vowing to fight to ensure it does not happen .
the zimbabwe opposition and western critics have said mugabe is a dictator who has ruined a once prosperous country .
they have sharply criticized him for applying suppression and violence against opposition supporters .
little support in africa bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : south africans demonstrate against election related violence in zimbabwe in johannesburg no african heads of state were present for the inauguration of mugabe 's sixth five-year term as president june 29 .
the head of the pan-african parliament mission told a news conference sunday that the vote was neither free nor fair and fresh polls should be held .
kenyan prime minister raila odinga , among the zimbabwean leader 's most vocal critics on the continent , called on the african union to send troops into zimbabwe and labelled mugabe " a shame to africa " .

on the streets of berlin , preparations for the final match were in full swing . from chancellor angela merkel downwards , germans will be cheering on " schweini , " " poldi " and their teammates in a nation now much more comfortable with being patriotic ever since the 2006 world cup was held on home soil . in towns and cities across the country , hundreds of thousands were expected at public viewing areas to watch the match beamed in from vienna from 20:45 local time onto huge screens and tens of millions will be glued to their tvs at home . on the streets of the capital , people are gathering in beer gardens hours before the game where they 'll follow the action on large-screen televisions .
some have been seen carrying refrigerators down streets to make sure parties are fully stocked .
black , red and gold flags are everywhere . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the referee for the final of euro 2008 holds a match ball nearly half a million people watched the last game in the specially erected " fan mile " around the brandenburg gate in berlin alone , and the atmosphere will be more electric still on sunday if joachim loew 's team triumphs . according to a survey in the bild am sonntag weekely , 85 percent of the country 's 82 million population will follow the match , and for all practical purposes , the country will come to a stand-still . german automakers like daimler , volkswagen and audi plan to shut down production during the game so that their workers can follow the match before the conveyor belts and europe 's biggest economy grind back into action after the final whistle . only one in five german televisions were tuned into something else as almost 30 million viewers were glued to wednesday 's semi-final thriller against turkey , and sunday 's final was not expected to be any less of a crowd-puller . worries about ballack bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : these guys have got to be feeling the pressure despite their confidence , the country is sweating over the fact that powerhouse captain michael ballack might not take to the field after hurting his leg in training at the team 's base in southern switzerland . nevertheless , 72 percent believe their side will win the wunder von wien -lrb- the vienna miracle -rrb- , according to bild am sonntag 's poll . " ballack injured ! , " the top-selling paper 's front page screams .
" but we are going to win the cup anyway ! " only one in five took the more pessimistic view - including none other than finance minister peer steinbrueck who perhaps unwisely predicts a 3-1 hammering , the paper said .
eight percent were hedging their bets . leaders in attendance merkel herself , who was shown literally jumping for joy in basel when the winning goal against turkey hit the back of the net on wednesday , will watch the match in vienna along with president horst koehler and other ministers . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : angela merkel and national player bastian schweinsteiger merkel became a regular in the stands during the world cup .
she has even taken to giving the players some motherly advice , and after the turkey match gave an interview in the flash zone area usually reserved for players and managers . her spokesman had to keep the chancellor informed by text message of the score in the game against portugal while she was tied up with more serious matters at an eu summit on june 19 . " i am sure that our team is going to succeed , " president koehler said in a column in the top-selling bild newspaper on sunday .
" our opponent is strong ... but with the fire in their bellies the german team can beat them . " a parade has been organized in central berlin for monday for the players - even if they lose - and the city authorities have asked schools to give pupils the afternoon off so they can attend . " it is very important for us that the team will be greeted by its supporters back in germany .
berlin has become like a second home to us since the 2006 world cup , " loew said . dw staff -lrb- jam -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

fernando torres scored the single goal in the intense match , which brought many german fans to tears . spain won their second european title in fine style on sunday , deservedly beating a weak germany 1-0 in vienna , on a goal from fernando torres . the handsome win culminates a stunning euro 2008 for spain , who have won five games and drawn one , scoring 12 goals and conceding just three since the european championships kicked off on june 7 in switzerland . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the spanish team in victory pose after beating germany .
sunday 's win was spain 's first international triumph since 1964 , when the european nations cup , as it was called then , was much less important than it is today . curiously , this was the first game in which spain - preferring an intelligent counter-attacking strategy - did not dominate possession from the beginning . luis aragones ' young team only had 48 percent ball possession , but nonetheless created countless chances and should have scored more goals . germany tired and frustrated germany , in contrast , failed to create a single clear chance and were clearly outclassed .
true to tradition , however , they battled until the bitter end , despite their fatigue , frustration and injuries . joachim loew 's team made an aggressive start , determined not to let spain dominate , but then the germans lacked the craft to create clear chances . spain slowly but surely got their act together and almost went ahead in the 14th minute , when german keeper jens lehmann had to keep out a deflection from defender christoph metzelder . nine minutes later torres headed a sergio ramos centre against lehmann 's post . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : fernando torres celebrates after scoring the winning goal torres scores single goal the only goal came in the 33rd minute .

fernando torres scored the single goal in the intense match , which brought many german fans to tears . spain won their second european title in fine style on sunday , deservedly beating a weak germany 1-0 in vienna , on a goal from fernando torres . the handsome win culminates a stunning euro 2008 for spain , who have won five games and drawn one , scoring 12 goals and conceding just three since the european championships kicked off on june 7 in switzerland . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the spanish team in victory pose after beating germany .
sunday 's win was spain 's first international triumph since 1964 , when the european nations cup , as it was called then , was much less important than it is today . curiously , this was the first game in which spain - preferring an intelligent counter-attacking strategy - did not dominate possession from the beginning . luis aragones ' young team only had 48 percent ball possession , but nonetheless created countless chances and should have scored more goals . germany tired and frustrated germany , in contrast , failed to create a single clear chance and were clearly outclassed .
true to tradition , however , they battled until the bitter end , despite their fatigue , frustration and injuries . joachim loew 's team made an aggressive start , determined not to let spain dominate , but then the germans lacked the craft to create clear chances . spain slowly but surely got their act together and almost went ahead in the 14th minute , when german keeper jens lehmann had to keep out a deflection from defender christoph metzelder . nine minutes later torres headed a sergio ramos centre against lehmann 's post . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : fernando torres celebrates after scoring the winning goal torres scores single goal the only goal came in the 33rd minute .
the majestic xavi hernandez played a tempting through ball for torres , who powered his way past philipp lahm and beat the lehmann with a clever chip . germany adopted a more direct approach in the second half , but with captain michael ballack not looking a hundred percent fit - and with striker lukas podolski and miroslav klose well marked and philipp lahm out with an injury - they were running more on hope than expectation . viva espana ! bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : spanish supporters cheer in plaza de colon in madrid , sunday june 29 , 2008 thousands of ecstatic spanish fans danced and chanted " viva espana " in central madrid as the country 's first major international football trophy in 44 years sparked a nationwide fiesta . the capital was awash with the red and gold national colours , as the country celebrated the euro victory in true spanish style .
the deafening sounds of cheering , klaxons and drums from the vast plaza colon , where thousands watched the match live from vienna on giant television screens , mixed with those of car horns across the city . germany fans disappointed bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a german supporter reacts after the final match between spain and germany fans of germany 's soccer team were stunned into disbelief after their team lost to spain .
the disappointment was visible on the faces of thousands who gathered in public viewing areas and fan miles to watch the match on giant screens . yet despite the loss , and the second-place finish , germany supporters applauded spain 's victory and praised germany 's solid run . dw staff -lrb- ktz -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the head of german engineering group siemens has confirmed that a major restructuring is in the works , after media reports said the firm wanted to lay off 17,000 workers . referring to the state of the world economy and the rising oil price , siemens chief executive peter loescher said it was time for germany 's biggest engineering company to act .
" we have to batten down the hatches , " before siemens caves in under the pressure , the ceo said .
in the comments which are set to be published in full on monday , loescher said siemens needed to reach a target saving of 1.2 billion euros -lrb- 1.9 billion dollars -rrb- by 2010 to remain competitive .
job cuts imminent over the weekend reports were leaked that siemens planned to cut more than 17,000 jobs from its 400,000 global workforce , including some 6,450 jobs in germany .
the amount - nearly four percent of the workforce - was considerably more than the 10,000 anticipated by trade union ig metall as part of a broad revamp of the company 's operations .
the scale of the cuts , which are expected to mainly affect administrative positions , is unprecedented in the 160-year history of the german company .
according to the sueddeutsche zeitung , the german cuts would be spread over two years and are due to be announced officially in the fall .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : peter löscher took over as ceo in 2007 in a letter to the employees , loescher called the restructuring plans the most " extensive in the last 20 years . "
he added that he hoped the job cuts would be as " socially acceptable as possible . "
siemens , which manufactures everything from hearing aids to nuclear power stations and trains in some 190 countries , posted worldwide sales last year of more than 70 billion euros .
but after problems with a range of major projects were uncovered in the early part of the year , the company has been struggling for ways to reform and streamline its production .
peter loescher took the helm of the company in 2007 after allegations of bribery on a huge scale forced the resignation of his predecessor klaus kleinfeld and the chairman of the board heinrich von pierer . dw staff -lrb- ktz -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the head of german engineering group siemens has confirmed that a major restructuring is in the works , after media reports said the firm wanted to lay off 17,000 workers . referring to the state of the world economy and the rising oil price , siemens chief executive peter loescher said it was time for germany 's biggest engineering company to act .
" we have to batten down the hatches , " before siemens caves in under the pressure , the ceo said .
in the comments which are set to be published in full on monday , loescher said siemens needed to reach a target saving of 1.2 billion euros -lrb- 1.9 billion dollars -rrb- by 2010 to remain competitive .
job cuts imminent over the weekend reports were leaked that siemens planned to cut more than 17,000 jobs from its 400,000 global workforce , including some 6,450 jobs in germany .
the amount - nearly four percent of the workforce - was considerably more than the 10,000 anticipated by trade union ig metall as part of a broad revamp of the company 's operations .
the scale of the cuts , which are expected to mainly affect administrative positions , is unprecedented in the 160-year history of the german company .
according to the sueddeutsche zeitung , the german cuts would be spread over two years and are due to be announced officially in the fall .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : peter löscher took over as ceo in 2007 in a letter to the employees , loescher called the restructuring plans the most " extensive in the last 20 years . "
he added that he hoped the job cuts would be as " socially acceptable as possible . "
siemens , which manufactures everything from hearing aids to nuclear power stations and trains in some 190 countries , posted worldwide sales last year of more than 70 billion euros .
but after problems with a range of major projects were uncovered in the early part of the year , the company has been struggling for ways to reform and streamline its production .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de euro 2008 -pipe- 29.06.2008 spain lifts trophy in euro 2008 großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : spainish players raise the european cup in vienna 's ernst-happel stadium germany 's hopes were dashed sunday when spain took home the title in the european championship soccer final in vienna .
fernando torres scored the single goal in the intense match , which brought many german fans to tears . spain won their second european title in fine style on sunday , deservedly beating a weak germany 1-0 in vienna , on a goal from fernando torres . the handsome win culminates a stunning euro 2008 for spain , who have won five games and drawn one , scoring 12 goals and conceding just three since the european championships kicked off on june 7 in switzerland . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the spanish team in victory pose after beating germany .
sunday 's win was spain 's first international triumph since 1964 , when the european nations cup , as it was called then , was much less important than it is today . curiously , this was the first game in which spain - preferring an intelligent counter-attacking strategy - did not dominate possession from the beginning . luis aragones ' young team only had 48 percent ball possession , but nonetheless created countless chances and should have scored more goals . germany tired and frustrated germany , in contrast , failed to create a single clear chance and were clearly outclassed .
true to tradition , however , they battled until the bitter end , despite their fatigue , frustration and injuries . joachim loew 's team made an aggressive start , determined not to let spain dominate , but then the germans lacked the craft to create clear chances . spain slowly but surely got their act together and almost went ahead in the 14th minute , when german keeper jens lehmann had to keep out a deflection from defender christoph metzelder . nine minutes later torres headed a sergio ramos centre against lehmann 's post . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : fernando torres celebrates after scoring the winning goal torres scores single goal the only goal came in the 33rd minute .
the majestic xavi hernandez played a tempting through ball for torres , who powered his way past philipp lahm and beat the lehmann with a clever chip . germany adopted a more direct approach in the second half , but with captain michael ballack not looking a hundred percent fit - and with striker lukas podolski and miroslav klose well marked and philipp lahm out with an injury - they were running more on hope than expectation . viva espana ! bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : spanish supporters cheer in plaza de colon in madrid , sunday june 29 , 2008 thousands of ecstatic spanish fans danced and chanted " viva espana " in central madrid as the country 's first major international football trophy in 44 years sparked a nationwide fiesta . the capital was awash with the red and gold national colours , as the country celebrated the euro victory in true spanish style .
the deafening sounds of cheering , klaxons and drums from the vast plaza colon , where thousands watched the match live from vienna on giant television screens , mixed with those of car horns across the city . germany fans disappointed bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a german supporter reacts after the final match between spain and germany fans of germany 's soccer team were stunned into disbelief after their team lost to spain .
the disappointment was visible on the faces of thousands who gathered in public viewing areas and fan miles to watch the match on giant screens . yet despite the loss , and the second-place finish , germany supporters applauded spain 's victory and praised germany 's solid run . dw staff -lrb- ktz -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

on the streets of berlin , preparations for the final match were in full swing . from chancellor angela merkel downwards , germans will be cheering on " schweini , " " poldi " and their teammates in a nation now much more comfortable with being patriotic ever since the 2006 world cup was held on home soil . in towns and cities across the country , hundreds of thousands were expected at public viewing areas to watch the match beamed in from vienna from 20:45 local time onto huge screens and tens of millions will be glued to their tvs at home . on the streets of the capital , people are gathering in beer gardens hours before the game where they 'll follow the action on large-screen televisions .
some have been seen carrying refrigerators down streets to make sure parties are fully stocked .
black , red and gold flags are everywhere . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the referee for the final of euro 2008 holds a match ball nearly half a million people watched the last game in the specially erected " fan mile " around the brandenburg gate in berlin alone , and the atmosphere will be more electric still on sunday if joachim loew 's team triumphs . according to a survey in the bild am sonntag weekely , 85 percent of the country 's 82 million population will follow the match , and for all practical purposes , the country will come to a stand-still . german automakers like daimler , volkswagen and audi plan to shut down production during the game so that their workers can follow the match before the conveyor belts and europe 's biggest economy grind back into action after the final whistle . only one in five german televisions were tuned into something else as almost 30 million viewers were glued to wednesday 's semi-final thriller against turkey , and sunday 's final was not expected to be any less of a crowd-puller . worries about ballack bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : these guys have got to be feeling the pressure despite their confidence , the country is sweating over the fact that powerhouse captain michael ballack might not take to the field after hurting his leg in training at the team 's base in southern switzerland . nevertheless , 72 percent believe their side will win the wunder von wien -lrb- the vienna miracle -rrb- , according to bild am sonntag 's poll . " ballack injured ! , " the top-selling paper 's front page screams .
" but we are going to win the cup anyway ! " only one in five took the more pessimistic view - including none other than finance minister peer steinbrueck who perhaps unwisely predicts a 3-1 hammering , the paper said .
eight percent were hedging their bets . leaders in attendance merkel herself , who was shown literally jumping for joy in basel when the winning goal against turkey hit the back of the net on wednesday , will watch the match in vienna along with president horst koehler and other ministers . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : angela merkel and national player bastian schweinsteiger merkel became a regular in the stands during the world cup .
she has even taken to giving the players some motherly advice , and after the turkey match gave an interview in the flash zone area usually reserved for players and managers . her spokesman had to keep the chancellor informed by text message of the score in the game against portugal while she was tied up with more serious matters at an eu summit on june 19 . " i am sure that our team is going to succeed , " president koehler said in a column in the top-selling bild newspaper on sunday .
" our opponent is strong ... but with the fire in their bellies the german team can beat them . " a parade has been organized in central berlin for monday for the players - even if they lose - and the city authorities have asked schools to give pupils the afternoon off so they can attend . " it is very important for us that the team will be greeted by its supporters back in germany .

fernando torres scored the single goal in the intense match , which brought many german fans to tears . spain won their second european title in fine style on sunday , deservedly beating a weak germany 1-0 in vienna , on a goal from fernando torres . the handsome win culminates a stunning euro 2008 for spain , who have won five games and drawn one , scoring 12 goals and conceding just three since the european championships kicked off on june 7 in switzerland . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the spanish team in victory pose after beating germany .
sunday 's win was spain 's first international triumph since 1964 , when the european nations cup , as it was called then , was much less important than it is today . curiously , this was the first game in which spain - preferring an intelligent counter-attacking strategy - did not dominate possession from the beginning . luis aragones ' young team only had 48 percent ball possession , but nonetheless created countless chances and should have scored more goals . germany tired and frustrated germany , in contrast , failed to create a single clear chance and were clearly outclassed .
true to tradition , however , they battled until the bitter end , despite their fatigue , frustration and injuries . joachim loew 's team made an aggressive start , determined not to let spain dominate , but then the germans lacked the craft to create clear chances . spain slowly but surely got their act together and almost went ahead in the 14th minute , when german keeper jens lehmann had to keep out a deflection from defender christoph metzelder . nine minutes later torres headed a sergio ramos centre against lehmann 's post . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : fernando torres celebrates after scoring the winning goal torres scores single goal the only goal came in the 33rd minute .
the majestic xavi hernandez played a tempting through ball for torres , who powered his way past philipp lahm and beat the lehmann with a clever chip . germany adopted a more direct approach in the second half , but with captain michael ballack not looking a hundred percent fit - and with striker lukas podolski and miroslav klose well marked and philipp lahm out with an injury - they were running more on hope than expectation . viva espana ! bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : spanish supporters cheer in plaza de colon in madrid , sunday june 29 , 2008 thousands of ecstatic spanish fans danced and chanted " viva espana " in central madrid as the country 's first major international football trophy in 44 years sparked a nationwide fiesta . the capital was awash with the red and gold national colours , as the country celebrated the euro victory in true spanish style .
the deafening sounds of cheering , klaxons and drums from the vast plaza colon , where thousands watched the match live from vienna on giant television screens , mixed with those of car horns across the city . germany fans disappointed bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a german supporter reacts after the final match between spain and germany fans of germany 's soccer team were stunned into disbelief after their team lost to spain .

luis aragones ' young side are hoping emulate that feat in vienna on sunday , june 29 , against germany . for a team which has become notorious for losing its bottle at the business end of tournaments and flattering to deceive on a consistent basis , spain move into their first major final in 24 years full of confidence while playing the kind of soccer they normally only reserve for the early rounds .
since they took to the field in paris to contest the 1984 european championship title against hosts france , spain have turned up for tournaments with squads full of the world 's biggest stars and the continent 's most talented players but have failed to make the latter stages .
many huge names from spanish soccer have graced the world cup and european championship stages in the shirt of the furia roja - and have shown their worth for about three games before meekly surrendering when things got serious .
normally it 's the quarter-final stage .
such has been the regularity that the spanish bow out at this stage , that it has become a bit of a mental block , if not a downright curse .
this year however , despite the fact that they were facing world champions italy at this stage , spain overcame both the italians and the psychological barrier to make it to the semis .
before earning themselves a place against italy , luis aragones ' team played their way through group d with skill and panache .
their opening game , a 4-1 thrashing of russia , got everyone believing again , while harboring all those memories of false dawns and premature celebrations .
opening game sends impressive message bildunterschrift : david villa opened his account with a hat trick against russia and got the ball rolling russia were supposed to be a new force , one with an attacking vision that could have overcome a sometimes ponderous spanish defense .
but not only did the rear guard hold firm , the spearhead proved deadly .
a david villa hat trick and a cameo goal from substitute cesc fabregas showed the world that spain had a rod of steel running from back to front , with a very sharp point at its attacking end .
the edge looked a little blunt when spain came up against the swedes in their second group match .
fernando torres got his first goal of the tournament , only to see it cancelled by zlatan ibrahimovic .
the game looked to be heading for a disappointing draw - which no doubt would have prompted questions about spain 's true quality - when that man villa popped up again to net a last gasp winner in the second minute of stoppage time .
with qualification assured , spain then finished off their group stage with a 2-1 win over already eliminated champions greece , with aragones fielding his reserves in a routine win .
spain had to come from behind to grab the points , with goals from reuben de la red and daniel guiza .
it was far from a classy performance but one which showed that spain could dig deep and regain the advantage even without a host of first-teamers on the pitch .
omens gather for quarter-final against italy then came italy .
spain had n't beaten the italians in a competitive match since a 2-0 win at the 1920 olympic games in belgium some 88 years ago .
there was also a certain amount of animosity bubbling under the surface , if the spanish press could be believed .
spain , it was claimed , were looking for revenge for the assault by mario tassotti on luis enrique which went unpunished in the quarter-final of the 1994 world cup in the united states , a match spain lost 2-1 .
whatever the motivation , spain dominated possession throughout regulation time but failed to translate their dominance into clear goal chances .
villa and david silva came close several times to breaking the tense deadlock for spain while italy offered few attacking threats .
spain 's domination continued into extra time , with italy 's keeper buffon saving from villa and santi cazorla shooting wide .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : iker casillas saves one of the penalties in the shoot-out spain may have had their horrible record in penalty shoot-outs at the back of their minds but they did n't show it .
while the spanish slotted in four of their kicks , keeper iker casillas was the hero , saving penalties from daniel de rossi and antonio di natale to put spain in the semi-finals .
the shoot-out victory also ended spain 's june 22 penalty jinx .
on june 22 , 1986 , spain lost to belgium in a dramatic world cup quarter-final shoot-out , then against england in euro 1996 on the same june date 10 years later .
and it was on june 22 , 2002 that the spaniards lost to hosts south korea in the 2002 world cup quarters .
spain raise their game to dominate russia meeting russia again in the semi-final , spain knew that their opponents had grown in confidence since their thrashing in the first game .
the return of andrei arshavin had inspired russia against sweden in the game that sealed qualification and then again in the rampant display that knocked the dutch out in the quarter-final .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : spain turned on the style to overcome russia but spain were irrepressible and arshavin was eclipsed by substitute cesc fabregas , on for the injured david villa after only 30 minutes or so of play .
fabregas delivered a midfield masterclass , pulling the strings and conducting the play as spain ran out 3-0 winners .
germany may not have fancied playing the russians , with their unpredictably marauding style , but they may not be looking forward to facing a spain team just one game away from ending 44 trophy-less years of hurt . nick amies send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the legendary formula one race course , nicknamed the green hell , is to be turned into a year-round leisure center . located 90 kilometers southwest of cologne in the heart of the eifel national park , the nürburgring has seen a lot in its 80 years : daredevil drivers , jubilant winners and too many dead . the track 's history includes more than 100 races and tragic crashes - like the fiery wreck at the 1976 grand prix , from which driver niki lauda barely escaped . now , however , the race course is quiet ; scaffolding covers the track 's start and finish lines and the main grandstands . in a major facelift meant to bring more life to the area , the track is being repurposed as a year-round leisure and business center with a promenade , an arena for small events , a convention center and a new grandstand .
four-star and a three-star hotels are entering the fray , along with a series of bungalows that will add up to 1,000 beds to the area . the nürburgring corporation plans to invest 215 million euros by spring of next year , according to ceo walter kafitz . when the formula one returns bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " rock am ring " brings in more than two million visitors annually new grand prix racetracks in abu dhabi , shanghai and singapore are more lucrative for formula one boss bernie eccleston . that means that the nürburgring has felt it must dispel the myth that it is past its prime - one reason justifying the course be flipped on its head . " when we talk about nürburgring 2009 , we 're also talking about the subsequent growth and development of the area , " said kafitz . after the renovation , the racetrack expects around 2 million per year , including the number of people coming to the world superbike championships and europe 's largest rock festival , the " rock am ring . " " new growth has to come from outside , " said kafitz .
" of course , we want to increase the interest in motorsports .
but we also do n't want to be dependent on motorsports .
we have to open up our offerings to bring people to the area from january to december . " while over half of the investments came from private investors , the " nürburgring 2009 " project is not without its critics .
some complain that the company is 90 percent owned by the state of rhineland palatinate , and they have doubts about whether their tax dollars are being put to good use . but kafitz says the ring is a business engine driving the region . according to information provided by the company , the track has invested about 100 million euros over the last 15 years in the modernization of the track and pits without considerable public support .
they say they have created 40 new jobs and promise to bring an additional 500 jobs to the region in the next two years . where managers can satisfy their need for speed bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : operators hope an 18-hole golf course will draw more tourists once construction is complete , more than half a million additional visitors are expected in the eifel each year .
at present , turnover at the ring is approximately 50 million annually - a number expected to double . nürburgring operators also expect to increase profit through the new 18-hole golf course or high-octane cars rentals to satisfy visitors ' need for speed . for companies like xerox and the italian motorcycle manufacturer ducati , which sponsor motorsports at the track , the nürburgring is a lucrative address . " we have a hotel directly on the course .
you can see the racetrack directly from your hotel room - that 's an amazing experience , " said marketing manager albert brenner . and despite all the add-ons , such as golf , motorsports will remain front and center at the ring , says kafitz . " it 's our core , " he said .

four-star and a three-star hotels are entering the fray , along with a series of bungalows that will add up to 1,000 beds to the area . the nürburgring corporation plans to invest 215 million euros by spring of next year , according to ceo walter kafitz . when the formula one returns bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " rock am ring " brings in more than two million visitors annually new grand prix racetracks in abu dhabi , shanghai and singapore are more lucrative for formula one boss bernie eccleston . that means that the nürburgring has felt it must dispel the myth that it is past its prime - one reason justifying the course be flipped on its head . " when we talk about nürburgring 2009 , we 're also talking about the subsequent growth and development of the area , " said kafitz . after the renovation , the racetrack expects around 2 million per year , including the number of people coming to the world superbike championships and europe 's largest rock festival , the " rock am ring .

some complain that the company is 90 percent owned by the state of rhineland palatinate , and they have doubts about whether their tax dollars are being put to good use . but kafitz says the ring is a business engine driving the region . according to information provided by the company , the track has invested about 100 million euros over the last 15 years in the modernization of the track and pits without considerable public support .

at present , turnover at the ring is approximately 50 million annually - a number expected to double . nürburgring operators also expect to increase profit through the new 18-hole golf course or high-octane cars rentals to satisfy visitors ' need for speed . for companies like xerox and the italian motorcycle manufacturer ducati , which sponsor motorsports at the track , the nürburgring is a lucrative address .

the legendary formula one race course , nicknamed the green hell , is to be turned into a year-round leisure center . located 90 kilometers southwest of cologne in the heart of the eifel national park , the nürburgring has seen a lot in its 80 years : daredevil drivers , jubilant winners and too many dead . the track 's history includes more than 100 races and tragic crashes - like the fiery wreck at the 1976 grand prix , from which driver niki lauda barely escaped . now , however , the race course is quiet ; scaffolding covers the track 's start and finish lines and the main grandstands . in a major facelift meant to bring more life to the area , the track is being repurposed as a year-round leisure and business center with a promenade , an arena for small events , a convention center and a new grandstand .
four-star and a three-star hotels are entering the fray , along with a series of bungalows that will add up to 1,000 beds to the area . the nürburgring corporation plans to invest 215 million euros by spring of next year , according to ceo walter kafitz . when the formula one returns bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " rock am ring " brings in more than two million visitors annually new grand prix racetracks in abu dhabi , shanghai and singapore are more lucrative for formula one boss bernie eccleston . that means that the nürburgring has felt it must dispel the myth that it is past its prime - one reason justifying the course be flipped on its head . " when we talk about nürburgring 2009 , we 're also talking about the subsequent growth and development of the area , " said kafitz . after the renovation , the racetrack expects around 2 million per year , including the number of people coming to the world superbike championships and europe 's largest rock festival , the " rock am ring . " " new growth has to come from outside , " said kafitz .
" of course , we want to increase the interest in motorsports .
but we also do n't want to be dependent on motorsports .
we have to open up our offerings to bring people to the area from january to december . " while over half of the investments came from private investors , the " nürburgring 2009 " project is not without its critics .
some complain that the company is 90 percent owned by the state of rhineland palatinate , and they have doubts about whether their tax dollars are being put to good use . but kafitz says the ring is a business engine driving the region . according to information provided by the company , the track has invested about 100 million euros over the last 15 years in the modernization of the track and pits without considerable public support .
they say they have created 40 new jobs and promise to bring an additional 500 jobs to the region in the next two years . where managers can satisfy their need for speed bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : operators hope an 18-hole golf course will draw more tourists once construction is complete , more than half a million additional visitors are expected in the eifel each year .
at present , turnover at the ring is approximately 50 million annually - a number expected to double . nürburgring operators also expect to increase profit through the new 18-hole golf course or high-octane cars rentals to satisfy visitors ' need for speed . for companies like xerox and the italian motorcycle manufacturer ducati , which sponsor motorsports at the track , the nürburgring is a lucrative address . " we have a hotel directly on the course .
you can see the racetrack directly from your hotel room - that 's an amazing experience , " said marketing manager albert brenner . and despite all the add-ons , such as golf , motorsports will remain front and center at the ring , says kafitz . " it 's our core , " he said .

luis aragones ' young side are hoping emulate that feat in vienna on sunday , june 29 , against germany . for a team which has become notorious for losing its bottle at the business end of tournaments and flattering to deceive on a consistent basis , spain move into their first major final in 24 years full of confidence while playing the kind of soccer they normally only reserve for the early rounds .
since they took to the field in paris to contest the 1984 european championship title against hosts france , spain have turned up for tournaments with squads full of the world 's biggest stars and the continent 's most talented players but have failed to make the latter stages .
many huge names from spanish soccer have graced the world cup and european championship stages in the shirt of the furia roja - and have shown their worth for about three games before meekly surrendering when things got serious .
normally it 's the quarter-final stage .
such has been the regularity that the spanish bow out at this stage , that it has become a bit of a mental block , if not a downright curse .
this year however , despite the fact that they were facing world champions italy at this stage , spain overcame both the italians and the psychological barrier to make it to the semis .
before earning themselves a place against italy , luis aragones ' team played their way through group d with skill and panache .
their opening game , a 4-1 thrashing of russia , got everyone believing again , while harboring all those memories of false dawns and premature celebrations .
opening game sends impressive message bildunterschrift : david villa opened his account with a hat trick against russia and got the ball rolling russia were supposed to be a new force , one with an attacking vision that could have overcome a sometimes ponderous spanish defense .
but not only did the rear guard hold firm , the spearhead proved deadly .
a david villa hat trick and a cameo goal from substitute cesc fabregas showed the world that spain had a rod of steel running from back to front , with a very sharp point at its attacking end .
the edge looked a little blunt when spain came up against the swedes in their second group match .
fernando torres got his first goal of the tournament , only to see it cancelled by zlatan ibrahimovic .
the game looked to be heading for a disappointing draw - which no doubt would have prompted questions about spain 's true quality - when that man villa popped up again to net a last gasp winner in the second minute of stoppage time .
with qualification assured , spain then finished off their group stage with a 2-1 win over already eliminated champions greece , with aragones fielding his reserves in a routine win .
spain had to come from behind to grab the points , with goals from reuben de la red and daniel guiza .
it was far from a classy performance but one which showed that spain could dig deep and regain the advantage even without a host of first-teamers on the pitch .
omens gather for quarter-final against italy then came italy .
spain had n't beaten the italians in a competitive match since a 2-0 win at the 1920 olympic games in belgium some 88 years ago .
there was also a certain amount of animosity bubbling under the surface , if the spanish press could be believed .
spain , it was claimed , were looking for revenge for the assault by mario tassotti on luis enrique which went unpunished in the quarter-final of the 1994 world cup in the united states , a match spain lost 2-1 .
whatever the motivation , spain dominated possession throughout regulation time but failed to translate their dominance into clear goal chances .
villa and david silva came close several times to breaking the tense deadlock for spain while italy offered few attacking threats .
spain 's domination continued into extra time , with italy 's keeper buffon saving from villa and santi cazorla shooting wide .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : iker casillas saves one of the penalties in the shoot-out spain may have had their horrible record in penalty shoot-outs at the back of their minds but they did n't show it .
while the spanish slotted in four of their kicks , keeper iker casillas was the hero , saving penalties from daniel de rossi and antonio di natale to put spain in the semi-finals .
the shoot-out victory also ended spain 's june 22 penalty jinx .
on june 22 , 1986 , spain lost to belgium in a dramatic world cup quarter-final shoot-out , then against england in euro 1996 on the same june date 10 years later .
and it was on june 22 , 2002 that the spaniards lost to hosts south korea in the 2002 world cup quarters .
spain raise their game to dominate russia meeting russia again in the semi-final , spain knew that their opponents had grown in confidence since their thrashing in the first game .
the return of andrei arshavin had inspired russia against sweden in the game that sealed qualification and then again in the rampant display that knocked the dutch out in the quarter-final .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : spain turned on the style to overcome russia but spain were irrepressible and arshavin was eclipsed by substitute cesc fabregas , on for the injured david villa after only 30 minutes or so of play .
fabregas delivered a midfield masterclass , pulling the strings and conducting the play as spain ran out 3-0 winners .

" i know spain has a lot of respect for us , " defender christoph metzelder , who earns his money at spanish champions real madrid , told a final news conference in tenero . " they have a lot of quality but this is a final .
there you need special qualities and we have some of them . " germany is the most successful team in euro history with three titles and two further finals .
spain , by contrast , won way back in 1964 and had not gone beyond the quarters since 1984 . metzelder praised spain 's consistency in the tournament and team manager oliver bierhoff named them light favorites . but the germans say they have good reason for optimism as well . a mixture of their proverbial luck and the determination never to give up saw them win 3-2 against turkey in the semi-finals although they played below par on wednesday . six days earlier germany had a classy performance in a 3-2 quarter-final win over portugal . germany face similar challenge to portugal quarter-final bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : xavi hernandez is a key player in spain 's midfield the german camp expects a very similar game to the portugal tie on sunday and is set to pack the midfield to deny xavi hernandez , andres iniesta in the same way it did with deco , cristiano ronaldo and company .

the spaniards do n't like it if we fight back aggressively .
we must try that and then play our own game , " said frings . bierhoff , who scored both goals when germany won the euro 1996 title against the czech republic , agreed : " you can not give them space - we must be close to them like against portugal . " the best news for germany is that frings has overcome his cracked rib and is expected to play as a starter in place of simon rolfes , although coach joachim loew is yet to announce the lineup . frings joins a midfield which also includes captain michael ballack , bastian schweinsteiger , thomas hitzlsperger and possibly also lukas podolski as against portugal and turkey - unless he is moved forward again to partner miroslav klose . " i feel really well , hardly have any problems .
i am surprised how well it went , " frings said in reference to have played the second half against turkey when rolfes got injured . " a coach frings would definitely field the player frings because i showed it does n't hamper me . " bierhoff and the players named the final a unique experience in which the team would not let itself and the country down . germans focused on chance of a lifetime bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : real madrid 's metzelder , pictured here center and without his current beard , is germany 's insider " you realize the tension is there .
it is a big match for a title , the team is very focused .
you do n't get many chances to play for a title , " said metzelder , the only expected starter who was also on the pitch when germany lost the 2002 world cup final to brazil . " we are competitive on sunday .
we can become european champions . " bierhoff said : " the motivation for the final is high .
it is important to have courage .
the players must show heart and give it all they have .
we demand concentration and dedication , the rest you ca n't influence . " looking ahead at a presentation before the german fans on monday in berlin , frings said the team did not want to meet the supporters empty-handed like in 2006 when germany came in third at the world cup . " this time we want to hold something in the air .
something was missing in 2006 .
this time we want to show more than a t-shirt saying ' thank you , " ' frings said . german team to celebrate with fans - win or lose the german team will come to berlin on monday to celebrate with the fans - regardless if they win or lose the euro 2008 final with spain . " it is very important to have the team celebrated in germany , " oliver bierhoff said on friday . jogi loew , captain michael ballack and the rest of the team are expected to arrive in the early afternoon on monday from vienna , where sunday 's final takes place . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany will be met by a huge crowd - even on a work day the presentation takes place at the fan zone in front of the brandenburg gate , where 500,000 people had gathered on wednesday to watch germany 's semi-final win over turkey .
a similar sized crowd is expected to watch the final there . germany also chose the berlin fan area to celebrate its third- place finish at the 2006 home world cup , then drawing 1.5 million people .
the euro fan zone is smaller than the one from the world cup . bierhoff said : " we know it ’ s a work day but we hope that employers and schools will allow us to have a big crowd .

the legendary formula one race course , nicknamed the green hell , is to be turned into a year-round leisure center . located 90 kilometers southwest of cologne in the heart of the eifel national park , the nürburgring has seen a lot in its 80 years : daredevil drivers , jubilant winners and too many dead . the track 's history includes more than 100 races and tragic crashes - like the fiery wreck at the 1976 grand prix , from which driver niki lauda barely escaped . now , however , the race course is quiet ; scaffolding covers the track 's start and finish lines and the main grandstands . in a major facelift meant to bring more life to the area , the track is being repurposed as a year-round leisure and business center with a promenade , an arena for small events , a convention center and a new grandstand .
four-star and a three-star hotels are entering the fray , along with a series of bungalows that will add up to 1,000 beds to the area . the nürburgring corporation plans to invest 215 million euros by spring of next year , according to ceo walter kafitz . when the formula one returns bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " rock am ring " brings in more than two million visitors annually new grand prix racetracks in abu dhabi , shanghai and singapore are more lucrative for formula one boss bernie eccleston . that means that the nürburgring has felt it must dispel the myth that it is past its prime - one reason justifying the course be flipped on its head . " when we talk about nürburgring 2009 , we 're also talking about the subsequent growth and development of the area , " said kafitz . after the renovation , the racetrack expects around 2 million per year , including the number of people coming to the world superbike championships and europe 's largest rock festival , the " rock am ring . " " new growth has to come from outside , " said kafitz .
" of course , we want to increase the interest in motorsports .
but we also do n't want to be dependent on motorsports .
we have to open up our offerings to bring people to the area from january to december . " while over half of the investments came from private investors , the " nürburgring 2009 " project is not without its critics .
some complain that the company is 90 percent owned by the state of rhineland palatinate , and they have doubts about whether their tax dollars are being put to good use . but kafitz says the ring is a business engine driving the region . according to information provided by the company , the track has invested about 100 million euros over the last 15 years in the modernization of the track and pits without considerable public support .
they say they have created 40 new jobs and promise to bring an additional 500 jobs to the region in the next two years . where managers can satisfy their need for speed bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : operators hope an 18-hole golf course will draw more tourists once construction is complete , more than half a million additional visitors are expected in the eifel each year .
at present , turnover at the ring is approximately 50 million annually - a number expected to double . nürburgring operators also expect to increase profit through the new 18-hole golf course or high-octane cars rentals to satisfy visitors ' need for speed . for companies like xerox and the italian motorcycle manufacturer ducati , which sponsor motorsports at the track , the nürburgring is a lucrative address . " we have a hotel directly on the course .
you can see the racetrack directly from your hotel room - that 's an amazing experience , " said marketing manager albert brenner . and despite all the add-ons , such as golf , motorsports will remain front and center at the ring , says kafitz . " it 's our core , " he said .
" it will always smell like gasoline here . " manfred böhm -lrb- cat -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

luis aragones ' young side are hoping emulate that feat in vienna on sunday , june 29 , against germany . for a team which has become notorious for losing its bottle at the business end of tournaments and flattering to deceive on a consistent basis , spain move into their first major final in 24 years full of confidence while playing the kind of soccer they normally only reserve for the early rounds .
since they took to the field in paris to contest the 1984 european championship title against hosts france , spain have turned up for tournaments with squads full of the world 's biggest stars and the continent 's most talented players but have failed to make the latter stages .
many huge names from spanish soccer have graced the world cup and european championship stages in the shirt of the furia roja - and have shown their worth for about three games before meekly surrendering when things got serious .
normally it 's the quarter-final stage .
such has been the regularity that the spanish bow out at this stage , that it has become a bit of a mental block , if not a downright curse .
this year however , despite the fact that they were facing world champions italy at this stage , spain overcame both the italians and the psychological barrier to make it to the semis .
before earning themselves a place against italy , luis aragones ' team played their way through group d with skill and panache .
their opening game , a 4-1 thrashing of russia , got everyone believing again , while harboring all those memories of false dawns and premature celebrations .

fernando torres got his first goal of the tournament , only to see it cancelled by zlatan ibrahimovic .
the game looked to be heading for a disappointing draw - which no doubt would have prompted questions about spain 's true quality - when that man villa popped up again to net a last gasp winner in the second minute of stoppage time .
with qualification assured , spain then finished off their group stage with a 2-1 win over already eliminated champions greece , with aragones fielding his reserves in a routine win .
spain had to come from behind to grab the points , with goals from reuben de la red and daniel guiza .
it was far from a classy performance but one which showed that spain could dig deep and regain the advantage even without a host of first-teamers on the pitch .
omens gather for quarter-final against italy then came italy .
spain had n't beaten the italians in a competitive match since a 2-0 win at the 1920 olympic games in belgium some 88 years ago .
there was also a certain amount of animosity bubbling under the surface , if the spanish press could be believed .
spain , it was claimed , were looking for revenge for the assault by mario tassotti on luis enrique which went unpunished in the quarter-final of the 1994 world cup in the united states , a match spain lost 2-1 .
whatever the motivation , spain dominated possession throughout regulation time but failed to translate their dominance into clear goal chances .

the shoot-out victory also ended spain 's june 22 penalty jinx .
on june 22 , 1986 , spain lost to belgium in a dramatic world cup quarter-final shoot-out , then against england in euro 1996 on the same june date 10 years later .

since they took to the field in paris to contest the 1984 european championship title against hosts france , spain have turned up for tournaments with squads full of the world 's biggest stars and the continent 's most talented players but have failed to make the latter stages .

the legendary formula one race course , nicknamed the green hell , is to be turned into a year-round leisure center . located 90 kilometers southwest of cologne in the heart of the eifel national park , the nürburgring has seen a lot in its 80 years : daredevil drivers , jubilant winners and too many dead . the track 's history includes more than 100 races and tragic crashes - like the fiery wreck at the 1976 grand prix , from which driver niki lauda barely escaped . now , however , the race course is quiet ; scaffolding covers the track 's start and finish lines and the main grandstands . in a major facelift meant to bring more life to the area , the track is being repurposed as a year-round leisure and business center with a promenade , an arena for small events , a convention center and a new grandstand .
four-star and a three-star hotels are entering the fray , along with a series of bungalows that will add up to 1,000 beds to the area . the nürburgring corporation plans to invest 215 million euros by spring of next year , according to ceo walter kafitz . when the formula one returns bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " rock am ring " brings in more than two million visitors annually new grand prix racetracks in abu dhabi , shanghai and singapore are more lucrative for formula one boss bernie eccleston . that means that the nürburgring has felt it must dispel the myth that it is past its prime - one reason justifying the course be flipped on its head . " when we talk about nürburgring 2009 , we 're also talking about the subsequent growth and development of the area , " said kafitz . after the renovation , the racetrack expects around 2 million per year , including the number of people coming to the world superbike championships and europe 's largest rock festival , the " rock am ring . " " new growth has to come from outside , " said kafitz .
" of course , we want to increase the interest in motorsports .
but we also do n't want to be dependent on motorsports .
we have to open up our offerings to bring people to the area from january to december . " while over half of the investments came from private investors , the " nürburgring 2009 " project is not without its critics .
some complain that the company is 90 percent owned by the state of rhineland palatinate , and they have doubts about whether their tax dollars are being put to good use . but kafitz says the ring is a business engine driving the region . according to information provided by the company , the track has invested about 100 million euros over the last 15 years in the modernization of the track and pits without considerable public support .
they say they have created 40 new jobs and promise to bring an additional 500 jobs to the region in the next two years . where managers can satisfy their need for speed bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : operators hope an 18-hole golf course will draw more tourists once construction is complete , more than half a million additional visitors are expected in the eifel each year .
at present , turnover at the ring is approximately 50 million annually - a number expected to double . nürburgring operators also expect to increase profit through the new 18-hole golf course or high-octane cars rentals to satisfy visitors ' need for speed . for companies like xerox and the italian motorcycle manufacturer ducati , which sponsor motorsports at the track , the nürburgring is a lucrative address . " we have a hotel directly on the course .
you can see the racetrack directly from your hotel room - that 's an amazing experience , " said marketing manager albert brenner . and despite all the add-ons , such as golf , motorsports will remain front and center at the ring , says kafitz . " it 's our core , " he said .

" i know spain has a lot of respect for us , " defender christoph metzelder , who earns his money at spanish champions real madrid , told a final news conference in tenero . " they have a lot of quality but this is a final .
there you need special qualities and we have some of them . " germany is the most successful team in euro history with three titles and two further finals .
spain , by contrast , won way back in 1964 and had not gone beyond the quarters since 1984 . metzelder praised spain 's consistency in the tournament and team manager oliver bierhoff named them light favorites . but the germans say they have good reason for optimism as well . a mixture of their proverbial luck and the determination never to give up saw them win 3-2 against turkey in the semi-finals although they played below par on wednesday . six days earlier germany had a classy performance in a 3-2 quarter-final win over portugal . germany face similar challenge to portugal quarter-final bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : xavi hernandez is a key player in spain 's midfield the german camp expects a very similar game to the portugal tie on sunday and is set to pack the midfield to deny xavi hernandez , andres iniesta in the same way it did with deco , cristiano ronaldo and company . " we must fight back as a team , not allow them into the game .
the spaniards do n't like it if we fight back aggressively .
we must try that and then play our own game , " said frings . bierhoff , who scored both goals when germany won the euro 1996 title against the czech republic , agreed : " you can not give them space - we must be close to them like against portugal . " the best news for germany is that frings has overcome his cracked rib and is expected to play as a starter in place of simon rolfes , although coach joachim loew is yet to announce the lineup . frings joins a midfield which also includes captain michael ballack , bastian schweinsteiger , thomas hitzlsperger and possibly also lukas podolski as against portugal and turkey - unless he is moved forward again to partner miroslav klose . " i feel really well , hardly have any problems .
i am surprised how well it went , " frings said in reference to have played the second half against turkey when rolfes got injured . " a coach frings would definitely field the player frings because i showed it does n't hamper me . " bierhoff and the players named the final a unique experience in which the team would not let itself and the country down . germans focused on chance of a lifetime bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : real madrid 's metzelder , pictured here center and without his current beard , is germany 's insider " you realize the tension is there .
it is a big match for a title , the team is very focused .
you do n't get many chances to play for a title , " said metzelder , the only expected starter who was also on the pitch when germany lost the 2002 world cup final to brazil . " we are competitive on sunday .
we can become european champions . " bierhoff said : " the motivation for the final is high .
it is important to have courage .
the players must show heart and give it all they have .
we demand concentration and dedication , the rest you ca n't influence . " looking ahead at a presentation before the german fans on monday in berlin , frings said the team did not want to meet the supporters empty-handed like in 2006 when germany came in third at the world cup . " this time we want to hold something in the air .
something was missing in 2006 .
this time we want to show more than a t-shirt saying ' thank you , " ' frings said . german team to celebrate with fans - win or lose the german team will come to berlin on monday to celebrate with the fans - regardless if they win or lose the euro 2008 final with spain . " it is very important to have the team celebrated in germany , " oliver bierhoff said on friday . jogi loew , captain michael ballack and the rest of the team are expected to arrive in the early afternoon on monday from vienna , where sunday 's final takes place . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany will be met by a huge crowd - even on a work day the presentation takes place at the fan zone in front of the brandenburg gate , where 500,000 people had gathered on wednesday to watch germany 's semi-final win over turkey .
a similar sized crowd is expected to watch the final there . germany also chose the berlin fan area to celebrate its third- place finish at the 2006 home world cup , then drawing 1.5 million people .
the euro fan zone is smaller than the one from the world cup . bierhoff said : " we know it ’ s a work day but we hope that employers and schools will allow us to have a big crowd .

critically acclaimed german film director wim wenders has been selected to head the jury at this year 's venice film festival . the venice festival organizers said in a statement that the 62-year-old wenders is one of the most innovative among contemporary filmmakers and has produced some of the most influential works of the past 40 years .
perhaps best known for his films " paris , texas " and " buena vista social club , " the german director 's own cinema career is tightly connected to venice .
" wim wenders has maintained strong ties with the -lrb- festival -rrb- over the years since his debut " in moviemaking , the festival organizers said .
strong ties to venice the veteran german director , who started as a film critic before he turned to directing in the 1970s , first appeared in venice in 1972 when he showed his second full-length feature film , " the goalkeeper 's fear of the penalty kick . "
a decade later venice awarded the filmmaker the festival 's top prize , the golden lion , for " the state of things " about a shoestring movie producer and his ragtag crew .
after the 1974 release of the first film in his road movie trilogy , " alice in the cities , " wenders showed the second part , " the wrong move " -lrb- 1975 -rrb- , at the cannes film festival .
the showing and the attention at the film festival helped launch his international career .
soon after the german director started filming in the united states , completing his movie trilogy with " kings of the road " -lrb- 1976 -rrb- and staying on to direct " the american friend " -lrb- 1977 -rrb- , an adaptation of the novel " ripley 's game " by patricia highsmith .
international accolades bildunterschrift : the guardian angels damiel -lrb- bruno ganz -rrb- and cassiel -lrb- otto sander -rrb- are invisible to everyone but children .
in 1984 wenders won the golden palm in cannes for " paris , texas , " and in 1987 he received the award for best director for his film " wings of desire . "

critically acclaimed german film director wim wenders has been selected to head the jury at this year 's venice film festival . the venice festival organizers said in a statement that the 62-year-old wenders is one of the most innovative among contemporary filmmakers and has produced some of the most influential works of the past 40 years .
perhaps best known for his films " paris , texas " and " buena vista social club , " the german director 's own cinema career is tightly connected to venice .
" wim wenders has maintained strong ties with the -lrb- festival -rrb- over the years since his debut " in moviemaking , the festival organizers said .
strong ties to venice the veteran german director , who started as a film critic before he turned to directing in the 1970s , first appeared in venice in 1972 when he showed his second full-length feature film , " the goalkeeper 's fear of the penalty kick . "
a decade later venice awarded the filmmaker the festival 's top prize , the golden lion , for " the state of things " about a shoestring movie producer and his ragtag crew .
after the 1974 release of the first film in his road movie trilogy , " alice in the cities , " wenders showed the second part , " the wrong move " -lrb- 1975 -rrb- , at the cannes film festival .
the showing and the attention at the film festival helped launch his international career .
soon after the german director started filming in the united states , completing his movie trilogy with " kings of the road " -lrb- 1976 -rrb- and staying on to direct " the american friend " -lrb- 1977 -rrb- , an adaptation of the novel " ripley 's game " by patricia highsmith .
international accolades bildunterschrift : the guardian angels damiel -lrb- bruno ganz -rrb- and cassiel -lrb- otto sander -rrb- are invisible to everyone but children .
in 1984 wenders won the golden palm in cannes for " paris , texas , " and in 1987 he received the award for best director for his film " wings of desire . "
the director continued making fictional films through the 1990s , as well as the highly acclaimed documentary " buena vista social club " -lrb- 1999 -rrb- , a vibrant tribute to cuban music .

the 1.2 kilometer long fan zone near the brandenburg gate was so full of jubilant fans that authorities had to close it off to new arrivals three hours before kick off . vendors had been doing a brisk trade for the past three weeks in flags , facepaints and national soccer shirts in a country now much more comfortable with patriotism ever since the 2006 world cup was held in germany . bildunterschrift : berlin 's fan mile is the country 's biggest open-air public viewing the scene was similar in other towns and cities , with huge crowds chanting " deutschland !
deutschland !

fernando torres scored the single goal in the intense match , which brought many german fans to tears . spain won their second european title in fine style on sunday , deservedly beating a weak germany 1-0 in vienna , on a goal from fernando torres . the handsome win culminates a stunning euro 2008 for spain , who have won five games and drawn one , scoring 12 goals and conceding just three since the european championships kicked off on june 7 in switzerland . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the spanish team in victory pose after beating germany .
sunday 's win was spain 's first international triumph since 1964 , when the european nations cup , as it was called then , was much less important than it is today . curiously , this was the first game in which spain - preferring an intelligent counter-attacking strategy - did not dominate possession from the beginning . luis aragones ' young team only had 48 percent ball possession , but nonetheless created countless chances and should have scored more goals . germany tired and frustrated germany , in contrast , failed to create a single clear chance and were clearly outclassed .
true to tradition , however , they battled until the bitter end , despite their fatigue , frustration and injuries . joachim loew 's team made an aggressive start , determined not to let spain dominate , but then the germans lacked the craft to create clear chances . spain slowly but surely got their act together and almost went ahead in the 14th minute , when german keeper jens lehmann had to keep out a deflection from defender christoph metzelder . nine minutes later torres headed a sergio ramos centre against lehmann 's post . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : fernando torres celebrates after scoring the winning goal torres scores single goal the only goal came in the 33rd minute .

the legendary formula one race course , nicknamed the green hell , is to be turned into a year-round leisure center . located 90 kilometers southwest of cologne in the heart of the eifel national park , the nürburgring has seen a lot in its 80 years : daredevil drivers , jubilant winners and too many dead . the track 's history includes more than 100 races and tragic crashes - like the fiery wreck at the 1976 grand prix , from which driver niki lauda barely escaped . now , however , the race course is quiet ; scaffolding covers the track 's start and finish lines and the main grandstands . in a major facelift meant to bring more life to the area , the track is being repurposed as a year-round leisure and business center with a promenade , an arena for small events , a convention center and a new grandstand .
four-star and a three-star hotels are entering the fray , along with a series of bungalows that will add up to 1,000 beds to the area . the nürburgring corporation plans to invest 215 million euros by spring of next year , according to ceo walter kafitz . when the formula one returns bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " rock am ring " brings in more than two million visitors annually new grand prix racetracks in abu dhabi , shanghai and singapore are more lucrative for formula one boss bernie eccleston . that means that the nürburgring has felt it must dispel the myth that it is past its prime - one reason justifying the course be flipped on its head . " when we talk about nürburgring 2009 , we 're also talking about the subsequent growth and development of the area , " said kafitz . after the renovation , the racetrack expects around 2 million per year , including the number of people coming to the world superbike championships and europe 's largest rock festival , the " rock am ring . " " new growth has to come from outside , " said kafitz .
" of course , we want to increase the interest in motorsports .
but we also do n't want to be dependent on motorsports .
we have to open up our offerings to bring people to the area from january to december . " while over half of the investments came from private investors , the " nürburgring 2009 " project is not without its critics .
some complain that the company is 90 percent owned by the state of rhineland palatinate , and they have doubts about whether their tax dollars are being put to good use . but kafitz says the ring is a business engine driving the region . according to information provided by the company , the track has invested about 100 million euros over the last 15 years in the modernization of the track and pits without considerable public support .
they say they have created 40 new jobs and promise to bring an additional 500 jobs to the region in the next two years . where managers can satisfy their need for speed bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : operators hope an 18-hole golf course will draw more tourists once construction is complete , more than half a million additional visitors are expected in the eifel each year .
at present , turnover at the ring is approximately 50 million annually - a number expected to double . nürburgring operators also expect to increase profit through the new 18-hole golf course or high-octane cars rentals to satisfy visitors ' need for speed . for companies like xerox and the italian motorcycle manufacturer ducati , which sponsor motorsports at the track , the nürburgring is a lucrative address . " we have a hotel directly on the course .
you can see the racetrack directly from your hotel room - that 's an amazing experience , " said marketing manager albert brenner . and despite all the add-ons , such as golf , motorsports will remain front and center at the ring , says kafitz . " it 's our core , " he said .

" i know spain has a lot of respect for us , " defender christoph metzelder , who earns his money at spanish champions real madrid , told a final news conference in tenero . " they have a lot of quality but this is a final .
there you need special qualities and we have some of them . " germany is the most successful team in euro history with three titles and two further finals .
spain , by contrast , won way back in 1964 and had not gone beyond the quarters since 1984 . metzelder praised spain 's consistency in the tournament and team manager oliver bierhoff named them light favorites . but the germans say they have good reason for optimism as well . a mixture of their proverbial luck and the determination never to give up saw them win 3-2 against turkey in the semi-finals although they played below par on wednesday . six days earlier germany had a classy performance in a 3-2 quarter-final win over portugal . germany face similar challenge to portugal quarter-final bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : xavi hernandez is a key player in spain 's midfield the german camp expects a very similar game to the portugal tie on sunday and is set to pack the midfield to deny xavi hernandez , andres iniesta in the same way it did with deco , cristiano ronaldo and company . " we must fight back as a team , not allow them into the game .
the spaniards do n't like it if we fight back aggressively .
we must try that and then play our own game , " said frings . bierhoff , who scored both goals when germany won the euro 1996 title against the czech republic , agreed : " you can not give them space - we must be close to them like against portugal . " the best news for germany is that frings has overcome his cracked rib and is expected to play as a starter in place of simon rolfes , although coach joachim loew is yet to announce the lineup . frings joins a midfield which also includes captain michael ballack , bastian schweinsteiger , thomas hitzlsperger and possibly also lukas podolski as against portugal and turkey - unless he is moved forward again to partner miroslav klose . " i feel really well , hardly have any problems .
i am surprised how well it went , " frings said in reference to have played the second half against turkey when rolfes got injured . " a coach frings would definitely field the player frings because i showed it does n't hamper me . " bierhoff and the players named the final a unique experience in which the team would not let itself and the country down . germans focused on chance of a lifetime bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : real madrid 's metzelder , pictured here center and without his current beard , is germany 's insider " you realize the tension is there .
it is a big match for a title , the team is very focused .
you do n't get many chances to play for a title , " said metzelder , the only expected starter who was also on the pitch when germany lost the 2002 world cup final to brazil . " we are competitive on sunday .
we can become european champions . " bierhoff said : " the motivation for the final is high .
it is important to have courage .
the players must show heart and give it all they have .
we demand concentration and dedication , the rest you ca n't influence . " looking ahead at a presentation before the german fans on monday in berlin , frings said the team did not want to meet the supporters empty-handed like in 2006 when germany came in third at the world cup . " this time we want to hold something in the air .
something was missing in 2006 .
this time we want to show more than a t-shirt saying ' thank you , " ' frings said . german team to celebrate with fans - win or lose the german team will come to berlin on monday to celebrate with the fans - regardless if they win or lose the euro 2008 final with spain . " it is very important to have the team celebrated in germany , " oliver bierhoff said on friday . jogi loew , captain michael ballack and the rest of the team are expected to arrive in the early afternoon on monday from vienna , where sunday 's final takes place . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany will be met by a huge crowd - even on a work day the presentation takes place at the fan zone in front of the brandenburg gate , where 500,000 people had gathered on wednesday to watch germany 's semi-final win over turkey .
a similar sized crowd is expected to watch the final there . germany also chose the berlin fan area to celebrate its third- place finish at the 2006 home world cup , then drawing 1.5 million people .
the euro fan zone is smaller than the one from the world cup . bierhoff said : " we know it ’ s a work day but we hope that employers and schools will allow us to have a big crowd . " bierhoff said that the dfb will also stage various events for fans at an international match later this year . dw staff / dpa news agency -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" i know spain has a lot of respect for us , " defender christoph metzelder , who earns his money at spanish champions real madrid , told a final news conference in tenero . " they have a lot of quality but this is a final .
there you need special qualities and we have some of them . " germany is the most successful team in euro history with three titles and two further finals .
spain , by contrast , won way back in 1964 and had not gone beyond the quarters since 1984 . metzelder praised spain 's consistency in the tournament and team manager oliver bierhoff named them light favorites . but the germans say they have good reason for optimism as well . a mixture of their proverbial luck and the determination never to give up saw them win 3-2 against turkey in the semi-finals although they played below par on wednesday . six days earlier germany had a classy performance in a 3-2 quarter-final win over portugal . germany face similar challenge to portugal quarter-final bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : xavi hernandez is a key player in spain 's midfield the german camp expects a very similar game to the portugal tie on sunday and is set to pack the midfield to deny xavi hernandez , andres iniesta in the same way it did with deco , cristiano ronaldo and company . " we must fight back as a team , not allow them into the game .
the spaniards do n't like it if we fight back aggressively .
we must try that and then play our own game , " said frings . bierhoff , who scored both goals when germany won the euro 1996 title against the czech republic , agreed : " you can not give them space - we must be close to them like against portugal . " the best news for germany is that frings has overcome his cracked rib and is expected to play as a starter in place of simon rolfes , although coach joachim loew is yet to announce the lineup . frings joins a midfield which also includes captain michael ballack , bastian schweinsteiger , thomas hitzlsperger and possibly also lukas podolski as against portugal and turkey - unless he is moved forward again to partner miroslav klose . " i feel really well , hardly have any problems .
i am surprised how well it went , " frings said in reference to have played the second half against turkey when rolfes got injured . " a coach frings would definitely field the player frings because i showed it does n't hamper me . " bierhoff and the players named the final a unique experience in which the team would not let itself and the country down . germans focused on chance of a lifetime bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : real madrid 's metzelder , pictured here center and without his current beard , is germany 's insider " you realize the tension is there .
it is a big match for a title , the team is very focused .
you do n't get many chances to play for a title , " said metzelder , the only expected starter who was also on the pitch when germany lost the 2002 world cup final to brazil . " we are competitive on sunday .
we can become european champions . " bierhoff said : " the motivation for the final is high .
it is important to have courage .
the players must show heart and give it all they have .
we demand concentration and dedication , the rest you ca n't influence . " looking ahead at a presentation before the german fans on monday in berlin , frings said the team did not want to meet the supporters empty-handed like in 2006 when germany came in third at the world cup . " this time we want to hold something in the air .
something was missing in 2006 .
this time we want to show more than a t-shirt saying ' thank you , " ' frings said . german team to celebrate with fans - win or lose the german team will come to berlin on monday to celebrate with the fans - regardless if they win or lose the euro 2008 final with spain . " it is very important to have the team celebrated in germany , " oliver bierhoff said on friday . jogi loew , captain michael ballack and the rest of the team are expected to arrive in the early afternoon on monday from vienna , where sunday 's final takes place . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany will be met by a huge crowd - even on a work day the presentation takes place at the fan zone in front of the brandenburg gate , where 500,000 people had gathered on wednesday to watch germany 's semi-final win over turkey .
a similar sized crowd is expected to watch the final there . germany also chose the berlin fan area to celebrate its third- place finish at the 2006 home world cup , then drawing 1.5 million people .
the euro fan zone is smaller than the one from the world cup . bierhoff said : " we know it ’ s a work day but we hope that employers and schools will allow us to have a big crowd . " bierhoff said that the dfb will also stage various events for fans at an international match later this year . dw staff / dpa news agency -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

striker fernando torres scored the goal in the 33rd minute . germany took the initiative early in the european championship soccer final , overwhelming spain from the left to set up several dangerous moves .
but spain quickly fought back to gain ball control during the second part of the first-half . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : torres celebrates scoring the opening goal during the euro 2008 final after several near-goals , torres wrestled his way past germany left back philipp lahm to meet a deep pass from xavi and then drive the ball over keeper jens lehmann and into the net . the liverpool striker had almost put spain ahead in the 23rd minute when he hit the base of the post with a header after a set up by sergio ramos on the right . spain is a step closer to their first trophy since winning the european cup in 1964 . germans keep up fight led on by captain michael ballack , who proved the injury to his right calf would not interfere with his performance , germany doggedly fought back spain , keeping the ball in play until half-time . ballack went down with blood streaming down his face after an accidental clash of heads with marcos senna .

fernando torres scored the single goal in the intense match , which brought many german fans to tears . spain won their second european title in fine style on sunday , deservedly beating a weak germany 1-0 in vienna , on a goal from fernando torres . the handsome win culminates a stunning euro 2008 for spain , who have won five games and drawn one , scoring 12 goals and conceding just three since the european championships kicked off on june 7 in switzerland . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the spanish team in victory pose after beating germany .
sunday 's win was spain 's first international triumph since 1964 , when the european nations cup , as it was called then , was much less important than it is today . curiously , this was the first game in which spain - preferring an intelligent counter-attacking strategy - did not dominate possession from the beginning . luis aragones ' young team only had 48 percent ball possession , but nonetheless created countless chances and should have scored more goals . germany tired and frustrated germany , in contrast , failed to create a single clear chance and were clearly outclassed .
true to tradition , however , they battled until the bitter end , despite their fatigue , frustration and injuries . joachim loew 's team made an aggressive start , determined not to let spain dominate , but then the germans lacked the craft to create clear chances . spain slowly but surely got their act together and almost went ahead in the 14th minute , when german keeper jens lehmann had to keep out a deflection from defender christoph metzelder . nine minutes later torres headed a sergio ramos centre against lehmann 's post . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : fernando torres celebrates after scoring the winning goal torres scores single goal the only goal came in the 33rd minute .
the majestic xavi hernandez played a tempting through ball for torres , who powered his way past philipp lahm and beat the lehmann with a clever chip . germany adopted a more direct approach in the second half , but with captain michael ballack not looking a hundred percent fit - and with striker lukas podolski and miroslav klose well marked and philipp lahm out with an injury - they were running more on hope than expectation . viva espana ! bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : spanish supporters cheer in plaza de colon in madrid , sunday june 29 , 2008 thousands of ecstatic spanish fans danced and chanted " viva espana " in central madrid as the country 's first major international football trophy in 44 years sparked a nationwide fiesta . the capital was awash with the red and gold national colours , as the country celebrated the euro victory in true spanish style .
the deafening sounds of cheering , klaxons and drums from the vast plaza colon , where thousands watched the match live from vienna on giant television screens , mixed with those of car horns across the city . germany fans disappointed bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a german supporter reacts after the final match between spain and germany fans of germany 's soccer team were stunned into disbelief after their team lost to spain .
the disappointment was visible on the faces of thousands who gathered in public viewing areas and fan miles to watch the match on giant screens . yet despite the loss , and the second-place finish , germany supporters applauded spain 's victory and praised germany 's solid run . dw staff -lrb- ktz -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the legendary formula one race course , nicknamed the green hell , is to be turned into a year-round leisure center . located 90 kilometers southwest of cologne in the heart of the eifel national park , the nürburgring has seen a lot in its 80 years : daredevil drivers , jubilant winners and too many dead . the track 's history includes more than 100 races and tragic crashes - like the fiery wreck at the 1976 grand prix , from which driver niki lauda barely escaped . now , however , the race course is quiet ; scaffolding covers the track 's start and finish lines and the main grandstands . in a major facelift meant to bring more life to the area , the track is being repurposed as a year-round leisure and business center with a promenade , an arena for small events , a convention center and a new grandstand .
four-star and a three-star hotels are entering the fray , along with a series of bungalows that will add up to 1,000 beds to the area . the nürburgring corporation plans to invest 215 million euros by spring of next year , according to ceo walter kafitz . when the formula one returns bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " rock am ring " brings in more than two million visitors annually new grand prix racetracks in abu dhabi , shanghai and singapore are more lucrative for formula one boss bernie eccleston . that means that the nürburgring has felt it must dispel the myth that it is past its prime - one reason justifying the course be flipped on its head . " when we talk about nürburgring 2009 , we 're also talking about the subsequent growth and development of the area , " said kafitz . after the renovation , the racetrack expects around 2 million per year , including the number of people coming to the world superbike championships and europe 's largest rock festival , the " rock am ring . " " new growth has to come from outside , " said kafitz .
" of course , we want to increase the interest in motorsports .
but we also do n't want to be dependent on motorsports .
we have to open up our offerings to bring people to the area from january to december . " while over half of the investments came from private investors , the " nürburgring 2009 " project is not without its critics .
some complain that the company is 90 percent owned by the state of rhineland palatinate , and they have doubts about whether their tax dollars are being put to good use . but kafitz says the ring is a business engine driving the region . according to information provided by the company , the track has invested about 100 million euros over the last 15 years in the modernization of the track and pits without considerable public support .
they say they have created 40 new jobs and promise to bring an additional 500 jobs to the region in the next two years . where managers can satisfy their need for speed bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : operators hope an 18-hole golf course will draw more tourists once construction is complete , more than half a million additional visitors are expected in the eifel each year .
at present , turnover at the ring is approximately 50 million annually - a number expected to double . nürburgring operators also expect to increase profit through the new 18-hole golf course or high-octane cars rentals to satisfy visitors ' need for speed . for companies like xerox and the italian motorcycle manufacturer ducati , which sponsor motorsports at the track , the nürburgring is a lucrative address . " we have a hotel directly on the course .
you can see the racetrack directly from your hotel room - that 's an amazing experience , " said marketing manager albert brenner . and despite all the add-ons , such as golf , motorsports will remain front and center at the ring , says kafitz . " it 's our core , " he said .

" when we talk about nürburgring 2009 , we 're also talking about the subsequent growth and development of the area , " said kafitz . after the renovation , the racetrack expects around 2 million per year , including the number of people coming to the world superbike championships and europe 's largest rock festival , the " rock am ring . " " new growth has to come from outside , " said kafitz .
" of course , we want to increase the interest in motorsports .
but we also do n't want to be dependent on motorsports .
we have to open up our offerings to bring people to the area from january to december . " while over half of the investments came from private investors , the " nürburgring 2009 " project is not without its critics .
some complain that the company is 90 percent owned by the state of rhineland palatinate , and they have doubts about whether their tax dollars are being put to good use . but kafitz says the ring is a business engine driving the region . according to information provided by the company , the track has invested about 100 million euros over the last 15 years in the modernization of the track and pits without considerable public support .
they say they have created 40 new jobs and promise to bring an additional 500 jobs to the region in the next two years . where managers can satisfy their need for speed bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : operators hope an 18-hole golf course will draw more tourists once construction is complete , more than half a million additional visitors are expected in the eifel each year .
at present , turnover at the ring is approximately 50 million annually - a number expected to double . nürburgring operators also expect to increase profit through the new 18-hole golf course or high-octane cars rentals to satisfy visitors ' need for speed . for companies like xerox and the italian motorcycle manufacturer ducati , which sponsor motorsports at the track , the nürburgring is a lucrative address . " we have a hotel directly on the course .
you can see the racetrack directly from your hotel room - that 's an amazing experience , " said marketing manager albert brenner . and despite all the add-ons , such as golf , motorsports will remain front and center at the ring , says kafitz . " it 's our core , " he said .
" it will always smell like gasoline here . " manfred böhm -lrb- cat -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the head of german engineering group siemens has confirmed that a major restructuring is in the works , after media reports said the firm wanted to lay off 17,000 workers . referring to the state of the world economy and the rising oil price , siemens chief executive peter loescher said it was time for germany 's biggest engineering company to act .
" we have to batten down the hatches , " before siemens caves in under the pressure , the ceo said .
in the comments which are set to be published in full on monday , loescher said siemens needed to reach a target saving of 1.2 billion euros -lrb- 1.9 billion dollars -rrb- by 2010 to remain competitive .
job cuts imminent over the weekend reports were leaked that siemens planned to cut more than 17,000 jobs from its 400,000 global workforce , including some 6,450 jobs in germany .
the amount - nearly four percent of the workforce - was considerably more than the 10,000 anticipated by trade union ig metall as part of a broad revamp of the company 's operations .
the scale of the cuts , which are expected to mainly affect administrative positions , is unprecedented in the 160-year history of the german company .
according to the sueddeutsche zeitung , the german cuts would be spread over two years and are due to be announced officially in the fall .

he added that he hoped the job cuts would be as " socially acceptable as possible . "
siemens , which manufactures everything from hearing aids to nuclear power stations and trains in some 190 countries , posted worldwide sales last year of more than 70 billion euros .
but after problems with a range of major projects were uncovered in the early part of the year , the company has been struggling for ways to reform and streamline its production .

the head of german engineering group siemens has confirmed that a major restructuring is in the works , after media reports said the firm wanted to lay off 17,000 workers . referring to the state of the world economy and the rising oil price , siemens chief executive peter loescher said it was time for germany 's biggest engineering company to act .
" we have to batten down the hatches , " before siemens caves in under the pressure , the ceo said .
in the comments which are set to be published in full on monday , loescher said siemens needed to reach a target saving of 1.2 billion euros -lrb- 1.9 billion dollars -rrb- by 2010 to remain competitive .
job cuts imminent over the weekend reports were leaked that siemens planned to cut more than 17,000 jobs from its 400,000 global workforce , including some 6,450 jobs in germany .
the amount - nearly four percent of the workforce - was considerably more than the 10,000 anticipated by trade union ig metall as part of a broad revamp of the company 's operations .
the scale of the cuts , which are expected to mainly affect administrative positions , is unprecedented in the 160-year history of the german company .
according to the sueddeutsche zeitung , the german cuts would be spread over two years and are due to be announced officially in the fall .

robert mugabe was sworn in for a new term as president of zimbabwe on sunday while the international community widely condemned the vote .
in europe , officials urged africa to play a bigger role in ending the crisis . official results released on sunday showed mugabe overwhelmingly won the country 's one-man election .
zimbabwe election officials said he received more than two million votes or about 85 percent of the vote .
opposition leader morgan tsvangirai , who pulled out of the election amid mounting violence against his supports , received about 230,000 votes .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a zimbabwean voter gets her finger dipped in purple dye to show she has voted and unable to vote again turnout for the june 27 election was put at 42 percent .
but reports have circulated that many zimbabweans were coerced into voting and that mugabe militias had applied scare tactics to anyone without the tell-tale purple fingertip proving a person had voted .
europe calls vote a farce the vote was widely condemned around the world .
german foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier denounced the election as a farce considering mugabe was the only candidate .
in a statement issued after friday 's vote , steinmeier said that germany welcomed the fact that the united nations security council was planning to discuss possible action against mugabe 's regime in the coming week .
many western leaders have urged the african union to take action at a summit in egypt on june 30 that was expected to focus on the zimbabwe election crisis . british prime minister gordon brown said the african union and the international community must work together to help bring stability to zimbabwe .
the united states has called for drawing up sanctions against zimbabwe .
the european union has said it will not rule out sanctions against " those responsible for the tragic events of recent months . "

he has also said the opposition will never come to power as long as he is alive , vowing to fight to ensure it does not happen .
the zimbabwe opposition and western critics have said mugabe is a dictator who has ruined a once prosperous country .
they have sharply criticized him for applying suppression and violence against opposition supporters .

kenyan prime minister raila odinga , among the zimbabwean leader 's most vocal critics on the continent , called on the african union to send troops into zimbabwe and labelled mugabe " a shame to africa " .

robert mugabe was sworn in for a new term as president of zimbabwe on sunday while the international community widely condemned the vote .
in europe , officials urged africa to play a bigger role in ending the crisis . official results released on sunday showed mugabe overwhelmingly won the country 's one-man election .
zimbabwe election officials said he received more than two million votes or about 85 percent of the vote .
opposition leader morgan tsvangirai , who pulled out of the election amid mounting violence against his supports , received about 230,000 votes .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a zimbabwean voter gets her finger dipped in purple dye to show she has voted and unable to vote again turnout for the june 27 election was put at 42 percent .
but reports have circulated that many zimbabweans were coerced into voting and that mugabe militias had applied scare tactics to anyone without the tell-tale purple fingertip proving a person had voted .
europe calls vote a farce the vote was widely condemned around the world .
german foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier denounced the election as a farce considering mugabe was the only candidate .
in a statement issued after friday 's vote , steinmeier said that germany welcomed the fact that the united nations security council was planning to discuss possible action against mugabe 's regime in the coming week .
many western leaders have urged the african union to take action at a summit in egypt on june 30 that was expected to focus on the zimbabwe election crisis . british prime minister gordon brown said the african union and the international community must work together to help bring stability to zimbabwe .
the united states has called for drawing up sanctions against zimbabwe .
the european union has said it will not rule out sanctions against " those responsible for the tragic events of recent months . "

he has also said the opposition will never come to power as long as he is alive , vowing to fight to ensure it does not happen .
the zimbabwe opposition and western critics have said mugabe is a dictator who has ruined a once prosperous country .
they have sharply criticized him for applying suppression and violence against opposition supporters .

kenyan prime minister raila odinga , among the zimbabwean leader 's most vocal critics on the continent , called on the african union to send troops into zimbabwe and labelled mugabe " a shame to africa " .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de formula one -pipe- 29.06.2008 the nürburgring gets a makeover großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : nürburgring 's race course : now under construction the nürburgring , germany 's oldest racetrack , recently got a dramatic makeover .
the legendary formula one race course , nicknamed the green hell , is to be turned into a year-round leisure center . located 90 kilometers southwest of cologne in the heart of the eifel national park , the nürburgring has seen a lot in its 80 years : daredevil drivers , jubilant winners and too many dead . the track 's history includes more than 100 races and tragic crashes - like the fiery wreck at the 1976 grand prix , from which driver niki lauda barely escaped . now , however , the race course is quiet ; scaffolding covers the track 's start and finish lines and the main grandstands . in a major facelift meant to bring more life to the area , the track is being repurposed as a year-round leisure and business center with a promenade , an arena for small events , a convention center and a new grandstand .
four-star and a three-star hotels are entering the fray , along with a series of bungalows that will add up to 1,000 beds to the area . the nürburgring corporation plans to invest 215 million euros by spring of next year , according to ceo walter kafitz . when the formula one returns bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " rock am ring " brings in more than two million visitors annually new grand prix racetracks in abu dhabi , shanghai and singapore are more lucrative for formula one boss bernie eccleston . that means that the nürburgring has felt it must dispel the myth that it is past its prime - one reason justifying the course be flipped on its head . " when we talk about nürburgring 2009 , we 're also talking about the subsequent growth and development of the area , " said kafitz . after the renovation , the racetrack expects around 2 million per year , including the number of people coming to the world superbike championships and europe 's largest rock festival , the " rock am ring . " " new growth has to come from outside , " said kafitz .
" of course , we want to increase the interest in motorsports .
but we also do n't want to be dependent on motorsports .
we have to open up our offerings to bring people to the area from january to december . " while over half of the investments came from private investors , the " nürburgring 2009 " project is not without its critics .
some complain that the company is 90 percent owned by the state of rhineland palatinate , and they have doubts about whether their tax dollars are being put to good use . but kafitz says the ring is a business engine driving the region . according to information provided by the company , the track has invested about 100 million euros over the last 15 years in the modernization of the track and pits without considerable public support .
they say they have created 40 new jobs and promise to bring an additional 500 jobs to the region in the next two years . where managers can satisfy their need for speed bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : operators hope an 18-hole golf course will draw more tourists once construction is complete , more than half a million additional visitors are expected in the eifel each year .
at present , turnover at the ring is approximately 50 million annually - a number expected to double . nürburgring operators also expect to increase profit through the new 18-hole golf course or high-octane cars rentals to satisfy visitors ' need for speed . for companies like xerox and the italian motorcycle manufacturer ducati , which sponsor motorsports at the track , the nürburgring is a lucrative address . " we have a hotel directly on the course .
you can see the racetrack directly from your hotel room - that 's an amazing experience , " said marketing manager albert brenner . and despite all the add-ons , such as golf , motorsports will remain front and center at the ring , says kafitz . " it 's our core , " he said .
" it will always smell like gasoline here . " manfred böhm -lrb- cat -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

fernando torres scored the single goal in the intense match , which brought many german fans to tears . spain won their second european title in fine style on sunday , deservedly beating a weak germany 1-0 in vienna , on a goal from fernando torres . the handsome win culminates a stunning euro 2008 for spain , who have won five games and drawn one , scoring 12 goals and conceding just three since the european championships kicked off on june 7 in switzerland . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the spanish team in victory pose after beating germany .
sunday 's win was spain 's first international triumph since 1964 , when the european nations cup , as it was called then , was much less important than it is today . curiously , this was the first game in which spain - preferring an intelligent counter-attacking strategy - did not dominate possession from the beginning . luis aragones ' young team only had 48 percent ball possession , but nonetheless created countless chances and should have scored more goals . germany tired and frustrated germany , in contrast , failed to create a single clear chance and were clearly outclassed .
true to tradition , however , they battled until the bitter end , despite their fatigue , frustration and injuries . joachim loew 's team made an aggressive start , determined not to let spain dominate , but then the germans lacked the craft to create clear chances . spain slowly but surely got their act together and almost went ahead in the 14th minute , when german keeper jens lehmann had to keep out a deflection from defender christoph metzelder . nine minutes later torres headed a sergio ramos centre against lehmann 's post . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : fernando torres celebrates after scoring the winning goal torres scores single goal the only goal came in the 33rd minute .
the majestic xavi hernandez played a tempting through ball for torres , who powered his way past philipp lahm and beat the lehmann with a clever chip . germany adopted a more direct approach in the second half , but with captain michael ballack not looking a hundred percent fit - and with striker lukas podolski and miroslav klose well marked and philipp lahm out with an injury - they were running more on hope than expectation . viva espana ! bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : spanish supporters cheer in plaza de colon in madrid , sunday june 29 , 2008 thousands of ecstatic spanish fans danced and chanted " viva espana " in central madrid as the country 's first major international football trophy in 44 years sparked a nationwide fiesta . the capital was awash with the red and gold national colours , as the country celebrated the euro victory in true spanish style .
the deafening sounds of cheering , klaxons and drums from the vast plaza colon , where thousands watched the match live from vienna on giant television screens , mixed with those of car horns across the city . germany fans disappointed bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a german supporter reacts after the final match between spain and germany fans of germany 's soccer team were stunned into disbelief after their team lost to spain .
the disappointment was visible on the faces of thousands who gathered in public viewing areas and fan miles to watch the match on giant screens . yet despite the loss , and the second-place finish , germany supporters applauded spain 's victory and praised germany 's solid run . dw staff -lrb- ktz -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" i know spain has a lot of respect for us , " defender christoph metzelder , who earns his money at spanish champions real madrid , told a final news conference in tenero . " they have a lot of quality but this is a final .
there you need special qualities and we have some of them . " germany is the most successful team in euro history with three titles and two further finals .
spain , by contrast , won way back in 1964 and had not gone beyond the quarters since 1984 . metzelder praised spain 's consistency in the tournament and team manager oliver bierhoff named them light favorites . but the germans say they have good reason for optimism as well . a mixture of their proverbial luck and the determination never to give up saw them win 3-2 against turkey in the semi-finals although they played below par on wednesday . six days earlier germany had a classy performance in a 3-2 quarter-final win over portugal . germany face similar challenge to portugal quarter-final bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : xavi hernandez is a key player in spain 's midfield the german camp expects a very similar game to the portugal tie on sunday and is set to pack the midfield to deny xavi hernandez , andres iniesta in the same way it did with deco , cristiano ronaldo and company . " we must fight back as a team , not allow them into the game .
the spaniards do n't like it if we fight back aggressively .
we must try that and then play our own game , " said frings . bierhoff , who scored both goals when germany won the euro 1996 title against the czech republic , agreed : " you can not give them space - we must be close to them like against portugal . " the best news for germany is that frings has overcome his cracked rib and is expected to play as a starter in place of simon rolfes , although coach joachim loew is yet to announce the lineup . frings joins a midfield which also includes captain michael ballack , bastian schweinsteiger , thomas hitzlsperger and possibly also lukas podolski as against portugal and turkey - unless he is moved forward again to partner miroslav klose . " i feel really well , hardly have any problems .
i am surprised how well it went , " frings said in reference to have played the second half against turkey when rolfes got injured . " a coach frings would definitely field the player frings because i showed it does n't hamper me . " bierhoff and the players named the final a unique experience in which the team would not let itself and the country down . germans focused on chance of a lifetime bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : real madrid 's metzelder , pictured here center and without his current beard , is germany 's insider " you realize the tension is there .
it is a big match for a title , the team is very focused .
you do n't get many chances to play for a title , " said metzelder , the only expected starter who was also on the pitch when germany lost the 2002 world cup final to brazil . " we are competitive on sunday .
we can become european champions . " bierhoff said : " the motivation for the final is high .
it is important to have courage .
the players must show heart and give it all they have .
we demand concentration and dedication , the rest you ca n't influence . " looking ahead at a presentation before the german fans on monday in berlin , frings said the team did not want to meet the supporters empty-handed like in 2006 when germany came in third at the world cup . " this time we want to hold something in the air .
something was missing in 2006 .
this time we want to show more than a t-shirt saying ' thank you , " ' frings said . german team to celebrate with fans - win or lose the german team will come to berlin on monday to celebrate with the fans - regardless if they win or lose the euro 2008 final with spain . " it is very important to have the team celebrated in germany , " oliver bierhoff said on friday . jogi loew , captain michael ballack and the rest of the team are expected to arrive in the early afternoon on monday from vienna , where sunday 's final takes place . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany will be met by a huge crowd - even on a work day the presentation takes place at the fan zone in front of the brandenburg gate , where 500,000 people had gathered on wednesday to watch germany 's semi-final win over turkey .
a similar sized crowd is expected to watch the final there . germany also chose the berlin fan area to celebrate its third- place finish at the 2006 home world cup , then drawing 1.5 million people .
the euro fan zone is smaller than the one from the world cup . bierhoff said : " we know it ’ s a work day but we hope that employers and schools will allow us to have a big crowd .

robert mugabe was sworn in for a new term as president of zimbabwe on sunday while the international community widely condemned the vote .
in europe , officials urged africa to play a bigger role in ending the crisis . official results released on sunday showed mugabe overwhelmingly won the country 's one-man election .
zimbabwe election officials said he received more than two million votes or about 85 percent of the vote .
opposition leader morgan tsvangirai , who pulled out of the election amid mounting violence against his supports , received about 230,000 votes .

europe calls vote a farce the vote was widely condemned around the world .
german foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier denounced the election as a farce considering mugabe was the only candidate .
in a statement issued after friday 's vote , steinmeier said that germany welcomed the fact that the united nations security council was planning to discuss possible action against mugabe 's regime in the coming week .

he has also said the opposition will never come to power as long as he is alive , vowing to fight to ensure it does not happen .
the zimbabwe opposition and western critics have said mugabe is a dictator who has ruined a once prosperous country .
they have sharply criticized him for applying suppression and violence against opposition supporters .

kenyan prime minister raila odinga , among the zimbabwean leader 's most vocal critics on the continent , called on the african union to send troops into zimbabwe and labelled mugabe " a shame to africa " .

opposition leader morgan tsvangirai , who pulled out of the election amid mounting violence against his supports , received about 230,000 votes .

europe calls vote a farce the vote was widely condemned around the world .
german foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier denounced the election as a farce considering mugabe was the only candidate .
in a statement issued after friday 's vote , steinmeier said that germany welcomed the fact that the united nations security council was planning to discuss possible action against mugabe 's regime in the coming week .

he has also said the opposition will never come to power as long as he is alive , vowing to fight to ensure it does not happen .
the zimbabwe opposition and western critics have said mugabe is a dictator who has ruined a once prosperous country .
they have sharply criticized him for applying suppression and violence against opposition supporters .

kenyan prime minister raila odinga , among the zimbabwean leader 's most vocal critics on the continent , called on the african union to send troops into zimbabwe and labelled mugabe " a shame to africa " .

luis aragones ' young side are hoping emulate that feat in vienna on sunday , june 29 , against germany . for a team which has become notorious for losing its bottle at the business end of tournaments and flattering to deceive on a consistent basis , spain move into their first major final in 24 years full of confidence while playing the kind of soccer they normally only reserve for the early rounds .
since they took to the field in paris to contest the 1984 european championship title against hosts france , spain have turned up for tournaments with squads full of the world 's biggest stars and the continent 's most talented players but have failed to make the latter stages .
many huge names from spanish soccer have graced the world cup and european championship stages in the shirt of the furia roja - and have shown their worth for about three games before meekly surrendering when things got serious .
normally it 's the quarter-final stage .
such has been the regularity that the spanish bow out at this stage , that it has become a bit of a mental block , if not a downright curse .
this year however , despite the fact that they were facing world champions italy at this stage , spain overcame both the italians and the psychological barrier to make it to the semis .
before earning themselves a place against italy , luis aragones ' team played their way through group d with skill and panache .
their opening game , a 4-1 thrashing of russia , got everyone believing again , while harboring all those memories of false dawns and premature celebrations .
opening game sends impressive message bildunterschrift : david villa opened his account with a hat trick against russia and got the ball rolling russia were supposed to be a new force , one with an attacking vision that could have overcome a sometimes ponderous spanish defense .
but not only did the rear guard hold firm , the spearhead proved deadly .
a david villa hat trick and a cameo goal from substitute cesc fabregas showed the world that spain had a rod of steel running from back to front , with a very sharp point at its attacking end .
the edge looked a little blunt when spain came up against the swedes in their second group match .
fernando torres got his first goal of the tournament , only to see it cancelled by zlatan ibrahimovic .
the game looked to be heading for a disappointing draw - which no doubt would have prompted questions about spain 's true quality - when that man villa popped up again to net a last gasp winner in the second minute of stoppage time .
with qualification assured , spain then finished off their group stage with a 2-1 win over already eliminated champions greece , with aragones fielding his reserves in a routine win .
spain had to come from behind to grab the points , with goals from reuben de la red and daniel guiza .
it was far from a classy performance but one which showed that spain could dig deep and regain the advantage even without a host of first-teamers on the pitch .
omens gather for quarter-final against italy then came italy .
spain had n't beaten the italians in a competitive match since a 2-0 win at the 1920 olympic games in belgium some 88 years ago .
there was also a certain amount of animosity bubbling under the surface , if the spanish press could be believed .
spain , it was claimed , were looking for revenge for the assault by mario tassotti on luis enrique which went unpunished in the quarter-final of the 1994 world cup in the united states , a match spain lost 2-1 .
whatever the motivation , spain dominated possession throughout regulation time but failed to translate their dominance into clear goal chances .
villa and david silva came close several times to breaking the tense deadlock for spain while italy offered few attacking threats .
spain 's domination continued into extra time , with italy 's keeper buffon saving from villa and santi cazorla shooting wide .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : iker casillas saves one of the penalties in the shoot-out spain may have had their horrible record in penalty shoot-outs at the back of their minds but they did n't show it .
while the spanish slotted in four of their kicks , keeper iker casillas was the hero , saving penalties from daniel de rossi and antonio di natale to put spain in the semi-finals .
the shoot-out victory also ended spain 's june 22 penalty jinx .
on june 22 , 1986 , spain lost to belgium in a dramatic world cup quarter-final shoot-out , then against england in euro 1996 on the same june date 10 years later .
and it was on june 22 , 2002 that the spaniards lost to hosts south korea in the 2002 world cup quarters .
spain raise their game to dominate russia meeting russia again in the semi-final , spain knew that their opponents had grown in confidence since their thrashing in the first game .
the return of andrei arshavin had inspired russia against sweden in the game that sealed qualification and then again in the rampant display that knocked the dutch out in the quarter-final .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : spain turned on the style to overcome russia but spain were irrepressible and arshavin was eclipsed by substitute cesc fabregas , on for the injured david villa after only 30 minutes or so of play .
fabregas delivered a midfield masterclass , pulling the strings and conducting the play as spain ran out 3-0 winners .

" i know spain has a lot of respect for us , " defender christoph metzelder , who earns his money at spanish champions real madrid , told a final news conference in tenero . " they have a lot of quality but this is a final .
there you need special qualities and we have some of them . " germany is the most successful team in euro history with three titles and two further finals .
spain , by contrast , won way back in 1964 and had not gone beyond the quarters since 1984 . metzelder praised spain 's consistency in the tournament and team manager oliver bierhoff named them light favorites . but the germans say they have good reason for optimism as well . a mixture of their proverbial luck and the determination never to give up saw them win 3-2 against turkey in the semi-finals although they played below par on wednesday . six days earlier germany had a classy performance in a 3-2 quarter-final win over portugal . germany face similar challenge to portugal quarter-final bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : xavi hernandez is a key player in spain 's midfield the german camp expects a very similar game to the portugal tie on sunday and is set to pack the midfield to deny xavi hernandez , andres iniesta in the same way it did with deco , cristiano ronaldo and company . " we must fight back as a team , not allow them into the game .
the spaniards do n't like it if we fight back aggressively .
we must try that and then play our own game , " said frings . bierhoff , who scored both goals when germany won the euro 1996 title against the czech republic , agreed : " you can not give them space - we must be close to them like against portugal . " the best news for germany is that frings has overcome his cracked rib and is expected to play as a starter in place of simon rolfes , although coach joachim loew is yet to announce the lineup . frings joins a midfield which also includes captain michael ballack , bastian schweinsteiger , thomas hitzlsperger and possibly also lukas podolski as against portugal and turkey - unless he is moved forward again to partner miroslav klose . " i feel really well , hardly have any problems .
i am surprised how well it went , " frings said in reference to have played the second half against turkey when rolfes got injured . " a coach frings would definitely field the player frings because i showed it does n't hamper me . " bierhoff and the players named the final a unique experience in which the team would not let itself and the country down . germans focused on chance of a lifetime bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : real madrid 's metzelder , pictured here center and without his current beard , is germany 's insider " you realize the tension is there .
it is a big match for a title , the team is very focused .
you do n't get many chances to play for a title , " said metzelder , the only expected starter who was also on the pitch when germany lost the 2002 world cup final to brazil . " we are competitive on sunday .
we can become european champions . " bierhoff said : " the motivation for the final is high .
it is important to have courage .
the players must show heart and give it all they have .
we demand concentration and dedication , the rest you ca n't influence . " looking ahead at a presentation before the german fans on monday in berlin , frings said the team did not want to meet the supporters empty-handed like in 2006 when germany came in third at the world cup . " this time we want to hold something in the air .

there you need special qualities and we have some of them . " germany is the most successful team in euro history with three titles and two further finals .
spain , by contrast , won way back in 1964 and had not gone beyond the quarters since 1984 . metzelder praised spain 's consistency in the tournament and team manager oliver bierhoff named them light favorites . but the germans say they have good reason for optimism as well . a mixture of their proverbial luck and the determination never to give up saw them win 3-2 against turkey in the semi-finals although they played below par on wednesday . six days earlier germany had a classy performance in a 3-2 quarter-final win over portugal . germany face similar challenge to portugal quarter-final bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : xavi hernandez is a key player in spain 's midfield the german camp expects a very similar game to the portugal tie on sunday and is set to pack the midfield to deny xavi hernandez , andres iniesta in the same way it did with deco , cristiano ronaldo and company .

" i feel really well , hardly have any problems .
i am surprised how well it went , " frings said in reference to have played the second half against turkey when rolfes got injured .

fernando torres scored the single goal in the intense match , which brought many german fans to tears . spain won their second european title in fine style on sunday , deservedly beating a weak germany 1-0 in vienna , on a goal from fernando torres . the handsome win culminates a stunning euro 2008 for spain , who have won five games and drawn one , scoring 12 goals and conceding just three since the european championships kicked off on june 7 in switzerland . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the spanish team in victory pose after beating germany .
sunday 's win was spain 's first international triumph since 1964 , when the european nations cup , as it was called then , was much less important than it is today . curiously , this was the first game in which spain - preferring an intelligent counter-attacking strategy - did not dominate possession from the beginning . luis aragones ' young team only had 48 percent ball possession , but nonetheless created countless chances and should have scored more goals . germany tired and frustrated germany , in contrast , failed to create a single clear chance and were clearly outclassed .
true to tradition , however , they battled until the bitter end , despite their fatigue , frustration and injuries . joachim loew 's team made an aggressive start , determined not to let spain dominate , but then the germans lacked the craft to create clear chances . spain slowly but surely got their act together and almost went ahead in the 14th minute , when german keeper jens lehmann had to keep out a deflection from defender christoph metzelder . nine minutes later torres headed a sergio ramos centre against lehmann 's post . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : fernando torres celebrates after scoring the winning goal torres scores single goal the only goal came in the 33rd minute .
the majestic xavi hernandez played a tempting through ball for torres , who powered his way past philipp lahm and beat the lehmann with a clever chip . germany adopted a more direct approach in the second half , but with captain michael ballack not looking a hundred percent fit - and with striker lukas podolski and miroslav klose well marked and philipp lahm out with an injury - they were running more on hope than expectation . viva espana ! bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : spanish supporters cheer in plaza de colon in madrid , sunday june 29 , 2008 thousands of ecstatic spanish fans danced and chanted " viva espana " in central madrid as the country 's first major international football trophy in 44 years sparked a nationwide fiesta . the capital was awash with the red and gold national colours , as the country celebrated the euro victory in true spanish style .
the deafening sounds of cheering , klaxons and drums from the vast plaza colon , where thousands watched the match live from vienna on giant television screens , mixed with those of car horns across the city . germany fans disappointed bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a german supporter reacts after the final match between spain and germany fans of germany 's soccer team were stunned into disbelief after their team lost to spain .

fernando torres scored the single goal in the intense match , which brought many german fans to tears . spain won their second european title in fine style on sunday , deservedly beating a weak germany 1-0 in vienna , on a goal from fernando torres . the handsome win culminates a stunning euro 2008 for spain , who have won five games and drawn one , scoring 12 goals and conceding just three since the european championships kicked off on june 7 in switzerland . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the spanish team in victory pose after beating germany .
sunday 's win was spain 's first international triumph since 1964 , when the european nations cup , as it was called then , was much less important than it is today . curiously , this was the first game in which spain - preferring an intelligent counter-attacking strategy - did not dominate possession from the beginning . luis aragones ' young team only had 48 percent ball possession , but nonetheless created countless chances and should have scored more goals . germany tired and frustrated germany , in contrast , failed to create a single clear chance and were clearly outclassed .
true to tradition , however , they battled until the bitter end , despite their fatigue , frustration and injuries . joachim loew 's team made an aggressive start , determined not to let spain dominate , but then the germans lacked the craft to create clear chances . spain slowly but surely got their act together and almost went ahead in the 14th minute , when german keeper jens lehmann had to keep out a deflection from defender christoph metzelder . nine minutes later torres headed a sergio ramos centre against lehmann 's post . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : fernando torres celebrates after scoring the winning goal torres scores single goal the only goal came in the 33rd minute .
the majestic xavi hernandez played a tempting through ball for torres , who powered his way past philipp lahm and beat the lehmann with a clever chip . germany adopted a more direct approach in the second half , but with captain michael ballack not looking a hundred percent fit - and with striker lukas podolski and miroslav klose well marked and philipp lahm out with an injury - they were running more on hope than expectation . viva espana ! bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : spanish supporters cheer in plaza de colon in madrid , sunday june 29 , 2008 thousands of ecstatic spanish fans danced and chanted " viva espana " in central madrid as the country 's first major international football trophy in 44 years sparked a nationwide fiesta . the capital was awash with the red and gold national colours , as the country celebrated the euro victory in true spanish style .
the deafening sounds of cheering , klaxons and drums from the vast plaza colon , where thousands watched the match live from vienna on giant television screens , mixed with those of car horns across the city . germany fans disappointed bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a german supporter reacts after the final match between spain and germany fans of germany 's soccer team were stunned into disbelief after their team lost to spain .
the disappointment was visible on the faces of thousands who gathered in public viewing areas and fan miles to watch the match on giant screens . yet despite the loss , and the second-place finish , germany supporters applauded spain 's victory and praised germany 's solid run . dw staff -lrb- ktz -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the head of german engineering group siemens has confirmed that a major restructuring is in the works , after media reports said the firm wanted to lay off 17,000 workers . referring to the state of the world economy and the rising oil price , siemens chief executive peter loescher said it was time for germany 's biggest engineering company to act .
" we have to batten down the hatches , " before siemens caves in under the pressure , the ceo said .
in the comments which are set to be published in full on monday , loescher said siemens needed to reach a target saving of 1.2 billion euros -lrb- 1.9 billion dollars -rrb- by 2010 to remain competitive .
job cuts imminent over the weekend reports were leaked that siemens planned to cut more than 17,000 jobs from its 400,000 global workforce , including some 6,450 jobs in germany .
the amount - nearly four percent of the workforce - was considerably more than the 10,000 anticipated by trade union ig metall as part of a broad revamp of the company 's operations .
the scale of the cuts , which are expected to mainly affect administrative positions , is unprecedented in the 160-year history of the german company .
according to the sueddeutsche zeitung , the german cuts would be spread over two years and are due to be announced officially in the fall .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : peter löscher took over as ceo in 2007 in a letter to the employees , loescher called the restructuring plans the most " extensive in the last 20 years . "
he added that he hoped the job cuts would be as " socially acceptable as possible . "
siemens , which manufactures everything from hearing aids to nuclear power stations and trains in some 190 countries , posted worldwide sales last year of more than 70 billion euros .
but after problems with a range of major projects were uncovered in the early part of the year , the company has been struggling for ways to reform and streamline its production .

on the streets of berlin , preparations for the final match were in full swing . from chancellor angela merkel downwards , germans will be cheering on " schweini , " " poldi " and their teammates in a nation now much more comfortable with being patriotic ever since the 2006 world cup was held on home soil . in towns and cities across the country , hundreds of thousands were expected at public viewing areas to watch the match beamed in from vienna from 20:45 local time onto huge screens and tens of millions will be glued to their tvs at home . on the streets of the capital , people are gathering in beer gardens hours before the game where they 'll follow the action on large-screen televisions .
some have been seen carrying refrigerators down streets to make sure parties are fully stocked .
black , red and gold flags are everywhere . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the referee for the final of euro 2008 holds a match ball nearly half a million people watched the last game in the specially erected " fan mile " around the brandenburg gate in berlin alone , and the atmosphere will be more electric still on sunday if joachim loew 's team triumphs . according to a survey in the bild am sonntag weekely , 85 percent of the country 's 82 million population will follow the match , and for all practical purposes , the country will come to a stand-still . german automakers like daimler , volkswagen and audi plan to shut down production during the game so that their workers can follow the match before the conveyor belts and europe 's biggest economy grind back into action after the final whistle . only one in five german televisions were tuned into something else as almost 30 million viewers were glued to wednesday 's semi-final thriller against turkey , and sunday 's final was not expected to be any less of a crowd-puller . worries about ballack bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : these guys have got to be feeling the pressure despite their confidence , the country is sweating over the fact that powerhouse captain michael ballack might not take to the field after hurting his leg in training at the team 's base in southern switzerland . nevertheless , 72 percent believe their side will win the wunder von wien -lrb- the vienna miracle -rrb- , according to bild am sonntag 's poll . " ballack injured ! , " the top-selling paper 's front page screams .
" but we are going to win the cup anyway ! " only one in five took the more pessimistic view - including none other than finance minister peer steinbrueck who perhaps unwisely predicts a 3-1 hammering , the paper said .
eight percent were hedging their bets . leaders in attendance merkel herself , who was shown literally jumping for joy in basel when the winning goal against turkey hit the back of the net on wednesday , will watch the match in vienna along with president horst koehler and other ministers . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : angela merkel and national player bastian schweinsteiger merkel became a regular in the stands during the world cup .
she has even taken to giving the players some motherly advice , and after the turkey match gave an interview in the flash zone area usually reserved for players and managers . her spokesman had to keep the chancellor informed by text message of the score in the game against portugal while she was tied up with more serious matters at an eu summit on june 19 . " i am sure that our team is going to succeed , " president koehler said in a column in the top-selling bild newspaper on sunday .
" our opponent is strong ... but with the fire in their bellies the german team can beat them . " a parade has been organized in central berlin for monday for the players - even if they lose - and the city authorities have asked schools to give pupils the afternoon off so they can attend . " it is very important for us that the team will be greeted by its supporters back in germany .
berlin has become like a second home to us since the 2006 world cup , " loew said . dw staff -lrb- jam -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

after the 1974 release of the first film in his road movie trilogy , " alice in the cities , " wenders showed the second part , " the wrong move " -lrb- 1975 -rrb- , at the cannes film festival .

robert mugabe was sworn in for a new term as president of zimbabwe on sunday while the international community widely condemned the vote .
in europe , officials urged africa to play a bigger role in ending the crisis . official results released on sunday showed mugabe overwhelmingly won the country 's one-man election .
zimbabwe election officials said he received more than two million votes or about 85 percent of the vote .
opposition leader morgan tsvangirai , who pulled out of the election amid mounting violence against his supports , received about 230,000 votes .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a zimbabwean voter gets her finger dipped in purple dye to show she has voted and unable to vote again turnout for the june 27 election was put at 42 percent .
but reports have circulated that many zimbabweans were coerced into voting and that mugabe militias had applied scare tactics to anyone without the tell-tale purple fingertip proving a person had voted .
europe calls vote a farce the vote was widely condemned around the world .
german foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier denounced the election as a farce considering mugabe was the only candidate .
in a statement issued after friday 's vote , steinmeier said that germany welcomed the fact that the united nations security council was planning to discuss possible action against mugabe 's regime in the coming week .
many western leaders have urged the african union to take action at a summit in egypt on june 30 that was expected to focus on the zimbabwe election crisis . british prime minister gordon brown said the african union and the international community must work together to help bring stability to zimbabwe .
the united states has called for drawing up sanctions against zimbabwe .
the european union has said it will not rule out sanctions against " those responsible for the tragic events of recent months . "
history of defiance bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : residents of mbare line up to cast their vote in the country 's presidential election the 84-year-old veteran fighter disregarded the official results from the first-round election in march which put opposition leader morgan tsvangirai ahead . mugabe flaunted international criticism and pushed ahead with the vote , warning against outside interference in his country 's affairs and shrugging off tsvangirai 's claims of violence .
he has also said the opposition will never come to power as long as he is alive , vowing to fight to ensure it does not happen .
the zimbabwe opposition and western critics have said mugabe is a dictator who has ruined a once prosperous country .
they have sharply criticized him for applying suppression and violence against opposition supporters .
little support in africa bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : south africans demonstrate against election related violence in zimbabwe in johannesburg no african heads of state were present for the inauguration of mugabe 's sixth five-year term as president june 29 .
the head of the pan-african parliament mission told a news conference sunday that the vote was neither free nor fair and fresh polls should be held .
kenyan prime minister raila odinga , among the zimbabwean leader 's most vocal critics on the continent , called on the african union to send troops into zimbabwe and labelled mugabe " a shame to africa " .
mugabe is africa 's oldest head of state and has ruled the former british colony uninterrupted since gaining independence from britain in 1980 . dw staff -lrb- ktz -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

luis aragones ' young side are hoping emulate that feat in vienna on sunday , june 29 , against germany . for a team which has become notorious for losing its bottle at the business end of tournaments and flattering to deceive on a consistent basis , spain move into their first major final in 24 years full of confidence while playing the kind of soccer they normally only reserve for the early rounds .
since they took to the field in paris to contest the 1984 european championship title against hosts france , spain have turned up for tournaments with squads full of the world 's biggest stars and the continent 's most talented players but have failed to make the latter stages .
many huge names from spanish soccer have graced the world cup and european championship stages in the shirt of the furia roja - and have shown their worth for about three games before meekly surrendering when things got serious .
normally it 's the quarter-final stage .
such has been the regularity that the spanish bow out at this stage , that it has become a bit of a mental block , if not a downright curse .
this year however , despite the fact that they were facing world champions italy at this stage , spain overcame both the italians and the psychological barrier to make it to the semis .
before earning themselves a place against italy , luis aragones ' team played their way through group d with skill and panache .
their opening game , a 4-1 thrashing of russia , got everyone believing again , while harboring all those memories of false dawns and premature celebrations .
opening game sends impressive message bildunterschrift : david villa opened his account with a hat trick against russia and got the ball rolling russia were supposed to be a new force , one with an attacking vision that could have overcome a sometimes ponderous spanish defense .
but not only did the rear guard hold firm , the spearhead proved deadly .
a david villa hat trick and a cameo goal from substitute cesc fabregas showed the world that spain had a rod of steel running from back to front , with a very sharp point at its attacking end .
the edge looked a little blunt when spain came up against the swedes in their second group match .
fernando torres got his first goal of the tournament , only to see it cancelled by zlatan ibrahimovic .
the game looked to be heading for a disappointing draw - which no doubt would have prompted questions about spain 's true quality - when that man villa popped up again to net a last gasp winner in the second minute of stoppage time .
with qualification assured , spain then finished off their group stage with a 2-1 win over already eliminated champions greece , with aragones fielding his reserves in a routine win .
spain had to come from behind to grab the points , with goals from reuben de la red and daniel guiza .
it was far from a classy performance but one which showed that spain could dig deep and regain the advantage even without a host of first-teamers on the pitch .
omens gather for quarter-final against italy then came italy .
spain had n't beaten the italians in a competitive match since a 2-0 win at the 1920 olympic games in belgium some 88 years ago .
there was also a certain amount of animosity bubbling under the surface , if the spanish press could be believed .
spain , it was claimed , were looking for revenge for the assault by mario tassotti on luis enrique which went unpunished in the quarter-final of the 1994 world cup in the united states , a match spain lost 2-1 .
whatever the motivation , spain dominated possession throughout regulation time but failed to translate their dominance into clear goal chances .
villa and david silva came close several times to breaking the tense deadlock for spain while italy offered few attacking threats .
spain 's domination continued into extra time , with italy 's keeper buffon saving from villa and santi cazorla shooting wide .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : iker casillas saves one of the penalties in the shoot-out spain may have had their horrible record in penalty shoot-outs at the back of their minds but they did n't show it .
while the spanish slotted in four of their kicks , keeper iker casillas was the hero , saving penalties from daniel de rossi and antonio di natale to put spain in the semi-finals .
the shoot-out victory also ended spain 's june 22 penalty jinx .
on june 22 , 1986 , spain lost to belgium in a dramatic world cup quarter-final shoot-out , then against england in euro 1996 on the same june date 10 years later .
and it was on june 22 , 2002 that the spaniards lost to hosts south korea in the 2002 world cup quarters .
spain raise their game to dominate russia meeting russia again in the semi-final , spain knew that their opponents had grown in confidence since their thrashing in the first game .
the return of andrei arshavin had inspired russia against sweden in the game that sealed qualification and then again in the rampant display that knocked the dutch out in the quarter-final .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : spain turned on the style to overcome russia but spain were irrepressible and arshavin was eclipsed by substitute cesc fabregas , on for the injured david villa after only 30 minutes or so of play .
fabregas delivered a midfield masterclass , pulling the strings and conducting the play as spain ran out 3-0 winners .
germany may not have fancied playing the russians , with their unpredictably marauding style , but they may not be looking forward to facing a spain team just one game away from ending 44 trophy-less years of hurt . nick amies send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the legendary formula one race course , nicknamed the green hell , is to be turned into a year-round leisure center . located 90 kilometers southwest of cologne in the heart of the eifel national park , the nürburgring has seen a lot in its 80 years : daredevil drivers , jubilant winners and too many dead . the track 's history includes more than 100 races and tragic crashes - like the fiery wreck at the 1976 grand prix , from which driver niki lauda barely escaped . now , however , the race course is quiet ; scaffolding covers the track 's start and finish lines and the main grandstands . in a major facelift meant to bring more life to the area , the track is being repurposed as a year-round leisure and business center with a promenade , an arena for small events , a convention center and a new grandstand .
four-star and a three-star hotels are entering the fray , along with a series of bungalows that will add up to 1,000 beds to the area . the nürburgring corporation plans to invest 215 million euros by spring of next year , according to ceo walter kafitz . when the formula one returns bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " rock am ring " brings in more than two million visitors annually new grand prix racetracks in abu dhabi , shanghai and singapore are more lucrative for formula one boss bernie eccleston . that means that the nürburgring has felt it must dispel the myth that it is past its prime - one reason justifying the course be flipped on its head . " when we talk about nürburgring 2009 , we 're also talking about the subsequent growth and development of the area , " said kafitz . after the renovation , the racetrack expects around 2 million per year , including the number of people coming to the world superbike championships and europe 's largest rock festival , the " rock am ring . " " new growth has to come from outside , " said kafitz .
" of course , we want to increase the interest in motorsports .
but we also do n't want to be dependent on motorsports .
we have to open up our offerings to bring people to the area from january to december . " while over half of the investments came from private investors , the " nürburgring 2009 " project is not without its critics .
some complain that the company is 90 percent owned by the state of rhineland palatinate , and they have doubts about whether their tax dollars are being put to good use . but kafitz says the ring is a business engine driving the region . according to information provided by the company , the track has invested about 100 million euros over the last 15 years in the modernization of the track and pits without considerable public support .
they say they have created 40 new jobs and promise to bring an additional 500 jobs to the region in the next two years . where managers can satisfy their need for speed bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : operators hope an 18-hole golf course will draw more tourists once construction is complete , more than half a million additional visitors are expected in the eifel each year .
at present , turnover at the ring is approximately 50 million annually - a number expected to double . nürburgring operators also expect to increase profit through the new 18-hole golf course or high-octane cars rentals to satisfy visitors ' need for speed . for companies like xerox and the italian motorcycle manufacturer ducati , which sponsor motorsports at the track , the nürburgring is a lucrative address . " we have a hotel directly on the course .
you can see the racetrack directly from your hotel room - that 's an amazing experience , " said marketing manager albert brenner . and despite all the add-ons , such as golf , motorsports will remain front and center at the ring , says kafitz . " it 's our core , " he said .

the legendary formula one race course , nicknamed the green hell , is to be turned into a year-round leisure center . located 90 kilometers southwest of cologne in the heart of the eifel national park , the nürburgring has seen a lot in its 80 years : daredevil drivers , jubilant winners and too many dead . the track 's history includes more than 100 races and tragic crashes - like the fiery wreck at the 1976 grand prix , from which driver niki lauda barely escaped . now , however , the race course is quiet ; scaffolding covers the track 's start and finish lines and the main grandstands . in a major facelift meant to bring more life to the area , the track is being repurposed as a year-round leisure and business center with a promenade , an arena for small events , a convention center and a new grandstand .
four-star and a three-star hotels are entering the fray , along with a series of bungalows that will add up to 1,000 beds to the area . the nürburgring corporation plans to invest 215 million euros by spring of next year , according to ceo walter kafitz . when the formula one returns bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " rock am ring " brings in more than two million visitors annually new grand prix racetracks in abu dhabi , shanghai and singapore are more lucrative for formula one boss bernie eccleston . that means that the nürburgring has felt it must dispel the myth that it is past its prime - one reason justifying the course be flipped on its head . " when we talk about nürburgring 2009 , we 're also talking about the subsequent growth and development of the area , " said kafitz . after the renovation , the racetrack expects around 2 million per year , including the number of people coming to the world superbike championships and europe 's largest rock festival , the " rock am ring . " " new growth has to come from outside , " said kafitz .
" of course , we want to increase the interest in motorsports .
but we also do n't want to be dependent on motorsports .
we have to open up our offerings to bring people to the area from january to december . " while over half of the investments came from private investors , the " nürburgring 2009 " project is not without its critics .
some complain that the company is 90 percent owned by the state of rhineland palatinate , and they have doubts about whether their tax dollars are being put to good use . but kafitz says the ring is a business engine driving the region . according to information provided by the company , the track has invested about 100 million euros over the last 15 years in the modernization of the track and pits without considerable public support .
they say they have created 40 new jobs and promise to bring an additional 500 jobs to the region in the next two years . where managers can satisfy their need for speed bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : operators hope an 18-hole golf course will draw more tourists once construction is complete , more than half a million additional visitors are expected in the eifel each year .
at present , turnover at the ring is approximately 50 million annually - a number expected to double . nürburgring operators also expect to increase profit through the new 18-hole golf course or high-octane cars rentals to satisfy visitors ' need for speed . for companies like xerox and the italian motorcycle manufacturer ducati , which sponsor motorsports at the track , the nürburgring is a lucrative address . " we have a hotel directly on the course .
you can see the racetrack directly from your hotel room - that 's an amazing experience , " said marketing manager albert brenner . and despite all the add-ons , such as golf , motorsports will remain front and center at the ring , says kafitz . " it 's our core , " he said .

critically acclaimed german film director wim wenders has been selected to head the jury at this year 's venice film festival . the venice festival organizers said in a statement that the 62-year-old wenders is one of the most innovative among contemporary filmmakers and has produced some of the most influential works of the past 40 years .
perhaps best known for his films " paris , texas " and " buena vista social club , " the german director 's own cinema career is tightly connected to venice .
" wim wenders has maintained strong ties with the -lrb- festival -rrb- over the years since his debut " in moviemaking , the festival organizers said .
strong ties to venice the veteran german director , who started as a film critic before he turned to directing in the 1970s , first appeared in venice in 1972 when he showed his second full-length feature film , " the goalkeeper 's fear of the penalty kick . "
a decade later venice awarded the filmmaker the festival 's top prize , the golden lion , for " the state of things " about a shoestring movie producer and his ragtag crew .
after the 1974 release of the first film in his road movie trilogy , " alice in the cities , " wenders showed the second part , " the wrong move " -lrb- 1975 -rrb- , at the cannes film festival .
the showing and the attention at the film festival helped launch his international career .
soon after the german director started filming in the united states , completing his movie trilogy with " kings of the road " -lrb- 1976 -rrb- and staying on to direct " the american friend " -lrb- 1977 -rrb- , an adaptation of the novel " ripley 's game " by patricia highsmith .
international accolades bildunterschrift : the guardian angels damiel -lrb- bruno ganz -rrb- and cassiel -lrb- otto sander -rrb- are invisible to everyone but children .
in 1984 wenders won the golden palm in cannes for " paris , texas , " and in 1987 he received the award for best director for his film " wings of desire . "
the director continued making fictional films through the 1990s , as well as the highly acclaimed documentary " buena vista social club " -lrb- 1999 -rrb- , a vibrant tribute to cuban music .
in 2000 his " million dollar hotel " won the silver bear jury prize at the berlin film festival .

fernando torres scored the single goal in the intense match , which brought many german fans to tears . spain won their second european title in fine style on sunday , deservedly beating a weak germany 1-0 in vienna , on a goal from fernando torres . the handsome win culminates a stunning euro 2008 for spain , who have won five games and drawn one , scoring 12 goals and conceding just three since the european championships kicked off on june 7 in switzerland . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the spanish team in victory pose after beating germany .
sunday 's win was spain 's first international triumph since 1964 , when the european nations cup , as it was called then , was much less important than it is today . curiously , this was the first game in which spain - preferring an intelligent counter-attacking strategy - did not dominate possession from the beginning . luis aragones ' young team only had 48 percent ball possession , but nonetheless created countless chances and should have scored more goals . germany tired and frustrated germany , in contrast , failed to create a single clear chance and were clearly outclassed .
true to tradition , however , they battled until the bitter end , despite their fatigue , frustration and injuries . joachim loew 's team made an aggressive start , determined not to let spain dominate , but then the germans lacked the craft to create clear chances . spain slowly but surely got their act together and almost went ahead in the 14th minute , when german keeper jens lehmann had to keep out a deflection from defender christoph metzelder . nine minutes later torres headed a sergio ramos centre against lehmann 's post . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : fernando torres celebrates after scoring the winning goal torres scores single goal the only goal came in the 33rd minute .
the majestic xavi hernandez played a tempting through ball for torres , who powered his way past philipp lahm and beat the lehmann with a clever chip . germany adopted a more direct approach in the second half , but with captain michael ballack not looking a hundred percent fit - and with striker lukas podolski and miroslav klose well marked and philipp lahm out with an injury - they were running more on hope than expectation . viva espana ! bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : spanish supporters cheer in plaza de colon in madrid , sunday june 29 , 2008 thousands of ecstatic spanish fans danced and chanted " viva espana " in central madrid as the country 's first major international football trophy in 44 years sparked a nationwide fiesta . the capital was awash with the red and gold national colours , as the country celebrated the euro victory in true spanish style .
the deafening sounds of cheering , klaxons and drums from the vast plaza colon , where thousands watched the match live from vienna on giant television screens , mixed with those of car horns across the city . germany fans disappointed bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a german supporter reacts after the final match between spain and germany fans of germany 's soccer team were stunned into disbelief after their team lost to spain .
the disappointment was visible on the faces of thousands who gathered in public viewing areas and fan miles to watch the match on giant screens . yet despite the loss , and the second-place finish , germany supporters applauded spain 's victory and praised germany 's solid run . dw staff -lrb- ktz -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

luis aragones ' young side are hoping emulate that feat in vienna on sunday , june 29 , against germany . for a team which has become notorious for losing its bottle at the business end of tournaments and flattering to deceive on a consistent basis , spain move into their first major final in 24 years full of confidence while playing the kind of soccer they normally only reserve for the early rounds .
since they took to the field in paris to contest the 1984 european championship title against hosts france , spain have turned up for tournaments with squads full of the world 's biggest stars and the continent 's most talented players but have failed to make the latter stages .
many huge names from spanish soccer have graced the world cup and european championship stages in the shirt of the furia roja - and have shown their worth for about three games before meekly surrendering when things got serious .
normally it 's the quarter-final stage .
such has been the regularity that the spanish bow out at this stage , that it has become a bit of a mental block , if not a downright curse .
this year however , despite the fact that they were facing world champions italy at this stage , spain overcame both the italians and the psychological barrier to make it to the semis .
before earning themselves a place against italy , luis aragones ' team played their way through group d with skill and panache .
their opening game , a 4-1 thrashing of russia , got everyone believing again , while harboring all those memories of false dawns and premature celebrations .
opening game sends impressive message bildunterschrift : david villa opened his account with a hat trick against russia and got the ball rolling russia were supposed to be a new force , one with an attacking vision that could have overcome a sometimes ponderous spanish defense .
but not only did the rear guard hold firm , the spearhead proved deadly .
a david villa hat trick and a cameo goal from substitute cesc fabregas showed the world that spain had a rod of steel running from back to front , with a very sharp point at its attacking end .
the edge looked a little blunt when spain came up against the swedes in their second group match .
fernando torres got his first goal of the tournament , only to see it cancelled by zlatan ibrahimovic .
the game looked to be heading for a disappointing draw - which no doubt would have prompted questions about spain 's true quality - when that man villa popped up again to net a last gasp winner in the second minute of stoppage time .
with qualification assured , spain then finished off their group stage with a 2-1 win over already eliminated champions greece , with aragones fielding his reserves in a routine win .
spain had to come from behind to grab the points , with goals from reuben de la red and daniel guiza .
it was far from a classy performance but one which showed that spain could dig deep and regain the advantage even without a host of first-teamers on the pitch .
omens gather for quarter-final against italy then came italy .
spain had n't beaten the italians in a competitive match since a 2-0 win at the 1920 olympic games in belgium some 88 years ago .
there was also a certain amount of animosity bubbling under the surface , if the spanish press could be believed .
spain , it was claimed , were looking for revenge for the assault by mario tassotti on luis enrique which went unpunished in the quarter-final of the 1994 world cup in the united states , a match spain lost 2-1 .
whatever the motivation , spain dominated possession throughout regulation time but failed to translate their dominance into clear goal chances .
villa and david silva came close several times to breaking the tense deadlock for spain while italy offered few attacking threats .
spain 's domination continued into extra time , with italy 's keeper buffon saving from villa and santi cazorla shooting wide .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : iker casillas saves one of the penalties in the shoot-out spain may have had their horrible record in penalty shoot-outs at the back of their minds but they did n't show it .
while the spanish slotted in four of their kicks , keeper iker casillas was the hero , saving penalties from daniel de rossi and antonio di natale to put spain in the semi-finals .
the shoot-out victory also ended spain 's june 22 penalty jinx .
on june 22 , 1986 , spain lost to belgium in a dramatic world cup quarter-final shoot-out , then against england in euro 1996 on the same june date 10 years later .
and it was on june 22 , 2002 that the spaniards lost to hosts south korea in the 2002 world cup quarters .
spain raise their game to dominate russia meeting russia again in the semi-final , spain knew that their opponents had grown in confidence since their thrashing in the first game .
the return of andrei arshavin had inspired russia against sweden in the game that sealed qualification and then again in the rampant display that knocked the dutch out in the quarter-final .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : spain turned on the style to overcome russia but spain were irrepressible and arshavin was eclipsed by substitute cesc fabregas , on for the injured david villa after only 30 minutes or so of play .
fabregas delivered a midfield masterclass , pulling the strings and conducting the play as spain ran out 3-0 winners .
germany may not have fancied playing the russians , with their unpredictably marauding style , but they may not be looking forward to facing a spain team just one game away from ending 44 trophy-less years of hurt . nick amies send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

critically acclaimed german film director wim wenders has been selected to head the jury at this year 's venice film festival . the venice festival organizers said in a statement that the 62-year-old wenders is one of the most innovative among contemporary filmmakers and has produced some of the most influential works of the past 40 years .
perhaps best known for his films " paris , texas " and " buena vista social club , " the german director 's own cinema career is tightly connected to venice .
" wim wenders has maintained strong ties with the -lrb- festival -rrb- over the years since his debut " in moviemaking , the festival organizers said .
strong ties to venice the veteran german director , who started as a film critic before he turned to directing in the 1970s , first appeared in venice in 1972 when he showed his second full-length feature film , " the goalkeeper 's fear of the penalty kick . "
a decade later venice awarded the filmmaker the festival 's top prize , the golden lion , for " the state of things " about a shoestring movie producer and his ragtag crew .
after the 1974 release of the first film in his road movie trilogy , " alice in the cities , " wenders showed the second part , " the wrong move " -lrb- 1975 -rrb- , at the cannes film festival .
the showing and the attention at the film festival helped launch his international career .
soon after the german director started filming in the united states , completing his movie trilogy with " kings of the road " -lrb- 1976 -rrb- and staying on to direct " the american friend " -lrb- 1977 -rrb- , an adaptation of the novel " ripley 's game " by patricia highsmith .

some have been seen carrying refrigerators down streets to make sure parties are fully stocked .
black , red and gold flags are everywhere . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the referee for the final of euro 2008 holds a match ball nearly half a million people watched the last game in the specially erected " fan mile " around the brandenburg gate in berlin alone , and the atmosphere will be more electric still on sunday if joachim loew 's team triumphs . according to a survey in the bild am sonntag weekely , 85 percent of the country 's 82 million population will follow the match , and for all practical purposes , the country will come to a stand-still . german automakers like daimler , volkswagen and audi plan to shut down production during the game so that their workers can follow the match before the conveyor belts and europe 's biggest economy grind back into action after the final whistle . only one in five german televisions were tuned into something else as almost 30 million viewers were glued to wednesday 's semi-final thriller against turkey , and sunday 's final was not expected to be any less of a crowd-puller . worries about ballack bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : these guys have got to be feeling the pressure despite their confidence , the country is sweating over the fact that powerhouse captain michael ballack might not take to the field after hurting his leg in training at the team 's base in southern switzerland . nevertheless , 72 percent believe their side will win the wunder von wien -lrb- the vienna miracle -rrb- , according to bild am sonntag 's poll . " ballack injured ! , " the top-selling paper 's front page screams .
" but we are going to win the cup anyway ! " only one in five took the more pessimistic view - including none other than finance minister peer steinbrueck who perhaps unwisely predicts a 3-1 hammering , the paper said .
eight percent were hedging their bets . leaders in attendance merkel herself , who was shown literally jumping for joy in basel when the winning goal against turkey hit the back of the net on wednesday , will watch the match in vienna along with president horst koehler and other ministers . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : angela merkel and national player bastian schweinsteiger merkel became a regular in the stands during the world cup .
she has even taken to giving the players some motherly advice , and after the turkey match gave an interview in the flash zone area usually reserved for players and managers . her spokesman had to keep the chancellor informed by text message of the score in the game against portugal while she was tied up with more serious matters at an eu summit on june 19 . " i am sure that our team is going to succeed , " president koehler said in a column in the top-selling bild newspaper on sunday .
" our opponent is strong ... but with the fire in their bellies the german team can beat them . " a parade has been organized in central berlin for monday for the players - even if they lose - and the city authorities have asked schools to give pupils the afternoon off so they can attend . " it is very important for us that the team will be greeted by its supporters back in germany .

on the streets of berlin , preparations for the final match were in full swing . from chancellor angela merkel downwards , germans will be cheering on " schweini , " " poldi " and their teammates in a nation now much more comfortable with being patriotic ever since the 2006 world cup was held on home soil . in towns and cities across the country , hundreds of thousands were expected at public viewing areas to watch the match beamed in from vienna from 20:45 local time onto huge screens and tens of millions will be glued to their tvs at home . on the streets of the capital , people are gathering in beer gardens hours before the game where they 'll follow the action on large-screen televisions .
some have been seen carrying refrigerators down streets to make sure parties are fully stocked .
black , red and gold flags are everywhere . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the referee for the final of euro 2008 holds a match ball nearly half a million people watched the last game in the specially erected " fan mile " around the brandenburg gate in berlin alone , and the atmosphere will be more electric still on sunday if joachim loew 's team triumphs . according to a survey in the bild am sonntag weekely , 85 percent of the country 's 82 million population will follow the match , and for all practical purposes , the country will come to a stand-still . german automakers like daimler , volkswagen and audi plan to shut down production during the game so that their workers can follow the match before the conveyor belts and europe 's biggest economy grind back into action after the final whistle . only one in five german televisions were tuned into something else as almost 30 million viewers were glued to wednesday 's semi-final thriller against turkey , and sunday 's final was not expected to be any less of a crowd-puller . worries about ballack bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : these guys have got to be feeling the pressure despite their confidence , the country is sweating over the fact that powerhouse captain michael ballack might not take to the field after hurting his leg in training at the team 's base in southern switzerland . nevertheless , 72 percent believe their side will win the wunder von wien -lrb- the vienna miracle -rrb- , according to bild am sonntag 's poll . " ballack injured ! , " the top-selling paper 's front page screams .
" but we are going to win the cup anyway ! " only one in five took the more pessimistic view - including none other than finance minister peer steinbrueck who perhaps unwisely predicts a 3-1 hammering , the paper said .
eight percent were hedging their bets . leaders in attendance merkel herself , who was shown literally jumping for joy in basel when the winning goal against turkey hit the back of the net on wednesday , will watch the match in vienna along with president horst koehler and other ministers . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : angela merkel and national player bastian schweinsteiger merkel became a regular in the stands during the world cup .
she has even taken to giving the players some motherly advice , and after the turkey match gave an interview in the flash zone area usually reserved for players and managers . her spokesman had to keep the chancellor informed by text message of the score in the game against portugal while she was tied up with more serious matters at an eu summit on june 19 . " i am sure that our team is going to succeed , " president koehler said in a column in the top-selling bild newspaper on sunday .
" our opponent is strong ... but with the fire in their bellies the german team can beat them . " a parade has been organized in central berlin for monday for the players - even if they lose - and the city authorities have asked schools to give pupils the afternoon off so they can attend . " it is very important for us that the team will be greeted by its supporters back in germany .
berlin has become like a second home to us since the 2006 world cup , " loew said . dw staff -lrb- jam -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" i know spain has a lot of respect for us , " defender christoph metzelder , who earns his money at spanish champions real madrid , told a final news conference in tenero . " they have a lot of quality but this is a final .
there you need special qualities and we have some of them . " germany is the most successful team in euro history with three titles and two further finals .
spain , by contrast , won way back in 1964 and had not gone beyond the quarters since 1984 . metzelder praised spain 's consistency in the tournament and team manager oliver bierhoff named them light favorites . but the germans say they have good reason for optimism as well . a mixture of their proverbial luck and the determination never to give up saw them win 3-2 against turkey in the semi-finals although they played below par on wednesday . six days earlier germany had a classy performance in a 3-2 quarter-final win over portugal . germany face similar challenge to portugal quarter-final bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : xavi hernandez is a key player in spain 's midfield the german camp expects a very similar game to the portugal tie on sunday and is set to pack the midfield to deny xavi hernandez , andres iniesta in the same way it did with deco , cristiano ronaldo and company . " we must fight back as a team , not allow them into the game .

" i know spain has a lot of respect for us , " defender christoph metzelder , who earns his money at spanish champions real madrid , told a final news conference in tenero . " they have a lot of quality but this is a final .
there you need special qualities and we have some of them . " germany is the most successful team in euro history with three titles and two further finals .
spain , by contrast , won way back in 1964 and had not gone beyond the quarters since 1984 . metzelder praised spain 's consistency in the tournament and team manager oliver bierhoff named them light favorites . but the germans say they have good reason for optimism as well . a mixture of their proverbial luck and the determination never to give up saw them win 3-2 against turkey in the semi-finals although they played below par on wednesday . six days earlier germany had a classy performance in a 3-2 quarter-final win over portugal . germany face similar challenge to portugal quarter-final bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : xavi hernandez is a key player in spain 's midfield the german camp expects a very similar game to the portugal tie on sunday and is set to pack the midfield to deny xavi hernandez , andres iniesta in the same way it did with deco , cristiano ronaldo and company . " we must fight back as a team , not allow them into the game .
the spaniards do n't like it if we fight back aggressively .
we must try that and then play our own game , " said frings . bierhoff , who scored both goals when germany won the euro 1996 title against the czech republic , agreed : " you can not give them space - we must be close to them like against portugal . " the best news for germany is that frings has overcome his cracked rib and is expected to play as a starter in place of simon rolfes , although coach joachim loew is yet to announce the lineup . frings joins a midfield which also includes captain michael ballack , bastian schweinsteiger , thomas hitzlsperger and possibly also lukas podolski as against portugal and turkey - unless he is moved forward again to partner miroslav klose . " i feel really well , hardly have any problems .
i am surprised how well it went , " frings said in reference to have played the second half against turkey when rolfes got injured . " a coach frings would definitely field the player frings because i showed it does n't hamper me . " bierhoff and the players named the final a unique experience in which the team would not let itself and the country down . germans focused on chance of a lifetime bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : real madrid 's metzelder , pictured here center and without his current beard , is germany 's insider " you realize the tension is there .
it is a big match for a title , the team is very focused .
you do n't get many chances to play for a title , " said metzelder , the only expected starter who was also on the pitch when germany lost the 2002 world cup final to brazil . " we are competitive on sunday .
we can become european champions . " bierhoff said : " the motivation for the final is high .
it is important to have courage .
the players must show heart and give it all they have .
we demand concentration and dedication , the rest you ca n't influence . " looking ahead at a presentation before the german fans on monday in berlin , frings said the team did not want to meet the supporters empty-handed like in 2006 when germany came in third at the world cup . " this time we want to hold something in the air .
something was missing in 2006 .
this time we want to show more than a t-shirt saying ' thank you , " ' frings said . german team to celebrate with fans - win or lose the german team will come to berlin on monday to celebrate with the fans - regardless if they win or lose the euro 2008 final with spain . " it is very important to have the team celebrated in germany , " oliver bierhoff said on friday . jogi loew , captain michael ballack and the rest of the team are expected to arrive in the early afternoon on monday from vienna , where sunday 's final takes place . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany will be met by a huge crowd - even on a work day the presentation takes place at the fan zone in front of the brandenburg gate , where 500,000 people had gathered on wednesday to watch germany 's semi-final win over turkey .
a similar sized crowd is expected to watch the final there . germany also chose the berlin fan area to celebrate its third- place finish at the 2006 home world cup , then drawing 1.5 million people .
the euro fan zone is smaller than the one from the world cup . bierhoff said : " we know it ’ s a work day but we hope that employers and schools will allow us to have a big crowd . " bierhoff said that the dfb will also stage various events for fans at an international match later this year . dw staff / dpa news agency -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the legendary formula one race course , nicknamed the green hell , is to be turned into a year-round leisure center . located 90 kilometers southwest of cologne in the heart of the eifel national park , the nürburgring has seen a lot in its 80 years : daredevil drivers , jubilant winners and too many dead . the track 's history includes more than 100 races and tragic crashes - like the fiery wreck at the 1976 grand prix , from which driver niki lauda barely escaped . now , however , the race course is quiet ; scaffolding covers the track 's start and finish lines and the main grandstands . in a major facelift meant to bring more life to the area , the track is being repurposed as a year-round leisure and business center with a promenade , an arena for small events , a convention center and a new grandstand .
four-star and a three-star hotels are entering the fray , along with a series of bungalows that will add up to 1,000 beds to the area . the nürburgring corporation plans to invest 215 million euros by spring of next year , according to ceo walter kafitz . when the formula one returns bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " rock am ring " brings in more than two million visitors annually new grand prix racetracks in abu dhabi , shanghai and singapore are more lucrative for formula one boss bernie eccleston . that means that the nürburgring has felt it must dispel the myth that it is past its prime - one reason justifying the course be flipped on its head .

the legendary formula one race course , nicknamed the green hell , is to be turned into a year-round leisure center . located 90 kilometers southwest of cologne in the heart of the eifel national park , the nürburgring has seen a lot in its 80 years : daredevil drivers , jubilant winners and too many dead . the track 's history includes more than 100 races and tragic crashes - like the fiery wreck at the 1976 grand prix , from which driver niki lauda barely escaped . now , however , the race course is quiet ; scaffolding covers the track 's start and finish lines and the main grandstands . in a major facelift meant to bring more life to the area , the track is being repurposed as a year-round leisure and business center with a promenade , an arena for small events , a convention center and a new grandstand .
four-star and a three-star hotels are entering the fray , along with a series of bungalows that will add up to 1,000 beds to the area . the nürburgring corporation plans to invest 215 million euros by spring of next year , according to ceo walter kafitz . when the formula one returns bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " rock am ring " brings in more than two million visitors annually new grand prix racetracks in abu dhabi , shanghai and singapore are more lucrative for formula one boss bernie eccleston . that means that the nürburgring has felt it must dispel the myth that it is past its prime - one reason justifying the course be flipped on its head . " when we talk about nürburgring 2009 , we 're also talking about the subsequent growth and development of the area , " said kafitz . after the renovation , the racetrack expects around 2 million per year , including the number of people coming to the world superbike championships and europe 's largest rock festival , the " rock am ring . " " new growth has to come from outside , " said kafitz .
" of course , we want to increase the interest in motorsports .
but we also do n't want to be dependent on motorsports .
we have to open up our offerings to bring people to the area from january to december . " while over half of the investments came from private investors , the " nürburgring 2009 " project is not without its critics .
some complain that the company is 90 percent owned by the state of rhineland palatinate , and they have doubts about whether their tax dollars are being put to good use . but kafitz says the ring is a business engine driving the region . according to information provided by the company , the track has invested about 100 million euros over the last 15 years in the modernization of the track and pits without considerable public support .
they say they have created 40 new jobs and promise to bring an additional 500 jobs to the region in the next two years . where managers can satisfy their need for speed bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : operators hope an 18-hole golf course will draw more tourists once construction is complete , more than half a million additional visitors are expected in the eifel each year .
at present , turnover at the ring is approximately 50 million annually - a number expected to double . nürburgring operators also expect to increase profit through the new 18-hole golf course or high-octane cars rentals to satisfy visitors ' need for speed . for companies like xerox and the italian motorcycle manufacturer ducati , which sponsor motorsports at the track , the nürburgring is a lucrative address . " we have a hotel directly on the course .
you can see the racetrack directly from your hotel room - that 's an amazing experience , " said marketing manager albert brenner . and despite all the add-ons , such as golf , motorsports will remain front and center at the ring , says kafitz . " it 's our core , " he said .

the head of german engineering group siemens has confirmed that a major restructuring is in the works , after media reports said the firm wanted to lay off 17,000 workers . referring to the state of the world economy and the rising oil price , siemens chief executive peter loescher said it was time for germany 's biggest engineering company to act .
" we have to batten down the hatches , " before siemens caves in under the pressure , the ceo said .
in the comments which are set to be published in full on monday , loescher said siemens needed to reach a target saving of 1.2 billion euros -lrb- 1.9 billion dollars -rrb- by 2010 to remain competitive .
job cuts imminent over the weekend reports were leaked that siemens planned to cut more than 17,000 jobs from its 400,000 global workforce , including some 6,450 jobs in germany .
the amount - nearly four percent of the workforce - was considerably more than the 10,000 anticipated by trade union ig metall as part of a broad revamp of the company 's operations .
the scale of the cuts , which are expected to mainly affect administrative positions , is unprecedented in the 160-year history of the german company .
according to the sueddeutsche zeitung , the german cuts would be spread over two years and are due to be announced officially in the fall .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : peter löscher took over as ceo in 2007 in a letter to the employees , loescher called the restructuring plans the most " extensive in the last 20 years . "
he added that he hoped the job cuts would be as " socially acceptable as possible . "
siemens , which manufactures everything from hearing aids to nuclear power stations and trains in some 190 countries , posted worldwide sales last year of more than 70 billion euros .
but after problems with a range of major projects were uncovered in the early part of the year , the company has been struggling for ways to reform and streamline its production .
peter loescher took the helm of the company in 2007 after allegations of bribery on a huge scale forced the resignation of his predecessor klaus kleinfeld and the chairman of the board heinrich von pierer . dw staff -lrb- ktz -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

critically acclaimed german film director wim wenders has been selected to head the jury at this year 's venice film festival . the venice festival organizers said in a statement that the 62-year-old wenders is one of the most innovative among contemporary filmmakers and has produced some of the most influential works of the past 40 years .
perhaps best known for his films " paris , texas " and " buena vista social club , " the german director 's own cinema career is tightly connected to venice .
" wim wenders has maintained strong ties with the -lrb- festival -rrb- over the years since his debut " in moviemaking , the festival organizers said .
strong ties to venice the veteran german director , who started as a film critic before he turned to directing in the 1970s , first appeared in venice in 1972 when he showed his second full-length feature film , " the goalkeeper 's fear of the penalty kick . "
a decade later venice awarded the filmmaker the festival 's top prize , the golden lion , for " the state of things " about a shoestring movie producer and his ragtag crew .
after the 1974 release of the first film in his road movie trilogy , " alice in the cities , " wenders showed the second part , " the wrong move " -lrb- 1975 -rrb- , at the cannes film festival .
the showing and the attention at the film festival helped launch his international career .
soon after the german director started filming in the united states , completing his movie trilogy with " kings of the road " -lrb- 1976 -rrb- and staying on to direct " the american friend " -lrb- 1977 -rrb- , an adaptation of the novel " ripley 's game " by patricia highsmith .
international accolades bildunterschrift : the guardian angels damiel -lrb- bruno ganz -rrb- and cassiel -lrb- otto sander -rrb- are invisible to everyone but children .
in 1984 wenders won the golden palm in cannes for " paris , texas , " and in 1987 he received the award for best director for his film " wings of desire . "
the director continued making fictional films through the 1990s , as well as the highly acclaimed documentary " buena vista social club " -lrb- 1999 -rrb- , a vibrant tribute to cuban music .
in 2000 his " million dollar hotel " won the silver bear jury prize at the berlin film festival .

robert mugabe was sworn in for a new term as president of zimbabwe on sunday while the international community widely condemned the vote .
in europe , officials urged africa to play a bigger role in ending the crisis . official results released on sunday showed mugabe overwhelmingly won the country 's one-man election .
zimbabwe election officials said he received more than two million votes or about 85 percent of the vote .
opposition leader morgan tsvangirai , who pulled out of the election amid mounting violence against his supports , received about 230,000 votes .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a zimbabwean voter gets her finger dipped in purple dye to show she has voted and unable to vote again turnout for the june 27 election was put at 42 percent .
but reports have circulated that many zimbabweans were coerced into voting and that mugabe militias had applied scare tactics to anyone without the tell-tale purple fingertip proving a person had voted .
europe calls vote a farce the vote was widely condemned around the world .
german foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier denounced the election as a farce considering mugabe was the only candidate .
in a statement issued after friday 's vote , steinmeier said that germany welcomed the fact that the united nations security council was planning to discuss possible action against mugabe 's regime in the coming week .
many western leaders have urged the african union to take action at a summit in egypt on june 30 that was expected to focus on the zimbabwe election crisis . british prime minister gordon brown said the african union and the international community must work together to help bring stability to zimbabwe .
the united states has called for drawing up sanctions against zimbabwe .
the european union has said it will not rule out sanctions against " those responsible for the tragic events of recent months . "

he has also said the opposition will never come to power as long as he is alive , vowing to fight to ensure it does not happen .
the zimbabwe opposition and western critics have said mugabe is a dictator who has ruined a once prosperous country .
they have sharply criticized him for applying suppression and violence against opposition supporters .
little support in africa bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : south africans demonstrate against election related violence in zimbabwe in johannesburg no african heads of state were present for the inauguration of mugabe 's sixth five-year term as president june 29 .
the head of the pan-african parliament mission told a news conference sunday that the vote was neither free nor fair and fresh polls should be held .
kenyan prime minister raila odinga , among the zimbabwean leader 's most vocal critics on the continent , called on the african union to send troops into zimbabwe and labelled mugabe " a shame to africa " .
mugabe is africa 's oldest head of state and has ruled the former british colony uninterrupted since gaining independence from britain in 1980 . dw staff -lrb- ktz -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

luis aragones ' young side are hoping emulate that feat in vienna on sunday , june 29 , against germany . for a team which has become notorious for losing its bottle at the business end of tournaments and flattering to deceive on a consistent basis , spain move into their first major final in 24 years full of confidence while playing the kind of soccer they normally only reserve for the early rounds .
since they took to the field in paris to contest the 1984 european championship title against hosts france , spain have turned up for tournaments with squads full of the world 's biggest stars and the continent 's most talented players but have failed to make the latter stages .
many huge names from spanish soccer have graced the world cup and european championship stages in the shirt of the furia roja - and have shown their worth for about three games before meekly surrendering when things got serious .
normally it 's the quarter-final stage .
such has been the regularity that the spanish bow out at this stage , that it has become a bit of a mental block , if not a downright curse .
this year however , despite the fact that they were facing world champions italy at this stage , spain overcame both the italians and the psychological barrier to make it to the semis .
before earning themselves a place against italy , luis aragones ' team played their way through group d with skill and panache .
their opening game , a 4-1 thrashing of russia , got everyone believing again , while harboring all those memories of false dawns and premature celebrations .
opening game sends impressive message bildunterschrift : david villa opened his account with a hat trick against russia and got the ball rolling russia were supposed to be a new force , one with an attacking vision that could have overcome a sometimes ponderous spanish defense .
but not only did the rear guard hold firm , the spearhead proved deadly .
a david villa hat trick and a cameo goal from substitute cesc fabregas showed the world that spain had a rod of steel running from back to front , with a very sharp point at its attacking end .
the edge looked a little blunt when spain came up against the swedes in their second group match .
fernando torres got his first goal of the tournament , only to see it cancelled by zlatan ibrahimovic .
the game looked to be heading for a disappointing draw - which no doubt would have prompted questions about spain 's true quality - when that man villa popped up again to net a last gasp winner in the second minute of stoppage time .
with qualification assured , spain then finished off their group stage with a 2-1 win over already eliminated champions greece , with aragones fielding his reserves in a routine win .
spain had to come from behind to grab the points , with goals from reuben de la red and daniel guiza .
it was far from a classy performance but one which showed that spain could dig deep and regain the advantage even without a host of first-teamers on the pitch .
omens gather for quarter-final against italy then came italy .
spain had n't beaten the italians in a competitive match since a 2-0 win at the 1920 olympic games in belgium some 88 years ago .
there was also a certain amount of animosity bubbling under the surface , if the spanish press could be believed .
spain , it was claimed , were looking for revenge for the assault by mario tassotti on luis enrique which went unpunished in the quarter-final of the 1994 world cup in the united states , a match spain lost 2-1 .
whatever the motivation , spain dominated possession throughout regulation time but failed to translate their dominance into clear goal chances .
villa and david silva came close several times to breaking the tense deadlock for spain while italy offered few attacking threats .
spain 's domination continued into extra time , with italy 's keeper buffon saving from villa and santi cazorla shooting wide .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : iker casillas saves one of the penalties in the shoot-out spain may have had their horrible record in penalty shoot-outs at the back of their minds but they did n't show it .
while the spanish slotted in four of their kicks , keeper iker casillas was the hero , saving penalties from daniel de rossi and antonio di natale to put spain in the semi-finals .
the shoot-out victory also ended spain 's june 22 penalty jinx .
on june 22 , 1986 , spain lost to belgium in a dramatic world cup quarter-final shoot-out , then against england in euro 1996 on the same june date 10 years later .
and it was on june 22 , 2002 that the spaniards lost to hosts south korea in the 2002 world cup quarters .
spain raise their game to dominate russia meeting russia again in the semi-final , spain knew that their opponents had grown in confidence since their thrashing in the first game .
the return of andrei arshavin had inspired russia against sweden in the game that sealed qualification and then again in the rampant display that knocked the dutch out in the quarter-final .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : spain turned on the style to overcome russia but spain were irrepressible and arshavin was eclipsed by substitute cesc fabregas , on for the injured david villa after only 30 minutes or so of play .
fabregas delivered a midfield masterclass , pulling the strings and conducting the play as spain ran out 3-0 winners .
germany may not have fancied playing the russians , with their unpredictably marauding style , but they may not be looking forward to facing a spain team just one game away from ending 44 trophy-less years of hurt . nick amies send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" ballack injured ! , " the top-selling paper 's front page screams .

luis aragones ' young side are hoping emulate that feat in vienna on sunday , june 29 , against germany . for a team which has become notorious for losing its bottle at the business end of tournaments and flattering to deceive on a consistent basis , spain move into their first major final in 24 years full of confidence while playing the kind of soccer they normally only reserve for the early rounds .
since they took to the field in paris to contest the 1984 european championship title against hosts france , spain have turned up for tournaments with squads full of the world 's biggest stars and the continent 's most talented players but have failed to make the latter stages .
many huge names from spanish soccer have graced the world cup and european championship stages in the shirt of the furia roja - and have shown their worth for about three games before meekly surrendering when things got serious .
normally it 's the quarter-final stage .
such has been the regularity that the spanish bow out at this stage , that it has become a bit of a mental block , if not a downright curse .
this year however , despite the fact that they were facing world champions italy at this stage , spain overcame both the italians and the psychological barrier to make it to the semis .
before earning themselves a place against italy , luis aragones ' team played their way through group d with skill and panache .
their opening game , a 4-1 thrashing of russia , got everyone believing again , while harboring all those memories of false dawns and premature celebrations .
opening game sends impressive message bildunterschrift : david villa opened his account with a hat trick against russia and got the ball rolling russia were supposed to be a new force , one with an attacking vision that could have overcome a sometimes ponderous spanish defense .
but not only did the rear guard hold firm , the spearhead proved deadly .
a david villa hat trick and a cameo goal from substitute cesc fabregas showed the world that spain had a rod of steel running from back to front , with a very sharp point at its attacking end .
the edge looked a little blunt when spain came up against the swedes in their second group match .
fernando torres got his first goal of the tournament , only to see it cancelled by zlatan ibrahimovic .
the game looked to be heading for a disappointing draw - which no doubt would have prompted questions about spain 's true quality - when that man villa popped up again to net a last gasp winner in the second minute of stoppage time .
with qualification assured , spain then finished off their group stage with a 2-1 win over already eliminated champions greece , with aragones fielding his reserves in a routine win .
spain had to come from behind to grab the points , with goals from reuben de la red and daniel guiza .
it was far from a classy performance but one which showed that spain could dig deep and regain the advantage even without a host of first-teamers on the pitch .
omens gather for quarter-final against italy then came italy .
spain had n't beaten the italians in a competitive match since a 2-0 win at the 1920 olympic games in belgium some 88 years ago .
there was also a certain amount of animosity bubbling under the surface , if the spanish press could be believed .
spain , it was claimed , were looking for revenge for the assault by mario tassotti on luis enrique which went unpunished in the quarter-final of the 1994 world cup in the united states , a match spain lost 2-1 .
whatever the motivation , spain dominated possession throughout regulation time but failed to translate their dominance into clear goal chances .
villa and david silva came close several times to breaking the tense deadlock for spain while italy offered few attacking threats .
spain 's domination continued into extra time , with italy 's keeper buffon saving from villa and santi cazorla shooting wide .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : iker casillas saves one of the penalties in the shoot-out spain may have had their horrible record in penalty shoot-outs at the back of their minds but they did n't show it .
while the spanish slotted in four of their kicks , keeper iker casillas was the hero , saving penalties from daniel de rossi and antonio di natale to put spain in the semi-finals .
the shoot-out victory also ended spain 's june 22 penalty jinx .
on june 22 , 1986 , spain lost to belgium in a dramatic world cup quarter-final shoot-out , then against england in euro 1996 on the same june date 10 years later .
and it was on june 22 , 2002 that the spaniards lost to hosts south korea in the 2002 world cup quarters .
spain raise their game to dominate russia meeting russia again in the semi-final , spain knew that their opponents had grown in confidence since their thrashing in the first game .
the return of andrei arshavin had inspired russia against sweden in the game that sealed qualification and then again in the rampant display that knocked the dutch out in the quarter-final .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : spain turned on the style to overcome russia but spain were irrepressible and arshavin was eclipsed by substitute cesc fabregas , on for the injured david villa after only 30 minutes or so of play .
fabregas delivered a midfield masterclass , pulling the strings and conducting the play as spain ran out 3-0 winners .

he has also said the opposition will never come to power as long as he is alive , vowing to fight to ensure it does not happen .
the zimbabwe opposition and western critics have said mugabe is a dictator who has ruined a once prosperous country .

kenyan prime minister raila odinga , among the zimbabwean leader 's most vocal critics on the continent , called on the african union to send troops into zimbabwe and labelled mugabe " a shame to africa " .

in a statement issued after friday 's vote , steinmeier said that germany welcomed the fact that the united nations security council was planning to discuss possible action against mugabe 's regime in the coming week .
many western leaders have urged the african union to take action at a summit in egypt on june 30 that was expected to focus on the zimbabwe election crisis . british prime minister gordon brown said the african union and the international community must work together to help bring stability to zimbabwe .
the united states has called for drawing up sanctions against zimbabwe .
the european union has said it will not rule out sanctions against " those responsible for the tragic events of recent months . "
history of defiance bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : residents of mbare line up to cast their vote in the country 's presidential election the 84-year-old veteran fighter disregarded the official results from the first-round election in march which put opposition leader morgan tsvangirai ahead . mugabe flaunted international criticism and pushed ahead with the vote , warning against outside interference in his country 's affairs and shrugging off tsvangirai 's claims of violence .
he has also said the opposition will never come to power as long as he is alive , vowing to fight to ensure it does not happen .
the zimbabwe opposition and western critics have said mugabe is a dictator who has ruined a once prosperous country .
they have sharply criticized him for applying suppression and violence against opposition supporters .

the head of the pan-african parliament mission told a news conference sunday that the vote was neither free nor fair and fresh polls should be held .
kenyan prime minister raila odinga , among the zimbabwean leader 's most vocal critics on the continent , called on the african union to send troops into zimbabwe and labelled mugabe " a shame to africa " .
mugabe is africa 's oldest head of state and has ruled the former british colony uninterrupted since gaining independence from britain in 1980 . dw staff -lrb- ktz -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the head of german engineering group siemens has confirmed that a major restructuring is in the works , after media reports said the firm wanted to lay off 17,000 workers . referring to the state of the world economy and the rising oil price , siemens chief executive peter loescher said it was time for germany 's biggest engineering company to act .
" we have to batten down the hatches , " before siemens caves in under the pressure , the ceo said .
in the comments which are set to be published in full on monday , loescher said siemens needed to reach a target saving of 1.2 billion euros -lrb- 1.9 billion dollars -rrb- by 2010 to remain competitive .
job cuts imminent over the weekend reports were leaked that siemens planned to cut more than 17,000 jobs from its 400,000 global workforce , including some 6,450 jobs in germany .
the amount - nearly four percent of the workforce - was considerably more than the 10,000 anticipated by trade union ig metall as part of a broad revamp of the company 's operations .
the scale of the cuts , which are expected to mainly affect administrative positions , is unprecedented in the 160-year history of the german company .
according to the sueddeutsche zeitung , the german cuts would be spread over two years and are due to be announced officially in the fall .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : peter löscher took over as ceo in 2007 in a letter to the employees , loescher called the restructuring plans the most " extensive in the last 20 years . "
he added that he hoped the job cuts would be as " socially acceptable as possible . "
siemens , which manufactures everything from hearing aids to nuclear power stations and trains in some 190 countries , posted worldwide sales last year of more than 70 billion euros .
but after problems with a range of major projects were uncovered in the early part of the year , the company has been struggling for ways to reform and streamline its production .

the head of german engineering group siemens has confirmed that a major restructuring is in the works , after media reports said the firm wanted to lay off 17,000 workers . referring to the state of the world economy and the rising oil price , siemens chief executive peter loescher said it was time for germany 's biggest engineering company to act .
" we have to batten down the hatches , " before siemens caves in under the pressure , the ceo said .
in the comments which are set to be published in full on monday , loescher said siemens needed to reach a target saving of 1.2 billion euros -lrb- 1.9 billion dollars -rrb- by 2010 to remain competitive .
job cuts imminent over the weekend reports were leaked that siemens planned to cut more than 17,000 jobs from its 400,000 global workforce , including some 6,450 jobs in germany .
the amount - nearly four percent of the workforce - was considerably more than the 10,000 anticipated by trade union ig metall as part of a broad revamp of the company 's operations .
the scale of the cuts , which are expected to mainly affect administrative positions , is unprecedented in the 160-year history of the german company .
according to the sueddeutsche zeitung , the german cuts would be spread over two years and are due to be announced officially in the fall .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : peter löscher took over as ceo in 2007 in a letter to the employees , loescher called the restructuring plans the most " extensive in the last 20 years . "
he added that he hoped the job cuts would be as " socially acceptable as possible . "
siemens , which manufactures everything from hearing aids to nuclear power stations and trains in some 190 countries , posted worldwide sales last year of more than 70 billion euros .
but after problems with a range of major projects were uncovered in the early part of the year , the company has been struggling for ways to reform and streamline its production .
peter loescher took the helm of the company in 2007 after allegations of bribery on a huge scale forced the resignation of his predecessor klaus kleinfeld and the chairman of the board heinrich von pierer . dw staff -lrb- ktz -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

robert mugabe was sworn in for a new term as president of zimbabwe on sunday while the international community widely condemned the vote .
in europe , officials urged africa to play a bigger role in ending the crisis . official results released on sunday showed mugabe overwhelmingly won the country 's one-man election .
zimbabwe election officials said he received more than two million votes or about 85 percent of the vote .
opposition leader morgan tsvangirai , who pulled out of the election amid mounting violence against his supports , received about 230,000 votes .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a zimbabwean voter gets her finger dipped in purple dye to show she has voted and unable to vote again turnout for the june 27 election was put at 42 percent .
but reports have circulated that many zimbabweans were coerced into voting and that mugabe militias had applied scare tactics to anyone without the tell-tale purple fingertip proving a person had voted .
europe calls vote a farce the vote was widely condemned around the world .
german foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier denounced the election as a farce considering mugabe was the only candidate .
in a statement issued after friday 's vote , steinmeier said that germany welcomed the fact that the united nations security council was planning to discuss possible action against mugabe 's regime in the coming week .
many western leaders have urged the african union to take action at a summit in egypt on june 30 that was expected to focus on the zimbabwe election crisis . british prime minister gordon brown said the african union and the international community must work together to help bring stability to zimbabwe .
the united states has called for drawing up sanctions against zimbabwe .
the european union has said it will not rule out sanctions against " those responsible for the tragic events of recent months . "
history of defiance bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : residents of mbare line up to cast their vote in the country 's presidential election the 84-year-old veteran fighter disregarded the official results from the first-round election in march which put opposition leader morgan tsvangirai ahead . mugabe flaunted international criticism and pushed ahead with the vote , warning against outside interference in his country 's affairs and shrugging off tsvangirai 's claims of violence .
he has also said the opposition will never come to power as long as he is alive , vowing to fight to ensure it does not happen .
the zimbabwe opposition and western critics have said mugabe is a dictator who has ruined a once prosperous country .
they have sharply criticized him for applying suppression and violence against opposition supporters .
little support in africa bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : south africans demonstrate against election related violence in zimbabwe in johannesburg no african heads of state were present for the inauguration of mugabe 's sixth five-year term as president june 29 .
the head of the pan-african parliament mission told a news conference sunday that the vote was neither free nor fair and fresh polls should be held .
kenyan prime minister raila odinga , among the zimbabwean leader 's most vocal critics on the continent , called on the african union to send troops into zimbabwe and labelled mugabe " a shame to africa " .
mugabe is africa 's oldest head of state and has ruled the former british colony uninterrupted since gaining independence from britain in 1980 . dw staff -lrb- ktz -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

fernando torres scored the single goal in the intense match , which brought many german fans to tears . spain won their second european title in fine style on sunday , deservedly beating a weak germany 1-0 in vienna , on a goal from fernando torres . the handsome win culminates a stunning euro 2008 for spain , who have won five games and drawn one , scoring 12 goals and conceding just three since the european championships kicked off on june 7 in switzerland . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the spanish team in victory pose after beating germany .
sunday 's win was spain 's first international triumph since 1964 , when the european nations cup , as it was called then , was much less important than it is today . curiously , this was the first game in which spain - preferring an intelligent counter-attacking strategy - did not dominate possession from the beginning . luis aragones ' young team only had 48 percent ball possession , but nonetheless created countless chances and should have scored more goals . germany tired and frustrated germany , in contrast , failed to create a single clear chance and were clearly outclassed .
true to tradition , however , they battled until the bitter end , despite their fatigue , frustration and injuries . joachim loew 's team made an aggressive start , determined not to let spain dominate , but then the germans lacked the craft to create clear chances . spain slowly but surely got their act together and almost went ahead in the 14th minute , when german keeper jens lehmann had to keep out a deflection from defender christoph metzelder . nine minutes later torres headed a sergio ramos centre against lehmann 's post . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : fernando torres celebrates after scoring the winning goal torres scores single goal the only goal came in the 33rd minute .
the majestic xavi hernandez played a tempting through ball for torres , who powered his way past philipp lahm and beat the lehmann with a clever chip . germany adopted a more direct approach in the second half , but with captain michael ballack not looking a hundred percent fit - and with striker lukas podolski and miroslav klose well marked and philipp lahm out with an injury - they were running more on hope than expectation . viva espana ! bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : spanish supporters cheer in plaza de colon in madrid , sunday june 29 , 2008 thousands of ecstatic spanish fans danced and chanted " viva espana " in central madrid as the country 's first major international football trophy in 44 years sparked a nationwide fiesta . the capital was awash with the red and gold national colours , as the country celebrated the euro victory in true spanish style .

the head of german engineering group siemens has confirmed that a major restructuring is in the works , after media reports said the firm wanted to lay off 17,000 workers . referring to the state of the world economy and the rising oil price , siemens chief executive peter loescher said it was time for germany 's biggest engineering company to act .
" we have to batten down the hatches , " before siemens caves in under the pressure , the ceo said .
in the comments which are set to be published in full on monday , loescher said siemens needed to reach a target saving of 1.2 billion euros -lrb- 1.9 billion dollars -rrb- by 2010 to remain competitive .
job cuts imminent over the weekend reports were leaked that siemens planned to cut more than 17,000 jobs from its 400,000 global workforce , including some 6,450 jobs in germany .
the amount - nearly four percent of the workforce - was considerably more than the 10,000 anticipated by trade union ig metall as part of a broad revamp of the company 's operations .
the scale of the cuts , which are expected to mainly affect administrative positions , is unprecedented in the 160-year history of the german company .
according to the sueddeutsche zeitung , the german cuts would be spread over two years and are due to be announced officially in the fall .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : peter löscher took over as ceo in 2007 in a letter to the employees , loescher called the restructuring plans the most " extensive in the last 20 years . "
he added that he hoped the job cuts would be as " socially acceptable as possible . "
siemens , which manufactures everything from hearing aids to nuclear power stations and trains in some 190 countries , posted worldwide sales last year of more than 70 billion euros .
but after problems with a range of major projects were uncovered in the early part of the year , the company has been struggling for ways to reform and streamline its production .
peter loescher took the helm of the company in 2007 after allegations of bribery on a huge scale forced the resignation of his predecessor klaus kleinfeld and the chairman of the board heinrich von pierer . dw staff -lrb- ktz -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?
dw-world.de siemens mulls plans to cut 15,000 jobs german electronics giant siemens is weighing plans to slash up to 15,000 white-collar jobs in a bid to cut administrative costs , a newspaper report said as ceo peter loescher vowed to avoid forced redundancies .

fernando torres scored the single goal in the intense match , which brought many german fans to tears . spain won their second european title in fine style on sunday , deservedly beating a weak germany 1-0 in vienna , on a goal from fernando torres . the handsome win culminates a stunning euro 2008 for spain , who have won five games and drawn one , scoring 12 goals and conceding just three since the european championships kicked off on june 7 in switzerland . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the spanish team in victory pose after beating germany .
sunday 's win was spain 's first international triumph since 1964 , when the european nations cup , as it was called then , was much less important than it is today . curiously , this was the first game in which spain - preferring an intelligent counter-attacking strategy - did not dominate possession from the beginning . luis aragones ' young team only had 48 percent ball possession , but nonetheless created countless chances and should have scored more goals . germany tired and frustrated germany , in contrast , failed to create a single clear chance and were clearly outclassed .
true to tradition , however , they battled until the bitter end , despite their fatigue , frustration and injuries . joachim loew 's team made an aggressive start , determined not to let spain dominate , but then the germans lacked the craft to create clear chances . spain slowly but surely got their act together and almost went ahead in the 14th minute , when german keeper jens lehmann had to keep out a deflection from defender christoph metzelder . nine minutes later torres headed a sergio ramos centre against lehmann 's post . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : fernando torres celebrates after scoring the winning goal torres scores single goal the only goal came in the 33rd minute .
the majestic xavi hernandez played a tempting through ball for torres , who powered his way past philipp lahm and beat the lehmann with a clever chip . germany adopted a more direct approach in the second half , but with captain michael ballack not looking a hundred percent fit - and with striker lukas podolski and miroslav klose well marked and philipp lahm out with an injury - they were running more on hope than expectation . viva espana ! bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : spanish supporters cheer in plaza de colon in madrid , sunday june 29 , 2008 thousands of ecstatic spanish fans danced and chanted " viva espana " in central madrid as the country 's first major international football trophy in 44 years sparked a nationwide fiesta . the capital was awash with the red and gold national colours , as the country celebrated the euro victory in true spanish style .
the deafening sounds of cheering , klaxons and drums from the vast plaza colon , where thousands watched the match live from vienna on giant television screens , mixed with those of car horns across the city . germany fans disappointed bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a german supporter reacts after the final match between spain and germany fans of germany 's soccer team were stunned into disbelief after their team lost to spain .
the disappointment was visible on the faces of thousands who gathered in public viewing areas and fan miles to watch the match on giant screens . yet despite the loss , and the second-place finish , germany supporters applauded spain 's victory and praised germany 's solid run . dw staff -lrb- ktz -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

luis aragones ' young side are hoping emulate that feat in vienna on sunday , june 29 , against germany . for a team which has become notorious for losing its bottle at the business end of tournaments and flattering to deceive on a consistent basis , spain move into their first major final in 24 years full of confidence while playing the kind of soccer they normally only reserve for the early rounds .
since they took to the field in paris to contest the 1984 european championship title against hosts france , spain have turned up for tournaments with squads full of the world 's biggest stars and the continent 's most talented players but have failed to make the latter stages .
many huge names from spanish soccer have graced the world cup and european championship stages in the shirt of the furia roja - and have shown their worth for about three games before meekly surrendering when things got serious .
normally it 's the quarter-final stage .
such has been the regularity that the spanish bow out at this stage , that it has become a bit of a mental block , if not a downright curse .
this year however , despite the fact that they were facing world champions italy at this stage , spain overcame both the italians and the psychological barrier to make it to the semis .
before earning themselves a place against italy , luis aragones ' team played their way through group d with skill and panache .
their opening game , a 4-1 thrashing of russia , got everyone believing again , while harboring all those memories of false dawns and premature celebrations .
opening game sends impressive message bildunterschrift : david villa opened his account with a hat trick against russia and got the ball rolling russia were supposed to be a new force , one with an attacking vision that could have overcome a sometimes ponderous spanish defense .
but not only did the rear guard hold firm , the spearhead proved deadly .
a david villa hat trick and a cameo goal from substitute cesc fabregas showed the world that spain had a rod of steel running from back to front , with a very sharp point at its attacking end .
the edge looked a little blunt when spain came up against the swedes in their second group match .
fernando torres got his first goal of the tournament , only to see it cancelled by zlatan ibrahimovic .
the game looked to be heading for a disappointing draw - which no doubt would have prompted questions about spain 's true quality - when that man villa popped up again to net a last gasp winner in the second minute of stoppage time .
with qualification assured , spain then finished off their group stage with a 2-1 win over already eliminated champions greece , with aragones fielding his reserves in a routine win .
spain had to come from behind to grab the points , with goals from reuben de la red and daniel guiza .
it was far from a classy performance but one which showed that spain could dig deep and regain the advantage even without a host of first-teamers on the pitch .
omens gather for quarter-final against italy then came italy .
spain had n't beaten the italians in a competitive match since a 2-0 win at the 1920 olympic games in belgium some 88 years ago .
there was also a certain amount of animosity bubbling under the surface , if the spanish press could be believed .
spain , it was claimed , were looking for revenge for the assault by mario tassotti on luis enrique which went unpunished in the quarter-final of the 1994 world cup in the united states , a match spain lost 2-1 .
whatever the motivation , spain dominated possession throughout regulation time but failed to translate their dominance into clear goal chances .
villa and david silva came close several times to breaking the tense deadlock for spain while italy offered few attacking threats .
spain 's domination continued into extra time , with italy 's keeper buffon saving from villa and santi cazorla shooting wide .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : iker casillas saves one of the penalties in the shoot-out spain may have had their horrible record in penalty shoot-outs at the back of their minds but they did n't show it .
while the spanish slotted in four of their kicks , keeper iker casillas was the hero , saving penalties from daniel de rossi and antonio di natale to put spain in the semi-finals .
the shoot-out victory also ended spain 's june 22 penalty jinx .
on june 22 , 1986 , spain lost to belgium in a dramatic world cup quarter-final shoot-out , then against england in euro 1996 on the same june date 10 years later .
and it was on june 22 , 2002 that the spaniards lost to hosts south korea in the 2002 world cup quarters .
spain raise their game to dominate russia meeting russia again in the semi-final , spain knew that their opponents had grown in confidence since their thrashing in the first game .
the return of andrei arshavin had inspired russia against sweden in the game that sealed qualification and then again in the rampant display that knocked the dutch out in the quarter-final .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : spain turned on the style to overcome russia but spain were irrepressible and arshavin was eclipsed by substitute cesc fabregas , on for the injured david villa after only 30 minutes or so of play .
fabregas delivered a midfield masterclass , pulling the strings and conducting the play as spain ran out 3-0 winners .
germany may not have fancied playing the russians , with their unpredictably marauding style , but they may not be looking forward to facing a spain team just one game away from ending 44 trophy-less years of hurt . nick amies send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the head of german engineering group siemens has confirmed that a major restructuring is in the works , after media reports said the firm wanted to lay off 17,000 workers . referring to the state of the world economy and the rising oil price , siemens chief executive peter loescher said it was time for germany 's biggest engineering company to act .
" we have to batten down the hatches , " before siemens caves in under the pressure , the ceo said .
in the comments which are set to be published in full on monday , loescher said siemens needed to reach a target saving of 1.2 billion euros -lrb- 1.9 billion dollars -rrb- by 2010 to remain competitive .
job cuts imminent over the weekend reports were leaked that siemens planned to cut more than 17,000 jobs from its 400,000 global workforce , including some 6,450 jobs in germany .
the amount - nearly four percent of the workforce - was considerably more than the 10,000 anticipated by trade union ig metall as part of a broad revamp of the company 's operations .
the scale of the cuts , which are expected to mainly affect administrative positions , is unprecedented in the 160-year history of the german company .
according to the sueddeutsche zeitung , the german cuts would be spread over two years and are due to be announced officially in the fall .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : peter löscher took over as ceo in 2007 in a letter to the employees , loescher called the restructuring plans the most " extensive in the last 20 years . "
he added that he hoped the job cuts would be as " socially acceptable as possible . "
siemens , which manufactures everything from hearing aids to nuclear power stations and trains in some 190 countries , posted worldwide sales last year of more than 70 billion euros .
but after problems with a range of major projects were uncovered in the early part of the year , the company has been struggling for ways to reform and streamline its production .
peter loescher took the helm of the company in 2007 after allegations of bribery on a huge scale forced the resignation of his predecessor klaus kleinfeld and the chairman of the board heinrich von pierer . dw staff -lrb- ktz -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

earlier , officials said the count was complete , but later reports said results from rural areas were still trickling in .
in an interview for the bbc 's andrew marr programme , archbishop tutu said the african union could have a clear role in persuading mr mugabe to negotiate .
" if you were to have a unanimous voice , saying quite clearly to mr mugabe ... you are illegitimate and we will not recognise your administration in any shape or form - i think that would be a very , very powerful signal and would really strengthen the hand of the international community . "
" i think that a very good argument can be made for having an international force to restore peace , " he added .
african union -lrb- au -rrb- foreign ministers have gathered in the egyptian town of sharm el-sheikh , before a full meeting of heads of state on monday which mr mugabe is expected to attend .
