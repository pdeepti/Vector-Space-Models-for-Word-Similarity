but for pro-palestinian germans , as well as those who deal intensively with the middle east conflict , may 14 underscores the uniquely perilous tightrope walk germany must perform in its position toward those who have suffered under israeli occupation .
" there is no such thing as a german-palestinian relationship without the german-israeli relationship , " said rene wildangel , a historian and green party expert on the middle east .
" whether one thinks that 's good or bad , that 's the case right now .
if you look at german chancellor angela merkel 's recent trip to israel , she made it quite clear how close the german-israeli relationship is . "
merkel visited israel in march , when she became the first head of government to speak - in german - to the israeli parliament , the knesset .
but some people in germany , including palestinians residents , were upset that the chancellor did not raise the middle east conflict in her speech .
" there was a storm of outrage that went through the palestinian communities , " said erhard arendt , who runs the palaestina portal , germany 's largest internet forum for discussing palestinian affairs .
" hundreds of letters were written to newspapers , saying ' we did n't crop up in -lsb- the speech -rsb- at all .
we were totally forgotten . "
public opinion versus policy bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel 's speech to the knesset on march 18 drew praise and criticism the german government support for israel is , of course , programmed by germans ' sense of shame and guilt for the holocaust , as well as their desire to atone concretely for the horrors of the past .
but the german people are often far more sympathetic to palestinian plight and far more willing to criticize israel than their government .
" according to one survey , 63 percent of the populace does n't think israel 's policies are right , " arendt said .
germans ' empathy for the palestinians often originates in attempts to come to terms with their own past .
" without doubt , the fact that i was intensely interested in the holocaust led me to get involved in palestinian affairs , " said arendt , who was born in 1941 .
" that certainly strengthened the idea in me that nothing even remotely similar should be allowed to happen again - anywhere and at any time . "
germans ' attitudes differ from opinion poll to opinion poll , depending on which questions are asked .
but certain hot-button issues perennially elicit german opposition to israeli government policies .
" there 's the occupation and the very difficult situation in gaza , as we 've seen in the past few months , " wildangel said .
" it 's a humanitarian problem connected to the israeli blockade in which the eu is also involved .
i think that topics like this , or the building israeli settlements in the west bank , makes germans feel that they have to voice criticism . "

because it viewed nazism as a product of western capitalism , communist east germany took no responsibility for the holocaust .
it was openly hostile to israel and at least nominally supportive of palestinians ' desire for a state of their own .
and in the 1970s , the anti-imperialist terrorist group raf in west germany and palestinian militants also identified closely with one another .
most spectacularly , members of a group called " the popular front for the liberation of palestine " hijacked a lufthansa plane in 1977 , demanding among other things the release of raf terrorists from prison .
german special forces successfully stormed the plane at mogadishu airport , killing the hijackers .
such incidents shocked mainstream germans and their government .
" i do n't think that this course of action was very useful to the palestinians , " wildangel said .
" i see it as an extreme , and ultimately marginal , chapter in the history of german-palestinian relations . "
faint prospects for change bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the eu may be the best hope for easing german-palestinian relations there is little chance that germany will decrease the support , financial or military , it offers to israel - although german palestinian advocates continue to argue that the country has a responsibility to do precisely that .
" we should be criticizing , making demands and taking action , " arendt said .
" providing weapons to a crisis region violates every international agreement there is , yet weapons are delivered to israel , including armored scout cars , that are used to kill palestinians . "

" i think the palestinians have to recognize what the relationship between germany and israel is and acknowledge that the past happened , " wildangel said .

but for pro-palestinian germans , as well as those who deal intensively with the middle east conflict , may 14 underscores the uniquely perilous tightrope walk germany must perform in its position toward those who have suffered under israeli occupation .
" there is no such thing as a german-palestinian relationship without the german-israeli relationship , " said rene wildangel , a historian and green party expert on the middle east .
" whether one thinks that 's good or bad , that 's the case right now .
if you look at german chancellor angela merkel 's recent trip to israel , she made it quite clear how close the german-israeli relationship is . "
merkel visited israel in march , when she became the first head of government to speak - in german - to the israeli parliament , the knesset .
but some people in germany , including palestinians residents , were upset that the chancellor did not raise the middle east conflict in her speech .
" there was a storm of outrage that went through the palestinian communities , " said erhard arendt , who runs the palaestina portal , germany 's largest internet forum for discussing palestinian affairs .
" hundreds of letters were written to newspapers , saying ' we did n't crop up in -lsb- the speech -rsb- at all .
we were totally forgotten . "
public opinion versus policy bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel 's speech to the knesset on march 18 drew praise and criticism the german government support for israel is , of course , programmed by germans ' sense of shame and guilt for the holocaust , as well as their desire to atone concretely for the horrors of the past .
but the german people are often far more sympathetic to palestinian plight and far more willing to criticize israel than their government .
" according to one survey , 63 percent of the populace does n't think israel 's policies are right , " arendt said .
germans ' empathy for the palestinians often originates in attempts to come to terms with their own past .
" without doubt , the fact that i was intensely interested in the holocaust led me to get involved in palestinian affairs , " said arendt , who was born in 1941 .
" that certainly strengthened the idea in me that nothing even remotely similar should be allowed to happen again - anywhere and at any time . "
germans ' attitudes differ from opinion poll to opinion poll , depending on which questions are asked .
but certain hot-button issues perennially elicit german opposition to israeli government policies .
" there 's the occupation and the very difficult situation in gaza , as we 've seen in the past few months , " wildangel said .
" it 's a humanitarian problem connected to the israeli blockade in which the eu is also involved .
i think that topics like this , or the building israeli settlements in the west bank , makes germans feel that they have to voice criticism . "

because it viewed nazism as a product of western capitalism , communist east germany took no responsibility for the holocaust .
it was openly hostile to israel and at least nominally supportive of palestinians ' desire for a state of their own .
and in the 1970s , the anti-imperialist terrorist group raf in west germany and palestinian militants also identified closely with one another .
most spectacularly , members of a group called " the popular front for the liberation of palestine " hijacked a lufthansa plane in 1977 , demanding among other things the release of raf terrorists from prison .
german special forces successfully stormed the plane at mogadishu airport , killing the hijackers .
such incidents shocked mainstream germans and their government .
" i do n't think that this course of action was very useful to the palestinians , " wildangel said .
" i see it as an extreme , and ultimately marginal , chapter in the history of german-palestinian relations . "
faint prospects for change bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the eu may be the best hope for easing german-palestinian relations there is little chance that germany will decrease the support , financial or military , it offers to israel - although german palestinian advocates continue to argue that the country has a responsibility to do precisely that .

" providing weapons to a crisis region violates every international agreement there is , yet weapons are delivered to israel , including armored scout cars , that are used to kill palestinians . "

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de media -pipe- 15.05.2008 false hitler doll reports vex ukraine großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the false reports caused a stir in ukraine and beyond prominent european media outlets recently circulated false reports of an adolf hitler doll being made in ukraine .
ukrainian journalist yevgeny minko said he was disappointed with how the erroneous story was handled . dw-world.de was among the european media sources to publish the falsified report on its english site in april 2008 .
it has since been removed from the web site .
the editors apologize to those readers who were offended by the publication of the article . yevgeny minko is editor-in-chief of telekritika , a monthly publication focusing on media issues in ukraine .
the following interview was conducted by email . dw-world.de : where did the inaccurate story originate and how did it spread ? yevgeny minko : the original story about the doll was published in the ukrainian newspaper dzerkalo tyzhnya -lrb- www.dt.ua -rrb- .
the author , andriy kapustin , described an incident of seeing a hitler doll manufactured in taiwan in one of kyiv 's novelty stores .
of course , he was not very pleased with what he saw .
he somewhat satirized the resemblance with the barbie doll , envisioning a hypothesized ukrainian family playing with the toy hitler .
nevertheless , he stressed that such a doll must not be welcome in a country that suffered from a nazi invasion during world war ii . this was a single incident of witnessing a hitler doll in kyiv .
no reports of massive sales are available . after a few days , -lsb- german news agency -rsb- dpa spread a brief translation of this feature .
their version contained a number of errors .
the text suggested that the hitler doll was going to be manufactured by a local company and would start selling in ukraine soon , which would definitely cause controversy in the country . as far as i understand , this erroneous translation was widespread and caused consequential reports in the media outside of ukraine . was the story correctly reported in the media outside of ukraine ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hitler invaded ukraine in 1941 , sending thousands to nazi concentration camps absolutely not .
first of all , russia 's first television channel made a very biased report , claiming that this hitler doll is a hit in kyiv , and queues of people willing to buy it were gathering in stores - although they failed to show these queues .
the report also implied that there were strong nazi tendencies in the policies of the ukrainian state . the bbc subsequently aired this report with an original text by jane hadden , although the latter was pretty close to the original . the daily telegraph and daily mail presented their own versions of the story .
the one from daily mail came out in classic tabloid style - shocking and provocative .
their feature roused response from readers who were horrified by the story . what were the most glaring omissions or mistakes in the article carried by the media outside of ukraine ? first , the doll is not made by a ukrainian manufacturer , it was made in taiwan .

ukrainian journalist yevgeny minko said he was disappointed with how the erroneous story was handled . dw-world.de was among the european media sources to publish the falsified report on its english site in april 2008 .
it has since been removed from the web site .
the editors apologize to those readers who were offended by the publication of the article . yevgeny minko is editor-in-chief of telekritika , a monthly publication focusing on media issues in ukraine .
the following interview was conducted by email . dw-world.de : where did the inaccurate story originate and how did it spread ? yevgeny minko : the original story about the doll was published in the ukrainian newspaper dzerkalo tyzhnya -lrb- www.dt.ua -rrb- .
the author , andriy kapustin , described an incident of seeing a hitler doll manufactured in taiwan in one of kyiv 's novelty stores .
of course , he was not very pleased with what he saw .
he somewhat satirized the resemblance with the barbie doll , envisioning a hypothesized ukrainian family playing with the toy hitler .
nevertheless , he stressed that such a doll must not be welcome in a country that suffered from a nazi invasion during world war ii . this was a single incident of witnessing a hitler doll in kyiv .
no reports of massive sales are available . after a few days , -lsb- german news agency -rsb- dpa spread a brief translation of this feature .
their version contained a number of errors .
the text suggested that the hitler doll was going to be manufactured by a local company and would start selling in ukraine soon , which would definitely cause controversy in the country . as far as i understand , this erroneous translation was widespread and caused consequential reports in the media outside of ukraine . was the story correctly reported in the media outside of ukraine ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hitler invaded ukraine in 1941 , sending thousands to nazi concentration camps absolutely not .
first of all , russia 's first television channel made a very biased report , claiming that this hitler doll is a hit in kyiv , and queues of people willing to buy it were gathering in stores - although they failed to show these queues .
the report also implied that there were strong nazi tendencies in the policies of the ukrainian state . the bbc subsequently aired this report with an original text by jane hadden , although the latter was pretty close to the original . the daily telegraph and daily mail presented their own versions of the story .
the one from daily mail came out in classic tabloid style - shocking and provocative .
their feature roused response from readers who were horrified by the story . what were the most glaring omissions or mistakes in the article carried by the media outside of ukraine ? first , the doll is not made by a ukrainian manufacturer , it was made in taiwan .
second , there is no ukrainian manufacturer that plans to sell hitler dolls across ukraine .
hence , no one plans to sell this doll with a variety of accessories .

ukrainian journalist yevgeny minko said he was disappointed with how the erroneous story was handled . dw-world.de was among the european media sources to publish the falsified report on its english site in april 2008 .
it has since been removed from the web site .
the editors apologize to those readers who were offended by the publication of the article . yevgeny minko is editor-in-chief of telekritika , a monthly publication focusing on media issues in ukraine .
the following interview was conducted by email . dw-world.de : where did the inaccurate story originate and how did it spread ? yevgeny minko : the original story about the doll was published in the ukrainian newspaper dzerkalo tyzhnya -lrb- www.dt.ua -rrb- .
the author , andriy kapustin , described an incident of seeing a hitler doll manufactured in taiwan in one of kyiv 's novelty stores .
of course , he was not very pleased with what he saw .
he somewhat satirized the resemblance with the barbie doll , envisioning a hypothesized ukrainian family playing with the toy hitler .
nevertheless , he stressed that such a doll must not be welcome in a country that suffered from a nazi invasion during world war ii . this was a single incident of witnessing a hitler doll in kyiv .
no reports of massive sales are available . after a few days , -lsb- german news agency -rsb- dpa spread a brief translation of this feature .
their version contained a number of errors .
the text suggested that the hitler doll was going to be manufactured by a local company and would start selling in ukraine soon , which would definitely cause controversy in the country . as far as i understand , this erroneous translation was widespread and caused consequential reports in the media outside of ukraine . was the story correctly reported in the media outside of ukraine ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hitler invaded ukraine in 1941 , sending thousands to nazi concentration camps absolutely not .
first of all , russia 's first television channel made a very biased report , claiming that this hitler doll is a hit in kyiv , and queues of people willing to buy it were gathering in stores - although they failed to show these queues .
the report also implied that there were strong nazi tendencies in the policies of the ukrainian state . the bbc subsequently aired this report with an original text by jane hadden , although the latter was pretty close to the original . the daily telegraph and daily mail presented their own versions of the story .
the one from daily mail came out in classic tabloid style - shocking and provocative .
their feature roused response from readers who were horrified by the story . what were the most glaring omissions or mistakes in the article carried by the media outside of ukraine ? first , the doll is not made by a ukrainian manufacturer , it was made in taiwan .
second , there is no ukrainian manufacturer that plans to sell hitler dolls across ukraine .
hence , no one plans to sell this doll with a variety of accessories .
third , ukrainian supermarkets do not sell this doll on a massive scale .
it was witnessed in a single novelty store . do you agree with the suspicions of some that there is an anti-ukrainian agenda to the story ? well , i am not a fan of conspiracy theories , so i would rather not say there was a certain anti-ukrainian agenda on the part of the media that spread the story .
except perhaps for russia 's first channel , which is known for its anti-ukrainian attitude and propaganda-like methods .
the other cases seem to be the result of negligent , careless reporting .
sadly , it was the most famous european media outlets that failed to stand up to professional standards . do you think that the media outlets that carried the story considered a possible anti-ukrainian agenda ? the european media was very inaccurate in their reports .
for instance , very few of the reporters mentioned the original source of the story - dzerkalo tyzhnya newspaper .
the bbc did not make it clear that the shown footage was basically a b-roll made by -lsb- russia 's -rsb- first channel .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de theater -pipe- 15.05.2008 director explains allure of america-focused theater festival großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : putting known film actors on stage is one of hoffmann 's successful moves dw-world talked to frank hoffmann , the artistic director of the ruhrfestspiele theater festival , about his decision to make america , land of cinema , the focus of his 2008 season . the ruhrfestspiele , or ruhr theater festival , one of europe 's most important and oldest theater festivals , opened this year on may 1 , 2008 , and runs through june 15 , 2008 .
ever since it was born of a unique deal between miners and actors who traded coal for performances during the hard winter of 1946/47 , the festival has kept up the tradition of putting on top-quality international productions in germany 's working-class ruhr valley . luxembourg director frank hoffmann took the artistic helm of the festival in 2004 at a precarious time in its history , pulling it back from the brink of bankruptcy and boosting visitor numbers from year to year .
in a conversation with dw-world.de , he discussed his fascination with modern american theater , and divulged his recipe for success . in the past you have focused on different authors at the ruhr festival .
this year you took on a country , america .
why ? originally we wanted to stay with my concept of focusing on a playwright , and i thought it might be arthur miller .
but then it became clear to me that we had to take a broad look at american theater of the 20th century .
that era - from eugene o ’ neill , whom you can count as the father of american theater , to today ’ s authors - underwent a singular development .
i thought it was worth focusing the festival on it . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hoffmann 's approach has had popular appeal weren ’ t you concerned that featuring the us could stigmatize the festival ?
after all , many europeans these days are fed up with american politics .
and the us is much better known for its pop culture than for its high art . it 's true that the image of america is not necessarily very positive , especially among artists , and especially when it comes to foreign policy .
i ’ m critical too - whether about the iraq war or other things that have happened during the bush presidency .
still , america is a very great nation and a great culture , and you have to be able to separate those things .
i think us theater rises above pop culture . european authors early in the last century - strindberg , ibsen , kafka - they all influenced american theater incredibly .
the american authors have absorbed it and are giving it back to us , with a focus of their own . what sets american theater apart ? american theater has a strong tie to cinema , much more than in any other country .
playwrights like david mamet and sam shepard are also hollywood scriptwriters .
this tie between cinema and theater is present even when it comes to actors , who play both on the stage and screen .
and there were many plays that have been turned into films .
there are enough interesting ties to support a festival . your predecessor at the festival , frank castorf , lasted less than a year .
his avant garde approach turned off the public , and the festival almost went bankrupt .
you have been lauded for rescuing the festival by putting on plays people wanted to see , and pulling in big-name actors .
what message does that send about pushing artistic boundaries ? we sold more than 75,000 tickets this year , more than ever in the history of the festival .
which means we have to suit many peoples ’ tastes .
but i want to be clear that we do not just put on popular plays .
we have a lot of world premieres and germany premieres .
we do modern theater , unconventional theater . our public is ready to take in the new ; they demand it .
but they also want to see popular things . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : austere aesthetics are frequent in in festival productions i can ’ t say exactly what explains our success but i think it has to do with how we present theater to people .
there isn ’ t just one aesthetic or style at the festival , there are many different aesthetics .
and the interesting thing is they are all found side by side .
they all bump up against each other .
it is exciting . so what is your recipe for a good theater festival ? first , there is the idea of it being strongly focused on a given concept or topic .
in the past it was an author , like shakespeare , beckett or goethe .
it allowed the viewer to compare a variety of different productions of one author 's work , and compare them . second , i created the idea of having festivals within a festival .
we have a festival of world premieres - every year there are three .
we have a series called young theater , with plays by young actors and directors .
we have a cabaret festival , and a children ’ s festival .
we try to make clear divisions . do you , personally , advocate a certain type of theater ? i think one thing is important - it has to be a sensual experience .
on the other hand , it has to be an adventure for the mind .
i think it needs to have both of those sides . in the past you have directed plays by a lot of europeans and south americans .
this year you are directing " a moon for the misbegotten , " by eugene o ’ neill .
was it a different experience for you ? no matter what i am directing , my method is the same .
i explore the play to its depths , and try to find out what holds it together .
in the context of this festival , of course , the subject of america had to be dealt with . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the troupe kataklo combine sport and theater i found it fascinating to work on this play because i have never been closer to using language of film - and not because i used any media in the production .
i ’ m talking in terms of the spirit of the play .
it was important for me to tie together the emotionality of cinema with the directness of theater . you said arthur miller was the starting point for this festival , and you are showcasing two of his plays : " the crucible " and " resurrection blues . "
both are on very political topics .
were you trying to make a point ? there are so many plays that i think are very current , beyond their time .
they have everything to do with our daily reality .
as a director , i can not avoid dealing with political issues .
and you can ’ t take on the topic of america without asking political questions . this year i am also directing " true west , " by sam shepard .
it is a piece from 1980 , but while i directed it i was very conscious of 9/11 .
you read this play differently knowing that 9/11 happened , and the audience sees it differently .
it is very enriching . interview : jennifer abramsohn send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

ever since it was born of a unique deal between miners and actors who traded coal for performances during the hard winter of 1946/47 , the festival has kept up the tradition of putting on top-quality international productions in germany 's working-class ruhr valley . luxembourg director frank hoffmann took the artistic helm of the festival in 2004 at a precarious time in its history , pulling it back from the brink of bankruptcy and boosting visitor numbers from year to year .
in a conversation with dw-world.de , he discussed his fascination with modern american theater , and divulged his recipe for success . in the past you have focused on different authors at the ruhr festival .
this year you took on a country , america .
why ? originally we wanted to stay with my concept of focusing on a playwright , and i thought it might be arthur miller .
but then it became clear to me that we had to take a broad look at american theater of the 20th century .
that era - from eugene o ’ neill , whom you can count as the father of american theater , to today ’ s authors - underwent a singular development .
i thought it was worth focusing the festival on it . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hoffmann 's approach has had popular appeal weren ’ t you concerned that featuring the us could stigmatize the festival ?
after all , many europeans these days are fed up with american politics .
and the us is much better known for its pop culture than for its high art . it 's true that the image of america is not necessarily very positive , especially among artists , and especially when it comes to foreign policy .
i ’ m critical too - whether about the iraq war or other things that have happened during the bush presidency .
still , america is a very great nation and a great culture , and you have to be able to separate those things .
i think us theater rises above pop culture . european authors early in the last century - strindberg , ibsen , kafka - they all influenced american theater incredibly .
the american authors have absorbed it and are giving it back to us , with a focus of their own . what sets american theater apart ? american theater has a strong tie to cinema , much more than in any other country .
playwrights like david mamet and sam shepard are also hollywood scriptwriters .
this tie between cinema and theater is present even when it comes to actors , who play both on the stage and screen .
and there were many plays that have been turned into films .
there are enough interesting ties to support a festival . your predecessor at the festival , frank castorf , lasted less than a year .
his avant garde approach turned off the public , and the festival almost went bankrupt .
you have been lauded for rescuing the festival by putting on plays people wanted to see , and pulling in big-name actors .
what message does that send about pushing artistic boundaries ? we sold more than 75,000 tickets this year , more than ever in the history of the festival .
which means we have to suit many peoples ’ tastes .
but i want to be clear that we do not just put on popular plays .
we have a lot of world premieres and germany premieres .
we do modern theater , unconventional theater . our public is ready to take in the new ; they demand it .
but they also want to see popular things . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : austere aesthetics are frequent in in festival productions i can ’ t say exactly what explains our success but i think it has to do with how we present theater to people .
there isn ’ t just one aesthetic or style at the festival , there are many different aesthetics .
and the interesting thing is they are all found side by side .
they all bump up against each other .
it is exciting . so what is your recipe for a good theater festival ? first , there is the idea of it being strongly focused on a given concept or topic .
in the past it was an author , like shakespeare , beckett or goethe .
it allowed the viewer to compare a variety of different productions of one author 's work , and compare them . second , i created the idea of having festivals within a festival .
we have a festival of world premieres - every year there are three .
we have a series called young theater , with plays by young actors and directors .
we have a cabaret festival , and a children ’ s festival .
we try to make clear divisions . do you , personally , advocate a certain type of theater ? i think one thing is important - it has to be a sensual experience .
on the other hand , it has to be an adventure for the mind .
i think it needs to have both of those sides . in the past you have directed plays by a lot of europeans and south americans .
this year you are directing " a moon for the misbegotten , " by eugene o ’ neill .
was it a different experience for you ? no matter what i am directing , my method is the same .
i explore the play to its depths , and try to find out what holds it together .
in the context of this festival , of course , the subject of america had to be dealt with . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the troupe kataklo combine sport and theater i found it fascinating to work on this play because i have never been closer to using language of film - and not because i used any media in the production .
i ’ m talking in terms of the spirit of the play .
it was important for me to tie together the emotionality of cinema with the directness of theater . you said arthur miller was the starting point for this festival , and you are showcasing two of his plays : " the crucible " and " resurrection blues . "
both are on very political topics .
were you trying to make a point ? there are so many plays that i think are very current , beyond their time .
they have everything to do with our daily reality .
as a director , i can not avoid dealing with political issues .
and you can ’ t take on the topic of america without asking political questions . this year i am also directing " true west , " by sam shepard .

ever since it was born of a unique deal between miners and actors who traded coal for performances during the hard winter of 1946/47 , the festival has kept up the tradition of putting on top-quality international productions in germany 's working-class ruhr valley . luxembourg director frank hoffmann took the artistic helm of the festival in 2004 at a precarious time in its history , pulling it back from the brink of bankruptcy and boosting visitor numbers from year to year .
in a conversation with dw-world.de , he discussed his fascination with modern american theater , and divulged his recipe for success . in the past you have focused on different authors at the ruhr festival .
this year you took on a country , america .
why ? originally we wanted to stay with my concept of focusing on a playwright , and i thought it might be arthur miller .
but then it became clear to me that we had to take a broad look at american theater of the 20th century .
that era - from eugene o ’ neill , whom you can count as the father of american theater , to today ’ s authors - underwent a singular development .
i thought it was worth focusing the festival on it . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hoffmann 's approach has had popular appeal weren ’ t you concerned that featuring the us could stigmatize the festival ?
after all , many europeans these days are fed up with american politics .
and the us is much better known for its pop culture than for its high art . it 's true that the image of america is not necessarily very positive , especially among artists , and especially when it comes to foreign policy .
i ’ m critical too - whether about the iraq war or other things that have happened during the bush presidency .
still , america is a very great nation and a great culture , and you have to be able to separate those things .
i think us theater rises above pop culture . european authors early in the last century - strindberg , ibsen , kafka - they all influenced american theater incredibly .
the american authors have absorbed it and are giving it back to us , with a focus of their own . what sets american theater apart ? american theater has a strong tie to cinema , much more than in any other country .
playwrights like david mamet and sam shepard are also hollywood scriptwriters .
this tie between cinema and theater is present even when it comes to actors , who play both on the stage and screen .
and there were many plays that have been turned into films .
there are enough interesting ties to support a festival . your predecessor at the festival , frank castorf , lasted less than a year .
his avant garde approach turned off the public , and the festival almost went bankrupt .
you have been lauded for rescuing the festival by putting on plays people wanted to see , and pulling in big-name actors .
what message does that send about pushing artistic boundaries ? we sold more than 75,000 tickets this year , more than ever in the history of the festival .
which means we have to suit many peoples ’ tastes .
but i want to be clear that we do not just put on popular plays .
we have a lot of world premieres and germany premieres .
we do modern theater , unconventional theater . our public is ready to take in the new ; they demand it .
but they also want to see popular things . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : austere aesthetics are frequent in in festival productions i can ’ t say exactly what explains our success but i think it has to do with how we present theater to people .
there isn ’ t just one aesthetic or style at the festival , there are many different aesthetics .
and the interesting thing is they are all found side by side .
they all bump up against each other .
it is exciting . so what is your recipe for a good theater festival ? first , there is the idea of it being strongly focused on a given concept or topic .
in the past it was an author , like shakespeare , beckett or goethe .
it allowed the viewer to compare a variety of different productions of one author 's work , and compare them . second , i created the idea of having festivals within a festival .
we have a festival of world premieres - every year there are three .
we have a series called young theater , with plays by young actors and directors .
we have a cabaret festival , and a children ’ s festival .
we try to make clear divisions . do you , personally , advocate a certain type of theater ? i think one thing is important - it has to be a sensual experience .
on the other hand , it has to be an adventure for the mind .
i think it needs to have both of those sides . in the past you have directed plays by a lot of europeans and south americans .
this year you are directing " a moon for the misbegotten , " by eugene o ’ neill .
was it a different experience for you ? no matter what i am directing , my method is the same .
i explore the play to its depths , and try to find out what holds it together .
in the context of this festival , of course , the subject of america had to be dealt with . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the troupe kataklo combine sport and theater i found it fascinating to work on this play because i have never been closer to using language of film - and not because i used any media in the production .
i ’ m talking in terms of the spirit of the play .
it was important for me to tie together the emotionality of cinema with the directness of theater . you said arthur miller was the starting point for this festival , and you are showcasing two of his plays : " the crucible " and " resurrection blues . "
both are on very political topics .
were you trying to make a point ? there are so many plays that i think are very current , beyond their time .
they have everything to do with our daily reality .
as a director , i can not avoid dealing with political issues .
and you can ’ t take on the topic of america without asking political questions . this year i am also directing " true west , " by sam shepard .
it is a piece from 1980 , but while i directed it i was very conscious of 9/11 .
you read this play differently knowing that 9/11 happened , and the audience sees it differently .
it is very enriching . interview : jennifer abramsohn send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" it said islamists regard germany as a crusader nation and also see it as an ally of the united states and israel - two of the biggest foes of muslim militants . germany 's growing military presence in afghanistan and its involvement in training iraqi security forces had made it a target for islamic terrorists , the report said . the document also spoke of a growing climate of anti-semitism among right-wing extremists in germany .
it said neo-nazis were making increased use of the internet and music to reach out to other sections of the population , particularly young people . the report said the number of politically motivated crimes in germany decreased slightly in 2007 to 28,538 .
the number of violent crimes by neo-nazis also dipped slightly to 833 .
according to the report , there are 4,400 known neo-nazis in germany , 200 more than in 2006 . dw staff / dpa -lrb- kjb -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de reader response -pipe- 15.05.2008 readers sound off on hugo chavez and the dalai lama großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : venezuela 's president hugo chavez comments by venezuelan president hugo chavez about chancellor merkel and the refusal of high-ranking german officials to meet with the dalai lama got readers attention this week . the following comments reflect the views of dw-world.de readers .
not all reader comments have been published .
dw-world.de reserves the right to edit for length and appropriateness of content . of course , hugo chavez 's comments were out of line .
he always is .
chavez is leftist but has never had the experience of living in a communist state , like east germany or the ussr , where there were no human rights , fundamental freedoms , right to property and so on . - stefan schneider , brazil chancellor merkel may be a conservative center-right politician but she is definitively not an extreme right-wing totalitarian leader as socialist president of venezuela hugo chavez thinks she might be .
you could label him an extreme left-wing totalitarian leader .
if they get to meet in lima , peru , i wonder if his attitude towards chancellor merkel will change . - stuart john pearson , australia as far as comparing merkel 's party with fascism , hugo chavez is grandstanding for his own benefit and seems to feel the need to show off to the world media with very bad taste and form . - g. gosau , canada although the comments of president chavez might sound extreme , they are just a reaction to chancellor merkel comments in the sense that this is hardball politics .
to my understanding , merkel was probably trying to praise the moderate left of countries like chile or brazil , but did it in a way that ended up attacking another country 's policy which is always a big no-no if you want to have friendly relationships .
chavez on the other hand is used to the snide comments coming from the us and this is his way of dealing with that .
speaking clearly and boldly is the only way he has been able to get his message across to a news media that is largely against him . - andres castillo , venezuela this is the way chavez says the truth .
it 's not diplomatic , but that does not matter , it is still the truth . - christian grundmann , venezuela this visit by the german chancellor angela merkel is very important for the relations between our continent and the eu - and stronger relations are needed for today and the future .
one should not believe what the venezuelan president said because he does not represent our interests or the latin american people . - rosita welcker , columbia president hugo chavez of venezuela had every right to reply to the provocative statement that chancellor angela merkel uttered when saying that he was not the voice of the region .
if you do not like criticism do not take upon yourself to criticize anyone else .
as for the christian democrats being a nazi-like party , it is very close to the truth .
the german catholic party was absorbed into the nazi party in 1934 .
so , senor chavez did make a statement that bore some truth in it .
but , should president chavez attend the eu-latin american and caribbean summit , i am sure he will tell angela merkel what he thinks .
right now angela merkel does not speak for the eu but as a mouthpiece of the bush regime in the us .
it 's a shame that the eu has become a tool of yankee imperialism .
tell chancellor merkel to keep her opinions to herself or face the consequences of her actions . - kenneth v. tellis , canada chavez was not out of line because he was telling the truth .
he has not told a lie yet . - leon bernotas , us dalai lama 's visit to germany bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hesse premier roland koch was the first official to meet with the dalai lama a german cabinet minister should meet with the dalai lama .
tibet should be free from china .
but i am very pleased with china accepting international help with the earthquake from germany , the us , australia and other members of the international community and that the chinese premier visited the affected area fairly quickly and offered to help . - stuart john pearson , australia i think the cabinet members and other top leaders in the government of germany should go out of their way to meet with the dalai lama personally and to set up some sort of dialogue with his representatives .

not all reader comments have been published .
dw-world.de reserves the right to edit for length and appropriateness of content . of course , hugo chavez 's comments were out of line .
he always is .
chavez is leftist but has never had the experience of living in a communist state , like east germany or the ussr , where there were no human rights , fundamental freedoms , right to property and so on . - stefan schneider , brazil chancellor merkel may be a conservative center-right politician but she is definitively not an extreme right-wing totalitarian leader as socialist president of venezuela hugo chavez thinks she might be .
you could label him an extreme left-wing totalitarian leader .
if they get to meet in lima , peru , i wonder if his attitude towards chancellor merkel will change . - stuart john pearson , australia as far as comparing merkel 's party with fascism , hugo chavez is grandstanding for his own benefit and seems to feel the need to show off to the world media with very bad taste and form . - g. gosau , canada although the comments of president chavez might sound extreme , they are just a reaction to chancellor merkel comments in the sense that this is hardball politics .
to my understanding , merkel was probably trying to praise the moderate left of countries like chile or brazil , but did it in a way that ended up attacking another country 's policy which is always a big no-no if you want to have friendly relationships .
chavez on the other hand is used to the snide comments coming from the us and this is his way of dealing with that .
speaking clearly and boldly is the only way he has been able to get his message across to a news media that is largely against him . - andres castillo , venezuela this is the way chavez says the truth .
it 's not diplomatic , but that does not matter , it is still the truth . - christian grundmann , venezuela this visit by the german chancellor angela merkel is very important for the relations between our continent and the eu - and stronger relations are needed for today and the future .
one should not believe what the venezuelan president said because he does not represent our interests or the latin american people . - rosita welcker , columbia president hugo chavez of venezuela had every right to reply to the provocative statement that chancellor angela merkel uttered when saying that he was not the voice of the region .
if you do not like criticism do not take upon yourself to criticize anyone else .
as for the christian democrats being a nazi-like party , it is very close to the truth .
the german catholic party was absorbed into the nazi party in 1934 .
so , senor chavez did make a statement that bore some truth in it .
but , should president chavez attend the eu-latin american and caribbean summit , i am sure he will tell angela merkel what he thinks .
right now angela merkel does not speak for the eu but as a mouthpiece of the bush regime in the us .
it 's a shame that the eu has become a tool of yankee imperialism .
tell chancellor merkel to keep her opinions to herself or face the consequences of her actions . - kenneth v. tellis , canada chavez was not out of line because he was telling the truth .
he has not told a lie yet . - leon bernotas , us dalai lama 's visit to germany bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hesse premier roland koch was the first official to meet with the dalai lama a german cabinet minister should meet with the dalai lama .
tibet should be free from china .
but i am very pleased with china accepting international help with the earthquake from germany , the us , australia and other members of the international community and that the chinese premier visited the affected area fairly quickly and offered to help . - stuart john pearson , australia i think the cabinet members and other top leaders in the government of germany should go out of their way to meet with the dalai lama personally and to set up some sort of dialogue with his representatives .

the dalai lama said he was deeply affected by monday 's devastating earthquake that officials fear could have killed 50,000 in the southwestern chinese province of sichuan .
the 72-year-old , who was awarded the nobel peace prize in 1989 for his efforts to achieve a non-violent solution to the tibetan problem , said he would pray for the victims .
frankfurt was the opening leg of a five-day tour of germany which will see the dalai lama speak on human rights and meet with a member of chancellor angela merkel 's cabinet in berlin .
after a breakfast meeting with roland koch , the conservative premier of the state of hesse , he traveled to bochum where he conferred with juergen ruettgers , prime minister of north rhine- westphalia , germany 's most populous state .
ruettgers said after the talks that the dalai lama had briefed him on the meetings between his representatives and the chinese government held in the aftermath of the freedom demonstrations in march that left an undetermined number of dead .
the talks , in the chinese city of shenzhen , had failed to generate the trust that was necessary to resolve the issue , the dalai lama said .
spiritual leader condemns chinese suppression bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the dalai lama spent the first day pressing the flesh the dalai lama also took the opportunity to lash out once more at the " suppression " of anti-chinese unrest in tibet .
" the chinese political authorities ' reaction , as before , was suppression .
so it is very sad , " the tibetan spiritual leader said after arriving in germany .
on wednesday , china protested at the dalai lama 's planned meetings with development minister heidemarie wieczorek-zeul and legislators at the german parliament .
the " dalai lama is not a normal monk , but a political exile who carries out anti-chinese and separatist activities abroad under the guise of religion , human rights and autonomy , " a statement released by the chinese embassy said .
the talks with wieczorek-zeul and members of the parliamentary foreign affairs committee are due to take place on may 19 when the dalai lama will also deliver a speech at berlin 's brandenburg gate .
the run-up to the visit was marked by a domestic row because no one in merkel 's government was prepared to meet him , apparently fearing it could upset china .
the meeting with the economic assistance minister was arranged at the last minute .

the dalai lama said he was not put off by this .

the talks with wieczorek-zeul and members of the parliamentary foreign affairs committee are due to take place on may 19 when the dalai lama will also deliver a speech at berlin 's brandenburg gate .

the dalai lama said he was deeply affected by monday 's devastating earthquake that officials fear could have killed 50,000 in the southwestern chinese province of sichuan .
the 72-year-old , who was awarded the nobel peace prize in 1989 for his efforts to achieve a non-violent solution to the tibetan problem , said he would pray for the victims .

ever since it was born of a unique deal between miners and actors who traded coal for performances during the hard winter of 1946/47 , the festival has kept up the tradition of putting on top-quality international productions in germany 's working-class ruhr valley . luxembourg director frank hoffmann took the artistic helm of the festival in 2004 at a precarious time in its history , pulling it back from the brink of bankruptcy and boosting visitor numbers from year to year .
in a conversation with dw-world.de , he discussed his fascination with modern american theater , and divulged his recipe for success . in the past you have focused on different authors at the ruhr festival .
this year you took on a country , america .
why ? originally we wanted to stay with my concept of focusing on a playwright , and i thought it might be arthur miller .
but then it became clear to me that we had to take a broad look at american theater of the 20th century .
that era - from eugene o ’ neill , whom you can count as the father of american theater , to today ’ s authors - underwent a singular development .
i thought it was worth focusing the festival on it . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hoffmann 's approach has had popular appeal weren ’ t you concerned that featuring the us could stigmatize the festival ?
after all , many europeans these days are fed up with american politics .
and the us is much better known for its pop culture than for its high art . it 's true that the image of america is not necessarily very positive , especially among artists , and especially when it comes to foreign policy .
i ’ m critical too - whether about the iraq war or other things that have happened during the bush presidency .
still , america is a very great nation and a great culture , and you have to be able to separate those things .
i think us theater rises above pop culture . european authors early in the last century - strindberg , ibsen , kafka - they all influenced american theater incredibly .
the american authors have absorbed it and are giving it back to us , with a focus of their own . what sets american theater apart ? american theater has a strong tie to cinema , much more than in any other country .
playwrights like david mamet and sam shepard are also hollywood scriptwriters .
this tie between cinema and theater is present even when it comes to actors , who play both on the stage and screen .
and there were many plays that have been turned into films .
there are enough interesting ties to support a festival . your predecessor at the festival , frank castorf , lasted less than a year .
his avant garde approach turned off the public , and the festival almost went bankrupt .
you have been lauded for rescuing the festival by putting on plays people wanted to see , and pulling in big-name actors .
what message does that send about pushing artistic boundaries ? we sold more than 75,000 tickets this year , more than ever in the history of the festival .
which means we have to suit many peoples ’ tastes .
but i want to be clear that we do not just put on popular plays .
we have a lot of world premieres and germany premieres .
we do modern theater , unconventional theater . our public is ready to take in the new ; they demand it .
but they also want to see popular things . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : austere aesthetics are frequent in in festival productions i can ’ t say exactly what explains our success but i think it has to do with how we present theater to people .
there isn ’ t just one aesthetic or style at the festival , there are many different aesthetics .
and the interesting thing is they are all found side by side .
they all bump up against each other .
it is exciting . so what is your recipe for a good theater festival ? first , there is the idea of it being strongly focused on a given concept or topic .
in the past it was an author , like shakespeare , beckett or goethe .
it allowed the viewer to compare a variety of different productions of one author 's work , and compare them . second , i created the idea of having festivals within a festival .
we have a festival of world premieres - every year there are three .
we have a series called young theater , with plays by young actors and directors .
we have a cabaret festival , and a children ’ s festival .
we try to make clear divisions . do you , personally , advocate a certain type of theater ? i think one thing is important - it has to be a sensual experience .
on the other hand , it has to be an adventure for the mind .
i think it needs to have both of those sides . in the past you have directed plays by a lot of europeans and south americans .
this year you are directing " a moon for the misbegotten , " by eugene o ’ neill .
was it a different experience for you ? no matter what i am directing , my method is the same .
i explore the play to its depths , and try to find out what holds it together .
in the context of this festival , of course , the subject of america had to be dealt with . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the troupe kataklo combine sport and theater i found it fascinating to work on this play because i have never been closer to using language of film - and not because i used any media in the production .
i ’ m talking in terms of the spirit of the play .
it was important for me to tie together the emotionality of cinema with the directness of theater . you said arthur miller was the starting point for this festival , and you are showcasing two of his plays : " the crucible " and " resurrection blues . "
both are on very political topics .
were you trying to make a point ? there are so many plays that i think are very current , beyond their time .
they have everything to do with our daily reality .
as a director , i can not avoid dealing with political issues .
and you can ’ t take on the topic of america without asking political questions . this year i am also directing " true west , " by sam shepard .
it is a piece from 1980 , but while i directed it i was very conscious of 9/11 .
you read this play differently knowing that 9/11 happened , and the audience sees it differently .
it is very enriching . interview : jennifer abramsohn send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

ukrainian journalist yevgeny minko said he was disappointed with how the erroneous story was handled . dw-world.de was among the european media sources to publish the falsified report on its english site in april 2008 .
it has since been removed from the web site .
the editors apologize to those readers who were offended by the publication of the article . yevgeny minko is editor-in-chief of telekritika , a monthly publication focusing on media issues in ukraine .
the following interview was conducted by email . dw-world.de : where did the inaccurate story originate and how did it spread ? yevgeny minko : the original story about the doll was published in the ukrainian newspaper dzerkalo tyzhnya -lrb- www.dt.ua -rrb- .
the author , andriy kapustin , described an incident of seeing a hitler doll manufactured in taiwan in one of kyiv 's novelty stores .
of course , he was not very pleased with what he saw .
he somewhat satirized the resemblance with the barbie doll , envisioning a hypothesized ukrainian family playing with the toy hitler .
nevertheless , he stressed that such a doll must not be welcome in a country that suffered from a nazi invasion during world war ii . this was a single incident of witnessing a hitler doll in kyiv .
no reports of massive sales are available . after a few days , -lsb- german news agency -rsb- dpa spread a brief translation of this feature .
their version contained a number of errors .
the text suggested that the hitler doll was going to be manufactured by a local company and would start selling in ukraine soon , which would definitely cause controversy in the country . as far as i understand , this erroneous translation was widespread and caused consequential reports in the media outside of ukraine . was the story correctly reported in the media outside of ukraine ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hitler invaded ukraine in 1941 , sending thousands to nazi concentration camps absolutely not .
first of all , russia 's first television channel made a very biased report , claiming that this hitler doll is a hit in kyiv , and queues of people willing to buy it were gathering in stores - although they failed to show these queues .
the report also implied that there were strong nazi tendencies in the policies of the ukrainian state . the bbc subsequently aired this report with an original text by jane hadden , although the latter was pretty close to the original . the daily telegraph and daily mail presented their own versions of the story .
the one from daily mail came out in classic tabloid style - shocking and provocative .
their feature roused response from readers who were horrified by the story . what were the most glaring omissions or mistakes in the article carried by the media outside of ukraine ? first , the doll is not made by a ukrainian manufacturer , it was made in taiwan .
second , there is no ukrainian manufacturer that plans to sell hitler dolls across ukraine .
hence , no one plans to sell this doll with a variety of accessories .
third , ukrainian supermarkets do not sell this doll on a massive scale .
it was witnessed in a single novelty store . do you agree with the suspicions of some that there is an anti-ukrainian agenda to the story ? well , i am not a fan of conspiracy theories , so i would rather not say there was a certain anti-ukrainian agenda on the part of the media that spread the story .
except perhaps for russia 's first channel , which is known for its anti-ukrainian attitude and propaganda-like methods .
the other cases seem to be the result of negligent , careless reporting .
sadly , it was the most famous european media outlets that failed to stand up to professional standards . do you think that the media outlets that carried the story considered a possible anti-ukrainian agenda ? the european media was very inaccurate in their reports .
for instance , very few of the reporters mentioned the original source of the story - dzerkalo tyzhnya newspaper .
the bbc did not make it clear that the shown footage was basically a b-roll made by -lsb- russia 's -rsb- first channel .
daily mail and deutsche welle failed to mention any original source for their reports . did the media that brought the inaccurate story respond to inquires in an appropriate manner ? not really .
we still do not have any responses from dpa .

the southwestern state has a law that bans " exterior expressions of religious confession . " the so-called " headscarf debate " is a long-raging one in germany , home to more than 3 million muslims , most of turkish origin .
many consider the headscarf a form of oppression against women and say immigrants who want to live here harmoniously must accept certain western values and play by german rules . others say forbidding it amounts to discriminating against islam and that germans should learn to accept other cultures and traditions . all religious dress bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : nuns are also not exempt , except in certain cases the country as a whole has been split on the issue of scarves and education , with some states tolerating teachers in scarves and others sacking them if they refuse to teach bare-headed . the judges in the city of mannheim interpreted the ban on religious dress as applying to all religions , whether to nuns and monks in habits or to male jewish teachers wearing the kippah . the law expressly exempts catholic religious who teach catholic doctrine classes in public schools , and the judges said three nuns in the state who teach other subjects had personal exemptions that would not apply to any other sisters in the future . dw staff -lrb- jam -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" -lsb- lula -rsb- said to me that he would receive the german chancellor , " said chavez .
" and i said , please greet her from me .
she comes here and throws stones , for reasons i do not know .
some european heads of state come in order to meet with us , and already before their arrival are throwing stones . " the tit for tat between the venezuelan and german leaders started when merkel told german news agency dpa in an interview ahead of this week 's summit of the european union , latin american and caribbean nations that the left-wing chavez is not the voice of the region . chavez replied aggressively late sunday in his weekly radio and television program , saying that merkel belongs to the political right , " the same right that supported hitler and fascism . " merkel downplays fascist accusations on tuesday the venezuelan government issued a statement stressing that merkel is not the eu 's only voice and demanded " respect " from germany . on wednesday , merkel did not respond directly to any remarks from chavez , only saying she wanted to " tighten the strategic partnership with latin america . " " president lula can relax ; i can look after myself , " merkel said when asked whether brazil 's head-of-state could help smooth over the dispute . lula da silva was also optimistic about the upcoming meeting : " if i know chavez and merkel well , they will sit down , have a cup of coffee and peace will reign between caracas and bonn , " he said , mistakenly referring to germany 's former capital . the german chancellor traveled to latin america on tuesday and met with the brazilian president on wednesday in brasilia to discuss broader bilateral economic ties . merkel , chavez and some 60 leaders from the european union , latin america and the caribbean are set to meet friday and saturday in lima , for the summit that the two regions hold every two years . dw staff -lrb- kjb -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the dalai lama said he was deeply affected by monday 's devastating earthquake that officials fear could have killed 50,000 in the southwestern chinese province of sichuan .
the 72-year-old , who was awarded the nobel peace prize in 1989 for his efforts to achieve a non-violent solution to the tibetan problem , said he would pray for the victims .
frankfurt was the opening leg of a five-day tour of germany which will see the dalai lama speak on human rights and meet with a member of chancellor angela merkel 's cabinet in berlin .
after a breakfast meeting with roland koch , the conservative premier of the state of hesse , he traveled to bochum where he conferred with juergen ruettgers , prime minister of north rhine- westphalia , germany 's most populous state .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de media -pipe- 15.05.2008 false hitler doll reports vex ukraine großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the false reports caused a stir in ukraine and beyond prominent european media outlets recently circulated false reports of an adolf hitler doll being made in ukraine .
ukrainian journalist yevgeny minko said he was disappointed with how the erroneous story was handled . dw-world.de was among the european media sources to publish the falsified report on its english site in april 2008 .
it has since been removed from the web site .
the editors apologize to those readers who were offended by the publication of the article . yevgeny minko is editor-in-chief of telekritika , a monthly publication focusing on media issues in ukraine .
the following interview was conducted by email . dw-world.de : where did the inaccurate story originate and how did it spread ? yevgeny minko : the original story about the doll was published in the ukrainian newspaper dzerkalo tyzhnya -lrb- www.dt.ua -rrb- .
the author , andriy kapustin , described an incident of seeing a hitler doll manufactured in taiwan in one of kyiv 's novelty stores .
of course , he was not very pleased with what he saw .
he somewhat satirized the resemblance with the barbie doll , envisioning a hypothesized ukrainian family playing with the toy hitler .
nevertheless , he stressed that such a doll must not be welcome in a country that suffered from a nazi invasion during world war ii . this was a single incident of witnessing a hitler doll in kyiv .
no reports of massive sales are available . after a few days , -lsb- german news agency -rsb- dpa spread a brief translation of this feature .
their version contained a number of errors .
the text suggested that the hitler doll was going to be manufactured by a local company and would start selling in ukraine soon , which would definitely cause controversy in the country . as far as i understand , this erroneous translation was widespread and caused consequential reports in the media outside of ukraine . was the story correctly reported in the media outside of ukraine ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hitler invaded ukraine in 1941 , sending thousands to nazi concentration camps absolutely not .
first of all , russia 's first television channel made a very biased report , claiming that this hitler doll is a hit in kyiv , and queues of people willing to buy it were gathering in stores - although they failed to show these queues .
the report also implied that there were strong nazi tendencies in the policies of the ukrainian state . the bbc subsequently aired this report with an original text by jane hadden , although the latter was pretty close to the original . the daily telegraph and daily mail presented their own versions of the story .
the one from daily mail came out in classic tabloid style - shocking and provocative .
their feature roused response from readers who were horrified by the story . what were the most glaring omissions or mistakes in the article carried by the media outside of ukraine ? first , the doll is not made by a ukrainian manufacturer , it was made in taiwan .
second , there is no ukrainian manufacturer that plans to sell hitler dolls across ukraine .
hence , no one plans to sell this doll with a variety of accessories .
third , ukrainian supermarkets do not sell this doll on a massive scale .
it was witnessed in a single novelty store . do you agree with the suspicions of some that there is an anti-ukrainian agenda to the story ? well , i am not a fan of conspiracy theories , so i would rather not say there was a certain anti-ukrainian agenda on the part of the media that spread the story .
except perhaps for russia 's first channel , which is known for its anti-ukrainian attitude and propaganda-like methods .
the other cases seem to be the result of negligent , careless reporting .
sadly , it was the most famous european media outlets that failed to stand up to professional standards . do you think that the media outlets that carried the story considered a possible anti-ukrainian agenda ? the european media was very inaccurate in their reports .
for instance , very few of the reporters mentioned the original source of the story - dzerkalo tyzhnya newspaper .
the bbc did not make it clear that the shown footage was basically a b-roll made by -lsb- russia 's -rsb- first channel .
daily mail and deutsche welle failed to mention any original source for their reports . did the media that brought the inaccurate story respond to inquires in an appropriate manner ? not really .
we still do not have any responses from dpa .
bbc , daily telegraph and daily mail removed the hitler doll reports from their web sites , but did not explain the situation to their audiences . interview : nick amies send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the dalai lama said he was deeply affected by monday 's devastating earthquake that officials fear could have killed 50,000 in the southwestern chinese province of sichuan .
the 72-year-old , who was awarded the nobel peace prize in 1989 for his efforts to achieve a non-violent solution to the tibetan problem , said he would pray for the victims .
frankfurt was the opening leg of a five-day tour of germany which will see the dalai lama speak on human rights and meet with a member of chancellor angela merkel 's cabinet in berlin .
after a breakfast meeting with roland koch , the conservative premier of the state of hesse , he traveled to bochum where he conferred with juergen ruettgers , prime minister of north rhine- westphalia , germany 's most populous state .
ruettgers said after the talks that the dalai lama had briefed him on the meetings between his representatives and the chinese government held in the aftermath of the freedom demonstrations in march that left an undetermined number of dead .
the talks , in the chinese city of shenzhen , had failed to generate the trust that was necessary to resolve the issue , the dalai lama said .
spiritual leader condemns chinese suppression bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the dalai lama spent the first day pressing the flesh the dalai lama also took the opportunity to lash out once more at the " suppression " of anti-chinese unrest in tibet .
" the chinese political authorities ' reaction , as before , was suppression .
so it is very sad , " the tibetan spiritual leader said after arriving in germany .
on wednesday , china protested at the dalai lama 's planned meetings with development minister heidemarie wieczorek-zeul and legislators at the german parliament .
the " dalai lama is not a normal monk , but a political exile who carries out anti-chinese and separatist activities abroad under the guise of religion , human rights and autonomy , " a statement released by the chinese embassy said .
the talks with wieczorek-zeul and members of the parliamentary foreign affairs committee are due to take place on may 19 when the dalai lama will also deliver a speech at berlin 's brandenburg gate .
the run-up to the visit was marked by a domestic row because no one in merkel 's government was prepared to meet him , apparently fearing it could upset china .
the meeting with the economic assistance minister was arranged at the last minute .
lama unmoved by german domestic row over visit bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel met with the dalai lama during a 2007 visit , but is in latin america this week the chancellor is in latin america and her deputy , foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier , turned down an official request for a meeting , saying he does not have time .
the dalai lama said he was not put off by this .
some " leading personalities find it uncomfortable to talk to me , " he said , " but that is all right . "
merkel met the dalai lama at the federal chancellery last september , a move which led to a chill in relations between berlin and beijing that ended only in january after intense german diplomatic efforts .
chinese communist forces invaded tibet in 1950 .
since the tibetan resistance movement collapsed in 1959 , the dalai lama has lived in india , where the tibetan government-in-exile is based . dw staff / dpa -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" -lsb- lula -rsb- said to me that he would receive the german chancellor , " said chavez .
" and i said , please greet her from me .
she comes here and throws stones , for reasons i do not know .
some european heads of state come in order to meet with us , and already before their arrival are throwing stones . " the tit for tat between the venezuelan and german leaders started when merkel told german news agency dpa in an interview ahead of this week 's summit of the european union , latin american and caribbean nations that the left-wing chavez is not the voice of the region . chavez replied aggressively late sunday in his weekly radio and television program , saying that merkel belongs to the political right , " the same right that supported hitler and fascism . " merkel downplays fascist accusations on tuesday the venezuelan government issued a statement stressing that merkel is not the eu 's only voice and demanded " respect " from germany . on wednesday , merkel did not respond directly to any remarks from chavez , only saying she wanted to " tighten the strategic partnership with latin america . " " president lula can relax ; i can look after myself , " merkel said when asked whether brazil 's head-of-state could help smooth over the dispute . lula da silva was also optimistic about the upcoming meeting : " if i know chavez and merkel well , they will sit down , have a cup of coffee and peace will reign between caracas and bonn , " he said , mistakenly referring to germany 's former capital . the german chancellor traveled to latin america on tuesday and met with the brazilian president on wednesday in brasilia to discuss broader bilateral economic ties . merkel , chavez and some 60 leaders from the european union , latin america and the caribbean are set to meet friday and saturday in lima , for the summit that the two regions hold every two years . dw staff -lrb- kjb -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

not all reader comments have been published .
dw-world.de reserves the right to edit for length and appropriateness of content . of course , hugo chavez 's comments were out of line .
he always is .
chavez is leftist but has never had the experience of living in a communist state , like east germany or the ussr , where there were no human rights , fundamental freedoms , right to property and so on . - stefan schneider , brazil chancellor merkel may be a conservative center-right politician but she is definitively not an extreme right-wing totalitarian leader as socialist president of venezuela hugo chavez thinks she might be .
you could label him an extreme left-wing totalitarian leader .
if they get to meet in lima , peru , i wonder if his attitude towards chancellor merkel will change . - stuart john pearson , australia as far as comparing merkel 's party with fascism , hugo chavez is grandstanding for his own benefit and seems to feel the need to show off to the world media with very bad taste and form . - g. gosau , canada although the comments of president chavez might sound extreme , they are just a reaction to chancellor merkel comments in the sense that this is hardball politics .
to my understanding , merkel was probably trying to praise the moderate left of countries like chile or brazil , but did it in a way that ended up attacking another country 's policy which is always a big no-no if you want to have friendly relationships .
chavez on the other hand is used to the snide comments coming from the us and this is his way of dealing with that .
speaking clearly and boldly is the only way he has been able to get his message across to a news media that is largely against him . - andres castillo , venezuela this is the way chavez says the truth .
it 's not diplomatic , but that does not matter , it is still the truth . - christian grundmann , venezuela this visit by the german chancellor angela merkel is very important for the relations between our continent and the eu - and stronger relations are needed for today and the future .
one should not believe what the venezuelan president said because he does not represent our interests or the latin american people . - rosita welcker , columbia president hugo chavez of venezuela had every right to reply to the provocative statement that chancellor angela merkel uttered when saying that he was not the voice of the region .
if you do not like criticism do not take upon yourself to criticize anyone else .
as for the christian democrats being a nazi-like party , it is very close to the truth .
the german catholic party was absorbed into the nazi party in 1934 .
so , senor chavez did make a statement that bore some truth in it .
but , should president chavez attend the eu-latin american and caribbean summit , i am sure he will tell angela merkel what he thinks .
right now angela merkel does not speak for the eu but as a mouthpiece of the bush regime in the us .
it 's a shame that the eu has become a tool of yankee imperialism .
tell chancellor merkel to keep her opinions to herself or face the consequences of her actions . - kenneth v. tellis , canada chavez was not out of line because he was telling the truth .
he has not told a lie yet . - leon bernotas , us dalai lama 's visit to germany bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hesse premier roland koch was the first official to meet with the dalai lama a german cabinet minister should meet with the dalai lama .
tibet should be free from china .
but i am very pleased with china accepting international help with the earthquake from germany , the us , australia and other members of the international community and that the chinese premier visited the affected area fairly quickly and offered to help . - stuart john pearson , australia i think the cabinet members and other top leaders in the government of germany should go out of their way to meet with the dalai lama personally and to set up some sort of dialogue with his representatives .
if he has arranged to travel such a distance to see germany 's leaders , the very least they could do would be to greet him and try to arrange something approaching substantial conversation .
furthermore , it would be the right time to consider some form of special recognition for his holiness , an award like the honorary citizenship which the city of paris bestowed upon him on april 21 , 2008 . - birger salberg , jr . , us foreign minister franz walter steinmeier should meet with the dalai lama on behalf of the german people .
he should always support on what is right including helping countries with emergency situations and promoting human rights which is the most important issue for this generation . - gonpo tenzing , germany the new us embassy in berlin please accept our deepest apologies for the monstrosity in the form of an embassy that pretends to represent the american people in the very center of berlin .

but for pro-palestinian germans , as well as those who deal intensively with the middle east conflict , may 14 underscores the uniquely perilous tightrope walk germany must perform in its position toward those who have suffered under israeli occupation .
" there is no such thing as a german-palestinian relationship without the german-israeli relationship , " said rene wildangel , a historian and green party expert on the middle east .
" whether one thinks that 's good or bad , that 's the case right now .
if you look at german chancellor angela merkel 's recent trip to israel , she made it quite clear how close the german-israeli relationship is . "
merkel visited israel in march , when she became the first head of government to speak - in german - to the israeli parliament , the knesset .
but some people in germany , including palestinians residents , were upset that the chancellor did not raise the middle east conflict in her speech .
" there was a storm of outrage that went through the palestinian communities , " said erhard arendt , who runs the palaestina portal , germany 's largest internet forum for discussing palestinian affairs .
" hundreds of letters were written to newspapers , saying ' we did n't crop up in -lsb- the speech -rsb- at all .
we were totally forgotten . "
public opinion versus policy bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel 's speech to the knesset on march 18 drew praise and criticism the german government support for israel is , of course , programmed by germans ' sense of shame and guilt for the holocaust , as well as their desire to atone concretely for the horrors of the past .
but the german people are often far more sympathetic to palestinian plight and far more willing to criticize israel than their government .
" according to one survey , 63 percent of the populace does n't think israel 's policies are right , " arendt said .
germans ' empathy for the palestinians often originates in attempts to come to terms with their own past .
" without doubt , the fact that i was intensely interested in the holocaust led me to get involved in palestinian affairs , " said arendt , who was born in 1941 .
" that certainly strengthened the idea in me that nothing even remotely similar should be allowed to happen again - anywhere and at any time . "
germans ' attitudes differ from opinion poll to opinion poll , depending on which questions are asked .
but certain hot-button issues perennially elicit german opposition to israeli government policies .
" there 's the occupation and the very difficult situation in gaza , as we 've seen in the past few months , " wildangel said .
" it 's a humanitarian problem connected to the israeli blockade in which the eu is also involved .
i think that topics like this , or the building israeli settlements in the west bank , makes germans feel that they have to voice criticism . "
historical triangle bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : israel 's blockade of the gaza strip is just the latest crisis in the region in germany , the palestinian cause continues to be associated with the extreme political left .
because it viewed nazism as a product of western capitalism , communist east germany took no responsibility for the holocaust .
it was openly hostile to israel and at least nominally supportive of palestinians ' desire for a state of their own .
and in the 1970s , the anti-imperialist terrorist group raf in west germany and palestinian militants also identified closely with one another .
most spectacularly , members of a group called " the popular front for the liberation of palestine " hijacked a lufthansa plane in 1977 , demanding among other things the release of raf terrorists from prison .
german special forces successfully stormed the plane at mogadishu airport , killing the hijackers .
such incidents shocked mainstream germans and their government .
" i do n't think that this course of action was very useful to the palestinians , " wildangel said .
" i see it as an extreme , and ultimately marginal , chapter in the history of german-palestinian relations . "
faint prospects for change bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the eu may be the best hope for easing german-palestinian relations there is little chance that germany will decrease the support , financial or military , it offers to israel - although german palestinian advocates continue to argue that the country has a responsibility to do precisely that .
" we should be criticizing , making demands and taking action , " arendt said .
" providing weapons to a crisis region violates every international agreement there is , yet weapons are delivered to israel , including armored scout cars , that are used to kill palestinians . "
but the situation could change somewhat if foreign policy is de-nationalized .
" i think the palestinians have to recognize what the relationship between germany and israel is and acknowledge that the past happened , " wildangel said .
" but they can expect the european union - and that 's the level where the financial and political decisions are made now - to be critical of israeli state polices wherever they are problematic for the palestinians and the peace process .

but for pro-palestinian germans , as well as those who deal intensively with the middle east conflict , may 14 underscores the uniquely perilous tightrope walk germany must perform in its position toward those who have suffered under israeli occupation .
" there is no such thing as a german-palestinian relationship without the german-israeli relationship , " said rene wildangel , a historian and green party expert on the middle east .
" whether one thinks that 's good or bad , that 's the case right now .
if you look at german chancellor angela merkel 's recent trip to israel , she made it quite clear how close the german-israeli relationship is . "
merkel visited israel in march , when she became the first head of government to speak - in german - to the israeli parliament , the knesset .
but some people in germany , including palestinians residents , were upset that the chancellor did not raise the middle east conflict in her speech .
" there was a storm of outrage that went through the palestinian communities , " said erhard arendt , who runs the palaestina portal , germany 's largest internet forum for discussing palestinian affairs .
" hundreds of letters were written to newspapers , saying ' we did n't crop up in -lsb- the speech -rsb- at all .

but the german people are often far more sympathetic to palestinian plight and far more willing to criticize israel than their government .
" according to one survey , 63 percent of the populace does n't think israel 's policies are right , " arendt said .
germans ' empathy for the palestinians often originates in attempts to come to terms with their own past .
" without doubt , the fact that i was intensely interested in the holocaust led me to get involved in palestinian affairs , " said arendt , who was born in 1941 .
" that certainly strengthened the idea in me that nothing even remotely similar should be allowed to happen again - anywhere and at any time . "
germans ' attitudes differ from opinion poll to opinion poll , depending on which questions are asked .
but certain hot-button issues perennially elicit german opposition to israeli government policies .
" there 's the occupation and the very difficult situation in gaza , as we 've seen in the past few months , " wildangel said .
" it 's a humanitarian problem connected to the israeli blockade in which the eu is also involved .
i think that topics like this , or the building israeli settlements in the west bank , makes germans feel that they have to voice criticism . "

because it viewed nazism as a product of western capitalism , communist east germany took no responsibility for the holocaust .
it was openly hostile to israel and at least nominally supportive of palestinians ' desire for a state of their own .
and in the 1970s , the anti-imperialist terrorist group raf in west germany and palestinian militants also identified closely with one another .
most spectacularly , members of a group called " the popular front for the liberation of palestine " hijacked a lufthansa plane in 1977 , demanding among other things the release of raf terrorists from prison .
german special forces successfully stormed the plane at mogadishu airport , killing the hijackers .
such incidents shocked mainstream germans and their government .

she comes here and throws stones , for reasons i do not know .
some european heads of state come in order to meet with us , and already before their arrival are throwing stones . " the tit for tat between the venezuelan and german leaders started when merkel told german news agency dpa in an interview ahead of this week 's summit of the european union , latin american and caribbean nations that the left-wing chavez is not the voice of the region . chavez replied aggressively late sunday in his weekly radio and television program , saying that merkel belongs to the political right , " the same right that supported hitler and fascism .

" " president lula can relax ; i can look after myself , " merkel said when asked whether brazil 's head-of-state could help smooth over the dispute . lula da silva was also optimistic about the upcoming meeting : " if i know chavez and merkel well , they will sit down , have a cup of coffee and peace will reign between caracas and bonn , " he said , mistakenly referring to germany 's former capital . the german chancellor traveled to latin america on tuesday and met with the brazilian president on wednesday in brasilia to discuss broader bilateral economic ties . merkel , chavez and some 60 leaders from the european union , latin america and the caribbean are set to meet friday and saturday in lima , for the summit that the two regions hold every two years . dw staff -lrb- kjb -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de theater -pipe- 15.05.2008 director explains allure of america-focused theater festival großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : putting known film actors on stage is one of hoffmann 's successful moves dw-world talked to frank hoffmann , the artistic director of the ruhrfestspiele theater festival , about his decision to make america , land of cinema , the focus of his 2008 season . the ruhrfestspiele , or ruhr theater festival , one of europe 's most important and oldest theater festivals , opened this year on may 1 , 2008 , and runs through june 15 , 2008 .
ever since it was born of a unique deal between miners and actors who traded coal for performances during the hard winter of 1946/47 , the festival has kept up the tradition of putting on top-quality international productions in germany 's working-class ruhr valley . luxembourg director frank hoffmann took the artistic helm of the festival in 2004 at a precarious time in its history , pulling it back from the brink of bankruptcy and boosting visitor numbers from year to year .
in a conversation with dw-world.de , he discussed his fascination with modern american theater , and divulged his recipe for success . in the past you have focused on different authors at the ruhr festival .
this year you took on a country , america .
why ? originally we wanted to stay with my concept of focusing on a playwright , and i thought it might be arthur miller .
but then it became clear to me that we had to take a broad look at american theater of the 20th century .
that era - from eugene o ’ neill , whom you can count as the father of american theater , to today ’ s authors - underwent a singular development .
i thought it was worth focusing the festival on it . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hoffmann 's approach has had popular appeal weren ’ t you concerned that featuring the us could stigmatize the festival ?
after all , many europeans these days are fed up with american politics .
and the us is much better known for its pop culture than for its high art . it 's true that the image of america is not necessarily very positive , especially among artists , and especially when it comes to foreign policy .
i ’ m critical too - whether about the iraq war or other things that have happened during the bush presidency .
still , america is a very great nation and a great culture , and you have to be able to separate those things .
i think us theater rises above pop culture . european authors early in the last century - strindberg , ibsen , kafka - they all influenced american theater incredibly .
the american authors have absorbed it and are giving it back to us , with a focus of their own . what sets american theater apart ? american theater has a strong tie to cinema , much more than in any other country .
playwrights like david mamet and sam shepard are also hollywood scriptwriters .
this tie between cinema and theater is present even when it comes to actors , who play both on the stage and screen .
and there were many plays that have been turned into films .
there are enough interesting ties to support a festival . your predecessor at the festival , frank castorf , lasted less than a year .
his avant garde approach turned off the public , and the festival almost went bankrupt .
you have been lauded for rescuing the festival by putting on plays people wanted to see , and pulling in big-name actors .
what message does that send about pushing artistic boundaries ? we sold more than 75,000 tickets this year , more than ever in the history of the festival .
which means we have to suit many peoples ’ tastes .
but i want to be clear that we do not just put on popular plays .
we have a lot of world premieres and germany premieres .
we do modern theater , unconventional theater . our public is ready to take in the new ; they demand it .
but they also want to see popular things . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : austere aesthetics are frequent in in festival productions i can ’ t say exactly what explains our success but i think it has to do with how we present theater to people .
there isn ’ t just one aesthetic or style at the festival , there are many different aesthetics .
and the interesting thing is they are all found side by side .
they all bump up against each other .
it is exciting . so what is your recipe for a good theater festival ? first , there is the idea of it being strongly focused on a given concept or topic .
in the past it was an author , like shakespeare , beckett or goethe .
it allowed the viewer to compare a variety of different productions of one author 's work , and compare them . second , i created the idea of having festivals within a festival .
we have a festival of world premieres - every year there are three .
we have a series called young theater , with plays by young actors and directors .
we have a cabaret festival , and a children ’ s festival .
we try to make clear divisions . do you , personally , advocate a certain type of theater ? i think one thing is important - it has to be a sensual experience .
on the other hand , it has to be an adventure for the mind .
i think it needs to have both of those sides . in the past you have directed plays by a lot of europeans and south americans .
this year you are directing " a moon for the misbegotten , " by eugene o ’ neill .

ever since it was born of a unique deal between miners and actors who traded coal for performances during the hard winter of 1946/47 , the festival has kept up the tradition of putting on top-quality international productions in germany 's working-class ruhr valley . luxembourg director frank hoffmann took the artistic helm of the festival in 2004 at a precarious time in its history , pulling it back from the brink of bankruptcy and boosting visitor numbers from year to year .
in a conversation with dw-world.de , he discussed his fascination with modern american theater , and divulged his recipe for success . in the past you have focused on different authors at the ruhr festival .
this year you took on a country , america .
why ? originally we wanted to stay with my concept of focusing on a playwright , and i thought it might be arthur miller .
but then it became clear to me that we had to take a broad look at american theater of the 20th century .
that era - from eugene o ’ neill , whom you can count as the father of american theater , to today ’ s authors - underwent a singular development .
i thought it was worth focusing the festival on it . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hoffmann 's approach has had popular appeal weren ’ t you concerned that featuring the us could stigmatize the festival ?
after all , many europeans these days are fed up with american politics .
and the us is much better known for its pop culture than for its high art . it 's true that the image of america is not necessarily very positive , especially among artists , and especially when it comes to foreign policy .
i ’ m critical too - whether about the iraq war or other things that have happened during the bush presidency .
still , america is a very great nation and a great culture , and you have to be able to separate those things .
i think us theater rises above pop culture . european authors early in the last century - strindberg , ibsen , kafka - they all influenced american theater incredibly .
the american authors have absorbed it and are giving it back to us , with a focus of their own . what sets american theater apart ? american theater has a strong tie to cinema , much more than in any other country .
playwrights like david mamet and sam shepard are also hollywood scriptwriters .
this tie between cinema and theater is present even when it comes to actors , who play both on the stage and screen .
and there were many plays that have been turned into films .
there are enough interesting ties to support a festival . your predecessor at the festival , frank castorf , lasted less than a year .
his avant garde approach turned off the public , and the festival almost went bankrupt .
you have been lauded for rescuing the festival by putting on plays people wanted to see , and pulling in big-name actors .
what message does that send about pushing artistic boundaries ? we sold more than 75,000 tickets this year , more than ever in the history of the festival .
which means we have to suit many peoples ’ tastes .
but i want to be clear that we do not just put on popular plays .
we have a lot of world premieres and germany premieres .
we do modern theater , unconventional theater . our public is ready to take in the new ; they demand it .
but they also want to see popular things . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : austere aesthetics are frequent in in festival productions i can ’ t say exactly what explains our success but i think it has to do with how we present theater to people .
there isn ’ t just one aesthetic or style at the festival , there are many different aesthetics .
and the interesting thing is they are all found side by side .
they all bump up against each other .
it is exciting . so what is your recipe for a good theater festival ? first , there is the idea of it being strongly focused on a given concept or topic .
in the past it was an author , like shakespeare , beckett or goethe .
it allowed the viewer to compare a variety of different productions of one author 's work , and compare them . second , i created the idea of having festivals within a festival .
we have a festival of world premieres - every year there are three .
we have a series called young theater , with plays by young actors and directors .
we have a cabaret festival , and a children ’ s festival .
we try to make clear divisions . do you , personally , advocate a certain type of theater ? i think one thing is important - it has to be a sensual experience .
on the other hand , it has to be an adventure for the mind .
i think it needs to have both of those sides . in the past you have directed plays by a lot of europeans and south americans .
this year you are directing " a moon for the misbegotten , " by eugene o ’ neill .
was it a different experience for you ? no matter what i am directing , my method is the same .
i explore the play to its depths , and try to find out what holds it together .
in the context of this festival , of course , the subject of america had to be dealt with . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the troupe kataklo combine sport and theater i found it fascinating to work on this play because i have never been closer to using language of film - and not because i used any media in the production .

ever since it was born of a unique deal between miners and actors who traded coal for performances during the hard winter of 1946/47 , the festival has kept up the tradition of putting on top-quality international productions in germany 's working-class ruhr valley . luxembourg director frank hoffmann took the artistic helm of the festival in 2004 at a precarious time in its history , pulling it back from the brink of bankruptcy and boosting visitor numbers from year to year .
in a conversation with dw-world.de , he discussed his fascination with modern american theater , and divulged his recipe for success . in the past you have focused on different authors at the ruhr festival .
this year you took on a country , america .
why ? originally we wanted to stay with my concept of focusing on a playwright , and i thought it might be arthur miller .
but then it became clear to me that we had to take a broad look at american theater of the 20th century .
that era - from eugene o ’ neill , whom you can count as the father of american theater , to today ’ s authors - underwent a singular development .
i thought it was worth focusing the festival on it . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hoffmann 's approach has had popular appeal weren ’ t you concerned that featuring the us could stigmatize the festival ?
after all , many europeans these days are fed up with american politics .
and the us is much better known for its pop culture than for its high art . it 's true that the image of america is not necessarily very positive , especially among artists , and especially when it comes to foreign policy .
i ’ m critical too - whether about the iraq war or other things that have happened during the bush presidency .
still , america is a very great nation and a great culture , and you have to be able to separate those things .
i think us theater rises above pop culture . european authors early in the last century - strindberg , ibsen , kafka - they all influenced american theater incredibly .
the american authors have absorbed it and are giving it back to us , with a focus of their own . what sets american theater apart ? american theater has a strong tie to cinema , much more than in any other country .
playwrights like david mamet and sam shepard are also hollywood scriptwriters .
this tie between cinema and theater is present even when it comes to actors , who play both on the stage and screen .
and there were many plays that have been turned into films .
there are enough interesting ties to support a festival . your predecessor at the festival , frank castorf , lasted less than a year .
his avant garde approach turned off the public , and the festival almost went bankrupt .
you have been lauded for rescuing the festival by putting on plays people wanted to see , and pulling in big-name actors .
what message does that send about pushing artistic boundaries ? we sold more than 75,000 tickets this year , more than ever in the history of the festival .
which means we have to suit many peoples ’ tastes .
but i want to be clear that we do not just put on popular plays .
we have a lot of world premieres and germany premieres .
we do modern theater , unconventional theater . our public is ready to take in the new ; they demand it .
but they also want to see popular things . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : austere aesthetics are frequent in in festival productions i can ’ t say exactly what explains our success but i think it has to do with how we present theater to people .
there isn ’ t just one aesthetic or style at the festival , there are many different aesthetics .
and the interesting thing is they are all found side by side .
they all bump up against each other .
it is exciting . so what is your recipe for a good theater festival ? first , there is the idea of it being strongly focused on a given concept or topic .
in the past it was an author , like shakespeare , beckett or goethe .
it allowed the viewer to compare a variety of different productions of one author 's work , and compare them . second , i created the idea of having festivals within a festival .
we have a festival of world premieres - every year there are three .
we have a series called young theater , with plays by young actors and directors .
we have a cabaret festival , and a children ’ s festival .
we try to make clear divisions . do you , personally , advocate a certain type of theater ? i think one thing is important - it has to be a sensual experience .
on the other hand , it has to be an adventure for the mind .
i think it needs to have both of those sides . in the past you have directed plays by a lot of europeans and south americans .
this year you are directing " a moon for the misbegotten , " by eugene o ’ neill .
was it a different experience for you ? no matter what i am directing , my method is the same .
i explore the play to its depths , and try to find out what holds it together .
in the context of this festival , of course , the subject of america had to be dealt with . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the troupe kataklo combine sport and theater i found it fascinating to work on this play because i have never been closer to using language of film - and not because i used any media in the production .
i ’ m talking in terms of the spirit of the play .
it was important for me to tie together the emotionality of cinema with the directness of theater . you said arthur miller was the starting point for this festival , and you are showcasing two of his plays : " the crucible " and " resurrection blues . "
both are on very political topics .
were you trying to make a point ? there are so many plays that i think are very current , beyond their time .
they have everything to do with our daily reality .
as a director , i can not avoid dealing with political issues .
and you can ’ t take on the topic of america without asking political questions . this year i am also directing " true west , " by sam shepard .
it is a piece from 1980 , but while i directed it i was very conscious of 9/11 .
you read this play differently knowing that 9/11 happened , and the audience sees it differently .
it is very enriching . interview : jennifer abramsohn send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the southwestern state has a law that bans " exterior expressions of religious confession . " the so-called " headscarf debate " is a long-raging one in germany , home to more than 3 million muslims , most of turkish origin .

but for pro-palestinian germans , as well as those who deal intensively with the middle east conflict , may 14 underscores the uniquely perilous tightrope walk germany must perform in its position toward those who have suffered under israeli occupation .
" there is no such thing as a german-palestinian relationship without the german-israeli relationship , " said rene wildangel , a historian and green party expert on the middle east .
" whether one thinks that 's good or bad , that 's the case right now .
if you look at german chancellor angela merkel 's recent trip to israel , she made it quite clear how close the german-israeli relationship is . "
merkel visited israel in march , when she became the first head of government to speak - in german - to the israeli parliament , the knesset .
but some people in germany , including palestinians residents , were upset that the chancellor did not raise the middle east conflict in her speech .
" there was a storm of outrage that went through the palestinian communities , " said erhard arendt , who runs the palaestina portal , germany 's largest internet forum for discussing palestinian affairs .
" hundreds of letters were written to newspapers , saying ' we did n't crop up in -lsb- the speech -rsb- at all .
we were totally forgotten . "
public opinion versus policy bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel 's speech to the knesset on march 18 drew praise and criticism the german government support for israel is , of course , programmed by germans ' sense of shame and guilt for the holocaust , as well as their desire to atone concretely for the horrors of the past .
but the german people are often far more sympathetic to palestinian plight and far more willing to criticize israel than their government .
" according to one survey , 63 percent of the populace does n't think israel 's policies are right , " arendt said .
germans ' empathy for the palestinians often originates in attempts to come to terms with their own past .
" without doubt , the fact that i was intensely interested in the holocaust led me to get involved in palestinian affairs , " said arendt , who was born in 1941 .
" that certainly strengthened the idea in me that nothing even remotely similar should be allowed to happen again - anywhere and at any time . "
germans ' attitudes differ from opinion poll to opinion poll , depending on which questions are asked .
but certain hot-button issues perennially elicit german opposition to israeli government policies .
" there 's the occupation and the very difficult situation in gaza , as we 've seen in the past few months , " wildangel said .
" it 's a humanitarian problem connected to the israeli blockade in which the eu is also involved .
i think that topics like this , or the building israeli settlements in the west bank , makes germans feel that they have to voice criticism . "
historical triangle bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : israel 's blockade of the gaza strip is just the latest crisis in the region in germany , the palestinian cause continues to be associated with the extreme political left .
because it viewed nazism as a product of western capitalism , communist east germany took no responsibility for the holocaust .
it was openly hostile to israel and at least nominally supportive of palestinians ' desire for a state of their own .
and in the 1970s , the anti-imperialist terrorist group raf in west germany and palestinian militants also identified closely with one another .
most spectacularly , members of a group called " the popular front for the liberation of palestine " hijacked a lufthansa plane in 1977 , demanding among other things the release of raf terrorists from prison .
german special forces successfully stormed the plane at mogadishu airport , killing the hijackers .
such incidents shocked mainstream germans and their government .
" i do n't think that this course of action was very useful to the palestinians , " wildangel said .
" i see it as an extreme , and ultimately marginal , chapter in the history of german-palestinian relations . "
faint prospects for change bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the eu may be the best hope for easing german-palestinian relations there is little chance that germany will decrease the support , financial or military , it offers to israel - although german palestinian advocates continue to argue that the country has a responsibility to do precisely that .
" we should be criticizing , making demands and taking action , " arendt said .
" providing weapons to a crisis region violates every international agreement there is , yet weapons are delivered to israel , including armored scout cars , that are used to kill palestinians . "
but the situation could change somewhat if foreign policy is de-nationalized .
" i think the palestinians have to recognize what the relationship between germany and israel is and acknowledge that the past happened , " wildangel said .
" but they can expect the european union - and that 's the level where the financial and political decisions are made now - to be critical of israeli state polices wherever they are problematic for the palestinians and the peace process .

ever since it was born of a unique deal between miners and actors who traded coal for performances during the hard winter of 1946/47 , the festival has kept up the tradition of putting on top-quality international productions in germany 's working-class ruhr valley . luxembourg director frank hoffmann took the artistic helm of the festival in 2004 at a precarious time in its history , pulling it back from the brink of bankruptcy and boosting visitor numbers from year to year .
in a conversation with dw-world.de , he discussed his fascination with modern american theater , and divulged his recipe for success . in the past you have focused on different authors at the ruhr festival .
this year you took on a country , america .
why ? originally we wanted to stay with my concept of focusing on a playwright , and i thought it might be arthur miller .
but then it became clear to me that we had to take a broad look at american theater of the 20th century .
that era - from eugene o ’ neill , whom you can count as the father of american theater , to today ’ s authors - underwent a singular development .
i thought it was worth focusing the festival on it . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hoffmann 's approach has had popular appeal weren ’ t you concerned that featuring the us could stigmatize the festival ?
after all , many europeans these days are fed up with american politics .
and the us is much better known for its pop culture than for its high art . it 's true that the image of america is not necessarily very positive , especially among artists , and especially when it comes to foreign policy .
i ’ m critical too - whether about the iraq war or other things that have happened during the bush presidency .
still , america is a very great nation and a great culture , and you have to be able to separate those things .
i think us theater rises above pop culture . european authors early in the last century - strindberg , ibsen , kafka - they all influenced american theater incredibly .
the american authors have absorbed it and are giving it back to us , with a focus of their own . what sets american theater apart ? american theater has a strong tie to cinema , much more than in any other country .
playwrights like david mamet and sam shepard are also hollywood scriptwriters .
this tie between cinema and theater is present even when it comes to actors , who play both on the stage and screen .
and there were many plays that have been turned into films .
there are enough interesting ties to support a festival . your predecessor at the festival , frank castorf , lasted less than a year .
his avant garde approach turned off the public , and the festival almost went bankrupt .
you have been lauded for rescuing the festival by putting on plays people wanted to see , and pulling in big-name actors .
what message does that send about pushing artistic boundaries ? we sold more than 75,000 tickets this year , more than ever in the history of the festival .
which means we have to suit many peoples ’ tastes .
but i want to be clear that we do not just put on popular plays .
we have a lot of world premieres and germany premieres .
we do modern theater , unconventional theater . our public is ready to take in the new ; they demand it .
but they also want to see popular things . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : austere aesthetics are frequent in in festival productions i can ’ t say exactly what explains our success but i think it has to do with how we present theater to people .
there isn ’ t just one aesthetic or style at the festival , there are many different aesthetics .
and the interesting thing is they are all found side by side .
they all bump up against each other .
it is exciting . so what is your recipe for a good theater festival ? first , there is the idea of it being strongly focused on a given concept or topic .
in the past it was an author , like shakespeare , beckett or goethe .
it allowed the viewer to compare a variety of different productions of one author 's work , and compare them . second , i created the idea of having festivals within a festival .
we have a festival of world premieres - every year there are three .
we have a series called young theater , with plays by young actors and directors .
we have a cabaret festival , and a children ’ s festival .
we try to make clear divisions . do you , personally , advocate a certain type of theater ? i think one thing is important - it has to be a sensual experience .
on the other hand , it has to be an adventure for the mind .
i think it needs to have both of those sides . in the past you have directed plays by a lot of europeans and south americans .
this year you are directing " a moon for the misbegotten , " by eugene o ’ neill .
was it a different experience for you ? no matter what i am directing , my method is the same .
i explore the play to its depths , and try to find out what holds it together .
in the context of this festival , of course , the subject of america had to be dealt with . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the troupe kataklo combine sport and theater i found it fascinating to work on this play because i have never been closer to using language of film - and not because i used any media in the production .
i ’ m talking in terms of the spirit of the play .
it was important for me to tie together the emotionality of cinema with the directness of theater . you said arthur miller was the starting point for this festival , and you are showcasing two of his plays : " the crucible " and " resurrection blues . "
both are on very political topics .
were you trying to make a point ? there are so many plays that i think are very current , beyond their time .
they have everything to do with our daily reality .
as a director , i can not avoid dealing with political issues .
and you can ’ t take on the topic of america without asking political questions . this year i am also directing " true west , " by sam shepard .
it is a piece from 1980 , but while i directed it i was very conscious of 9/11 .
you read this play differently knowing that 9/11 happened , and the audience sees it differently .
it is very enriching . interview : jennifer abramsohn send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de middle east -pipe- 15.05.2008 german past complicates relations with palestinians großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : between 70,000 and 100,000 palestinians live in germany as israel celebrated its 60th anniversary , dw-world spoke to two experts about the problems german-jewish history creates for present-day germany 's policy toward the palestinians . the anniversary of the declaration of an independent jewish state on wednesday , may 14 was occasion for celebration for most jews - and a chance for germany to demonstrate its continue support for israel .
but for pro-palestinian germans , as well as those who deal intensively with the middle east conflict , may 14 underscores the uniquely perilous tightrope walk germany must perform in its position toward those who have suffered under israeli occupation .
" there is no such thing as a german-palestinian relationship without the german-israeli relationship , " said rene wildangel , a historian and green party expert on the middle east .
" whether one thinks that 's good or bad , that 's the case right now .
if you look at german chancellor angela merkel 's recent trip to israel , she made it quite clear how close the german-israeli relationship is . "
merkel visited israel in march , when she became the first head of government to speak - in german - to the israeli parliament , the knesset .
but some people in germany , including palestinians residents , were upset that the chancellor did not raise the middle east conflict in her speech .
" there was a storm of outrage that went through the palestinian communities , " said erhard arendt , who runs the palaestina portal , germany 's largest internet forum for discussing palestinian affairs .
" hundreds of letters were written to newspapers , saying ' we did n't crop up in -lsb- the speech -rsb- at all .
we were totally forgotten . "
public opinion versus policy bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel 's speech to the knesset on march 18 drew praise and criticism the german government support for israel is , of course , programmed by germans ' sense of shame and guilt for the holocaust , as well as their desire to atone concretely for the horrors of the past .
but the german people are often far more sympathetic to palestinian plight and far more willing to criticize israel than their government .
" according to one survey , 63 percent of the populace does n't think israel 's policies are right , " arendt said .
germans ' empathy for the palestinians often originates in attempts to come to terms with their own past .
" without doubt , the fact that i was intensely interested in the holocaust led me to get involved in palestinian affairs , " said arendt , who was born in 1941 .
" that certainly strengthened the idea in me that nothing even remotely similar should be allowed to happen again - anywhere and at any time . "
germans ' attitudes differ from opinion poll to opinion poll , depending on which questions are asked .
but certain hot-button issues perennially elicit german opposition to israeli government policies .
" there 's the occupation and the very difficult situation in gaza , as we 've seen in the past few months , " wildangel said .
" it 's a humanitarian problem connected to the israeli blockade in which the eu is also involved .
i think that topics like this , or the building israeli settlements in the west bank , makes germans feel that they have to voice criticism . "
historical triangle bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : israel 's blockade of the gaza strip is just the latest crisis in the region in germany , the palestinian cause continues to be associated with the extreme political left .
because it viewed nazism as a product of western capitalism , communist east germany took no responsibility for the holocaust .
it was openly hostile to israel and at least nominally supportive of palestinians ' desire for a state of their own .
and in the 1970s , the anti-imperialist terrorist group raf in west germany and palestinian militants also identified closely with one another .
most spectacularly , members of a group called " the popular front for the liberation of palestine " hijacked a lufthansa plane in 1977 , demanding among other things the release of raf terrorists from prison .
german special forces successfully stormed the plane at mogadishu airport , killing the hijackers .
such incidents shocked mainstream germans and their government .
" i do n't think that this course of action was very useful to the palestinians , " wildangel said .
" i see it as an extreme , and ultimately marginal , chapter in the history of german-palestinian relations . "
faint prospects for change bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the eu may be the best hope for easing german-palestinian relations there is little chance that germany will decrease the support , financial or military , it offers to israel - although german palestinian advocates continue to argue that the country has a responsibility to do precisely that .
" we should be criticizing , making demands and taking action , " arendt said .
" providing weapons to a crisis region violates every international agreement there is , yet weapons are delivered to israel , including armored scout cars , that are used to kill palestinians . "
but the situation could change somewhat if foreign policy is de-nationalized .
" i think the palestinians have to recognize what the relationship between germany and israel is and acknowledge that the past happened , " wildangel said .
" but they can expect the european union - and that 's the level where the financial and political decisions are made now - to be critical of israeli state polices wherever they are problematic for the palestinians and the peace process .
" palestinians can expect that german and european politicians to push seriously for a peaceful settlement , " wildangel added .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de middle east -pipe- 15.05.2008 german past complicates relations with palestinians großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : between 70,000 and 100,000 palestinians live in germany as israel celebrated its 60th anniversary , dw-world spoke to two experts about the problems german-jewish history creates for present-day germany 's policy toward the palestinians . the anniversary of the declaration of an independent jewish state on wednesday , may 14 was occasion for celebration for most jews - and a chance for germany to demonstrate its continue support for israel .
but for pro-palestinian germans , as well as those who deal intensively with the middle east conflict , may 14 underscores the uniquely perilous tightrope walk germany must perform in its position toward those who have suffered under israeli occupation .
" there is no such thing as a german-palestinian relationship without the german-israeli relationship , " said rene wildangel , a historian and green party expert on the middle east .
" whether one thinks that 's good or bad , that 's the case right now .
if you look at german chancellor angela merkel 's recent trip to israel , she made it quite clear how close the german-israeli relationship is . "
merkel visited israel in march , when she became the first head of government to speak - in german - to the israeli parliament , the knesset .
but some people in germany , including palestinians residents , were upset that the chancellor did not raise the middle east conflict in her speech .
" there was a storm of outrage that went through the palestinian communities , " said erhard arendt , who runs the palaestina portal , germany 's largest internet forum for discussing palestinian affairs .
" hundreds of letters were written to newspapers , saying ' we did n't crop up in -lsb- the speech -rsb- at all .
we were totally forgotten . "
public opinion versus policy bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel 's speech to the knesset on march 18 drew praise and criticism the german government support for israel is , of course , programmed by germans ' sense of shame and guilt for the holocaust , as well as their desire to atone concretely for the horrors of the past .
but the german people are often far more sympathetic to palestinian plight and far more willing to criticize israel than their government .
" according to one survey , 63 percent of the populace does n't think israel 's policies are right , " arendt said .
germans ' empathy for the palestinians often originates in attempts to come to terms with their own past .
" without doubt , the fact that i was intensely interested in the holocaust led me to get involved in palestinian affairs , " said arendt , who was born in 1941 .
" that certainly strengthened the idea in me that nothing even remotely similar should be allowed to happen again - anywhere and at any time . "
germans ' attitudes differ from opinion poll to opinion poll , depending on which questions are asked .
but certain hot-button issues perennially elicit german opposition to israeli government policies .
" there 's the occupation and the very difficult situation in gaza , as we 've seen in the past few months , " wildangel said .
" it 's a humanitarian problem connected to the israeli blockade in which the eu is also involved .
i think that topics like this , or the building israeli settlements in the west bank , makes germans feel that they have to voice criticism . "
historical triangle bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : israel 's blockade of the gaza strip is just the latest crisis in the region in germany , the palestinian cause continues to be associated with the extreme political left .
because it viewed nazism as a product of western capitalism , communist east germany took no responsibility for the holocaust .
it was openly hostile to israel and at least nominally supportive of palestinians ' desire for a state of their own .
and in the 1970s , the anti-imperialist terrorist group raf in west germany and palestinian militants also identified closely with one another .
most spectacularly , members of a group called " the popular front for the liberation of palestine " hijacked a lufthansa plane in 1977 , demanding among other things the release of raf terrorists from prison .
german special forces successfully stormed the plane at mogadishu airport , killing the hijackers .
such incidents shocked mainstream germans and their government .
" i do n't think that this course of action was very useful to the palestinians , " wildangel said .
" i see it as an extreme , and ultimately marginal , chapter in the history of german-palestinian relations . "
faint prospects for change bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the eu may be the best hope for easing german-palestinian relations there is little chance that germany will decrease the support , financial or military , it offers to israel - although german palestinian advocates continue to argue that the country has a responsibility to do precisely that .
" we should be criticizing , making demands and taking action , " arendt said .
" providing weapons to a crisis region violates every international agreement there is , yet weapons are delivered to israel , including armored scout cars , that are used to kill palestinians . "
but the situation could change somewhat if foreign policy is de-nationalized .
" i think the palestinians have to recognize what the relationship between germany and israel is and acknowledge that the past happened , " wildangel said .
" but they can expect the european union - and that 's the level where the financial and political decisions are made now - to be critical of israeli state polices wherever they are problematic for the palestinians and the peace process .
" palestinians can expect that german and european politicians to push seriously for a peaceful settlement , " wildangel added .

ever since it was born of a unique deal between miners and actors who traded coal for performances during the hard winter of 1946/47 , the festival has kept up the tradition of putting on top-quality international productions in germany 's working-class ruhr valley . luxembourg director frank hoffmann took the artistic helm of the festival in 2004 at a precarious time in its history , pulling it back from the brink of bankruptcy and boosting visitor numbers from year to year .
in a conversation with dw-world.de , he discussed his fascination with modern american theater , and divulged his recipe for success . in the past you have focused on different authors at the ruhr festival .
this year you took on a country , america .
why ? originally we wanted to stay with my concept of focusing on a playwright , and i thought it might be arthur miller .
but then it became clear to me that we had to take a broad look at american theater of the 20th century .
that era - from eugene o ’ neill , whom you can count as the father of american theater , to today ’ s authors - underwent a singular development .
i thought it was worth focusing the festival on it . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hoffmann 's approach has had popular appeal weren ’ t you concerned that featuring the us could stigmatize the festival ?
after all , many europeans these days are fed up with american politics .
and the us is much better known for its pop culture than for its high art . it 's true that the image of america is not necessarily very positive , especially among artists , and especially when it comes to foreign policy .
i ’ m critical too - whether about the iraq war or other things that have happened during the bush presidency .
still , america is a very great nation and a great culture , and you have to be able to separate those things .
i think us theater rises above pop culture . european authors early in the last century - strindberg , ibsen , kafka - they all influenced american theater incredibly .
the american authors have absorbed it and are giving it back to us , with a focus of their own . what sets american theater apart ? american theater has a strong tie to cinema , much more than in any other country .
playwrights like david mamet and sam shepard are also hollywood scriptwriters .
this tie between cinema and theater is present even when it comes to actors , who play both on the stage and screen .
and there were many plays that have been turned into films .
there are enough interesting ties to support a festival . your predecessor at the festival , frank castorf , lasted less than a year .
his avant garde approach turned off the public , and the festival almost went bankrupt .
you have been lauded for rescuing the festival by putting on plays people wanted to see , and pulling in big-name actors .
what message does that send about pushing artistic boundaries ? we sold more than 75,000 tickets this year , more than ever in the history of the festival .
which means we have to suit many peoples ’ tastes .
but i want to be clear that we do not just put on popular plays .
we have a lot of world premieres and germany premieres .
we do modern theater , unconventional theater . our public is ready to take in the new ; they demand it .
but they also want to see popular things . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : austere aesthetics are frequent in in festival productions i can ’ t say exactly what explains our success but i think it has to do with how we present theater to people .
there isn ’ t just one aesthetic or style at the festival , there are many different aesthetics .
and the interesting thing is they are all found side by side .
they all bump up against each other .
it is exciting . so what is your recipe for a good theater festival ? first , there is the idea of it being strongly focused on a given concept or topic .
in the past it was an author , like shakespeare , beckett or goethe .
it allowed the viewer to compare a variety of different productions of one author 's work , and compare them . second , i created the idea of having festivals within a festival .
we have a festival of world premieres - every year there are three .
we have a series called young theater , with plays by young actors and directors .
we have a cabaret festival , and a children ’ s festival .
we try to make clear divisions . do you , personally , advocate a certain type of theater ? i think one thing is important - it has to be a sensual experience .
on the other hand , it has to be an adventure for the mind .
i think it needs to have both of those sides . in the past you have directed plays by a lot of europeans and south americans .
this year you are directing " a moon for the misbegotten , " by eugene o ’ neill .
was it a different experience for you ? no matter what i am directing , my method is the same .
i explore the play to its depths , and try to find out what holds it together .
in the context of this festival , of course , the subject of america had to be dealt with . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the troupe kataklo combine sport and theater i found it fascinating to work on this play because i have never been closer to using language of film - and not because i used any media in the production .
i ’ m talking in terms of the spirit of the play .
it was important for me to tie together the emotionality of cinema with the directness of theater . you said arthur miller was the starting point for this festival , and you are showcasing two of his plays : " the crucible " and " resurrection blues . "
both are on very political topics .
were you trying to make a point ? there are so many plays that i think are very current , beyond their time .
they have everything to do with our daily reality .
as a director , i can not avoid dealing with political issues .
and you can ’ t take on the topic of america without asking political questions . this year i am also directing " true west , " by sam shepard .
it is a piece from 1980 , but while i directed it i was very conscious of 9/11 .
you read this play differently knowing that 9/11 happened , and the audience sees it differently .
it is very enriching . interview : jennifer abramsohn send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de media -pipe- 15.05.2008 false hitler doll reports vex ukraine großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the false reports caused a stir in ukraine and beyond prominent european media outlets recently circulated false reports of an adolf hitler doll being made in ukraine .
ukrainian journalist yevgeny minko said he was disappointed with how the erroneous story was handled . dw-world.de was among the european media sources to publish the falsified report on its english site in april 2008 .
it has since been removed from the web site .
the editors apologize to those readers who were offended by the publication of the article . yevgeny minko is editor-in-chief of telekritika , a monthly publication focusing on media issues in ukraine .
the following interview was conducted by email . dw-world.de : where did the inaccurate story originate and how did it spread ? yevgeny minko : the original story about the doll was published in the ukrainian newspaper dzerkalo tyzhnya -lrb- www.dt.ua -rrb- .
the author , andriy kapustin , described an incident of seeing a hitler doll manufactured in taiwan in one of kyiv 's novelty stores .
of course , he was not very pleased with what he saw .
he somewhat satirized the resemblance with the barbie doll , envisioning a hypothesized ukrainian family playing with the toy hitler .
nevertheless , he stressed that such a doll must not be welcome in a country that suffered from a nazi invasion during world war ii . this was a single incident of witnessing a hitler doll in kyiv .
no reports of massive sales are available . after a few days , -lsb- german news agency -rsb- dpa spread a brief translation of this feature .
their version contained a number of errors .
the text suggested that the hitler doll was going to be manufactured by a local company and would start selling in ukraine soon , which would definitely cause controversy in the country . as far as i understand , this erroneous translation was widespread and caused consequential reports in the media outside of ukraine . was the story correctly reported in the media outside of ukraine ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hitler invaded ukraine in 1941 , sending thousands to nazi concentration camps absolutely not .
first of all , russia 's first television channel made a very biased report , claiming that this hitler doll is a hit in kyiv , and queues of people willing to buy it were gathering in stores - although they failed to show these queues .
the report also implied that there were strong nazi tendencies in the policies of the ukrainian state . the bbc subsequently aired this report with an original text by jane hadden , although the latter was pretty close to the original . the daily telegraph and daily mail presented their own versions of the story .
the one from daily mail came out in classic tabloid style - shocking and provocative .
their feature roused response from readers who were horrified by the story . what were the most glaring omissions or mistakes in the article carried by the media outside of ukraine ? first , the doll is not made by a ukrainian manufacturer , it was made in taiwan .
second , there is no ukrainian manufacturer that plans to sell hitler dolls across ukraine .
hence , no one plans to sell this doll with a variety of accessories .
third , ukrainian supermarkets do not sell this doll on a massive scale .
it was witnessed in a single novelty store . do you agree with the suspicions of some that there is an anti-ukrainian agenda to the story ? well , i am not a fan of conspiracy theories , so i would rather not say there was a certain anti-ukrainian agenda on the part of the media that spread the story .
except perhaps for russia 's first channel , which is known for its anti-ukrainian attitude and propaganda-like methods .
the other cases seem to be the result of negligent , careless reporting .
sadly , it was the most famous european media outlets that failed to stand up to professional standards . do you think that the media outlets that carried the story considered a possible anti-ukrainian agenda ? the european media was very inaccurate in their reports .
for instance , very few of the reporters mentioned the original source of the story - dzerkalo tyzhnya newspaper .
the bbc did not make it clear that the shown footage was basically a b-roll made by -lsb- russia 's -rsb- first channel .
daily mail and deutsche welle failed to mention any original source for their reports . did the media that brought the inaccurate story respond to inquires in an appropriate manner ? not really .
we still do not have any responses from dpa .
bbc , daily telegraph and daily mail removed the hitler doll reports from their web sites , but did not explain the situation to their audiences . interview : nick amies send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de theater -pipe- 15.05.2008 director explains allure of america-focused theater festival großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : putting known film actors on stage is one of hoffmann 's successful moves dw-world talked to frank hoffmann , the artistic director of the ruhrfestspiele theater festival , about his decision to make america , land of cinema , the focus of his 2008 season . the ruhrfestspiele , or ruhr theater festival , one of europe 's most important and oldest theater festivals , opened this year on may 1 , 2008 , and runs through june 15 , 2008 .
ever since it was born of a unique deal between miners and actors who traded coal for performances during the hard winter of 1946/47 , the festival has kept up the tradition of putting on top-quality international productions in germany 's working-class ruhr valley . luxembourg director frank hoffmann took the artistic helm of the festival in 2004 at a precarious time in its history , pulling it back from the brink of bankruptcy and boosting visitor numbers from year to year .
in a conversation with dw-world.de , he discussed his fascination with modern american theater , and divulged his recipe for success . in the past you have focused on different authors at the ruhr festival .
this year you took on a country , america .
why ? originally we wanted to stay with my concept of focusing on a playwright , and i thought it might be arthur miller .
but then it became clear to me that we had to take a broad look at american theater of the 20th century .
that era - from eugene o ’ neill , whom you can count as the father of american theater , to today ’ s authors - underwent a singular development .
i thought it was worth focusing the festival on it . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hoffmann 's approach has had popular appeal weren ’ t you concerned that featuring the us could stigmatize the festival ?
after all , many europeans these days are fed up with american politics .
and the us is much better known for its pop culture than for its high art . it 's true that the image of america is not necessarily very positive , especially among artists , and especially when it comes to foreign policy .
i ’ m critical too - whether about the iraq war or other things that have happened during the bush presidency .
still , america is a very great nation and a great culture , and you have to be able to separate those things .
i think us theater rises above pop culture . european authors early in the last century - strindberg , ibsen , kafka - they all influenced american theater incredibly .
the american authors have absorbed it and are giving it back to us , with a focus of their own . what sets american theater apart ? american theater has a strong tie to cinema , much more than in any other country .
playwrights like david mamet and sam shepard are also hollywood scriptwriters .
this tie between cinema and theater is present even when it comes to actors , who play both on the stage and screen .
and there were many plays that have been turned into films .
there are enough interesting ties to support a festival . your predecessor at the festival , frank castorf , lasted less than a year .
his avant garde approach turned off the public , and the festival almost went bankrupt .
you have been lauded for rescuing the festival by putting on plays people wanted to see , and pulling in big-name actors .
what message does that send about pushing artistic boundaries ? we sold more than 75,000 tickets this year , more than ever in the history of the festival .
which means we have to suit many peoples ’ tastes .
but i want to be clear that we do not just put on popular plays .
we have a lot of world premieres and germany premieres .
we do modern theater , unconventional theater . our public is ready to take in the new ; they demand it .
but they also want to see popular things . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : austere aesthetics are frequent in in festival productions i can ’ t say exactly what explains our success but i think it has to do with how we present theater to people .
there isn ’ t just one aesthetic or style at the festival , there are many different aesthetics .
and the interesting thing is they are all found side by side .
they all bump up against each other .
it is exciting . so what is your recipe for a good theater festival ? first , there is the idea of it being strongly focused on a given concept or topic .
in the past it was an author , like shakespeare , beckett or goethe .
it allowed the viewer to compare a variety of different productions of one author 's work , and compare them . second , i created the idea of having festivals within a festival .
we have a festival of world premieres - every year there are three .
we have a series called young theater , with plays by young actors and directors .
we have a cabaret festival , and a children ’ s festival .
we try to make clear divisions . do you , personally , advocate a certain type of theater ? i think one thing is important - it has to be a sensual experience .
on the other hand , it has to be an adventure for the mind .
i think it needs to have both of those sides . in the past you have directed plays by a lot of europeans and south americans .
this year you are directing " a moon for the misbegotten , " by eugene o ’ neill .
was it a different experience for you ? no matter what i am directing , my method is the same .
i explore the play to its depths , and try to find out what holds it together .
in the context of this festival , of course , the subject of america had to be dealt with . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the troupe kataklo combine sport and theater i found it fascinating to work on this play because i have never been closer to using language of film - and not because i used any media in the production .
i ’ m talking in terms of the spirit of the play .
it was important for me to tie together the emotionality of cinema with the directness of theater . you said arthur miller was the starting point for this festival , and you are showcasing two of his plays : " the crucible " and " resurrection blues . "
both are on very political topics .
were you trying to make a point ? there are so many plays that i think are very current , beyond their time .
they have everything to do with our daily reality .
as a director , i can not avoid dealing with political issues .
and you can ’ t take on the topic of america without asking political questions . this year i am also directing " true west , " by sam shepard .
it is a piece from 1980 , but while i directed it i was very conscious of 9/11 .
you read this play differently knowing that 9/11 happened , and the audience sees it differently .
it is very enriching . interview : jennifer abramsohn send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the dalai lama said he was deeply affected by monday 's devastating earthquake that officials fear could have killed 50,000 in the southwestern chinese province of sichuan .
the 72-year-old , who was awarded the nobel peace prize in 1989 for his efforts to achieve a non-violent solution to the tibetan problem , said he would pray for the victims .
frankfurt was the opening leg of a five-day tour of germany which will see the dalai lama speak on human rights and meet with a member of chancellor angela merkel 's cabinet in berlin .
after a breakfast meeting with roland koch , the conservative premier of the state of hesse , he traveled to bochum where he conferred with juergen ruettgers , prime minister of north rhine- westphalia , germany 's most populous state .
ruettgers said after the talks that the dalai lama had briefed him on the meetings between his representatives and the chinese government held in the aftermath of the freedom demonstrations in march that left an undetermined number of dead .
the talks , in the chinese city of shenzhen , had failed to generate the trust that was necessary to resolve the issue , the dalai lama said .
spiritual leader condemns chinese suppression bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the dalai lama spent the first day pressing the flesh the dalai lama also took the opportunity to lash out once more at the " suppression " of anti-chinese unrest in tibet .
" the chinese political authorities ' reaction , as before , was suppression .
so it is very sad , " the tibetan spiritual leader said after arriving in germany .
on wednesday , china protested at the dalai lama 's planned meetings with development minister heidemarie wieczorek-zeul and legislators at the german parliament .
the " dalai lama is not a normal monk , but a political exile who carries out anti-chinese and separatist activities abroad under the guise of religion , human rights and autonomy , " a statement released by the chinese embassy said .
the talks with wieczorek-zeul and members of the parliamentary foreign affairs committee are due to take place on may 19 when the dalai lama will also deliver a speech at berlin 's brandenburg gate .
the run-up to the visit was marked by a domestic row because no one in merkel 's government was prepared to meet him , apparently fearing it could upset china .
the meeting with the economic assistance minister was arranged at the last minute .
lama unmoved by german domestic row over visit bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel met with the dalai lama during a 2007 visit , but is in latin america this week the chancellor is in latin america and her deputy , foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier , turned down an official request for a meeting , saying he does not have time .
the dalai lama said he was not put off by this .
some " leading personalities find it uncomfortable to talk to me , " he said , " but that is all right . "
merkel met the dalai lama at the federal chancellery last september , a move which led to a chill in relations between berlin and beijing that ended only in january after intense german diplomatic efforts .
chinese communist forces invaded tibet in 1950 .
since the tibetan resistance movement collapsed in 1959 , the dalai lama has lived in india , where the tibetan government-in-exile is based . dw staff / dpa -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de media -pipe- 15.05.2008 false hitler doll reports vex ukraine großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the false reports caused a stir in ukraine and beyond prominent european media outlets recently circulated false reports of an adolf hitler doll being made in ukraine .
ukrainian journalist yevgeny minko said he was disappointed with how the erroneous story was handled . dw-world.de was among the european media sources to publish the falsified report on its english site in april 2008 .
it has since been removed from the web site .
the editors apologize to those readers who were offended by the publication of the article . yevgeny minko is editor-in-chief of telekritika , a monthly publication focusing on media issues in ukraine .
the following interview was conducted by email . dw-world.de : where did the inaccurate story originate and how did it spread ? yevgeny minko : the original story about the doll was published in the ukrainian newspaper dzerkalo tyzhnya -lrb- www.dt.ua -rrb- .
the author , andriy kapustin , described an incident of seeing a hitler doll manufactured in taiwan in one of kyiv 's novelty stores .
of course , he was not very pleased with what he saw .
he somewhat satirized the resemblance with the barbie doll , envisioning a hypothesized ukrainian family playing with the toy hitler .
nevertheless , he stressed that such a doll must not be welcome in a country that suffered from a nazi invasion during world war ii . this was a single incident of witnessing a hitler doll in kyiv .
no reports of massive sales are available . after a few days , -lsb- german news agency -rsb- dpa spread a brief translation of this feature .
their version contained a number of errors .
the text suggested that the hitler doll was going to be manufactured by a local company and would start selling in ukraine soon , which would definitely cause controversy in the country . as far as i understand , this erroneous translation was widespread and caused consequential reports in the media outside of ukraine . was the story correctly reported in the media outside of ukraine ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hitler invaded ukraine in 1941 , sending thousands to nazi concentration camps absolutely not .
first of all , russia 's first television channel made a very biased report , claiming that this hitler doll is a hit in kyiv , and queues of people willing to buy it were gathering in stores - although they failed to show these queues .
the report also implied that there were strong nazi tendencies in the policies of the ukrainian state . the bbc subsequently aired this report with an original text by jane hadden , although the latter was pretty close to the original . the daily telegraph and daily mail presented their own versions of the story .
the one from daily mail came out in classic tabloid style - shocking and provocative .
their feature roused response from readers who were horrified by the story . what were the most glaring omissions or mistakes in the article carried by the media outside of ukraine ? first , the doll is not made by a ukrainian manufacturer , it was made in taiwan .
second , there is no ukrainian manufacturer that plans to sell hitler dolls across ukraine .
hence , no one plans to sell this doll with a variety of accessories .
third , ukrainian supermarkets do not sell this doll on a massive scale .
it was witnessed in a single novelty store . do you agree with the suspicions of some that there is an anti-ukrainian agenda to the story ? well , i am not a fan of conspiracy theories , so i would rather not say there was a certain anti-ukrainian agenda on the part of the media that spread the story .
except perhaps for russia 's first channel , which is known for its anti-ukrainian attitude and propaganda-like methods .
the other cases seem to be the result of negligent , careless reporting .
sadly , it was the most famous european media outlets that failed to stand up to professional standards . do you think that the media outlets that carried the story considered a possible anti-ukrainian agenda ? the european media was very inaccurate in their reports .
for instance , very few of the reporters mentioned the original source of the story - dzerkalo tyzhnya newspaper .
the bbc did not make it clear that the shown footage was basically a b-roll made by -lsb- russia 's -rsb- first channel .
daily mail and deutsche welle failed to mention any original source for their reports . did the media that brought the inaccurate story respond to inquires in an appropriate manner ? not really .
we still do not have any responses from dpa .
bbc , daily telegraph and daily mail removed the hitler doll reports from their web sites , but did not explain the situation to their audiences . interview : nick amies send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

ever since it was born of a unique deal between miners and actors who traded coal for performances during the hard winter of 1946/47 , the festival has kept up the tradition of putting on top-quality international productions in germany 's working-class ruhr valley . luxembourg director frank hoffmann took the artistic helm of the festival in 2004 at a precarious time in its history , pulling it back from the brink of bankruptcy and boosting visitor numbers from year to year .
in a conversation with dw-world.de , he discussed his fascination with modern american theater , and divulged his recipe for success . in the past you have focused on different authors at the ruhr festival .
this year you took on a country , america .
why ? originally we wanted to stay with my concept of focusing on a playwright , and i thought it might be arthur miller .
but then it became clear to me that we had to take a broad look at american theater of the 20th century .
that era - from eugene o ’ neill , whom you can count as the father of american theater , to today ’ s authors - underwent a singular development .
i thought it was worth focusing the festival on it . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hoffmann 's approach has had popular appeal weren ’ t you concerned that featuring the us could stigmatize the festival ?
after all , many europeans these days are fed up with american politics .
and the us is much better known for its pop culture than for its high art . it 's true that the image of america is not necessarily very positive , especially among artists , and especially when it comes to foreign policy .
i ’ m critical too - whether about the iraq war or other things that have happened during the bush presidency .
still , america is a very great nation and a great culture , and you have to be able to separate those things .
i think us theater rises above pop culture . european authors early in the last century - strindberg , ibsen , kafka - they all influenced american theater incredibly .
the american authors have absorbed it and are giving it back to us , with a focus of their own . what sets american theater apart ? american theater has a strong tie to cinema , much more than in any other country .
playwrights like david mamet and sam shepard are also hollywood scriptwriters .
this tie between cinema and theater is present even when it comes to actors , who play both on the stage and screen .
and there were many plays that have been turned into films .
there are enough interesting ties to support a festival . your predecessor at the festival , frank castorf , lasted less than a year .
his avant garde approach turned off the public , and the festival almost went bankrupt .
you have been lauded for rescuing the festival by putting on plays people wanted to see , and pulling in big-name actors .
what message does that send about pushing artistic boundaries ? we sold more than 75,000 tickets this year , more than ever in the history of the festival .
which means we have to suit many peoples ’ tastes .
but i want to be clear that we do not just put on popular plays .
we have a lot of world premieres and germany premieres .
we do modern theater , unconventional theater . our public is ready to take in the new ; they demand it .
but they also want to see popular things . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : austere aesthetics are frequent in in festival productions i can ’ t say exactly what explains our success but i think it has to do with how we present theater to people .
there isn ’ t just one aesthetic or style at the festival , there are many different aesthetics .
and the interesting thing is they are all found side by side .
they all bump up against each other .
it is exciting . so what is your recipe for a good theater festival ? first , there is the idea of it being strongly focused on a given concept or topic .
in the past it was an author , like shakespeare , beckett or goethe .
it allowed the viewer to compare a variety of different productions of one author 's work , and compare them . second , i created the idea of having festivals within a festival .
we have a festival of world premieres - every year there are three .
we have a series called young theater , with plays by young actors and directors .
we have a cabaret festival , and a children ’ s festival .
we try to make clear divisions . do you , personally , advocate a certain type of theater ? i think one thing is important - it has to be a sensual experience .
on the other hand , it has to be an adventure for the mind .
i think it needs to have both of those sides . in the past you have directed plays by a lot of europeans and south americans .
this year you are directing " a moon for the misbegotten , " by eugene o ’ neill .
was it a different experience for you ? no matter what i am directing , my method is the same .
i explore the play to its depths , and try to find out what holds it together .
in the context of this festival , of course , the subject of america had to be dealt with . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the troupe kataklo combine sport and theater i found it fascinating to work on this play because i have never been closer to using language of film - and not because i used any media in the production .
i ’ m talking in terms of the spirit of the play .
it was important for me to tie together the emotionality of cinema with the directness of theater . you said arthur miller was the starting point for this festival , and you are showcasing two of his plays : " the crucible " and " resurrection blues . "
both are on very political topics .
were you trying to make a point ? there are so many plays that i think are very current , beyond their time .
they have everything to do with our daily reality .
as a director , i can not avoid dealing with political issues .
and you can ’ t take on the topic of america without asking political questions . this year i am also directing " true west , " by sam shepard .
it is a piece from 1980 , but while i directed it i was very conscious of 9/11 .
you read this play differently knowing that 9/11 happened , and the audience sees it differently .
it is very enriching . interview : jennifer abramsohn send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" it said islamists regard germany as a crusader nation and also see it as an ally of the united states and israel - two of the biggest foes of muslim militants . germany 's growing military presence in afghanistan and its involvement in training iraqi security forces had made it a target for islamic terrorists , the report said . the document also spoke of a growing climate of anti-semitism among right-wing extremists in germany .
it said neo-nazis were making increased use of the internet and music to reach out to other sections of the population , particularly young people . the report said the number of politically motivated crimes in germany decreased slightly in 2007 to 28,538 .
the number of violent crimes by neo-nazis also dipped slightly to 833 .

not all reader comments have been published .
dw-world.de reserves the right to edit for length and appropriateness of content . of course , hugo chavez 's comments were out of line .
he always is .
chavez is leftist but has never had the experience of living in a communist state , like east germany or the ussr , where there were no human rights , fundamental freedoms , right to property and so on . - stefan schneider , brazil chancellor merkel may be a conservative center-right politician but she is definitively not an extreme right-wing totalitarian leader as socialist president of venezuela hugo chavez thinks she might be .
you could label him an extreme left-wing totalitarian leader .
if they get to meet in lima , peru , i wonder if his attitude towards chancellor merkel will change . - stuart john pearson , australia as far as comparing merkel 's party with fascism , hugo chavez is grandstanding for his own benefit and seems to feel the need to show off to the world media with very bad taste and form . - g. gosau , canada although the comments of president chavez might sound extreme , they are just a reaction to chancellor merkel comments in the sense that this is hardball politics .
to my understanding , merkel was probably trying to praise the moderate left of countries like chile or brazil , but did it in a way that ended up attacking another country 's policy which is always a big no-no if you want to have friendly relationships .
chavez on the other hand is used to the snide comments coming from the us and this is his way of dealing with that .
speaking clearly and boldly is the only way he has been able to get his message across to a news media that is largely against him . - andres castillo , venezuela this is the way chavez says the truth .
it 's not diplomatic , but that does not matter , it is still the truth . - christian grundmann , venezuela this visit by the german chancellor angela merkel is very important for the relations between our continent and the eu - and stronger relations are needed for today and the future .
one should not believe what the venezuelan president said because he does not represent our interests or the latin american people . - rosita welcker , columbia president hugo chavez of venezuela had every right to reply to the provocative statement that chancellor angela merkel uttered when saying that he was not the voice of the region .
if you do not like criticism do not take upon yourself to criticize anyone else .
as for the christian democrats being a nazi-like party , it is very close to the truth .
the german catholic party was absorbed into the nazi party in 1934 .
so , senor chavez did make a statement that bore some truth in it .
but , should president chavez attend the eu-latin american and caribbean summit , i am sure he will tell angela merkel what he thinks .
right now angela merkel does not speak for the eu but as a mouthpiece of the bush regime in the us .
it 's a shame that the eu has become a tool of yankee imperialism .
tell chancellor merkel to keep her opinions to herself or face the consequences of her actions . - kenneth v. tellis , canada chavez was not out of line because he was telling the truth .
he has not told a lie yet . - leon bernotas , us dalai lama 's visit to germany bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hesse premier roland koch was the first official to meet with the dalai lama a german cabinet minister should meet with the dalai lama .
tibet should be free from china .
but i am very pleased with china accepting international help with the earthquake from germany , the us , australia and other members of the international community and that the chinese premier visited the affected area fairly quickly and offered to help . - stuart john pearson , australia i think the cabinet members and other top leaders in the government of germany should go out of their way to meet with the dalai lama personally and to set up some sort of dialogue with his representatives .
if he has arranged to travel such a distance to see germany 's leaders , the very least they could do would be to greet him and try to arrange something approaching substantial conversation .
furthermore , it would be the right time to consider some form of special recognition for his holiness , an award like the honorary citizenship which the city of paris bestowed upon him on april 21 , 2008 . - birger salberg , jr . , us foreign minister franz walter steinmeier should meet with the dalai lama on behalf of the german people .
he should always support on what is right including helping countries with emergency situations and promoting human rights which is the most important issue for this generation . - gonpo tenzing , germany the new us embassy in berlin please accept our deepest apologies for the monstrosity in the form of an embassy that pretends to represent the american people in the very center of berlin .
we are embarrassed and saddened by this misuse of our tax dollars .
it would have been laughed out of chicago had anyone attempted to disgrace our largest mid-western city with such an ugly edifice . - robert and virginia bach , us compiled by dw staff -lrb- ot -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de merkel downplays dispute with chavez ahead of summit venezuela 's president hugo chavez accused german chancellor angela merkel of groundlessly bombarding him " with stones " on wednesday , may 14 , continuing a war of words between the two leaders -lrb- 15.05.2008 -rrb- dalai lama begins germany tour the dalai lama arrived in germany on thursday , may 15 , at the start of a five-day visit that includes a meeting with a member of chancellor angela merkel 's cabinet in berlin .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de theater -pipe- 15.05.2008 director explains allure of america-focused theater festival großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : putting known film actors on stage is one of hoffmann 's successful moves dw-world talked to frank hoffmann , the artistic director of the ruhrfestspiele theater festival , about his decision to make america , land of cinema , the focus of his 2008 season . the ruhrfestspiele , or ruhr theater festival , one of europe 's most important and oldest theater festivals , opened this year on may 1 , 2008 , and runs through june 15 , 2008 .
ever since it was born of a unique deal between miners and actors who traded coal for performances during the hard winter of 1946/47 , the festival has kept up the tradition of putting on top-quality international productions in germany 's working-class ruhr valley . luxembourg director frank hoffmann took the artistic helm of the festival in 2004 at a precarious time in its history , pulling it back from the brink of bankruptcy and boosting visitor numbers from year to year .
in a conversation with dw-world.de , he discussed his fascination with modern american theater , and divulged his recipe for success . in the past you have focused on different authors at the ruhr festival .
this year you took on a country , america .
why ? originally we wanted to stay with my concept of focusing on a playwright , and i thought it might be arthur miller .
but then it became clear to me that we had to take a broad look at american theater of the 20th century .
that era - from eugene o ’ neill , whom you can count as the father of american theater , to today ’ s authors - underwent a singular development .
i thought it was worth focusing the festival on it . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hoffmann 's approach has had popular appeal weren ’ t you concerned that featuring the us could stigmatize the festival ?
after all , many europeans these days are fed up with american politics .
and the us is much better known for its pop culture than for its high art . it 's true that the image of america is not necessarily very positive , especially among artists , and especially when it comes to foreign policy .
i ’ m critical too - whether about the iraq war or other things that have happened during the bush presidency .
still , america is a very great nation and a great culture , and you have to be able to separate those things .
i think us theater rises above pop culture . european authors early in the last century - strindberg , ibsen , kafka - they all influenced american theater incredibly .
the american authors have absorbed it and are giving it back to us , with a focus of their own . what sets american theater apart ? american theater has a strong tie to cinema , much more than in any other country .
playwrights like david mamet and sam shepard are also hollywood scriptwriters .
this tie between cinema and theater is present even when it comes to actors , who play both on the stage and screen .
and there were many plays that have been turned into films .
there are enough interesting ties to support a festival . your predecessor at the festival , frank castorf , lasted less than a year .
his avant garde approach turned off the public , and the festival almost went bankrupt .
you have been lauded for rescuing the festival by putting on plays people wanted to see , and pulling in big-name actors .
what message does that send about pushing artistic boundaries ? we sold more than 75,000 tickets this year , more than ever in the history of the festival .
which means we have to suit many peoples ’ tastes .
but i want to be clear that we do not just put on popular plays .
we have a lot of world premieres and germany premieres .
we do modern theater , unconventional theater . our public is ready to take in the new ; they demand it .
but they also want to see popular things . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : austere aesthetics are frequent in in festival productions i can ’ t say exactly what explains our success but i think it has to do with how we present theater to people .
there isn ’ t just one aesthetic or style at the festival , there are many different aesthetics .
and the interesting thing is they are all found side by side .
they all bump up against each other .
it is exciting . so what is your recipe for a good theater festival ? first , there is the idea of it being strongly focused on a given concept or topic .
in the past it was an author , like shakespeare , beckett or goethe .
it allowed the viewer to compare a variety of different productions of one author 's work , and compare them . second , i created the idea of having festivals within a festival .
we have a festival of world premieres - every year there are three .
we have a series called young theater , with plays by young actors and directors .
we have a cabaret festival , and a children ’ s festival .
we try to make clear divisions . do you , personally , advocate a certain type of theater ? i think one thing is important - it has to be a sensual experience .
on the other hand , it has to be an adventure for the mind .
i think it needs to have both of those sides . in the past you have directed plays by a lot of europeans and south americans .
this year you are directing " a moon for the misbegotten , " by eugene o ’ neill .
was it a different experience for you ? no matter what i am directing , my method is the same .
i explore the play to its depths , and try to find out what holds it together .
in the context of this festival , of course , the subject of america had to be dealt with . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the troupe kataklo combine sport and theater i found it fascinating to work on this play because i have never been closer to using language of film - and not because i used any media in the production .
i ’ m talking in terms of the spirit of the play .
it was important for me to tie together the emotionality of cinema with the directness of theater . you said arthur miller was the starting point for this festival , and you are showcasing two of his plays : " the crucible " and " resurrection blues . "
both are on very political topics .
were you trying to make a point ? there are so many plays that i think are very current , beyond their time .
they have everything to do with our daily reality .
as a director , i can not avoid dealing with political issues .
and you can ’ t take on the topic of america without asking political questions . this year i am also directing " true west , " by sam shepard .
it is a piece from 1980 , but while i directed it i was very conscious of 9/11 .
you read this play differently knowing that 9/11 happened , and the audience sees it differently .
it is very enriching . interview : jennifer abramsohn send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the dalai lama said he was deeply affected by monday 's devastating earthquake that officials fear could have killed 50,000 in the southwestern chinese province of sichuan .
the 72-year-old , who was awarded the nobel peace prize in 1989 for his efforts to achieve a non-violent solution to the tibetan problem , said he would pray for the victims .
frankfurt was the opening leg of a five-day tour of germany which will see the dalai lama speak on human rights and meet with a member of chancellor angela merkel 's cabinet in berlin .
after a breakfast meeting with roland koch , the conservative premier of the state of hesse , he traveled to bochum where he conferred with juergen ruettgers , prime minister of north rhine- westphalia , germany 's most populous state .
ruettgers said after the talks that the dalai lama had briefed him on the meetings between his representatives and the chinese government held in the aftermath of the freedom demonstrations in march that left an undetermined number of dead .

the southwestern state has a law that bans " exterior expressions of religious confession . " the so-called " headscarf debate " is a long-raging one in germany , home to more than 3 million muslims , most of turkish origin .
many consider the headscarf a form of oppression against women and say immigrants who want to live here harmoniously must accept certain western values and play by german rules . others say forbidding it amounts to discriminating against islam and that germans should learn to accept other cultures and traditions . all religious dress bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : nuns are also not exempt , except in certain cases the country as a whole has been split on the issue of scarves and education , with some states tolerating teachers in scarves and others sacking them if they refuse to teach bare-headed . the judges in the city of mannheim interpreted the ban on religious dress as applying to all religions , whether to nuns and monks in habits or to male jewish teachers wearing the kippah . the law expressly exempts catholic religious who teach catholic doctrine classes in public schools , and the judges said three nuns in the state who teach other subjects had personal exemptions that would not apply to any other sisters in the future . dw staff -lrb- jam -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" -lsb- lula -rsb- said to me that he would receive the german chancellor , " said chavez .
" and i said , please greet her from me .
she comes here and throws stones , for reasons i do not know .
some european heads of state come in order to meet with us , and already before their arrival are throwing stones . " the tit for tat between the venezuelan and german leaders started when merkel told german news agency dpa in an interview ahead of this week 's summit of the european union , latin american and caribbean nations that the left-wing chavez is not the voice of the region . chavez replied aggressively late sunday in his weekly radio and television program , saying that merkel belongs to the political right , " the same right that supported hitler and fascism . " merkel downplays fascist accusations on tuesday the venezuelan government issued a statement stressing that merkel is not the eu 's only voice and demanded " respect " from germany . on wednesday , merkel did not respond directly to any remarks from chavez , only saying she wanted to " tighten the strategic partnership with latin america . " " president lula can relax ; i can look after myself , " merkel said when asked whether brazil 's head-of-state could help smooth over the dispute . lula da silva was also optimistic about the upcoming meeting : " if i know chavez and merkel well , they will sit down , have a cup of coffee and peace will reign between caracas and bonn , " he said , mistakenly referring to germany 's former capital . the german chancellor traveled to latin america on tuesday and met with the brazilian president on wednesday in brasilia to discuss broader bilateral economic ties . merkel , chavez and some 60 leaders from the european union , latin america and the caribbean are set to meet friday and saturday in lima , for the summit that the two regions hold every two years . dw staff -lrb- kjb -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

ever since it was born of a unique deal between miners and actors who traded coal for performances during the hard winter of 1946/47 , the festival has kept up the tradition of putting on top-quality international productions in germany 's working-class ruhr valley . luxembourg director frank hoffmann took the artistic helm of the festival in 2004 at a precarious time in its history , pulling it back from the brink of bankruptcy and boosting visitor numbers from year to year .
in a conversation with dw-world.de , he discussed his fascination with modern american theater , and divulged his recipe for success . in the past you have focused on different authors at the ruhr festival .
this year you took on a country , america .
why ? originally we wanted to stay with my concept of focusing on a playwright , and i thought it might be arthur miller .
but then it became clear to me that we had to take a broad look at american theater of the 20th century .
that era - from eugene o ’ neill , whom you can count as the father of american theater , to today ’ s authors - underwent a singular development .
i thought it was worth focusing the festival on it . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hoffmann 's approach has had popular appeal weren ’ t you concerned that featuring the us could stigmatize the festival ?
after all , many europeans these days are fed up with american politics .
and the us is much better known for its pop culture than for its high art . it 's true that the image of america is not necessarily very positive , especially among artists , and especially when it comes to foreign policy .
i ’ m critical too - whether about the iraq war or other things that have happened during the bush presidency .
still , america is a very great nation and a great culture , and you have to be able to separate those things .
i think us theater rises above pop culture . european authors early in the last century - strindberg , ibsen , kafka - they all influenced american theater incredibly .
the american authors have absorbed it and are giving it back to us , with a focus of their own . what sets american theater apart ? american theater has a strong tie to cinema , much more than in any other country .
playwrights like david mamet and sam shepard are also hollywood scriptwriters .
this tie between cinema and theater is present even when it comes to actors , who play both on the stage and screen .
and there were many plays that have been turned into films .
there are enough interesting ties to support a festival . your predecessor at the festival , frank castorf , lasted less than a year .
his avant garde approach turned off the public , and the festival almost went bankrupt .
you have been lauded for rescuing the festival by putting on plays people wanted to see , and pulling in big-name actors .
what message does that send about pushing artistic boundaries ? we sold more than 75,000 tickets this year , more than ever in the history of the festival .
which means we have to suit many peoples ’ tastes .
but i want to be clear that we do not just put on popular plays .
we have a lot of world premieres and germany premieres .
we do modern theater , unconventional theater . our public is ready to take in the new ; they demand it .
but they also want to see popular things . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : austere aesthetics are frequent in in festival productions i can ’ t say exactly what explains our success but i think it has to do with how we present theater to people .
there isn ’ t just one aesthetic or style at the festival , there are many different aesthetics .
and the interesting thing is they are all found side by side .
they all bump up against each other .
it is exciting . so what is your recipe for a good theater festival ? first , there is the idea of it being strongly focused on a given concept or topic .
in the past it was an author , like shakespeare , beckett or goethe .
it allowed the viewer to compare a variety of different productions of one author 's work , and compare them . second , i created the idea of having festivals within a festival .
we have a festival of world premieres - every year there are three .
we have a series called young theater , with plays by young actors and directors .
we have a cabaret festival , and a children ’ s festival .
we try to make clear divisions . do you , personally , advocate a certain type of theater ? i think one thing is important - it has to be a sensual experience .
on the other hand , it has to be an adventure for the mind .
i think it needs to have both of those sides . in the past you have directed plays by a lot of europeans and south americans .
this year you are directing " a moon for the misbegotten , " by eugene o ’ neill .
was it a different experience for you ? no matter what i am directing , my method is the same .
i explore the play to its depths , and try to find out what holds it together .
in the context of this festival , of course , the subject of america had to be dealt with . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the troupe kataklo combine sport and theater i found it fascinating to work on this play because i have never been closer to using language of film - and not because i used any media in the production .
i ’ m talking in terms of the spirit of the play .
it was important for me to tie together the emotionality of cinema with the directness of theater . you said arthur miller was the starting point for this festival , and you are showcasing two of his plays : " the crucible " and " resurrection blues . "
both are on very political topics .
were you trying to make a point ? there are so many plays that i think are very current , beyond their time .
they have everything to do with our daily reality .
as a director , i can not avoid dealing with political issues .
and you can ’ t take on the topic of america without asking political questions . this year i am also directing " true west , " by sam shepard .
it is a piece from 1980 , but while i directed it i was very conscious of 9/11 .
you read this play differently knowing that 9/11 happened , and the audience sees it differently .
it is very enriching . interview : jennifer abramsohn send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

i explore the play to its depths , and try to find out what holds it together .
in the context of this festival , of course , the subject of america had to be dealt with . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the troupe kataklo combine sport and theater i found it fascinating to work on this play because i have never been closer to using language of film - and not because i used any media in the production .
i ’ m talking in terms of the spirit of the play .
it was important for me to tie together the emotionality of cinema with the directness of theater . you said arthur miller was the starting point for this festival , and you are showcasing two of his plays : " the crucible " and " resurrection blues . "
both are on very political topics .
were you trying to make a point ? there are so many plays that i think are very current , beyond their time .
they have everything to do with our daily reality .
as a director , i can not avoid dealing with political issues .
and you can ’ t take on the topic of america without asking political questions . this year i am also directing " true west , " by sam shepard .
it is a piece from 1980 , but while i directed it i was very conscious of 9/11 .
you read this play differently knowing that 9/11 happened , and the audience sees it differently .

ever since it was born of a unique deal between miners and actors who traded coal for performances during the hard winter of 1946/47 , the festival has kept up the tradition of putting on top-quality international productions in germany 's working-class ruhr valley . luxembourg director frank hoffmann took the artistic helm of the festival in 2004 at a precarious time in its history , pulling it back from the brink of bankruptcy and boosting visitor numbers from year to year .
in a conversation with dw-world.de , he discussed his fascination with modern american theater , and divulged his recipe for success . in the past you have focused on different authors at the ruhr festival .
this year you took on a country , america .
why ? originally we wanted to stay with my concept of focusing on a playwright , and i thought it might be arthur miller .
but then it became clear to me that we had to take a broad look at american theater of the 20th century .
that era - from eugene o ’ neill , whom you can count as the father of american theater , to today ’ s authors - underwent a singular development .
i thought it was worth focusing the festival on it . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hoffmann 's approach has had popular appeal weren ’ t you concerned that featuring the us could stigmatize the festival ?
after all , many europeans these days are fed up with american politics .
and the us is much better known for its pop culture than for its high art . it 's true that the image of america is not necessarily very positive , especially among artists , and especially when it comes to foreign policy .
i ’ m critical too - whether about the iraq war or other things that have happened during the bush presidency .
still , america is a very great nation and a great culture , and you have to be able to separate those things .
i think us theater rises above pop culture . european authors early in the last century - strindberg , ibsen , kafka - they all influenced american theater incredibly .
the american authors have absorbed it and are giving it back to us , with a focus of their own . what sets american theater apart ? american theater has a strong tie to cinema , much more than in any other country .
playwrights like david mamet and sam shepard are also hollywood scriptwriters .
this tie between cinema and theater is present even when it comes to actors , who play both on the stage and screen .
and there were many plays that have been turned into films .
there are enough interesting ties to support a festival . your predecessor at the festival , frank castorf , lasted less than a year .
his avant garde approach turned off the public , and the festival almost went bankrupt .
you have been lauded for rescuing the festival by putting on plays people wanted to see , and pulling in big-name actors .
what message does that send about pushing artistic boundaries ? we sold more than 75,000 tickets this year , more than ever in the history of the festival .
which means we have to suit many peoples ’ tastes .
but i want to be clear that we do not just put on popular plays .
we have a lot of world premieres and germany premieres .
we do modern theater , unconventional theater . our public is ready to take in the new ; they demand it .
but they also want to see popular things . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : austere aesthetics are frequent in in festival productions i can ’ t say exactly what explains our success but i think it has to do with how we present theater to people .
there isn ’ t just one aesthetic or style at the festival , there are many different aesthetics .
and the interesting thing is they are all found side by side .
they all bump up against each other .
it is exciting . so what is your recipe for a good theater festival ? first , there is the idea of it being strongly focused on a given concept or topic .
in the past it was an author , like shakespeare , beckett or goethe .
it allowed the viewer to compare a variety of different productions of one author 's work , and compare them . second , i created the idea of having festivals within a festival .
we have a festival of world premieres - every year there are three .
we have a series called young theater , with plays by young actors and directors .
we have a cabaret festival , and a children ’ s festival .
we try to make clear divisions . do you , personally , advocate a certain type of theater ? i think one thing is important - it has to be a sensual experience .
on the other hand , it has to be an adventure for the mind .
i think it needs to have both of those sides . in the past you have directed plays by a lot of europeans and south americans .
this year you are directing " a moon for the misbegotten , " by eugene o ’ neill .
was it a different experience for you ? no matter what i am directing , my method is the same .
i explore the play to its depths , and try to find out what holds it together .

" and i said , please greet her from me .
she comes here and throws stones , for reasons i do not know .
some european heads of state come in order to meet with us , and already before their arrival are throwing stones . " the tit for tat between the venezuelan and german leaders started when merkel told german news agency dpa in an interview ahead of this week 's summit of the european union , latin american and caribbean nations that the left-wing chavez is not the voice of the region . chavez replied aggressively late sunday in his weekly radio and television program , saying that merkel belongs to the political right , " the same right that supported hitler and fascism . " merkel downplays fascist accusations on tuesday the venezuelan government issued a statement stressing that merkel is not the eu 's only voice and demanded " respect " from germany . on wednesday , merkel did not respond directly to any remarks from chavez , only saying she wanted to " tighten the strategic partnership with latin america . " " president lula can relax ; i can look after myself , " merkel said when asked whether brazil 's head-of-state could help smooth over the dispute . lula da silva was also optimistic about the upcoming meeting : " if i know chavez and merkel well , they will sit down , have a cup of coffee and peace will reign between caracas and bonn , " he said , mistakenly referring to germany 's former capital . the german chancellor traveled to latin america on tuesday and met with the brazilian president on wednesday in brasilia to discuss broader bilateral economic ties . merkel , chavez and some 60 leaders from the european union , latin america and the caribbean are set to meet friday and saturday in lima , for the summit that the two regions hold every two years . dw staff -lrb- kjb -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de reader response -pipe- 15.05.2008 readers sound off on hugo chavez and the dalai lama großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : venezuela 's president hugo chavez comments by venezuelan president hugo chavez about chancellor merkel and the refusal of high-ranking german officials to meet with the dalai lama got readers attention this week . the following comments reflect the views of dw-world.de readers .
not all reader comments have been published .
dw-world.de reserves the right to edit for length and appropriateness of content . of course , hugo chavez 's comments were out of line .
he always is .
chavez is leftist but has never had the experience of living in a communist state , like east germany or the ussr , where there were no human rights , fundamental freedoms , right to property and so on . - stefan schneider , brazil chancellor merkel may be a conservative center-right politician but she is definitively not an extreme right-wing totalitarian leader as socialist president of venezuela hugo chavez thinks she might be .
you could label him an extreme left-wing totalitarian leader .
if they get to meet in lima , peru , i wonder if his attitude towards chancellor merkel will change . - stuart john pearson , australia as far as comparing merkel 's party with fascism , hugo chavez is grandstanding for his own benefit and seems to feel the need to show off to the world media with very bad taste and form . - g. gosau , canada although the comments of president chavez might sound extreme , they are just a reaction to chancellor merkel comments in the sense that this is hardball politics .
to my understanding , merkel was probably trying to praise the moderate left of countries like chile or brazil , but did it in a way that ended up attacking another country 's policy which is always a big no-no if you want to have friendly relationships .
chavez on the other hand is used to the snide comments coming from the us and this is his way of dealing with that .
speaking clearly and boldly is the only way he has been able to get his message across to a news media that is largely against him . - andres castillo , venezuela this is the way chavez says the truth .
it 's not diplomatic , but that does not matter , it is still the truth . - christian grundmann , venezuela this visit by the german chancellor angela merkel is very important for the relations between our continent and the eu - and stronger relations are needed for today and the future .
one should not believe what the venezuelan president said because he does not represent our interests or the latin american people . - rosita welcker , columbia president hugo chavez of venezuela had every right to reply to the provocative statement that chancellor angela merkel uttered when saying that he was not the voice of the region .
if you do not like criticism do not take upon yourself to criticize anyone else .
as for the christian democrats being a nazi-like party , it is very close to the truth .
the german catholic party was absorbed into the nazi party in 1934 .
so , senor chavez did make a statement that bore some truth in it .
but , should president chavez attend the eu-latin american and caribbean summit , i am sure he will tell angela merkel what he thinks .
right now angela merkel does not speak for the eu but as a mouthpiece of the bush regime in the us .
it 's a shame that the eu has become a tool of yankee imperialism .
tell chancellor merkel to keep her opinions to herself or face the consequences of her actions . - kenneth v. tellis , canada chavez was not out of line because he was telling the truth .
he has not told a lie yet . - leon bernotas , us dalai lama 's visit to germany bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hesse premier roland koch was the first official to meet with the dalai lama a german cabinet minister should meet with the dalai lama .
tibet should be free from china .
but i am very pleased with china accepting international help with the earthquake from germany , the us , australia and other members of the international community and that the chinese premier visited the affected area fairly quickly and offered to help . - stuart john pearson , australia i think the cabinet members and other top leaders in the government of germany should go out of their way to meet with the dalai lama personally and to set up some sort of dialogue with his representatives .
if he has arranged to travel such a distance to see germany 's leaders , the very least they could do would be to greet him and try to arrange something approaching substantial conversation .
furthermore , it would be the right time to consider some form of special recognition for his holiness , an award like the honorary citizenship which the city of paris bestowed upon him on april 21 , 2008 . - birger salberg , jr . , us foreign minister franz walter steinmeier should meet with the dalai lama on behalf of the german people .
he should always support on what is right including helping countries with emergency situations and promoting human rights which is the most important issue for this generation . - gonpo tenzing , germany the new us embassy in berlin please accept our deepest apologies for the monstrosity in the form of an embassy that pretends to represent the american people in the very center of berlin .
we are embarrassed and saddened by this misuse of our tax dollars .
it would have been laughed out of chicago had anyone attempted to disgrace our largest mid-western city with such an ugly edifice . - robert and virginia bach , us compiled by dw staff -lrb- ot -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de merkel downplays dispute with chavez ahead of summit venezuela 's president hugo chavez accused german chancellor angela merkel of groundlessly bombarding him " with stones " on wednesday , may 14 , continuing a war of words between the two leaders -lrb- 15.05.2008 -rrb- dalai lama begins germany tour the dalai lama arrived in germany on thursday , may 15 , at the start of a five-day visit that includes a meeting with a member of chancellor angela merkel 's cabinet in berlin .

official figures show it has had its biggest growth spurt in almost 12 years . the country 's gross domestic product -lrb- gdp -rrb- expanded by 1.5 percent compared to the previous quarter , according to preliminary data issued by the german statistics office on thursday , may 15 . " the german economy proved itself to be very robust at the start of 2008 despite the increasing burdens , " said a statement released by the office . economists polled by reuters news agency had expected the gdp in europe 's largest economy to have expanded by only 0.7 percent .
in the fourth quarter it grew 0.3 percent .
this comes despite the global credit crunch , the high price of oil and the strong euro . driven by the power within bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the building industry has been one positive economic motor the growth was driven by an increase in investment by companies and a rise in domestic consumption , rather than any increase in exports .
the statistics office will announce more details in two weeks . economists had predicted a slowdown in german economic growth this year with expansion rates dropping under the 2 percent mark , following 2.5 percent in 2006 and 2.9 percent in 2005 .
many responded to thursday 's news with a more optimistic projection . " that 's a sensational figure , " said commerzbank analyst matthias rubisch .
" the projections for this whole year will have to be revised upwards after this strong start .
we could definitely achieve a two before the decimal point . " however , he also warned of a drop in growth in the spring quarter . hsbc trinkhaus expert lothar hessler made a similar prognosis . " that is much stronger than expected , " he said .
" the question is whether there will be a setback now in spring .
but even if economic performance stagnates in the remaining quarters of this year , we will end up with a growth rate of around two percent . " sustainable growth or a flash in the pan ? ulrike kastens , of sal .
oppenheim , was more cautious , sticking by her prediction of a 1.5 percent growth rate for this year , while conceding it could rise above this . she attributed the good growth figures partly to a strong performance from the construction industry , which has been aided by the mild winter . " as nice as it is , it is just a temporary effect , " she said .
" we have to bargain for it being a blip .
in the second quarter we will see a correction of this positive result .

ukrainian journalist yevgeny minko said he was disappointed with how the erroneous story was handled . dw-world.de was among the european media sources to publish the falsified report on its english site in april 2008 .
it has since been removed from the web site .
the editors apologize to those readers who were offended by the publication of the article . yevgeny minko is editor-in-chief of telekritika , a monthly publication focusing on media issues in ukraine .
the following interview was conducted by email . dw-world.de : where did the inaccurate story originate and how did it spread ? yevgeny minko : the original story about the doll was published in the ukrainian newspaper dzerkalo tyzhnya -lrb- www.dt.ua -rrb- .
the author , andriy kapustin , described an incident of seeing a hitler doll manufactured in taiwan in one of kyiv 's novelty stores .
of course , he was not very pleased with what he saw .
he somewhat satirized the resemblance with the barbie doll , envisioning a hypothesized ukrainian family playing with the toy hitler .
nevertheless , he stressed that such a doll must not be welcome in a country that suffered from a nazi invasion during world war ii . this was a single incident of witnessing a hitler doll in kyiv .
no reports of massive sales are available . after a few days , -lsb- german news agency -rsb- dpa spread a brief translation of this feature .
their version contained a number of errors .
the text suggested that the hitler doll was going to be manufactured by a local company and would start selling in ukraine soon , which would definitely cause controversy in the country . as far as i understand , this erroneous translation was widespread and caused consequential reports in the media outside of ukraine . was the story correctly reported in the media outside of ukraine ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hitler invaded ukraine in 1941 , sending thousands to nazi concentration camps absolutely not .
first of all , russia 's first television channel made a very biased report , claiming that this hitler doll is a hit in kyiv , and queues of people willing to buy it were gathering in stores - although they failed to show these queues .
the report also implied that there were strong nazi tendencies in the policies of the ukrainian state . the bbc subsequently aired this report with an original text by jane hadden , although the latter was pretty close to the original . the daily telegraph and daily mail presented their own versions of the story .
the one from daily mail came out in classic tabloid style - shocking and provocative .
their feature roused response from readers who were horrified by the story . what were the most glaring omissions or mistakes in the article carried by the media outside of ukraine ? first , the doll is not made by a ukrainian manufacturer , it was made in taiwan .
second , there is no ukrainian manufacturer that plans to sell hitler dolls across ukraine .
hence , no one plans to sell this doll with a variety of accessories .
third , ukrainian supermarkets do not sell this doll on a massive scale .
it was witnessed in a single novelty store . do you agree with the suspicions of some that there is an anti-ukrainian agenda to the story ? well , i am not a fan of conspiracy theories , so i would rather not say there was a certain anti-ukrainian agenda on the part of the media that spread the story .
except perhaps for russia 's first channel , which is known for its anti-ukrainian attitude and propaganda-like methods .
the other cases seem to be the result of negligent , careless reporting .
sadly , it was the most famous european media outlets that failed to stand up to professional standards . do you think that the media outlets that carried the story considered a possible anti-ukrainian agenda ? the european media was very inaccurate in their reports .
for instance , very few of the reporters mentioned the original source of the story - dzerkalo tyzhnya newspaper .
the bbc did not make it clear that the shown footage was basically a b-roll made by -lsb- russia 's -rsb- first channel .
daily mail and deutsche welle failed to mention any original source for their reports . did the media that brought the inaccurate story respond to inquires in an appropriate manner ? not really .

ukrainian journalist yevgeny minko said he was disappointed with how the erroneous story was handled . dw-world.de was among the european media sources to publish the falsified report on its english site in april 2008 .
it has since been removed from the web site .
the editors apologize to those readers who were offended by the publication of the article . yevgeny minko is editor-in-chief of telekritika , a monthly publication focusing on media issues in ukraine .
the following interview was conducted by email . dw-world.de : where did the inaccurate story originate and how did it spread ? yevgeny minko : the original story about the doll was published in the ukrainian newspaper dzerkalo tyzhnya -lrb- www.dt.ua -rrb- .
the author , andriy kapustin , described an incident of seeing a hitler doll manufactured in taiwan in one of kyiv 's novelty stores .
of course , he was not very pleased with what he saw .
he somewhat satirized the resemblance with the barbie doll , envisioning a hypothesized ukrainian family playing with the toy hitler .
nevertheless , he stressed that such a doll must not be welcome in a country that suffered from a nazi invasion during world war ii . this was a single incident of witnessing a hitler doll in kyiv .
no reports of massive sales are available . after a few days , -lsb- german news agency -rsb- dpa spread a brief translation of this feature .
their version contained a number of errors .
the text suggested that the hitler doll was going to be manufactured by a local company and would start selling in ukraine soon , which would definitely cause controversy in the country . as far as i understand , this erroneous translation was widespread and caused consequential reports in the media outside of ukraine . was the story correctly reported in the media outside of ukraine ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hitler invaded ukraine in 1941 , sending thousands to nazi concentration camps absolutely not .
first of all , russia 's first television channel made a very biased report , claiming that this hitler doll is a hit in kyiv , and queues of people willing to buy it were gathering in stores - although they failed to show these queues .
the report also implied that there were strong nazi tendencies in the policies of the ukrainian state . the bbc subsequently aired this report with an original text by jane hadden , although the latter was pretty close to the original . the daily telegraph and daily mail presented their own versions of the story .
the one from daily mail came out in classic tabloid style - shocking and provocative .
their feature roused response from readers who were horrified by the story . what were the most glaring omissions or mistakes in the article carried by the media outside of ukraine ? first , the doll is not made by a ukrainian manufacturer , it was made in taiwan .
second , there is no ukrainian manufacturer that plans to sell hitler dolls across ukraine .
hence , no one plans to sell this doll with a variety of accessories .
third , ukrainian supermarkets do not sell this doll on a massive scale .
it was witnessed in a single novelty store . do you agree with the suspicions of some that there is an anti-ukrainian agenda to the story ? well , i am not a fan of conspiracy theories , so i would rather not say there was a certain anti-ukrainian agenda on the part of the media that spread the story .
except perhaps for russia 's first channel , which is known for its anti-ukrainian attitude and propaganda-like methods .

the greek government is to retain authority over military aspects of the telecommunications service . ote is market leader in fixed and mobile communications in greece and also has subsidiaries in romania , bulgaria , macedonia and albania as well as a 20 percent stake in the main serbian phone company . the purchase price for telekom will total 3.2 billion euros -lrb- $ 4.9 billion -rrb- , according to wednesday 's announcement .

" it said islamists regard germany as a crusader nation and also see it as an ally of the united states and israel - two of the biggest foes of muslim militants . germany 's growing military presence in afghanistan and its involvement in training iraqi security forces had made it a target for islamic terrorists , the report said . the document also spoke of a growing climate of anti-semitism among right-wing extremists in germany .
it said neo-nazis were making increased use of the internet and music to reach out to other sections of the population , particularly young people . the report said the number of politically motivated crimes in germany decreased slightly in 2007 to 28,538 .
the number of violent crimes by neo-nazis also dipped slightly to 833 .
according to the report , there are 4,400 known neo-nazis in germany , 200 more than in 2006 . dw staff / dpa -lrb- kjb -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

but for pro-palestinian germans , as well as those who deal intensively with the middle east conflict , may 14 underscores the uniquely perilous tightrope walk germany must perform in its position toward those who have suffered under israeli occupation .
" there is no such thing as a german-palestinian relationship without the german-israeli relationship , " said rene wildangel , a historian and green party expert on the middle east .
" whether one thinks that 's good or bad , that 's the case right now .
if you look at german chancellor angela merkel 's recent trip to israel , she made it quite clear how close the german-israeli relationship is . "
merkel visited israel in march , when she became the first head of government to speak - in german - to the israeli parliament , the knesset .
but some people in germany , including palestinians residents , were upset that the chancellor did not raise the middle east conflict in her speech .
" there was a storm of outrage that went through the palestinian communities , " said erhard arendt , who runs the palaestina portal , germany 's largest internet forum for discussing palestinian affairs .
" hundreds of letters were written to newspapers , saying ' we did n't crop up in -lsb- the speech -rsb- at all .

public opinion versus policy bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel 's speech to the knesset on march 18 drew praise and criticism the german government support for israel is , of course , programmed by germans ' sense of shame and guilt for the holocaust , as well as their desire to atone concretely for the horrors of the past .
but the german people are often far more sympathetic to palestinian plight and far more willing to criticize israel than their government .
" according to one survey , 63 percent of the populace does n't think israel 's policies are right , " arendt said .
germans ' empathy for the palestinians often originates in attempts to come to terms with their own past .
" without doubt , the fact that i was intensely interested in the holocaust led me to get involved in palestinian affairs , " said arendt , who was born in 1941 .
" that certainly strengthened the idea in me that nothing even remotely similar should be allowed to happen again - anywhere and at any time . "
germans ' attitudes differ from opinion poll to opinion poll , depending on which questions are asked .
but certain hot-button issues perennially elicit german opposition to israeli government policies .
" there 's the occupation and the very difficult situation in gaza , as we 've seen in the past few months , " wildangel said .
" it 's a humanitarian problem connected to the israeli blockade in which the eu is also involved .
i think that topics like this , or the building israeli settlements in the west bank , makes germans feel that they have to voice criticism . "
historical triangle bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : israel 's blockade of the gaza strip is just the latest crisis in the region in germany , the palestinian cause continues to be associated with the extreme political left .
because it viewed nazism as a product of western capitalism , communist east germany took no responsibility for the holocaust .
it was openly hostile to israel and at least nominally supportive of palestinians ' desire for a state of their own .
and in the 1970s , the anti-imperialist terrorist group raf in west germany and palestinian militants also identified closely with one another .
most spectacularly , members of a group called " the popular front for the liberation of palestine " hijacked a lufthansa plane in 1977 , demanding among other things the release of raf terrorists from prison .
german special forces successfully stormed the plane at mogadishu airport , killing the hijackers .
such incidents shocked mainstream germans and their government .
" i do n't think that this course of action was very useful to the palestinians , " wildangel said .
" i see it as an extreme , and ultimately marginal , chapter in the history of german-palestinian relations . "
faint prospects for change bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the eu may be the best hope for easing german-palestinian relations there is little chance that germany will decrease the support , financial or military , it offers to israel - although german palestinian advocates continue to argue that the country has a responsibility to do precisely that .
" we should be criticizing , making demands and taking action , " arendt said .
" providing weapons to a crisis region violates every international agreement there is , yet weapons are delivered to israel , including armored scout cars , that are used to kill palestinians . "

if you look at german chancellor angela merkel 's recent trip to israel , she made it quite clear how close the german-israeli relationship is . "
merkel visited israel in march , when she became the first head of government to speak - in german - to the israeli parliament , the knesset .
but some people in germany , including palestinians residents , were upset that the chancellor did not raise the middle east conflict in her speech .
" there was a storm of outrage that went through the palestinian communities , " said erhard arendt , who runs the palaestina portal , germany 's largest internet forum for discussing palestinian affairs .
" hundreds of letters were written to newspapers , saying ' we did n't crop up in -lsb- the speech -rsb- at all .
we were totally forgotten . "
public opinion versus policy bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel 's speech to the knesset on march 18 drew praise and criticism the german government support for israel is , of course , programmed by germans ' sense of shame and guilt for the holocaust , as well as their desire to atone concretely for the horrors of the past .
but the german people are often far more sympathetic to palestinian plight and far more willing to criticize israel than their government .
" according to one survey , 63 percent of the populace does n't think israel 's policies are right , " arendt said .
germans ' empathy for the palestinians often originates in attempts to come to terms with their own past .
" without doubt , the fact that i was intensely interested in the holocaust led me to get involved in palestinian affairs , " said arendt , who was born in 1941 .
" that certainly strengthened the idea in me that nothing even remotely similar should be allowed to happen again - anywhere and at any time . "
germans ' attitudes differ from opinion poll to opinion poll , depending on which questions are asked .
but certain hot-button issues perennially elicit german opposition to israeli government policies .
" there 's the occupation and the very difficult situation in gaza , as we 've seen in the past few months , " wildangel said .
" it 's a humanitarian problem connected to the israeli blockade in which the eu is also involved .
i think that topics like this , or the building israeli settlements in the west bank , makes germans feel that they have to voice criticism . "
historical triangle bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : israel 's blockade of the gaza strip is just the latest crisis in the region in germany , the palestinian cause continues to be associated with the extreme political left .
because it viewed nazism as a product of western capitalism , communist east germany took no responsibility for the holocaust .
it was openly hostile to israel and at least nominally supportive of palestinians ' desire for a state of their own .
and in the 1970s , the anti-imperialist terrorist group raf in west germany and palestinian militants also identified closely with one another .
most spectacularly , members of a group called " the popular front for the liberation of palestine " hijacked a lufthansa plane in 1977 , demanding among other things the release of raf terrorists from prison .
german special forces successfully stormed the plane at mogadishu airport , killing the hijackers .
such incidents shocked mainstream germans and their government .
" i do n't think that this course of action was very useful to the palestinians , " wildangel said .
" i see it as an extreme , and ultimately marginal , chapter in the history of german-palestinian relations . "
faint prospects for change bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the eu may be the best hope for easing german-palestinian relations there is little chance that germany will decrease the support , financial or military , it offers to israel - although german palestinian advocates continue to argue that the country has a responsibility to do precisely that .
" we should be criticizing , making demands and taking action , " arendt said .
" providing weapons to a crisis region violates every international agreement there is , yet weapons are delivered to israel , including armored scout cars , that are used to kill palestinians . "
but the situation could change somewhat if foreign policy is de-nationalized .
" i think the palestinians have to recognize what the relationship between germany and israel is and acknowledge that the past happened , " wildangel said .
" but they can expect the european union - and that 's the level where the financial and political decisions are made now - to be critical of israeli state polices wherever they are problematic for the palestinians and the peace process .
" palestinians can expect that german and european politicians to push seriously for a peaceful settlement , " wildangel added .
" that includes a certain amount of objectivity and a sense of responsibility for both sides . " jefferson chase send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the dalai lama said he was deeply affected by monday 's devastating earthquake that officials fear could have killed 50,000 in the southwestern chinese province of sichuan .
the 72-year-old , who was awarded the nobel peace prize in 1989 for his efforts to achieve a non-violent solution to the tibetan problem , said he would pray for the victims .
frankfurt was the opening leg of a five-day tour of germany which will see the dalai lama speak on human rights and meet with a member of chancellor angela merkel 's cabinet in berlin .
after a breakfast meeting with roland koch , the conservative premier of the state of hesse , he traveled to bochum where he conferred with juergen ruettgers , prime minister of north rhine- westphalia , germany 's most populous state .
ruettgers said after the talks that the dalai lama had briefed him on the meetings between his representatives and the chinese government held in the aftermath of the freedom demonstrations in march that left an undetermined number of dead .

the " dalai lama is not a normal monk , but a political exile who carries out anti-chinese and separatist activities abroad under the guise of religion , human rights and autonomy , " a statement released by the chinese embassy said .
the talks with wieczorek-zeul and members of the parliamentary foreign affairs committee are due to take place on may 19 when the dalai lama will also deliver a speech at berlin 's brandenburg gate .
the run-up to the visit was marked by a domestic row because no one in merkel 's government was prepared to meet him , apparently fearing it could upset china .

the dalai lama said he was deeply affected by monday 's devastating earthquake that officials fear could have killed 50,000 in the southwestern chinese province of sichuan .
the 72-year-old , who was awarded the nobel peace prize in 1989 for his efforts to achieve a non-violent solution to the tibetan problem , said he would pray for the victims .
frankfurt was the opening leg of a five-day tour of germany which will see the dalai lama speak on human rights and meet with a member of chancellor angela merkel 's cabinet in berlin .
after a breakfast meeting with roland koch , the conservative premier of the state of hesse , he traveled to bochum where he conferred with juergen ruettgers , prime minister of north rhine- westphalia , germany 's most populous state .
ruettgers said after the talks that the dalai lama had briefed him on the meetings between his representatives and the chinese government held in the aftermath of the freedom demonstrations in march that left an undetermined number of dead .
the talks , in the chinese city of shenzhen , had failed to generate the trust that was necessary to resolve the issue , the dalai lama said .
spiritual leader condemns chinese suppression bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the dalai lama spent the first day pressing the flesh the dalai lama also took the opportunity to lash out once more at the " suppression " of anti-chinese unrest in tibet .
" the chinese political authorities ' reaction , as before , was suppression .
so it is very sad , " the tibetan spiritual leader said after arriving in germany .
on wednesday , china protested at the dalai lama 's planned meetings with development minister heidemarie wieczorek-zeul and legislators at the german parliament .
the " dalai lama is not a normal monk , but a political exile who carries out anti-chinese and separatist activities abroad under the guise of religion , human rights and autonomy , " a statement released by the chinese embassy said .
the talks with wieczorek-zeul and members of the parliamentary foreign affairs committee are due to take place on may 19 when the dalai lama will also deliver a speech at berlin 's brandenburg gate .
the run-up to the visit was marked by a domestic row because no one in merkel 's government was prepared to meet him , apparently fearing it could upset china .
the meeting with the economic assistance minister was arranged at the last minute .
lama unmoved by german domestic row over visit bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel met with the dalai lama during a 2007 visit , but is in latin america this week the chancellor is in latin america and her deputy , foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier , turned down an official request for a meeting , saying he does not have time .
the dalai lama said he was not put off by this .
some " leading personalities find it uncomfortable to talk to me , " he said , " but that is all right . "
merkel met the dalai lama at the federal chancellery last september , a move which led to a chill in relations between berlin and beijing that ended only in january after intense german diplomatic efforts .
chinese communist forces invaded tibet in 1950 .

ukrainian journalist yevgeny minko said he was disappointed with how the erroneous story was handled . dw-world.de was among the european media sources to publish the falsified report on its english site in april 2008 .
it has since been removed from the web site .
the editors apologize to those readers who were offended by the publication of the article . yevgeny minko is editor-in-chief of telekritika , a monthly publication focusing on media issues in ukraine .
the following interview was conducted by email . dw-world.de : where did the inaccurate story originate and how did it spread ? yevgeny minko : the original story about the doll was published in the ukrainian newspaper dzerkalo tyzhnya -lrb- www.dt.ua -rrb- .
the author , andriy kapustin , described an incident of seeing a hitler doll manufactured in taiwan in one of kyiv 's novelty stores .
of course , he was not very pleased with what he saw .
he somewhat satirized the resemblance with the barbie doll , envisioning a hypothesized ukrainian family playing with the toy hitler .
nevertheless , he stressed that such a doll must not be welcome in a country that suffered from a nazi invasion during world war ii . this was a single incident of witnessing a hitler doll in kyiv .
no reports of massive sales are available . after a few days , -lsb- german news agency -rsb- dpa spread a brief translation of this feature .
their version contained a number of errors .
the text suggested that the hitler doll was going to be manufactured by a local company and would start selling in ukraine soon , which would definitely cause controversy in the country . as far as i understand , this erroneous translation was widespread and caused consequential reports in the media outside of ukraine . was the story correctly reported in the media outside of ukraine ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hitler invaded ukraine in 1941 , sending thousands to nazi concentration camps absolutely not .
first of all , russia 's first television channel made a very biased report , claiming that this hitler doll is a hit in kyiv , and queues of people willing to buy it were gathering in stores - although they failed to show these queues .
the report also implied that there were strong nazi tendencies in the policies of the ukrainian state . the bbc subsequently aired this report with an original text by jane hadden , although the latter was pretty close to the original . the daily telegraph and daily mail presented their own versions of the story .
the one from daily mail came out in classic tabloid style - shocking and provocative .
their feature roused response from readers who were horrified by the story . what were the most glaring omissions or mistakes in the article carried by the media outside of ukraine ? first , the doll is not made by a ukrainian manufacturer , it was made in taiwan .
second , there is no ukrainian manufacturer that plans to sell hitler dolls across ukraine .
hence , no one plans to sell this doll with a variety of accessories .
third , ukrainian supermarkets do not sell this doll on a massive scale .
it was witnessed in a single novelty store . do you agree with the suspicions of some that there is an anti-ukrainian agenda to the story ? well , i am not a fan of conspiracy theories , so i would rather not say there was a certain anti-ukrainian agenda on the part of the media that spread the story .
except perhaps for russia 's first channel , which is known for its anti-ukrainian attitude and propaganda-like methods .
the other cases seem to be the result of negligent , careless reporting .
sadly , it was the most famous european media outlets that failed to stand up to professional standards . do you think that the media outlets that carried the story considered a possible anti-ukrainian agenda ? the european media was very inaccurate in their reports .
for instance , very few of the reporters mentioned the original source of the story - dzerkalo tyzhnya newspaper .
the bbc did not make it clear that the shown footage was basically a b-roll made by -lsb- russia 's -rsb- first channel .
daily mail and deutsche welle failed to mention any original source for their reports . did the media that brought the inaccurate story respond to inquires in an appropriate manner ? not really .

ever since it was born of a unique deal between miners and actors who traded coal for performances during the hard winter of 1946/47 , the festival has kept up the tradition of putting on top-quality international productions in germany 's working-class ruhr valley . luxembourg director frank hoffmann took the artistic helm of the festival in 2004 at a precarious time in its history , pulling it back from the brink of bankruptcy and boosting visitor numbers from year to year .
in a conversation with dw-world.de , he discussed his fascination with modern american theater , and divulged his recipe for success . in the past you have focused on different authors at the ruhr festival .
this year you took on a country , america .
why ? originally we wanted to stay with my concept of focusing on a playwright , and i thought it might be arthur miller .
but then it became clear to me that we had to take a broad look at american theater of the 20th century .
that era - from eugene o ’ neill , whom you can count as the father of american theater , to today ’ s authors - underwent a singular development .
i thought it was worth focusing the festival on it . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hoffmann 's approach has had popular appeal weren ’ t you concerned that featuring the us could stigmatize the festival ?
after all , many europeans these days are fed up with american politics .
and the us is much better known for its pop culture than for its high art . it 's true that the image of america is not necessarily very positive , especially among artists , and especially when it comes to foreign policy .
i ’ m critical too - whether about the iraq war or other things that have happened during the bush presidency .
still , america is a very great nation and a great culture , and you have to be able to separate those things .
i think us theater rises above pop culture . european authors early in the last century - strindberg , ibsen , kafka - they all influenced american theater incredibly .
the american authors have absorbed it and are giving it back to us , with a focus of their own . what sets american theater apart ? american theater has a strong tie to cinema , much more than in any other country .
playwrights like david mamet and sam shepard are also hollywood scriptwriters .
this tie between cinema and theater is present even when it comes to actors , who play both on the stage and screen .
and there were many plays that have been turned into films .
there are enough interesting ties to support a festival . your predecessor at the festival , frank castorf , lasted less than a year .
his avant garde approach turned off the public , and the festival almost went bankrupt .
you have been lauded for rescuing the festival by putting on plays people wanted to see , and pulling in big-name actors .
what message does that send about pushing artistic boundaries ? we sold more than 75,000 tickets this year , more than ever in the history of the festival .
which means we have to suit many peoples ’ tastes .
but i want to be clear that we do not just put on popular plays .
we have a lot of world premieres and germany premieres .
we do modern theater , unconventional theater . our public is ready to take in the new ; they demand it .
but they also want to see popular things . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : austere aesthetics are frequent in in festival productions i can ’ t say exactly what explains our success but i think it has to do with how we present theater to people .
there isn ’ t just one aesthetic or style at the festival , there are many different aesthetics .
and the interesting thing is they are all found side by side .
they all bump up against each other .
it is exciting . so what is your recipe for a good theater festival ? first , there is the idea of it being strongly focused on a given concept or topic .
in the past it was an author , like shakespeare , beckett or goethe .
it allowed the viewer to compare a variety of different productions of one author 's work , and compare them . second , i created the idea of having festivals within a festival .
we have a festival of world premieres - every year there are three .
we have a series called young theater , with plays by young actors and directors .
we have a cabaret festival , and a children ’ s festival .
we try to make clear divisions . do you , personally , advocate a certain type of theater ? i think one thing is important - it has to be a sensual experience .
on the other hand , it has to be an adventure for the mind .
i think it needs to have both of those sides . in the past you have directed plays by a lot of europeans and south americans .
this year you are directing " a moon for the misbegotten , " by eugene o ’ neill .
was it a different experience for you ? no matter what i am directing , my method is the same .
i explore the play to its depths , and try to find out what holds it together .
in the context of this festival , of course , the subject of america had to be dealt with . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the troupe kataklo combine sport and theater i found it fascinating to work on this play because i have never been closer to using language of film - and not because i used any media in the production .
i ’ m talking in terms of the spirit of the play .
it was important for me to tie together the emotionality of cinema with the directness of theater . you said arthur miller was the starting point for this festival , and you are showcasing two of his plays : " the crucible " and " resurrection blues . "
both are on very political topics .
were you trying to make a point ? there are so many plays that i think are very current , beyond their time .
they have everything to do with our daily reality .
as a director , i can not avoid dealing with political issues .
and you can ’ t take on the topic of america without asking political questions . this year i am also directing " true west , " by sam shepard .
it is a piece from 1980 , but while i directed it i was very conscious of 9/11 .
you read this play differently knowing that 9/11 happened , and the audience sees it differently .
it is very enriching . interview : jennifer abramsohn send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

official figures show it has had its biggest growth spurt in almost 12 years . the country 's gross domestic product -lrb- gdp -rrb- expanded by 1.5 percent compared to the previous quarter , according to preliminary data issued by the german statistics office on thursday , may 15 . " the german economy proved itself to be very robust at the start of 2008 despite the increasing burdens , " said a statement released by the office . economists polled by reuters news agency had expected the gdp in europe 's largest economy to have expanded by only 0.7 percent .
in the fourth quarter it grew 0.3 percent .
this comes despite the global credit crunch , the high price of oil and the strong euro . driven by the power within bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the building industry has been one positive economic motor the growth was driven by an increase in investment by companies and a rise in domestic consumption , rather than any increase in exports .

many responded to thursday 's news with a more optimistic projection . " that 's a sensational figure , " said commerzbank analyst matthias rubisch .
" the projections for this whole year will have to be revised upwards after this strong start .
we could definitely achieve a two before the decimal point . " however , he also warned of a drop in growth in the spring quarter . hsbc trinkhaus expert lothar hessler made a similar prognosis . " that is much stronger than expected , " he said .

" it said islamists regard germany as a crusader nation and also see it as an ally of the united states and israel - two of the biggest foes of muslim militants . germany 's growing military presence in afghanistan and its involvement in training iraqi security forces had made it a target for islamic terrorists , the report said . the document also spoke of a growing climate of anti-semitism among right-wing extremists in germany .
it said neo-nazis were making increased use of the internet and music to reach out to other sections of the population , particularly young people . the report said the number of politically motivated crimes in germany decreased slightly in 2007 to 28,538 .
the number of violent crimes by neo-nazis also dipped slightly to 833 .

but for pro-palestinian germans , as well as those who deal intensively with the middle east conflict , may 14 underscores the uniquely perilous tightrope walk germany must perform in its position toward those who have suffered under israeli occupation .
" there is no such thing as a german-palestinian relationship without the german-israeli relationship , " said rene wildangel , a historian and green party expert on the middle east .
" whether one thinks that 's good or bad , that 's the case right now .
if you look at german chancellor angela merkel 's recent trip to israel , she made it quite clear how close the german-israeli relationship is . "
merkel visited israel in march , when she became the first head of government to speak - in german - to the israeli parliament , the knesset .
but some people in germany , including palestinians residents , were upset that the chancellor did not raise the middle east conflict in her speech .
" there was a storm of outrage that went through the palestinian communities , " said erhard arendt , who runs the palaestina portal , germany 's largest internet forum for discussing palestinian affairs .
" hundreds of letters were written to newspapers , saying ' we did n't crop up in -lsb- the speech -rsb- at all .
we were totally forgotten . "
public opinion versus policy bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel 's speech to the knesset on march 18 drew praise and criticism the german government support for israel is , of course , programmed by germans ' sense of shame and guilt for the holocaust , as well as their desire to atone concretely for the horrors of the past .
but the german people are often far more sympathetic to palestinian plight and far more willing to criticize israel than their government .
" according to one survey , 63 percent of the populace does n't think israel 's policies are right , " arendt said .
germans ' empathy for the palestinians often originates in attempts to come to terms with their own past .
" without doubt , the fact that i was intensely interested in the holocaust led me to get involved in palestinian affairs , " said arendt , who was born in 1941 .
" that certainly strengthened the idea in me that nothing even remotely similar should be allowed to happen again - anywhere and at any time . "
germans ' attitudes differ from opinion poll to opinion poll , depending on which questions are asked .
but certain hot-button issues perennially elicit german opposition to israeli government policies .
" there 's the occupation and the very difficult situation in gaza , as we 've seen in the past few months , " wildangel said .
" it 's a humanitarian problem connected to the israeli blockade in which the eu is also involved .
i think that topics like this , or the building israeli settlements in the west bank , makes germans feel that they have to voice criticism . "
historical triangle bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : israel 's blockade of the gaza strip is just the latest crisis in the region in germany , the palestinian cause continues to be associated with the extreme political left .
because it viewed nazism as a product of western capitalism , communist east germany took no responsibility for the holocaust .
it was openly hostile to israel and at least nominally supportive of palestinians ' desire for a state of their own .
and in the 1970s , the anti-imperialist terrorist group raf in west germany and palestinian militants also identified closely with one another .
most spectacularly , members of a group called " the popular front for the liberation of palestine " hijacked a lufthansa plane in 1977 , demanding among other things the release of raf terrorists from prison .
german special forces successfully stormed the plane at mogadishu airport , killing the hijackers .
such incidents shocked mainstream germans and their government .
" i do n't think that this course of action was very useful to the palestinians , " wildangel said .
" i see it as an extreme , and ultimately marginal , chapter in the history of german-palestinian relations . "
faint prospects for change bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the eu may be the best hope for easing german-palestinian relations there is little chance that germany will decrease the support , financial or military , it offers to israel - although german palestinian advocates continue to argue that the country has a responsibility to do precisely that .
" we should be criticizing , making demands and taking action , " arendt said .
" providing weapons to a crisis region violates every international agreement there is , yet weapons are delivered to israel , including armored scout cars , that are used to kill palestinians . "
but the situation could change somewhat if foreign policy is de-nationalized .
" i think the palestinians have to recognize what the relationship between germany and israel is and acknowledge that the past happened , " wildangel said .
" but they can expect the european union - and that 's the level where the financial and political decisions are made now - to be critical of israeli state polices wherever they are problematic for the palestinians and the peace process .

faint prospects for change bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the eu may be the best hope for easing german-palestinian relations there is little chance that germany will decrease the support , financial or military , it offers to israel - although german palestinian advocates continue to argue that the country has a responsibility to do precisely that .
" we should be criticizing , making demands and taking action , " arendt said .
" providing weapons to a crisis region violates every international agreement there is , yet weapons are delivered to israel , including armored scout cars , that are used to kill palestinians . "
but the situation could change somewhat if foreign policy is de-nationalized .
" i think the palestinians have to recognize what the relationship between germany and israel is and acknowledge that the past happened , " wildangel said .
" but they can expect the european union - and that 's the level where the financial and political decisions are made now - to be critical of israeli state polices wherever they are problematic for the palestinians and the peace process .
" palestinians can expect that german and european politicians to push seriously for a peaceful settlement , " wildangel added .
" that includes a certain amount of objectivity and a sense of responsibility for both sides . " jefferson chase send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

to my understanding , merkel was probably trying to praise the moderate left of countries like chile or brazil , but did it in a way that ended up attacking another country 's policy which is always a big no-no if you want to have friendly relationships .
chavez on the other hand is used to the snide comments coming from the us and this is his way of dealing with that .

the dalai lama said he was deeply affected by monday 's devastating earthquake that officials fear could have killed 50,000 in the southwestern chinese province of sichuan .
the 72-year-old , who was awarded the nobel peace prize in 1989 for his efforts to achieve a non-violent solution to the tibetan problem , said he would pray for the victims .
frankfurt was the opening leg of a five-day tour of germany which will see the dalai lama speak on human rights and meet with a member of chancellor angela merkel 's cabinet in berlin .
after a breakfast meeting with roland koch , the conservative premier of the state of hesse , he traveled to bochum where he conferred with juergen ruettgers , prime minister of north rhine- westphalia , germany 's most populous state .
ruettgers said after the talks that the dalai lama had briefed him on the meetings between his representatives and the chinese government held in the aftermath of the freedom demonstrations in march that left an undetermined number of dead .
the talks , in the chinese city of shenzhen , had failed to generate the trust that was necessary to resolve the issue , the dalai lama said .
spiritual leader condemns chinese suppression bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the dalai lama spent the first day pressing the flesh the dalai lama also took the opportunity to lash out once more at the " suppression " of anti-chinese unrest in tibet .
" the chinese political authorities ' reaction , as before , was suppression .
so it is very sad , " the tibetan spiritual leader said after arriving in germany .
on wednesday , china protested at the dalai lama 's planned meetings with development minister heidemarie wieczorek-zeul and legislators at the german parliament .
the " dalai lama is not a normal monk , but a political exile who carries out anti-chinese and separatist activities abroad under the guise of religion , human rights and autonomy , " a statement released by the chinese embassy said .
the talks with wieczorek-zeul and members of the parliamentary foreign affairs committee are due to take place on may 19 when the dalai lama will also deliver a speech at berlin 's brandenburg gate .
the run-up to the visit was marked by a domestic row because no one in merkel 's government was prepared to meet him , apparently fearing it could upset china .
the meeting with the economic assistance minister was arranged at the last minute .
lama unmoved by german domestic row over visit bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel met with the dalai lama during a 2007 visit , but is in latin america this week the chancellor is in latin america and her deputy , foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier , turned down an official request for a meeting , saying he does not have time .
the dalai lama said he was not put off by this .
some " leading personalities find it uncomfortable to talk to me , " he said , " but that is all right . "
merkel met the dalai lama at the federal chancellery last september , a move which led to a chill in relations between berlin and beijing that ended only in january after intense german diplomatic efforts .

" it said islamists regard germany as a crusader nation and also see it as an ally of the united states and israel - two of the biggest foes of muslim militants . germany 's growing military presence in afghanistan and its involvement in training iraqi security forces had made it a target for islamic terrorists , the report said . the document also spoke of a growing climate of anti-semitism among right-wing extremists in germany .
it said neo-nazis were making increased use of the internet and music to reach out to other sections of the population , particularly young people . the report said the number of politically motivated crimes in germany decreased slightly in 2007 to 28,538 .
the number of violent crimes by neo-nazis also dipped slightly to 833 .
according to the report , there are 4,400 known neo-nazis in germany , 200 more than in 2006 . dw staff / dpa -lrb- kjb -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de reader response -pipe- 15.05.2008 readers sound off on hugo chavez and the dalai lama großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : venezuela 's president hugo chavez comments by venezuelan president hugo chavez about chancellor merkel and the refusal of high-ranking german officials to meet with the dalai lama got readers attention this week . the following comments reflect the views of dw-world.de readers .
not all reader comments have been published .
dw-world.de reserves the right to edit for length and appropriateness of content . of course , hugo chavez 's comments were out of line .
he always is .
chavez is leftist but has never had the experience of living in a communist state , like east germany or the ussr , where there were no human rights , fundamental freedoms , right to property and so on . - stefan schneider , brazil chancellor merkel may be a conservative center-right politician but she is definitively not an extreme right-wing totalitarian leader as socialist president of venezuela hugo chavez thinks she might be .
you could label him an extreme left-wing totalitarian leader .
if they get to meet in lima , peru , i wonder if his attitude towards chancellor merkel will change . - stuart john pearson , australia as far as comparing merkel 's party with fascism , hugo chavez is grandstanding for his own benefit and seems to feel the need to show off to the world media with very bad taste and form . - g. gosau , canada although the comments of president chavez might sound extreme , they are just a reaction to chancellor merkel comments in the sense that this is hardball politics .
to my understanding , merkel was probably trying to praise the moderate left of countries like chile or brazil , but did it in a way that ended up attacking another country 's policy which is always a big no-no if you want to have friendly relationships .

the dalai lama said he was deeply affected by monday 's devastating earthquake that officials fear could have killed 50,000 in the southwestern chinese province of sichuan .
the 72-year-old , who was awarded the nobel peace prize in 1989 for his efforts to achieve a non-violent solution to the tibetan problem , said he would pray for the victims .
frankfurt was the opening leg of a five-day tour of germany which will see the dalai lama speak on human rights and meet with a member of chancellor angela merkel 's cabinet in berlin .
after a breakfast meeting with roland koch , the conservative premier of the state of hesse , he traveled to bochum where he conferred with juergen ruettgers , prime minister of north rhine- westphalia , germany 's most populous state .
ruettgers said after the talks that the dalai lama had briefed him on the meetings between his representatives and the chinese government held in the aftermath of the freedom demonstrations in march that left an undetermined number of dead .
the talks , in the chinese city of shenzhen , had failed to generate the trust that was necessary to resolve the issue , the dalai lama said .
spiritual leader condemns chinese suppression bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the dalai lama spent the first day pressing the flesh the dalai lama also took the opportunity to lash out once more at the " suppression " of anti-chinese unrest in tibet .
" the chinese political authorities ' reaction , as before , was suppression .
so it is very sad , " the tibetan spiritual leader said after arriving in germany .
on wednesday , china protested at the dalai lama 's planned meetings with development minister heidemarie wieczorek-zeul and legislators at the german parliament .
the " dalai lama is not a normal monk , but a political exile who carries out anti-chinese and separatist activities abroad under the guise of religion , human rights and autonomy , " a statement released by the chinese embassy said .
the talks with wieczorek-zeul and members of the parliamentary foreign affairs committee are due to take place on may 19 when the dalai lama will also deliver a speech at berlin 's brandenburg gate .
the run-up to the visit was marked by a domestic row because no one in merkel 's government was prepared to meet him , apparently fearing it could upset china .
the meeting with the economic assistance minister was arranged at the last minute .

the dalai lama said he was not put off by this .
some " leading personalities find it uncomfortable to talk to me , " he said , " but that is all right . "

the dalai lama said he was deeply affected by monday 's devastating earthquake that officials fear could have killed 50,000 in the southwestern chinese province of sichuan .
the 72-year-old , who was awarded the nobel peace prize in 1989 for his efforts to achieve a non-violent solution to the tibetan problem , said he would pray for the victims .
frankfurt was the opening leg of a five-day tour of germany which will see the dalai lama speak on human rights and meet with a member of chancellor angela merkel 's cabinet in berlin .
after a breakfast meeting with roland koch , the conservative premier of the state of hesse , he traveled to bochum where he conferred with juergen ruettgers , prime minister of north rhine- westphalia , germany 's most populous state .
ruettgers said after the talks that the dalai lama had briefed him on the meetings between his representatives and the chinese government held in the aftermath of the freedom demonstrations in march that left an undetermined number of dead .
the talks , in the chinese city of shenzhen , had failed to generate the trust that was necessary to resolve the issue , the dalai lama said .

" the chinese political authorities ' reaction , as before , was suppression .
so it is very sad , " the tibetan spiritual leader said after arriving in germany .
on wednesday , china protested at the dalai lama 's planned meetings with development minister heidemarie wieczorek-zeul and legislators at the german parliament .
the " dalai lama is not a normal monk , but a political exile who carries out anti-chinese and separatist activities abroad under the guise of religion , human rights and autonomy , " a statement released by the chinese embassy said .
the talks with wieczorek-zeul and members of the parliamentary foreign affairs committee are due to take place on may 19 when the dalai lama will also deliver a speech at berlin 's brandenburg gate .
the run-up to the visit was marked by a domestic row because no one in merkel 's government was prepared to meet him , apparently fearing it could upset china .
the meeting with the economic assistance minister was arranged at the last minute .

after a breakfast meeting with roland koch , the conservative premier of the state of hesse , he traveled to bochum where he conferred with juergen ruettgers , prime minister of north rhine- westphalia , germany 's most populous state .
ruettgers said after the talks that the dalai lama had briefed him on the meetings between his representatives and the chinese government held in the aftermath of the freedom demonstrations in march that left an undetermined number of dead .
the talks , in the chinese city of shenzhen , had failed to generate the trust that was necessary to resolve the issue , the dalai lama said .
spiritual leader condemns chinese suppression bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the dalai lama spent the first day pressing the flesh the dalai lama also took the opportunity to lash out once more at the " suppression " of anti-chinese unrest in tibet .
" the chinese political authorities ' reaction , as before , was suppression .
so it is very sad , " the tibetan spiritual leader said after arriving in germany .
on wednesday , china protested at the dalai lama 's planned meetings with development minister heidemarie wieczorek-zeul and legislators at the german parliament .
the " dalai lama is not a normal monk , but a political exile who carries out anti-chinese and separatist activities abroad under the guise of religion , human rights and autonomy , " a statement released by the chinese embassy said .
the talks with wieczorek-zeul and members of the parliamentary foreign affairs committee are due to take place on may 19 when the dalai lama will also deliver a speech at berlin 's brandenburg gate .
the run-up to the visit was marked by a domestic row because no one in merkel 's government was prepared to meet him , apparently fearing it could upset china .
the meeting with the economic assistance minister was arranged at the last minute .
lama unmoved by german domestic row over visit bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel met with the dalai lama during a 2007 visit , but is in latin america this week the chancellor is in latin america and her deputy , foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier , turned down an official request for a meeting , saying he does not have time .
the dalai lama said he was not put off by this .
some " leading personalities find it uncomfortable to talk to me , " he said , " but that is all right . "
merkel met the dalai lama at the federal chancellery last september , a move which led to a chill in relations between berlin and beijing that ended only in january after intense german diplomatic efforts .
chinese communist forces invaded tibet in 1950 .
since the tibetan resistance movement collapsed in 1959 , the dalai lama has lived in india , where the tibetan government-in-exile is based . dw staff / dpa -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

ukrainian journalist yevgeny minko said he was disappointed with how the erroneous story was handled . dw-world.de was among the european media sources to publish the falsified report on its english site in april 2008 .
it has since been removed from the web site .
the editors apologize to those readers who were offended by the publication of the article . yevgeny minko is editor-in-chief of telekritika , a monthly publication focusing on media issues in ukraine .
the following interview was conducted by email . dw-world.de : where did the inaccurate story originate and how did it spread ? yevgeny minko : the original story about the doll was published in the ukrainian newspaper dzerkalo tyzhnya -lrb- www.dt.ua -rrb- .
the author , andriy kapustin , described an incident of seeing a hitler doll manufactured in taiwan in one of kyiv 's novelty stores .
of course , he was not very pleased with what he saw .
he somewhat satirized the resemblance with the barbie doll , envisioning a hypothesized ukrainian family playing with the toy hitler .
nevertheless , he stressed that such a doll must not be welcome in a country that suffered from a nazi invasion during world war ii . this was a single incident of witnessing a hitler doll in kyiv .
no reports of massive sales are available . after a few days , -lsb- german news agency -rsb- dpa spread a brief translation of this feature .
their version contained a number of errors .
the text suggested that the hitler doll was going to be manufactured by a local company and would start selling in ukraine soon , which would definitely cause controversy in the country . as far as i understand , this erroneous translation was widespread and caused consequential reports in the media outside of ukraine . was the story correctly reported in the media outside of ukraine ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hitler invaded ukraine in 1941 , sending thousands to nazi concentration camps absolutely not .
first of all , russia 's first television channel made a very biased report , claiming that this hitler doll is a hit in kyiv , and queues of people willing to buy it were gathering in stores - although they failed to show these queues .
the report also implied that there were strong nazi tendencies in the policies of the ukrainian state . the bbc subsequently aired this report with an original text by jane hadden , although the latter was pretty close to the original . the daily telegraph and daily mail presented their own versions of the story .
the one from daily mail came out in classic tabloid style - shocking and provocative .
their feature roused response from readers who were horrified by the story . what were the most glaring omissions or mistakes in the article carried by the media outside of ukraine ? first , the doll is not made by a ukrainian manufacturer , it was made in taiwan .
second , there is no ukrainian manufacturer that plans to sell hitler dolls across ukraine .
hence , no one plans to sell this doll with a variety of accessories .
third , ukrainian supermarkets do not sell this doll on a massive scale .
it was witnessed in a single novelty store . do you agree with the suspicions of some that there is an anti-ukrainian agenda to the story ? well , i am not a fan of conspiracy theories , so i would rather not say there was a certain anti-ukrainian agenda on the part of the media that spread the story .
except perhaps for russia 's first channel , which is known for its anti-ukrainian attitude and propaganda-like methods .
the other cases seem to be the result of negligent , careless reporting .
sadly , it was the most famous european media outlets that failed to stand up to professional standards . do you think that the media outlets that carried the story considered a possible anti-ukrainian agenda ? the european media was very inaccurate in their reports .
for instance , very few of the reporters mentioned the original source of the story - dzerkalo tyzhnya newspaper .
the bbc did not make it clear that the shown footage was basically a b-roll made by -lsb- russia 's -rsb- first channel .
daily mail and deutsche welle failed to mention any original source for their reports . did the media that brought the inaccurate story respond to inquires in an appropriate manner ? not really .

ukrainian journalist yevgeny minko said he was disappointed with how the erroneous story was handled . dw-world.de was among the european media sources to publish the falsified report on its english site in april 2008 .
it has since been removed from the web site .
the editors apologize to those readers who were offended by the publication of the article . yevgeny minko is editor-in-chief of telekritika , a monthly publication focusing on media issues in ukraine .
the following interview was conducted by email . dw-world.de : where did the inaccurate story originate and how did it spread ? yevgeny minko : the original story about the doll was published in the ukrainian newspaper dzerkalo tyzhnya -lrb- www.dt.ua -rrb- .
the author , andriy kapustin , described an incident of seeing a hitler doll manufactured in taiwan in one of kyiv 's novelty stores .
of course , he was not very pleased with what he saw .
he somewhat satirized the resemblance with the barbie doll , envisioning a hypothesized ukrainian family playing with the toy hitler .
nevertheless , he stressed that such a doll must not be welcome in a country that suffered from a nazi invasion during world war ii . this was a single incident of witnessing a hitler doll in kyiv .
no reports of massive sales are available . after a few days , -lsb- german news agency -rsb- dpa spread a brief translation of this feature .
their version contained a number of errors .
the text suggested that the hitler doll was going to be manufactured by a local company and would start selling in ukraine soon , which would definitely cause controversy in the country . as far as i understand , this erroneous translation was widespread and caused consequential reports in the media outside of ukraine . was the story correctly reported in the media outside of ukraine ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hitler invaded ukraine in 1941 , sending thousands to nazi concentration camps absolutely not .
first of all , russia 's first television channel made a very biased report , claiming that this hitler doll is a hit in kyiv , and queues of people willing to buy it were gathering in stores - although they failed to show these queues .
the report also implied that there were strong nazi tendencies in the policies of the ukrainian state . the bbc subsequently aired this report with an original text by jane hadden , although the latter was pretty close to the original . the daily telegraph and daily mail presented their own versions of the story .
the one from daily mail came out in classic tabloid style - shocking and provocative .
their feature roused response from readers who were horrified by the story . what were the most glaring omissions or mistakes in the article carried by the media outside of ukraine ? first , the doll is not made by a ukrainian manufacturer , it was made in taiwan .
second , there is no ukrainian manufacturer that plans to sell hitler dolls across ukraine .
hence , no one plans to sell this doll with a variety of accessories .
third , ukrainian supermarkets do not sell this doll on a massive scale .
it was witnessed in a single novelty store . do you agree with the suspicions of some that there is an anti-ukrainian agenda to the story ? well , i am not a fan of conspiracy theories , so i would rather not say there was a certain anti-ukrainian agenda on the part of the media that spread the story .
except perhaps for russia 's first channel , which is known for its anti-ukrainian attitude and propaganda-like methods .
the other cases seem to be the result of negligent , careless reporting .
sadly , it was the most famous european media outlets that failed to stand up to professional standards . do you think that the media outlets that carried the story considered a possible anti-ukrainian agenda ? the european media was very inaccurate in their reports .
for instance , very few of the reporters mentioned the original source of the story - dzerkalo tyzhnya newspaper .
the bbc did not make it clear that the shown footage was basically a b-roll made by -lsb- russia 's -rsb- first channel .
daily mail and deutsche welle failed to mention any original source for their reports . did the media that brought the inaccurate story respond to inquires in an appropriate manner ? not really .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de theater -pipe- 15.05.2008 director explains allure of america-focused theater festival großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : putting known film actors on stage is one of hoffmann 's successful moves dw-world talked to frank hoffmann , the artistic director of the ruhrfestspiele theater festival , about his decision to make america , land of cinema , the focus of his 2008 season . the ruhrfestspiele , or ruhr theater festival , one of europe 's most important and oldest theater festivals , opened this year on may 1 , 2008 , and runs through june 15 , 2008 .
ever since it was born of a unique deal between miners and actors who traded coal for performances during the hard winter of 1946/47 , the festival has kept up the tradition of putting on top-quality international productions in germany 's working-class ruhr valley . luxembourg director frank hoffmann took the artistic helm of the festival in 2004 at a precarious time in its history , pulling it back from the brink of bankruptcy and boosting visitor numbers from year to year .
in a conversation with dw-world.de , he discussed his fascination with modern american theater , and divulged his recipe for success . in the past you have focused on different authors at the ruhr festival .
this year you took on a country , america .
why ? originally we wanted to stay with my concept of focusing on a playwright , and i thought it might be arthur miller .
but then it became clear to me that we had to take a broad look at american theater of the 20th century .
that era - from eugene o ’ neill , whom you can count as the father of american theater , to today ’ s authors - underwent a singular development .
i thought it was worth focusing the festival on it . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hoffmann 's approach has had popular appeal weren ’ t you concerned that featuring the us could stigmatize the festival ?
after all , many europeans these days are fed up with american politics .
and the us is much better known for its pop culture than for its high art . it 's true that the image of america is not necessarily very positive , especially among artists , and especially when it comes to foreign policy .
i ’ m critical too - whether about the iraq war or other things that have happened during the bush presidency .
still , america is a very great nation and a great culture , and you have to be able to separate those things .
i think us theater rises above pop culture . european authors early in the last century - strindberg , ibsen , kafka - they all influenced american theater incredibly .
the american authors have absorbed it and are giving it back to us , with a focus of their own . what sets american theater apart ? american theater has a strong tie to cinema , much more than in any other country .
playwrights like david mamet and sam shepard are also hollywood scriptwriters .
this tie between cinema and theater is present even when it comes to actors , who play both on the stage and screen .
and there were many plays that have been turned into films .
there are enough interesting ties to support a festival . your predecessor at the festival , frank castorf , lasted less than a year .
his avant garde approach turned off the public , and the festival almost went bankrupt .
you have been lauded for rescuing the festival by putting on plays people wanted to see , and pulling in big-name actors .
what message does that send about pushing artistic boundaries ? we sold more than 75,000 tickets this year , more than ever in the history of the festival .
which means we have to suit many peoples ’ tastes .
but i want to be clear that we do not just put on popular plays .
we have a lot of world premieres and germany premieres .
we do modern theater , unconventional theater . our public is ready to take in the new ; they demand it .
but they also want to see popular things . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : austere aesthetics are frequent in in festival productions i can ’ t say exactly what explains our success but i think it has to do with how we present theater to people .
there isn ’ t just one aesthetic or style at the festival , there are many different aesthetics .
and the interesting thing is they are all found side by side .
they all bump up against each other .
it is exciting . so what is your recipe for a good theater festival ? first , there is the idea of it being strongly focused on a given concept or topic .
in the past it was an author , like shakespeare , beckett or goethe .
it allowed the viewer to compare a variety of different productions of one author 's work , and compare them . second , i created the idea of having festivals within a festival .
we have a festival of world premieres - every year there are three .
we have a series called young theater , with plays by young actors and directors .
we have a cabaret festival , and a children ’ s festival .
we try to make clear divisions . do you , personally , advocate a certain type of theater ? i think one thing is important - it has to be a sensual experience .
on the other hand , it has to be an adventure for the mind .
i think it needs to have both of those sides . in the past you have directed plays by a lot of europeans and south americans .
this year you are directing " a moon for the misbegotten , " by eugene o ’ neill .
was it a different experience for you ? no matter what i am directing , my method is the same .
i explore the play to its depths , and try to find out what holds it together .
in the context of this festival , of course , the subject of america had to be dealt with . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the troupe kataklo combine sport and theater i found it fascinating to work on this play because i have never been closer to using language of film - and not because i used any media in the production .
i ’ m talking in terms of the spirit of the play .
it was important for me to tie together the emotionality of cinema with the directness of theater . you said arthur miller was the starting point for this festival , and you are showcasing two of his plays : " the crucible " and " resurrection blues . "
both are on very political topics .
were you trying to make a point ? there are so many plays that i think are very current , beyond their time .
they have everything to do with our daily reality .
as a director , i can not avoid dealing with political issues .
and you can ’ t take on the topic of america without asking political questions . this year i am also directing " true west , " by sam shepard .
it is a piece from 1980 , but while i directed it i was very conscious of 9/11 .
you read this play differently knowing that 9/11 happened , and the audience sees it differently .
it is very enriching . interview : jennifer abramsohn send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

ever since it was born of a unique deal between miners and actors who traded coal for performances during the hard winter of 1946/47 , the festival has kept up the tradition of putting on top-quality international productions in germany 's working-class ruhr valley . luxembourg director frank hoffmann took the artistic helm of the festival in 2004 at a precarious time in its history , pulling it back from the brink of bankruptcy and boosting visitor numbers from year to year .
in a conversation with dw-world.de , he discussed his fascination with modern american theater , and divulged his recipe for success . in the past you have focused on different authors at the ruhr festival .
this year you took on a country , america .

it was important for me to tie together the emotionality of cinema with the directness of theater . you said arthur miller was the starting point for this festival , and you are showcasing two of his plays : " the crucible " and " resurrection blues . "
both are on very political topics .
were you trying to make a point ? there are so many plays that i think are very current , beyond their time .
they have everything to do with our daily reality .
as a director , i can not avoid dealing with political issues .
and you can ’ t take on the topic of america without asking political questions . this year i am also directing " true west , " by sam shepard .
it is a piece from 1980 , but while i directed it i was very conscious of 9/11 .

ever since it was born of a unique deal between miners and actors who traded coal for performances during the hard winter of 1946/47 , the festival has kept up the tradition of putting on top-quality international productions in germany 's working-class ruhr valley . luxembourg director frank hoffmann took the artistic helm of the festival in 2004 at a precarious time in its history , pulling it back from the brink of bankruptcy and boosting visitor numbers from year to year .
in a conversation with dw-world.de , he discussed his fascination with modern american theater , and divulged his recipe for success . in the past you have focused on different authors at the ruhr festival .
this year you took on a country , america .
why ? originally we wanted to stay with my concept of focusing on a playwright , and i thought it might be arthur miller .
but then it became clear to me that we had to take a broad look at american theater of the 20th century .
that era - from eugene o ’ neill , whom you can count as the father of american theater , to today ’ s authors - underwent a singular development .
i thought it was worth focusing the festival on it . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hoffmann 's approach has had popular appeal weren ’ t you concerned that featuring the us could stigmatize the festival ?
after all , many europeans these days are fed up with american politics .
and the us is much better known for its pop culture than for its high art . it 's true that the image of america is not necessarily very positive , especially among artists , and especially when it comes to foreign policy .
i ’ m critical too - whether about the iraq war or other things that have happened during the bush presidency .
still , america is a very great nation and a great culture , and you have to be able to separate those things .
i think us theater rises above pop culture . european authors early in the last century - strindberg , ibsen , kafka - they all influenced american theater incredibly .
the american authors have absorbed it and are giving it back to us , with a focus of their own . what sets american theater apart ? american theater has a strong tie to cinema , much more than in any other country .
playwrights like david mamet and sam shepard are also hollywood scriptwriters .
this tie between cinema and theater is present even when it comes to actors , who play both on the stage and screen .
and there were many plays that have been turned into films .
there are enough interesting ties to support a festival . your predecessor at the festival , frank castorf , lasted less than a year .
his avant garde approach turned off the public , and the festival almost went bankrupt .
you have been lauded for rescuing the festival by putting on plays people wanted to see , and pulling in big-name actors .
what message does that send about pushing artistic boundaries ? we sold more than 75,000 tickets this year , more than ever in the history of the festival .
which means we have to suit many peoples ’ tastes .
but i want to be clear that we do not just put on popular plays .
we have a lot of world premieres and germany premieres .
we do modern theater , unconventional theater . our public is ready to take in the new ; they demand it .
but they also want to see popular things . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : austere aesthetics are frequent in in festival productions i can ’ t say exactly what explains our success but i think it has to do with how we present theater to people .
there isn ’ t just one aesthetic or style at the festival , there are many different aesthetics .
and the interesting thing is they are all found side by side .
they all bump up against each other .
it is exciting . so what is your recipe for a good theater festival ? first , there is the idea of it being strongly focused on a given concept or topic .
in the past it was an author , like shakespeare , beckett or goethe .
it allowed the viewer to compare a variety of different productions of one author 's work , and compare them . second , i created the idea of having festivals within a festival .
we have a festival of world premieres - every year there are three .
we have a series called young theater , with plays by young actors and directors .
we have a cabaret festival , and a children ’ s festival .
we try to make clear divisions . do you , personally , advocate a certain type of theater ? i think one thing is important - it has to be a sensual experience .
on the other hand , it has to be an adventure for the mind .
i think it needs to have both of those sides . in the past you have directed plays by a lot of europeans and south americans .
this year you are directing " a moon for the misbegotten , " by eugene o ’ neill .
was it a different experience for you ? no matter what i am directing , my method is the same .
i explore the play to its depths , and try to find out what holds it together .
in the context of this festival , of course , the subject of america had to be dealt with . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the troupe kataklo combine sport and theater i found it fascinating to work on this play because i have never been closer to using language of film - and not because i used any media in the production .

" -lsb- lula -rsb- said to me that he would receive the german chancellor , " said chavez .
" and i said , please greet her from me .
she comes here and throws stones , for reasons i do not know .
some european heads of state come in order to meet with us , and already before their arrival are throwing stones . " the tit for tat between the venezuelan and german leaders started when merkel told german news agency dpa in an interview ahead of this week 's summit of the european union , latin american and caribbean nations that the left-wing chavez is not the voice of the region . chavez replied aggressively late sunday in his weekly radio and television program , saying that merkel belongs to the political right , " the same right that supported hitler and fascism . " merkel downplays fascist accusations on tuesday the venezuelan government issued a statement stressing that merkel is not the eu 's only voice and demanded " respect " from germany . on wednesday , merkel did not respond directly to any remarks from chavez , only saying she wanted to " tighten the strategic partnership with latin america . " " president lula can relax ; i can look after myself , " merkel said when asked whether brazil 's head-of-state could help smooth over the dispute . lula da silva was also optimistic about the upcoming meeting : " if i know chavez and merkel well , they will sit down , have a cup of coffee and peace will reign between caracas and bonn , " he said , mistakenly referring to germany 's former capital . the german chancellor traveled to latin america on tuesday and met with the brazilian president on wednesday in brasilia to discuss broader bilateral economic ties . merkel , chavez and some 60 leaders from the european union , latin america and the caribbean are set to meet friday and saturday in lima , for the summit that the two regions hold every two years . dw staff -lrb- kjb -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

but for pro-palestinian germans , as well as those who deal intensively with the middle east conflict , may 14 underscores the uniquely perilous tightrope walk germany must perform in its position toward those who have suffered under israeli occupation .
" there is no such thing as a german-palestinian relationship without the german-israeli relationship , " said rene wildangel , a historian and green party expert on the middle east .
" whether one thinks that 's good or bad , that 's the case right now .
if you look at german chancellor angela merkel 's recent trip to israel , she made it quite clear how close the german-israeli relationship is . "
merkel visited israel in march , when she became the first head of government to speak - in german - to the israeli parliament , the knesset .
but some people in germany , including palestinians residents , were upset that the chancellor did not raise the middle east conflict in her speech .
" there was a storm of outrage that went through the palestinian communities , " said erhard arendt , who runs the palaestina portal , germany 's largest internet forum for discussing palestinian affairs .
" hundreds of letters were written to newspapers , saying ' we did n't crop up in -lsb- the speech -rsb- at all .

public opinion versus policy bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel 's speech to the knesset on march 18 drew praise and criticism the german government support for israel is , of course , programmed by germans ' sense of shame and guilt for the holocaust , as well as their desire to atone concretely for the horrors of the past .
but the german people are often far more sympathetic to palestinian plight and far more willing to criticize israel than their government .
" according to one survey , 63 percent of the populace does n't think israel 's policies are right , " arendt said .
germans ' empathy for the palestinians often originates in attempts to come to terms with their own past .
" without doubt , the fact that i was intensely interested in the holocaust led me to get involved in palestinian affairs , " said arendt , who was born in 1941 .
" that certainly strengthened the idea in me that nothing even remotely similar should be allowed to happen again - anywhere and at any time . "
germans ' attitudes differ from opinion poll to opinion poll , depending on which questions are asked .

it was openly hostile to israel and at least nominally supportive of palestinians ' desire for a state of their own .
and in the 1970s , the anti-imperialist terrorist group raf in west germany and palestinian militants also identified closely with one another .
most spectacularly , members of a group called " the popular front for the liberation of palestine " hijacked a lufthansa plane in 1977 , demanding among other things the release of raf terrorists from prison .

" whether one thinks that 's good or bad , that 's the case right now .
if you look at german chancellor angela merkel 's recent trip to israel , she made it quite clear how close the german-israeli relationship is . "
merkel visited israel in march , when she became the first head of government to speak - in german - to the israeli parliament , the knesset .

most spectacularly , members of a group called " the popular front for the liberation of palestine " hijacked a lufthansa plane in 1977 , demanding among other things the release of raf terrorists from prison .
german special forces successfully stormed the plane at mogadishu airport , killing the hijackers .
such incidents shocked mainstream germans and their government .
" i do n't think that this course of action was very useful to the palestinians , " wildangel said .
" i see it as an extreme , and ultimately marginal , chapter in the history of german-palestinian relations . "
faint prospects for change bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the eu may be the best hope for easing german-palestinian relations there is little chance that germany will decrease the support , financial or military , it offers to israel - although german palestinian advocates continue to argue that the country has a responsibility to do precisely that .
" we should be criticizing , making demands and taking action , " arendt said .
" providing weapons to a crisis region violates every international agreement there is , yet weapons are delivered to israel , including armored scout cars , that are used to kill palestinians . "
but the situation could change somewhat if foreign policy is de-nationalized .
" i think the palestinians have to recognize what the relationship between germany and israel is and acknowledge that the past happened , " wildangel said .
" but they can expect the european union - and that 's the level where the financial and political decisions are made now - to be critical of israeli state polices wherever they are problematic for the palestinians and the peace process .
" palestinians can expect that german and european politicians to push seriously for a peaceful settlement , " wildangel added .
" that includes a certain amount of objectivity and a sense of responsibility for both sides . " jefferson chase send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

ever since it was born of a unique deal between miners and actors who traded coal for performances during the hard winter of 1946/47 , the festival has kept up the tradition of putting on top-quality international productions in germany 's working-class ruhr valley . luxembourg director frank hoffmann took the artistic helm of the festival in 2004 at a precarious time in its history , pulling it back from the brink of bankruptcy and boosting visitor numbers from year to year .
in a conversation with dw-world.de , he discussed his fascination with modern american theater , and divulged his recipe for success . in the past you have focused on different authors at the ruhr festival .
this year you took on a country , america .
why ? originally we wanted to stay with my concept of focusing on a playwright , and i thought it might be arthur miller .
but then it became clear to me that we had to take a broad look at american theater of the 20th century .
that era - from eugene o ’ neill , whom you can count as the father of american theater , to today ’ s authors - underwent a singular development .
i thought it was worth focusing the festival on it . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hoffmann 's approach has had popular appeal weren ’ t you concerned that featuring the us could stigmatize the festival ?
after all , many europeans these days are fed up with american politics .
and the us is much better known for its pop culture than for its high art . it 's true that the image of america is not necessarily very positive , especially among artists , and especially when it comes to foreign policy .
i ’ m critical too - whether about the iraq war or other things that have happened during the bush presidency .
still , america is a very great nation and a great culture , and you have to be able to separate those things .
i think us theater rises above pop culture . european authors early in the last century - strindberg , ibsen , kafka - they all influenced american theater incredibly .
the american authors have absorbed it and are giving it back to us , with a focus of their own . what sets american theater apart ? american theater has a strong tie to cinema , much more than in any other country .
playwrights like david mamet and sam shepard are also hollywood scriptwriters .
this tie between cinema and theater is present even when it comes to actors , who play both on the stage and screen .
and there were many plays that have been turned into films .
there are enough interesting ties to support a festival . your predecessor at the festival , frank castorf , lasted less than a year .
his avant garde approach turned off the public , and the festival almost went bankrupt .
you have been lauded for rescuing the festival by putting on plays people wanted to see , and pulling in big-name actors .
what message does that send about pushing artistic boundaries ? we sold more than 75,000 tickets this year , more than ever in the history of the festival .
which means we have to suit many peoples ’ tastes .
but i want to be clear that we do not just put on popular plays .
we have a lot of world premieres and germany premieres .
we do modern theater , unconventional theater . our public is ready to take in the new ; they demand it .
but they also want to see popular things . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : austere aesthetics are frequent in in festival productions i can ’ t say exactly what explains our success but i think it has to do with how we present theater to people .
there isn ’ t just one aesthetic or style at the festival , there are many different aesthetics .
and the interesting thing is they are all found side by side .
they all bump up against each other .
it is exciting . so what is your recipe for a good theater festival ? first , there is the idea of it being strongly focused on a given concept or topic .
in the past it was an author , like shakespeare , beckett or goethe .
it allowed the viewer to compare a variety of different productions of one author 's work , and compare them . second , i created the idea of having festivals within a festival .
we have a festival of world premieres - every year there are three .
we have a series called young theater , with plays by young actors and directors .
we have a cabaret festival , and a children ’ s festival .
we try to make clear divisions . do you , personally , advocate a certain type of theater ? i think one thing is important - it has to be a sensual experience .
on the other hand , it has to be an adventure for the mind .
i think it needs to have both of those sides . in the past you have directed plays by a lot of europeans and south americans .
this year you are directing " a moon for the misbegotten , " by eugene o ’ neill .
was it a different experience for you ? no matter what i am directing , my method is the same .
i explore the play to its depths , and try to find out what holds it together .
in the context of this festival , of course , the subject of america had to be dealt with . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the troupe kataklo combine sport and theater i found it fascinating to work on this play because i have never been closer to using language of film - and not because i used any media in the production .
i ’ m talking in terms of the spirit of the play .
it was important for me to tie together the emotionality of cinema with the directness of theater . you said arthur miller was the starting point for this festival , and you are showcasing two of his plays : " the crucible " and " resurrection blues . "
both are on very political topics .
were you trying to make a point ? there are so many plays that i think are very current , beyond their time .
they have everything to do with our daily reality .
as a director , i can not avoid dealing with political issues .
and you can ’ t take on the topic of america without asking political questions . this year i am also directing " true west , " by sam shepard .
it is a piece from 1980 , but while i directed it i was very conscious of 9/11 .
you read this play differently knowing that 9/11 happened , and the audience sees it differently .
it is very enriching . interview : jennifer abramsohn send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

in the amazonian state of para , years of destruction have left their mark , with land cleared by loggers or for use by cattle .
travel in this area can be precarious , as you drive along flooded dirt tracks and cross fragile bridges just narrow enough for one vehicle to pass .
twisted metal hangs from the front of a bus that amazingly makes its way along this route , creeping tentatively up the muddier slopes , and travelling more slowly going down them .
we are making a five-hour journey from the town of paragominas , to the small community of tembe indians .
this report is part of a bbc world service special on the amazon rainforest .
starting at 0500 gmt on thursday 15 may , there are live and recorded broadcasts .
highlights include a double edition of newshour , presented live from three locations in brazil - manaus , paragominas and alta floresta - at 1200 and a one hour special at 1600 .
bbc world service special report prince charles urges logging halt this tribe now has the support of government agencies and some of the wooden houses with thatched roofs have satellite dishes , but this was an isolated group of people when they were discovered by catholic missionaries in the 17th century .
local community leader valdeci tembe tries to preserve some of the rituals here , singing in his native tupi guarani language , and handing down traditions to his children as was done from generation to generation .
these are some of brazil 's poorest people , and for the families who live here along the river life follows a simple routine .
illegal logging in the hot sticky rainforest the cooling waters are a welcome relief for the local children , while for one boy a monkey from the nearby rainforest is a favourite family pet .
government agencies do provide backup and medical assistance , but the community here says the government has no coherent plan for the future .
on indigenous land in the nearby rainforest there are also signs of illegal logging , which local people say the authorities have allowed to happen here for at least 20 years .
the tembe indians say around 40 % of their land has been cleared , but the government ignored pleas to do anything about it .
they say that as the authorities failed to act , some of their community also became involved in selling wood illegally , but for now this has stopped .
among indians traditionally associated with protecting the rainforest , it seems some began to ask why if others are making profits from the wood , should it not be open to them as well .
" in truth this community is tired of waiting for some response from the government not only to protect the forest , but to give the native indians better conditions of living , says valdeci .
" this has never happened and has led to the indian community getting caught up in the selling of wood . "
sympathy ' not enough ' it is this general impunity surrounding logging which valdeci says prompted some indigenous people to get involved in the past , he says .
" in fact cutting wood is not a problem for anyone .
in reality people cut wood where this is an indian reserve or where there this not - even when it is illegal they cut , " says valdeci .
" what motivates this is the impunity . "
the plight of indigenous people in this area is recognised by the brazilian authorities .
" a combination of a clampdown by the police and the state to the prevent the illegal removal of wood is fundamental , " says juscelino de carmo bessa , of funai , the government agency which looks after the interests of indigenous people .
have your say " surely better control and management of the current resources would be a better plan , or do they seem to forget that an enormous percentage of all the oxygen worldwide originates from the amazon area ? "
nick beck , bournemouth send us your comments " but it has to be combined with economic alternatives for them to buy the products they need from the market but which they do n't have . "
but for the tembe indians sympathy is no longer enough - they say they want options that will guarantee an economic future for them and their children , such as sustainable logging in the nearby forest .
as night falls on another day in amazon these are troubling times for the region 's oldest residents , who say they are still waiting for the full extent of their problems to be recognised .

while expected to cause a rise in crime statistics , jacqui smith said the move would offer an understanding of how crime affects young people .
children 's groups want youngsters to be included in the bcs and ms smith has asked for views on how to survey them .
meanwhile , research suggests that one in eight children aged 11 to 16 has been the victim of a gadget theft .
children 's groups say there is no reason for young people not to be surveyed and the home office is appealing for advice on which age groups should take part in the bcs .
this could result in children under 10 - who legally can not be held responsible for their actions - being asked if they have been victims of crime . "
children are amongst the most victimised of all age groups when it comes to crimes like violence , and yet we more often hear about children as criminals themselves . "
kathy evans , the children 's society designing the solution to crime the bcs is currently based on the conclusions of 40,000 interviews conducted with adults about their experience of crime .
ms smith said : " we know that young people remain more likely to be victims of crime than perpetrators .
" extending the bcs will help us to understand better how crime affects young people and do even more to prevent it . "
' staggering complacency ' the shadow home secretary , david davis , welcomed the changes but said the bsc failed to count other serious crimes such as murder , rape , shoplifting and fraud .
" this demonstrates labour 's staggering complacency - if you do n't count crime properly , how can you cut it ? , " mr davis said .
liberal democrat home affairs spokesman chris huhne also greeted the move , but said more needed to be done to deal with weapons like guns and knives .
" the government has got to take action to get these weapons off our streets by reaching out to communities and using intelligence-led stop and search . "
tim bateman , of crime reduction charity nacro , said the decision " should go some way to redressing the balance between the public 's perception that young people are primarily offenders and the reality that they are subject to relatively high levels of victimisation " .
expensive belongings kathy evans , director of policy at the children 's society , said the extension of the british crime survey to include children was long-overdue .
" children are amongst the most victimised of all age groups when it comes to crimes like violence , and yet we more often hear about children as criminals themselves .
" it is essential , when the bcs is so influential in public policy on crime , that it should include a truer picture of the volume and type of offences against crime 's youngest victims , " she added .
design council poll findings one in eight children has had a gadget stolen in the last three years one in three were occupied - listening to music , texting , talking on a mobile - when the item was stolen 97 % carry an expensive item on them ; 85 % frequently carry a mobile phone almost half of those who carry an expensive item estimate its value at £ 100 to £ 500 the announcement comes as a poll conducted for the design council shows that children are vulnerable to crime - one in eight has had a gadget stolen in the last three years .
the poll of 1,000 children aged 11 to 16 found that one in three victims were listening to music on headphones , talking on a mobile , texting , or playing games on a console when their item was stolen .
it also found that 97 % of children carry expensive belongings on them , with almost half estimating the value of their product at between £ 100 and £ 500 .
bags which ' scream ' uk technology designers and manufacturers will join the home secretary later at an event , hosted by the design council , to discuss new ways of harnessing design power to combat crime .
initiatives include chairs with hidden compartments to hold personal belongings , bags which " scream " when snatched , and " m " - shaped bike racks which encourage cyclists to lock up their bikes properly .
the home office use two methods to count crime ; the bcs and recorded crime statistics .

while expected to cause a rise in crime statistics , jacqui smith said the move would offer an understanding of how crime affects young people .
children 's groups want youngsters to be included in the bcs and ms smith has asked for views on how to survey them .
meanwhile , research suggests that one in eight children aged 11 to 16 has been the victim of a gadget theft .
children 's groups say there is no reason for young people not to be surveyed and the home office is appealing for advice on which age groups should take part in the bcs .
this could result in children under 10 - who legally can not be held responsible for their actions - being asked if they have been victims of crime .
children are amongst the most victimised of all age groups when it comes to crimes like violence , and yet we more often hear about children as criminals themselves .
kathy evans , the children 's society designing the solution to crime the bcs is currently based on the conclusions of 40,000 interviews conducted with adults about their experience of crime .
ms smith said : " we know that young people remain more likely to be victims of crime than perpetrators .
" extending the bcs will help us to understand better how crime affects young people and do even more to prevent it . "
' staggering complacency ' the shadow home secretary , david davis , welcomed the changes but said the bsc failed to count other serious crimes such as murder , rape , shoplifting and fraud .
" this demonstrates labour 's staggering complacency - if you do n't count crime properly , how can you cut it ? , " mr davis said .
liberal democrat home affairs spokesman chris huhne also greeted the move , but said more needed to be done to deal with weapons like guns and knives .
" the government has got to take action to get these weapons off our streets by reaching out to communities and using intelligence-led stop and search . "
tim bateman , of crime reduction charity nacro , said the decision " should go some way to redressing the balance between the public 's perception that young people are primarily offenders and the reality that they are subject to relatively high levels of victimisation " .
expensive belongings kathy evans , director of policy at the children 's society , said the extension of the british crime survey to include children was long-overdue .
" children are amongst the most victimised of all age groups when it comes to crimes like violence , and yet we more often hear about children as criminals themselves .
" it is essential , when the bcs is so influential in public policy on crime , that it should include a truer picture of the volume and type of offences against crime 's youngest victims , " she added .

the national behaviour and attendance review , after a two-year study , says issues need to be addressed in primary schools to " nip these problems in the bud . "
it also wants intensive training for child welfare professionals and teachers to deal with bad behaviour .
the welsh assembly government is to develop an action plan in response .
the steering group was made up of teachers , academics , and representatives of children 's charities , police and social agencies , chaired by professor ken reid , of swansea metropolitan university .
the government here in wales is clearly worried about truancy - why else would they ask one of britain 's leading experts to spend two years compiling this report ?
and they have cause to be .
truancy is without doubt the biggest problem for schools in wales .
studies consistently show children who miss significant amounts of school are less likely to find employment and a stable home life .
they 're much more likely to get involved in crime or spend much of their lives on benefits .
the legacy of missed school is long and damaging .
according to welsh assembly government figures around 16,500 are away from lessons every day .
some are so called " authorised absentees " - away on holiday , or ill - but many are missing because they 're truants .
spotting the potential truants early is crucial , according to prof reid .
report findings there is a clear link between low literacy and behavioural and attendance problems a large number of professionals feel under-trained in handling attendance and behavioural problems there are too many ' unofficial exclusions ' from certain schools and a wide variation in the way the rules are applied the number of pupils out of school is not properly monitored there is a wide disparity in provision for out-of-school pupils in different council areas children should be listened too more closely on these issues greater inter-agency cooperation needed changing trends including the rise in behavioural problems among girls there is a rise pupils displaying problems well before key stage 3 all secondary schools needed a named professional to lead on these issues an assembly government action plan needs immediate and long term priorities source : national behaviour and attendance review -lrb- nbar -rrb- report at the moment he says help for disaffected students is geared towards those aged 14 plus .
" that 's too late , " he told me .
" you have to get in early if you want to make a difference . "
reading and writing is key .
unless they have those skills by the time they reach 11 , prof reid says the future is bleak .
" pupils who do not have the ability to read and write by the time they leave primary school fall further behind with their schoolwork , " he said .
" they are the pupils who become truants , they misbehave , they 're likely to get involved with bullying , they 're likely to be the pupils who are excluded and when they leave school they are likely to be the pupils who have major problems in their adult lives . "
the evidence is , says prof reid , that around 20 % of welsh children are not achieving the sort of results they should by 11 .
that means thousands of children could be at risk .
he said he was taking into account the fact that many more pupils from wales come from a disadvantaged backgrounds and that truancy issues date from about 1870 .
" even allowing for that , the fact remains that an awful lot of pupils underachieve in primary school and go on to underachieve even more when they get to the secondary stage and that is leading to further problems , " said prof reid .
so what does the report say about dealing with pupils who have been temporarily or permanently excluded ?
prof reid says legislation should be introduced by the assembly government compelling schools and education authorities to continue their education within days of their exclusion , rather than allowing them to roam the streets .
increasingly councils are using the courts to deal with the parents of truanting children .
local councils are increasingly using their powers and in recent years a number of parents - mainly mothers - have found themselves being imprisoned .
prof reid says jailing parents is " headline grabbing " but he is doubtful that prison has any long term effect on parents of persistent truants .
" it should only be used as a last resort , " he said .
these recommendations - including early intervention , training , increased emphasis on reading and writing - represent a seismic shift in policy .
if they 're adopted they will need significant funding and at a time of national belt tightening , is the money in the education kitty ?
education minister jane hutt said it was a " comprehensive body of work on a very important aspect of our education system " .
she said the views of pupils themselves had provided a " valuable insight " into the key issues surrounding behaviour and attendance .
ms hutt said a working group would be set up to develop an action plan by early next year in response to the recommendations .

the national behaviour and attendance review , after a two-year study , says issues need to be addressed in primary schools to " nip these problems in the bud . "
it also wants intensive training for child welfare professionals and teachers to deal with bad behaviour .
the welsh assembly government is to develop an action plan in response .
the steering group was made up of teachers , academics , and representatives of children 's charities , police and social agencies , chaired by professor ken reid , of swansea metropolitan university .
the government here in wales is clearly worried about truancy - why else would they ask one of britain 's leading experts to spend two years compiling this report ?
and they have cause to be .
truancy is without doubt the biggest problem for schools in wales .
studies consistently show children who miss significant amounts of school are less likely to find employment and a stable home life .
they 're much more likely to get involved in crime or spend much of their lives on benefits .
the legacy of missed school is long and damaging .
according to welsh assembly government figures around 16,500 are away from lessons every day .
some are so called " authorised absentees " - away on holiday , or ill - but many are missing because they 're truants .
spotting the potential truants early is crucial , according to prof reid .
report findings there is a clear link between low literacy and behavioural and attendance problems a large number of professionals feel under-trained in handling attendance and behavioural problems there are too many ' unofficial exclusions ' from certain schools and a wide variation in the way the rules are applied the number of pupils out of school is not properly monitored there is a wide disparity in provision for out-of-school pupils in different council areas children should be listened too more closely on these issues greater inter-agency cooperation needed changing trends including the rise in behavioural problems among girls there is a rise pupils displaying problems well before key stage 3 all secondary schools needed a named professional to lead on these issues an assembly government action plan needs immediate and long term priorities source : national behaviour and attendance review -lrb- nbar -rrb- report at the moment he says help for disaffected students is geared towards those aged 14 plus .
" that 's too late , " he told me .
" you have to get in early if you want to make a difference . "
reading and writing is key .
unless they have those skills by the time they reach 11 , prof reid says the future is bleak .
" pupils who do not have the ability to read and write by the time they leave primary school fall further behind with their schoolwork , " he said .
" they are the pupils who become truants , they misbehave , they 're likely to get involved with bullying , they 're likely to be the pupils who are excluded and when they leave school they are likely to be the pupils who have major problems in their adult lives . "
the evidence is , says prof reid , that around 20 % of welsh children are not achieving the sort of results they should by 11 .
that means thousands of children could be at risk .
he said he was taking into account the fact that many more pupils from wales come from a disadvantaged backgrounds and that truancy issues date from about 1870 .
" even allowing for that , the fact remains that an awful lot of pupils underachieve in primary school and go on to underachieve even more when they get to the secondary stage and that is leading to further problems , " said prof reid .
so what does the report say about dealing with pupils who have been temporarily or permanently excluded ?
prof reid says legislation should be introduced by the assembly government compelling schools and education authorities to continue their education within days of their exclusion , rather than allowing them to roam the streets .
increasingly councils are using the courts to deal with the parents of truanting children .
local councils are increasingly using their powers and in recent years a number of parents - mainly mothers - have found themselves being imprisoned .
prof reid says jailing parents is " headline grabbing " but he is doubtful that prison has any long term effect on parents of persistent truants .
" it should only be used as a last resort , " he said .
these recommendations - including early intervention , training , increased emphasis on reading and writing - represent a seismic shift in policy .
if they 're adopted they will need significant funding and at a time of national belt tightening , is the money in the education kitty ?
education minister jane hutt said it was a " comprehensive body of work on a very important aspect of our education system " .
she said the views of pupils themselves had provided a " valuable insight " into the key issues surrounding behaviour and attendance .
ms hutt said a working group would be set up to develop an action plan by early next year in response to the recommendations .

the national behaviour and attendance review , after a two-year study , says issues need to be addressed in primary schools to " nip these problems in the bud . "
it also wants intensive training for child welfare professionals and teachers to deal with bad behaviour .
the welsh assembly government is to develop an action plan in response .
the steering group was made up of teachers , academics , and representatives of children 's charities , police and social agencies , chaired by professor ken reid , of swansea metropolitan university .
the government here in wales is clearly worried about truancy - why else would they ask one of britain 's leading experts to spend two years compiling this report ?
and they have cause to be .
truancy is without doubt the biggest problem for schools in wales .
studies consistently show children who miss significant amounts of school are less likely to find employment and a stable home life .
they 're much more likely to get involved in crime or spend much of their lives on benefits .
the legacy of missed school is long and damaging .
according to welsh assembly government figures around 16,500 are away from lessons every day .
some are so called " authorised absentees " - away on holiday , or ill - but many are missing because they 're truants .
spotting the potential truants early is crucial , according to prof reid .
report findings there is a clear link between low literacy and behavioural and attendance problems a large number of professionals feel under-trained in handling attendance and behavioural problems there are too many ' unofficial exclusions ' from certain schools and a wide variation in the way the rules are applied the number of pupils out of school is not properly monitored there is a wide disparity in provision for out-of-school pupils in different council areas children should be listened too more closely on these issues greater inter-agency cooperation needed changing trends including the rise in behavioural problems among girls there is a rise pupils displaying problems well before key stage 3 all secondary schools needed a named professional to lead on these issues an assembly government action plan needs immediate and long term priorities source : national behaviour and attendance review -lrb- nbar -rrb- report at the moment he says help for disaffected students is geared towards those aged 14 plus .
" that 's too late , " he told me .
" you have to get in early if you want to make a difference . "
reading and writing is key .
unless they have those skills by the time they reach 11 , prof reid says the future is bleak .
" pupils who do not have the ability to read and write by the time they leave primary school fall further behind with their schoolwork , " he said .
" they are the pupils who become truants , they misbehave , they 're likely to get involved with bullying , they 're likely to be the pupils who are excluded and when they leave school they are likely to be the pupils who have major problems in their adult lives . "
the evidence is , says prof reid , that around 20 % of welsh children are not achieving the sort of results they should by 11 .
that means thousands of children could be at risk .
he said he was taking into account the fact that many more pupils from wales come from a disadvantaged backgrounds and that truancy issues date from about 1870 .
" even allowing for that , the fact remains that an awful lot of pupils underachieve in primary school and go on to underachieve even more when they get to the secondary stage and that is leading to further problems , " said prof reid .
so what does the report say about dealing with pupils who have been temporarily or permanently excluded ?
prof reid says legislation should be introduced by the assembly government compelling schools and education authorities to continue their education within days of their exclusion , rather than allowing them to roam the streets .
increasingly councils are using the courts to deal with the parents of truanting children .
local councils are increasingly using their powers and in recent years a number of parents - mainly mothers - have found themselves being imprisoned .
prof reid says jailing parents is " headline grabbing " but he is doubtful that prison has any long term effect on parents of persistent truants .
" it should only be used as a last resort , " he said .
these recommendations - including early intervention , training , increased emphasis on reading and writing - represent a seismic shift in policy .
if they 're adopted they will need significant funding and at a time of national belt tightening , is the money in the education kitty ?
education minister jane hutt said it was a " comprehensive body of work on a very important aspect of our education system " .
she said the views of pupils themselves had provided a " valuable insight " into the key issues surrounding behaviour and attendance .
ms hutt said a working group would be set up to develop an action plan by early next year in response to the recommendations .

i believe that if our recommendations to the welsh assembly government are followed , there is a considerable possibility that we can make great strides in managing pupils ' behaviour and attendance in wales .
let me discuss some of our key findings and the reasons for them .
first , we believe that all teachers and child welfare professionals in wales should receive significant training in behaviour management .
second , we consider that there should be much earlier intervention with pupils who manifest behaviour and attendance problems .
our evidence suggests that many pupils begin their histories of poor behaviour and non-attendance in primary schools , often as early as five or seven years of age .
earlier intervention will enable us to nip these problems in the bud rather than reaching the persistent stage .
i believe there needs to be changes made to our existing guidelines on exclusion with a regulatory shake-up .
this will require new legislation by the welsh assembly government .
we need to end the practice of both " unofficial exclusions " and " negotiated exclusions . "
there needs to be a further look at managed moves protocol and guidance .
by following the suggestions in my report we should hopefully keep more pupils in school leaving them less free to roam the streets during school time .
our evidence from children and young people suggests that they understand the reasons why pupils should attend school regularly and behave well when in learning situations .
at the same time , i believe there should be a policy of zero tolerance on violence against teachers and pupils against pupils .
to achieve this , i believe the welsh assembly government should strengthen its guidance on physical intervention and restraint .
i also believe that every secondary school should have a named senior professional responsible for behaviour , attendance and parental liaison .
this person should be allocated sufficient time to undertake the job .
equally , every local authority in wales should have its own behavioural support team or a shared unit with a neighbouring authority .
i also consider that some of the new assembly government initiatives should help implement the ideas in the report .
these include the foundation phase initiative , the learning coaches concept , curriculum 2008 and the 14-19 initiative .
many of our disaffected pupils require more vocational rather than academic opportunities .
to achieve this , i believe we need to ensure that all our pupils should be able to read and write by the time they leave primary school .
otherwise , they will fall further behind and are likely to become increasingly disaffected . "

the house of commons public accounts committee said simpler forms would help raise £ 330m more in tax .
it also called for hm revenue & customs -lrb- hmrc -rrb- to improve its telephone advice service and to make its website easier to navigate .
however , hmrc has already announced the introduction of simpler forms this year and is revising its website as well .
last month the hmrc launched a shorter form for the more than nine million self-assessment taxpayers who are due to file for the 2007-08 tax year .
it was the first big change to the forms since 1997 .
" hmrc has successfully encouraged millions of people to complete and send forms to us online , " said an hmrc spokeswoman .
" this has been achieved through a combination of streamlined forms , more responsive online services and media marketing , " she added .
maze edward leigh mp , chairman of the public accounts committee said there was a lot of scope for improvement in the way hmrc dealt with taxpayers .
" too many people are unintentionally making mistakes , resulting in an estimated underpayment of tax each year of some £ 330 million , " he said .
" the department is falling short of industry standards in how quickly phone enquiries are picked up and dealt with .
" too many callers are still being shunted round the system rather than directed straightaway to the staff with the right knowledge , " he added .
the committee accused the hmrc of running a website that was " a bit of a maze " and said some of its leaflets were still going over the head of people who had below average literacy .
unintentional however , the mps acknowledged that the department 's performance had improved in some areas .
in 2006-07 , 72 % of telephone calls were answered within 20 seconds compared with 45 % the year before .
accurate and complete advice was given 95 % of the time .
however , the mps ' report pointed to the fact that 3.3 million people filled in their self-assessment tax forms incorrectly in 2001-02 , understating their tax liability by £ 2.8bn in the process .
the mps said £ 330m of that had been unintentional .

i believe that if our recommendations to the welsh assembly government are followed , there is a considerable possibility that we can make great strides in managing pupils ' behaviour and attendance in wales .
let me discuss some of our key findings and the reasons for them .
first , we believe that all teachers and child welfare professionals in wales should receive significant training in behaviour management .
second , we consider that there should be much earlier intervention with pupils who manifest behaviour and attendance problems .
our evidence suggests that many pupils begin their histories of poor behaviour and non-attendance in primary schools , often as early as five or seven years of age .
earlier intervention will enable us to nip these problems in the bud rather than reaching the persistent stage .
i believe there needs to be changes made to our existing guidelines on exclusion with a regulatory shake-up .
this will require new legislation by the welsh assembly government .
we need to end the practice of both " unofficial exclusions " and " negotiated exclusions . "
there needs to be a further look at managed moves protocol and guidance .
by following the suggestions in my report we should hopefully keep more pupils in school leaving them less free to roam the streets during school time .
our evidence from children and young people suggests that they understand the reasons why pupils should attend school regularly and behave well when in learning situations .
at the same time , i believe there should be a policy of zero tolerance on violence against teachers and pupils against pupils .
to achieve this , i believe the welsh assembly government should strengthen its guidance on physical intervention and restraint .
i also believe that every secondary school should have a named senior professional responsible for behaviour , attendance and parental liaison .
this person should be allocated sufficient time to undertake the job .
equally , every local authority in wales should have its own behavioural support team or a shared unit with a neighbouring authority .
i also consider that some of the new assembly government initiatives should help implement the ideas in the report .
these include the foundation phase initiative , the learning coaches concept , curriculum 2008 and the 14-19 initiative .
many of our disaffected pupils require more vocational rather than academic opportunities .
to achieve this , i believe we need to ensure that all our pupils should be able to read and write by the time they leave primary school .
otherwise , they will fall further behind and are likely to become increasingly disaffected .

the house of commons public accounts committee said simpler forms would help raise £ 330m more in tax .
it also called for hm revenue & customs -lrb- hmrc -rrb- to improve its telephone advice service and to make its website easier to navigate .
however , hmrc has already announced the introduction of simpler forms this year and is revising its website as well .
last month the hmrc launched a shorter form for the more than nine million self-assessment taxpayers who are due to file for the 2007-08 tax year .
it was the first big change to the forms since 1997 .
" hmrc has successfully encouraged millions of people to complete and send forms to us online , " said an hmrc spokeswoman .
" this has been achieved through a combination of streamlined forms , more responsive online services and media marketing , " she added .
maze edward leigh mp , chairman of the public accounts committee said there was a lot of scope for improvement in the way hmrc dealt with taxpayers .
" too many people are unintentionally making mistakes , resulting in an estimated underpayment of tax each year of some £ 330 million , " he said .
" the department is falling short of industry standards in how quickly phone enquiries are picked up and dealt with .
" too many callers are still being shunted round the system rather than directed straightaway to the staff with the right knowledge , " he added .
the committee accused the hmrc of running a website that was " a bit of a maze " and said some of its leaflets were still going over the head of people who had below average literacy .
unintentional however , the mps acknowledged that the department 's performance had improved in some areas .
in 2006-07 , 72 % of telephone calls were answered within 20 seconds compared with 45 % the year before .
accurate and complete advice was given 95 % of the time .
however , the mps ' report pointed to the fact that 3.3 million people filled in their self-assessment tax forms incorrectly in 2001-02 , understating their tax liability by £ 2.8bn in the process .
the mps said £ 330m of that had been unintentional .

" the department is falling short of industry standards in how quickly phone enquiries are picked up and dealt with .
" too many callers are still being shunted round the system rather than directed straightaway to the staff with the right knowledge , " he added .
the committee accused the hmrc of running a website that was " a bit of a maze " and said some of its leaflets were still going over the head of people who had below average literacy .
unintentional however , the mps acknowledged that the department 's performance had improved in some areas .
in 2006-07 , 72 % of telephone calls were answered within 20 seconds compared with 45 % the year before .
accurate and complete advice was given 95 % of the time .
however , the mps ' report pointed to the fact that 3.3 million people filled in their self-assessment tax forms incorrectly in 2001-02 , understating their tax liability by £ 2.8bn in the process .
the mps said £ 330m of that had been unintentional .

a former british protectorate , the territory is a self-governing state in free association with new zealand .
overview overview facts leaders media its economy centres on tourism ; the territory 's natural assets include fine beaches and volcanic mountains .
more than twice as many native cook islanders live in new zealand than live in the islands themselves .
most of them have left in search of a brighter economic future .
as new zealand citizens they can also live in australia .
the government has encouraged islanders to return .
businesses have been involved in the drive .
but the population level has continued to fall .
black pearls are the chief export .
agriculture , the sale of fishing licences to foreign fleets and offshore finance are also key revenue earners .
the cook islands are prone to tropical storms ; hurricane martin devastated the northern islands in 1997 causing substantial losses for the black pearl industry .
named after captain cook , who explored them in 1773 , the islands were once autonomous , home to tribes of mixed polynesian ancestry .

what a rollercoaster of a season !
it started with the usual early season optimism , boosted by the signings of robbie fowler , jimmy floyd hasselbaink and trevor sinclair .
but the hopes of runaway success were swept aside as it soon became clear to every city fan that fowler and hasselbaink just could n't play together as the team struggled with a lack of pace upfront .
a dreadful run until december brought dave jones ' own position as manager into severe doubt - but he survived and city eventually prospered on the field .
injuries to fowler , riccardo scimeca and sinclair also paled into significance against the whole of the future of the club .
that was thrown into doubt as langston sought to win repayment of millions of pounds owing immediately .
would we be relegated ?
would we have a club ?
court success for langston would have put the club into administration and having 10 points docked while the team were struggling in the league was a nightmare scenario .
you do really have to pinch yourself to make sure that it 's not all been a dream phillip nifield so it was that the fa cup provided salvation for us long-suffering fans .
chasetown and hereford were despatched despite the odd scare and wolverhampton wanderers were taken apart at ninian park .
then it was premiership middlesborough in the sixth round .
they were outplayed and a national tv audience soon found out about 17-year-old aaron ramsey , a top premiership star in the making .
so it was to the semi-final at wembley .
there were those purists that complained about the fa cup somehow being devalued because the semi finals were there .
rubbish .
most city fans wanted to go to wembley - not villa park or old trafford to see our beloved bluebirds play .
they did us proud and perhaps it was destiny that local lad joe ledley would score the spectacular winner .

midfielder joe ledley celebrates scoring the winner against barnsley we 'll be the outsiders on 17 may but do n't write us off , particularly if the boys play as they did against middlesborough .
it will be a great day out in wembley , whatever the result .
you do really have to pinch yourself to make sure that it 's not all been a dream .
what a marvellous worldwide advert for the city of cardiff and wales .
thousands of column inches in newspapers with the match being beamed to a vast audience across the globe .
and what an opportunity for a celebration after the game - open-top bus tour and a civic reception must be laid on , win or lose .
after all it could be another 81 years before we go to wembley again in an fa cup final .
with city at wembley , there 's just the premiership to go and after almost 50 years of following the bluebirds , i then can die a happy fan .
there 's also the bluebirds ' last season in ninian park to look forward to .
and , hopefully , the club will make it to the promised land of the premiership , ready for the opening of the new stadium .

what a rollercoaster of a season !
it started with the usual early season optimism , boosted by the signings of robbie fowler , jimmy floyd hasselbaink and trevor sinclair .
but the hopes of runaway success were swept aside as it soon became clear to every city fan that fowler and hasselbaink just could n't play together as the team struggled with a lack of pace upfront .
a dreadful run until december brought dave jones ' own position as manager into severe doubt - but he survived and city eventually prospered on the field .
injuries to fowler , riccardo scimeca and sinclair also paled into significance against the whole of the future of the club .
that was thrown into doubt as langston sought to win repayment of millions of pounds owing immediately .
would we be relegated ?
would we have a club ?
court success for langston would have put the club into administration and having 10 points docked while the team were struggling in the league was a nightmare scenario .
you do really have to pinch yourself to make sure that it 's not all been a dream phillip nifield so it was that the fa cup provided salvation for us long-suffering fans .
chasetown and hereford were despatched despite the odd scare and wolverhampton wanderers were taken apart at ninian park .
then it was premiership middlesborough in the sixth round .
they were outplayed and a national tv audience soon found out about 17-year-old aaron ramsey , a top premiership star in the making .
so it was to the semi-final at wembley .
there were those purists that complained about the fa cup somehow being devalued because the semi finals were there .
rubbish .
most city fans wanted to go to wembley - not villa park or old trafford to see our beloved bluebirds play .
they did us proud and perhaps it was destiny that local lad joe ledley would score the spectacular winner .
cardiff city in the fa cup final .
sounds a lot less plausible than the liberal democrats winning the next general election !
midfielder joe ledley celebrates scoring the winner against barnsley we 'll be the outsiders on 17 may but do n't write us off , particularly if the boys play as they did against middlesborough .
it will be a great day out in wembley , whatever the result .
you do really have to pinch yourself to make sure that it 's not all been a dream .
what a marvellous worldwide advert for the city of cardiff and wales .
thousands of column inches in newspapers with the match being beamed to a vast audience across the globe .
and what an opportunity for a celebration after the game - open-top bus tour and a civic reception must be laid on , win or lose .
after all it could be another 81 years before we go to wembley again in an fa cup final .
with city at wembley , there 's just the premiership to go and after almost 50 years of following the bluebirds , i then can die a happy fan .
there 's also the bluebirds ' last season in ninian park to look forward to .
and , hopefully , the club will make it to the promised land of the premiership , ready for the opening of the new stadium .
