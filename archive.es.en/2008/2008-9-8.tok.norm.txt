7 for their post-apocalyptic style music video for the song ready , set , go ! the quartet 's win as the only male and only non-american nominees in their category came as a surprise to the young musicians . " i ca n't describe in any words what we 're feeling right now , " singer bill kaulitz said , thanking the band 's fans worldwide .
since tokio hotel was formed in magdeburg in 2001 , the quartet of bill and tom kaulitz , georg listing and gustav schaefer have enjoyed much success in their native germany , wirth four number one singles and two chart-topping albums , selling nearly five million cds and dvds .
tokio hotel released their first album “ schrei ” -lrb- scream -rrb- in may 2006 and sold some 600,000 copies in six days in germany .
it also quickly became a major success in france , austria and switzerland .
persistent pop disaster doll britney spears stole the mtv show , however , winning awards in all three categories she was nominated in : video of the year , best pop video and best female video .
the row of awards marked a comeback after her disastrous performance at last year 's vmas .
ever growing international success bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : despite the band 's popularity , their hair has had mixed reviews after starting to sing more in english , tokio hotel 's international popularity has been growing rapidly with large fan bases in other european countries , particularly in france and belgium .
the award marks the band 's growing success in north america , reaching 39 in the official us billboard charts and climbing as high as sixth place in the canadian charts .
that makes tokio hotel one of the few german bands to enjoy such international success .
tokio hotel is well known for what some describe as shrewd marketing tactics - playing on the singer 's androgynous look , the band members ' young ages and edgy hairstyles to reach icon status among many teenage girls .
as well as singing more in english , the band has recently adopted a more serious " emo " image , which is reflected in their now award-winning video depicting a mass of soulless people marching in uniforms - apparently the victims of a dystopic regime .
the vma award is already being seen as a potential breakthrough for the band to further success in america .
speaking ahead of the ceremony , bill kaulitz said : " we do n't expect it , so for us , it 's so cool to be nominated .
i think it 's really , really special for us - it 's america and it 's our first american award and that 's so huge . "
the youngsters showed they are getting used to the international pop-star lifestyle when they turned up for the awards on a monster truck , though they were upstaged by rapper t-pain who arrived on elephant accompanied by various circus performers . dw staff -lrb- ah -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

11 attacks have provided fertile ground for conspiracy theories italian film-maker giulietto chiesa , who was in berlin for a screening of his documentary which questions the official us version of the 9/11 terrorist attacks , has called for an international tribunal to probe events . chiesa was in berlin at the weekend for a screening of his film which features , among others , novelist gore vidal and playwright dario fo as well as retired american professor of philosophy david ray griffin who advances conspiracy theories that contradict mainstream accounts of events of 11 september , 2001 .
federal aviation administration controllers , us air force pilots , military commanders and physicists also appear in the critical documentary , which the director hopes will create " political awareness " of the " faulty " official investigation into the events by the 9/11 commission .
" some of the individuals appearing in the film are former fbi and cia agents , people who have in a sense taken a very big risk in speaking out .
i am very grateful to them because they have done a big job , " said chiesa .
" the film would not have been possible without them , " he said , adding that zero had been seen in france and belgium at individual screenings , and by more than 20,000 people in italy .
but the film so far has not gained a distributor in europe .
pushing for an international tribunal chiesa , one of italy 's most respected journalists and a la stampa foreign correspondent for more than 20 years , told his berlin audience an 9/11 international tribunal could serve a useful purpose .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : alternative theories abound about what actually happened at the site of the twin towers " if feelings were strong enough a positive result could be obtained , but it would not happen immediately .
so far it 's been the us administration that has won the information fight and obtained their result - unfortunately , " chiesa said . " our task is to inform millions of people of the true situation .
everybody should be involved in this struggle with a tribunal or commission helping once we win approval for the idea , " he said .
in an interview with german news agency dpa , chiesa , a european parliamentary deputy , said russian television is to give prime time airing to his film on the eve of this week 's seventh anniversary of the attacks in new york and washington .
" that means that some 30 million russian citizens will learn the truth about what happened , which is a very big result for me . "
chiesa , whose documentary was first screened to a large german audience at the goethe institute in munich in may , was clearly delighted at his reception in berlin .
" it 's important that so many people have shown up , " he said .
one of a panel of six experts debating the 9/11 topic in berlin , chiesa said he was eager for his film to gain more public support and become a " multiplicator " across germany .
" if that happens it means we are making politics in the right sense of the word . "
critics question government version of attacks andreas von buelow , a controversial former german minister of technology , and ex-state secretary in the defense ministry , was among the berlin participants who said further investigation was needed into 9/11 .
he told dpa it was " one of life 's characteristics that governments are prone to lie in order to achieve their agendas .
the americans told us that in iraq , saddam hussein had something to do with al-qaeda , which was absolutely untrue .
even the cia knew this , " he said .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some say the us invasion of iraq on a false pretext is proof of government lies of international events " then , they told us that saddam hussein was preparing weapons of mass destruction , which was also untrue , so they have been lying all over the place and are still fighting there .
meanwhile a million people have been killed . "
asked if there was any prospect of a policy change once the next us president was elected , he replied bluntly " no ! "
juergen elsaesser , 51 , a berlin-based journalist and author whose latest book is titled " terror target europe : the dangerous double game of the secret services , " spoke of the huge contradictions in the official us version of the 9/11 events .
" critics find themselves accused of conspiracy theories , but the biggest conspiracy is to be found in the official 9/11 version of the us government which maintains that osama bin laden , from a cave in afghanistan , along with 19 young arabs , combined to carry out the most perfidious attack in the history of mankind , " he said .
" that just does n't add up .
for me the most important contradiction is how the air defences of the greatest military power on the planet failed to prevent such attacks occurring and that no interceptor fighter planes or rocket systems were ever activated .

11 attacks have provided fertile ground for conspiracy theories italian film-maker giulietto chiesa , who was in berlin for a screening of his documentary which questions the official us version of the 9/11 terrorist attacks , has called for an international tribunal to probe events . chiesa was in berlin at the weekend for a screening of his film which features , among others , novelist gore vidal and playwright dario fo as well as retired american professor of philosophy david ray griffin who advances conspiracy theories that contradict mainstream accounts of events of 11 september , 2001 .
federal aviation administration controllers , us air force pilots , military commanders and physicists also appear in the critical documentary , which the director hopes will create " political awareness " of the " faulty " official investigation into the events by the 9/11 commission .
" some of the individuals appearing in the film are former fbi and cia agents , people who have in a sense taken a very big risk in speaking out .
i am very grateful to them because they have done a big job , " said chiesa .
" the film would not have been possible without them , " he said , adding that zero had been seen in france and belgium at individual screenings , and by more than 20,000 people in italy .
but the film so far has not gained a distributor in europe .

everybody should be involved in this struggle with a tribunal or commission helping once we win approval for the idea , " he said .
in an interview with german news agency dpa , chiesa , a european parliamentary deputy , said russian television is to give prime time airing to his film on the eve of this week 's seventh anniversary of the attacks in new york and washington .
" that means that some 30 million russian citizens will learn the truth about what happened , which is a very big result for me . "
chiesa , whose documentary was first screened to a large german audience at the goethe institute in munich in may , was clearly delighted at his reception in berlin .
" it 's important that so many people have shown up , " he said .
one of a panel of six experts debating the 9/11 topic in berlin , chiesa said he was eager for his film to gain more public support and become a " multiplicator " across germany .
" if that happens it means we are making politics in the right sense of the word . "
critics question government version of attacks andreas von buelow , a controversial former german minister of technology , and ex-state secretary in the defense ministry , was among the berlin participants who said further investigation was needed into 9/11 .

11 attacks have provided fertile ground for conspiracy theories italian film-maker giulietto chiesa , who was in berlin for a screening of his documentary which questions the official us version of the 9/11 terrorist attacks , has called for an international tribunal to probe events . chiesa was in berlin at the weekend for a screening of his film which features , among others , novelist gore vidal and playwright dario fo as well as retired american professor of philosophy david ray griffin who advances conspiracy theories that contradict mainstream accounts of events of 11 september , 2001 .
federal aviation administration controllers , us air force pilots , military commanders and physicists also appear in the critical documentary , which the director hopes will create " political awareness " of the " faulty " official investigation into the events by the 9/11 commission .
" some of the individuals appearing in the film are former fbi and cia agents , people who have in a sense taken a very big risk in speaking out .
i am very grateful to them because they have done a big job , " said chiesa .
" the film would not have been possible without them , " he said , adding that zero had been seen in france and belgium at individual screenings , and by more than 20,000 people in italy .
but the film so far has not gained a distributor in europe .
pushing for an international tribunal chiesa , one of italy 's most respected journalists and a la stampa foreign correspondent for more than 20 years , told his berlin audience an 9/11 international tribunal could serve a useful purpose .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : alternative theories abound about what actually happened at the site of the twin towers " if feelings were strong enough a positive result could be obtained , but it would not happen immediately .
so far it 's been the us administration that has won the information fight and obtained their result - unfortunately , " chiesa said . " our task is to inform millions of people of the true situation .
everybody should be involved in this struggle with a tribunal or commission helping once we win approval for the idea , " he said .
in an interview with german news agency dpa , chiesa , a european parliamentary deputy , said russian television is to give prime time airing to his film on the eve of this week 's seventh anniversary of the attacks in new york and washington .
" that means that some 30 million russian citizens will learn the truth about what happened , which is a very big result for me . "
chiesa , whose documentary was first screened to a large german audience at the goethe institute in munich in may , was clearly delighted at his reception in berlin .
" it 's important that so many people have shown up , " he said .
one of a panel of six experts debating the 9/11 topic in berlin , chiesa said he was eager for his film to gain more public support and become a " multiplicator " across germany .
" if that happens it means we are making politics in the right sense of the word . "
critics question government version of attacks andreas von buelow , a controversial former german minister of technology , and ex-state secretary in the defense ministry , was among the berlin participants who said further investigation was needed into 9/11 .
he told dpa it was " one of life 's characteristics that governments are prone to lie in order to achieve their agendas .
the americans told us that in iraq , saddam hussein had something to do with al-qaeda , which was absolutely untrue .
even the cia knew this , " he said .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some say the us invasion of iraq on a false pretext is proof of government lies of international events " then , they told us that saddam hussein was preparing weapons of mass destruction , which was also untrue , so they have been lying all over the place and are still fighting there .
meanwhile a million people have been killed . "
asked if there was any prospect of a policy change once the next us president was elected , he replied bluntly " no ! "
juergen elsaesser , 51 , a berlin-based journalist and author whose latest book is titled " terror target europe : the dangerous double game of the secret services , " spoke of the huge contradictions in the official us version of the 9/11 events .
" critics find themselves accused of conspiracy theories , but the biggest conspiracy is to be found in the official 9/11 version of the us government which maintains that osama bin laden , from a cave in afghanistan , along with 19 young arabs , combined to carry out the most perfidious attack in the history of mankind , " he said .
" that just does n't add up .
for me the most important contradiction is how the air defences of the greatest military power on the planet failed to prevent such attacks occurring and that no interceptor fighter planes or rocket systems were ever activated .

dw-world.de takes a closer look at the man the spd is pinning its hopes on for the top job . for several years , frank walter steinmeier has consistently been among germany ’ s three most popular politicians , at times right at the top of the list or trailing slightly behind christian democrat chancellor angela merkel whom he will now strive to dethrone at the general election next year . the grey-haired 52-year-old 's nomination as candidate for chancellor did n't come as a real surprise .
but doubts persist about whether he can inspire on the campaign trail since steinmeier is an untested challenger - he has never run for public office steinmeier was born in the western german town of detmold .
he joined the spd in 1976 without ever becoming an entrenched party soldier .
a lawyer , steinmeier became gerhard schroeder ’ s chief of staff when the former chancellor was premier of the state of lower saxony . following gerhard schröder 's election as chancellor in 1998 , frank-walter steinmeier was appointed head of the chancellory and commissioner for the federal intelligence services . steinmeier was entrusted with responsibility for overall policy coordination within the federal government . he became one of schroeder 's closest advisors , coordinating the security services and shaping the agenda 2010 package of economic reforms - the unpopular centrepiece of the administration . since 2005 , he ’ s been the country ’ s foreign minister , serving chancellor angela merkel and often standing in her shadow , even in foreign policy matters .
this is why political analysts often refer to steinmeier as germany ’ s biggest number two who ’ s never had to lead a single election campaign . tough road ahead bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : steinmeier 's opponent and boss is the current chancellor , angela merkel however , steinmeier is certainly not without merits .
as foreign minister , he ’ s cut an excellent figure in operations to free german hostages in iraq , afghanistan and elsewhere .
he ’ s also played a pivotal role in keeping up the dialogue with iran over tehran ’ s nuclear arms program , as well as in fostering the process of european integration and enlargement . steinmeier has quite a challenge ahead of him .
he is soft spoken and often looks out of place in large crowds .
he tends to lean towards prepared statements rather than off the cuff remarks to the press .
many germans , including spd supporters , are worried that steinmeier won ’ t have the killer political instinct it will take to unseat angela merkel , who has become quite popular . the foreign minister does have a sense of authority about him , and when he speaks it ’ s difficult to argue with what he says .
as one observer told dw-radio however , it ’ s usually equally difficult to remember a single sentence the minister has uttered .
perhaps he ’ ll have something more memorable up his sleeve now that he ’ s the spd ’ s candidate for chancellor . so far , he ’ s steered clear of scoring political points by throwing mud at opponents or rivals , saying it is more important to tell people what you yourself stand for so that they can judge in which way you ’ re different .
whether this strategy will pay off during the 2009 general election remains to be seen . dw staff -lrb- mrm -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

dw-world.de takes a closer look at the man the spd is pinning its hopes on for the top job . for several years , frank walter steinmeier has consistently been among germany ’ s three most popular politicians , at times right at the top of the list or trailing slightly behind christian democrat chancellor angela merkel whom he will now strive to dethrone at the general election next year . the grey-haired 52-year-old 's nomination as candidate for chancellor did n't come as a real surprise .
but doubts persist about whether he can inspire on the campaign trail since steinmeier is an untested challenger - he has never run for public office steinmeier was born in the western german town of detmold .
he joined the spd in 1976 without ever becoming an entrenched party soldier .
a lawyer , steinmeier became gerhard schroeder ’ s chief of staff when the former chancellor was premier of the state of lower saxony . following gerhard schröder 's election as chancellor in 1998 , frank-walter steinmeier was appointed head of the chancellory and commissioner for the federal intelligence services . steinmeier was entrusted with responsibility for overall policy coordination within the federal government . he became one of schroeder 's closest advisors , coordinating the security services and shaping the agenda 2010 package of economic reforms - the unpopular centrepiece of the administration . since 2005 , he ’ s been the country ’ s foreign minister , serving chancellor angela merkel and often standing in her shadow , even in foreign policy matters .
this is why political analysts often refer to steinmeier as germany ’ s biggest number two who ’ s never had to lead a single election campaign . tough road ahead bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : steinmeier 's opponent and boss is the current chancellor , angela merkel however , steinmeier is certainly not without merits .
as foreign minister , he ’ s cut an excellent figure in operations to free german hostages in iraq , afghanistan and elsewhere .
he ’ s also played a pivotal role in keeping up the dialogue with iran over tehran ’ s nuclear arms program , as well as in fostering the process of european integration and enlargement . steinmeier has quite a challenge ahead of him .
he is soft spoken and often looks out of place in large crowds .

but forces will remain in the rebel regions of south ossetia and abkhazia . dmitry medvedev said russian forces would pull back to pre-conflict positions by october 1 , when replaced by 200 european monitors in the buffer zones around georgia 's breakaway regions of south ossetia and abkhazia .
under monday 's agreement , russia is also due to pull out in a week 's time from outstanding checkpoints between sinaki and the black sea port of poti , deep inside georgia .
" russia has obtained a guarantee from the european union and france which holds the eu presidency , on the non-use of force by the georgian side , " medvedev said at a joint press conference after meeting with eu negotiators .
nicolas sarkozy , whose country holds the rotating eu presidency , said he had given medvedev a letter from georgian president mikhail saakashvili , vowing to abstain from any use of force .
difficult negotiations still ahead both leaders said international peace talks would start october 15 in geneva .
but negotiations look set to be fraught .
despite the accord , moscow is refusing to reverse its recognition of the independence of georgia 's two separatist regions of south ossetia and abkhazia .
and medevev attacked georgia for its " hair-brained " assault on ossetia , which he said had been launched with the direct or tacit support of the united states .
" russia is fully complying with the settlement plan , but i ca n't say the same for the georgian side that is actively trying to re-establish its military positions , and the united states , unfortunately , is supporting this , " medvedev said .

but forces will remain in the rebel regions of south ossetia and abkhazia . dmitry medvedev said russian forces would pull back to pre-conflict positions by october 1 , when replaced by 200 european monitors in the buffer zones around georgia 's breakaway regions of south ossetia and abkhazia .
under monday 's agreement , russia is also due to pull out in a week 's time from outstanding checkpoints between sinaki and the black sea port of poti , deep inside georgia .
" russia has obtained a guarantee from the european union and france which holds the eu presidency , on the non-use of force by the georgian side , " medvedev said at a joint press conference after meeting with eu negotiators .
nicolas sarkozy , whose country holds the rotating eu presidency , said he had given medvedev a letter from georgian president mikhail saakashvili , vowing to abstain from any use of force .
difficult negotiations still ahead both leaders said international peace talks would start october 15 in geneva .
but negotiations look set to be fraught .
despite the accord , moscow is refusing to reverse its recognition of the independence of georgia 's two separatist regions of south ossetia and abkhazia .
and medevev attacked georgia for its " hair-brained " assault on ossetia , which he said had been launched with the direct or tacit support of the united states .
" russia is fully complying with the settlement plan , but i ca n't say the same for the georgian side that is actively trying to re-establish its military positions , and the united states , unfortunately , is supporting this , " medvedev said .
bildunterschrift : monday also saw the first of three days of hearings brought by georgia against russia meanwhile , georgia was accusing russia before the un 's highest court in the hague of conducting a long-running campaign of " ethnic cleansing " in georgian territory . russia defended its actions before the international court of justice -lrb- icj -rrb- , saying a georgian assault on the rebel region of south ossetia last month left it no choice but to send in tanks and troops .
thaw between eu and russia ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hundreds are estimated to have been killed on both sides after talks with the russian president , sarkozy said negotiations on a new eu-russia partnership could resume " as early as october " if the measures were enforced .
the meetings had been originally scheduled for september , but were frozen until moscow pulls out of georgia .
" things are perfectly clear : we want partnership and we want peace , " said sarkozy .
his sentiments were chimed by the russian president .
" our country values the european efforts ... we do not want a deterioration of our relations , " medvedev told sarkozy , who was also accompanied by eu foreign policy envoy javier solana and european commission president jose manuel barroso .
in an exercise of shuttle diplomacy after russia and georgia refused to take part in direct talks , the three left for tbilisi to meet with georgian president saakashvili immediately after the talks .
the talks , launched in july , were aimed at agreeing a new framework for eu-russia ties .
the existing accord dates from 1997 , when russia was still suffering economically from the break-up of the soviet union . washington is sticking to a firm line , however , with us president george w. bush taking a long-awaited decision to postpone talks with russia on a nuclear agreement .
" the president intends to notify congress that he has today rescinded his prior determination regarding the us-russia agreement for peaceful nuclear cooperation , " a statement said .
russian troops entered georgia on august 8 to push back georgian forces attempting to regain control of south ossetia , the moscow-backed region that broke away from tbilisi in the early 1990s . dw staff -lrb- jg -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de opinion -pipe- 08.09.2008 opinion : fannie mae and freddie mac bail-out is not the end großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the us government and federal reserve has saved mortgage companies freddie mac and fannie mae , which together lost $ 14 billion -lrb- 9.9 billion euros -rrb- , but dw 's karl zawadzky still thinks crisis is too close for comfort . the bosses of the big banks always want to make us believe that the financial crisis is leading towards its end and that the worldwide finance and banking system has come away again with a black eye .
but that is not the case .
the crisis which has supposedly been resolved by the very dubiously financed american real estate market has just reached a new hazard level .
banks have lost $ 500 billion -lrb- 350 billion euros -rrb- .
a whole array of finance companies are in financial disorder .
in the usa a number of banks have been closed and more will follow .
that is bad enough .
it would be much worse if the big mortgage financers fannie mae and freddie mac broke down , a fate which has so far been hindered only through massive intervention by finance minister henry paulson and the federal reserve .
state forced to intervene bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : karl zawadzky the ministry of finance and the federal reserve had no choice but to intervene due to one single reason : the collapse of fannie mae and freddie mac could have precipitated a core meltdown of the american bank and stock market systems , dragging the rest of the world with it into the abyss .
that is because these two banks are responsible for $ 5.3 billion -lrb- 3.7 billion euros -rrb- of america 's $ 12 billion -lrb- 8.4 billion euro -rrb- total mortgage debt .
that corresponds to one third of america 's gross domestic product .
besides that , pretty much all other banks have turned their backs on the mortgage market .
an economic crisis in the usa would have very quickly become a depression - and it would have had worldwide consequences .
in the end the government and the federal reserve felt compelled to act , since the two institutions play a central role on the mortgage market .
they are practically the reinsurance for the mortgage banks - they sell credit claims to the regional mortgage banks and , as the case may be , guarantee the claims and thus back them up .
crisis still looming yet there is no longer much new business , quite the opposite : more and more real estate companies are coming under foreclosure .
experts take it for granted that in this year more than one million americans will cut their debt service .
the risks with fannie mae and freddie mac are piling up .
in the case of a property crisis , this is the least favorable business model .
in addition , fannie mae and freddie mac trade under the names of private corporations , but cooperate closely with the state .
the state had to act as the confidence crisis was getting more and more out of hand .
after they already obtained federal reserve credit on advance conditions , the state took them completely under its wing and supplied them with fresh money .
the free-enterprise rules are being overridden , economic misconduct is going unpunished , and the state is stepping onto the scene as a savior .
after the profits are privatized in good times , the losses are socialized by the state .
the amount under fire , which is financed by selling bonds from investors , including governments and central banks from all over the world , is simply too big to let the two mortgage financers slip into bankruptcy .
that shows to what extent the fire is blazing over the rooftops of the global finance systems .
the danger of a finance system core meltdown may have been momentarily averted , but the bank crisis is still far from over . karl zawadzky is dw-radio 's business editor -lrb- ah -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

in the usa a number of banks have been closed and more will follow .

according to monday 's financial times germany -lrb- ftd -rrb- , the cdu leadership has prepared a keynote speech for its party conference in december in which east germany is described as the " germany 's second dictatorship " .
the document cited by the ftd stresses the lack of civil liberties in the german democratic republic .
it also stresses the desperate economic situation of the state at the time the wall came down .
the country was , according to the cdu paper , on the brink of " economic collapse " in 1989 . limbering up for the elections bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : its logo may be red , but that 's about the only thing the document , which is due to be discussed by the party executive over the next few days before being presented to december 's party conference , is intended to serve as the basis for the cdu 's electoral campaign in national elections in 2009 .
the cdu is searching for the right strategy to improve its support in eastern germany .
recent polls have put the conservatives and the left party neck-and-neck at 28 percent in the region .
the social democrats are trailing by several points .
the left has its main support base in the formerly communist eastern states but has also made strong inroads in western states in recent months .
in order to counter any tendencies to play down harmful aspects of the regime in the future , the cdu is also calling for more museums to be set up in former east german stasi -lrb- secret service -rrb- prisons and remaining border installations to be placed under preservation orders .
it also favors erecting freedom and unity monuments in leipzig , the center of opposition rallies against the gdr regime , and the german capital berlin . the cdu is also planning to use the speech to set out its differences from the social democrats , accusing the spd party leadership of attempting to block reunification .
recent years have seen a growing tendency in eastern germany - both culturally and socio-politically - towards " ostalgie , " a german expression made up of the words ost -lrb- east -rrb- and " nostalgia " . studies have also indicated an alarming lack of knowledge about the former communist regime among german schoolchildren . dw staff -lrb- jg -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de nuclear power -pipe- 08.09.2008 german government aware of nuclear problems : report großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : asse has become the latest focus of the nuclear debate a report published in germany 's focus magazine alleges that authorities in the state of lower saxony were aware of safety issues at the asse ii atomic storage facility 15 years ago . the focus report says the state government , led by the social democratic party -lrb- spd -rrb- at the time , commissioned a technical report on potential hazards at the converted salt mine in 1991 .
after two years of evaluation , experts warned that areas near the south-western edge of asse were unsafe .
their 1993 report found that up to 4,000 litres of water were flooding into the mine 's shafts each day .
it recommended that all shafts and caverns less than 750 metres below the earth ’ s surface should be stabilised to prevent possible collapse .
focus reports that although spd leaders in lower saxony received an updated report highlighting safety concerns in 1998 , they chose to keep the warnings under wraps .
the extent of the safety problems at asse were made public last week , prompting environment minister sigmar gabriel to transfer responsibility of the facility from the munich-based helmholtz institute for scientific research to the federal office for radiation protection .
waste disposal ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : in the 1960s researchers thought salt mines were ideal for storing nuclear waste nuclear power is often touted as being clean and carbon-friendly , but opponents point out that no one has yet found a durable solution for storing nuclear waste , which remains highly radioactive for centuries .
asse was converted into an atomic waste storage facility in the 1960s as a pilot project linked to plans for a permanent facility at another former salt mine at gorleben , lower saxony .
but problems at asse raise questions about the feasibility of the gorleben site at a time when germany ’ s grand coalition government is split on whether or not to reverse plans to abandon all nuclear power by 2021 .
political fallout chancellor angela merkel 's conservative christian democratic union -lrb- cdu -rrb- , which supports continued use of nuclear power , is worried that asse will undermine its calls for a rethink of the planned phase-out .
in a radio interview on sunday , merkel said there needed to be decisions about what to do with highly radioactive material .
" we do also need to make progress in the storage of highly radioactive material .
it 's about atomic plants .
a moratorium has been agreed for gorleben and of course decisions must be made on how things go from here , " merkel told deutschlandfunk radio .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : environment minister gabriel has assumed control of asse in its latest issue , der spiegel magazine quoted a strategy paper in which conservative lawmaker katherine reiche demanded that environment minister gabriel immediately lift the moratorium on exploring options for storing atomic waste at gorleben .
the moratorium is the result of battles between supporters of nuclear power , who unsuccessfully tried to rush through gorleben 's commissioning in the 1970s , and a powerful lobby of opponents for whom the unresolved storage question buys time to discredit nuclear energy .
der spiegel reports that a search for alternatives elsewhere , which gabriel and the social democrats prefer , would cost at least one billion euros .
if plans for the waste storage facility at gorleben are given up completely , energy companies could make compensation demands worth billions of euros . dw staff -lrb- sje -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

after two years of evaluation , experts warned that areas near the south-western edge of asse were unsafe .
their 1993 report found that up to 4,000 litres of water were flooding into the mine 's shafts each day .
it recommended that all shafts and caverns less than 750 metres below the earth ’ s surface should be stabilised to prevent possible collapse .
focus reports that although spd leaders in lower saxony received an updated report highlighting safety concerns in 1998 , they chose to keep the warnings under wraps .
the extent of the safety problems at asse were made public last week , prompting environment minister sigmar gabriel to transfer responsibility of the facility from the munich-based helmholtz institute for scientific research to the federal office for radiation protection .

bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : in the 1960s researchers thought salt mines were ideal for storing nuclear waste nuclear power is often touted as being clean and carbon-friendly , but opponents point out that no one has yet found a durable solution for storing nuclear waste , which remains highly radioactive for centuries .
asse was converted into an atomic waste storage facility in the 1960s as a pilot project linked to plans for a permanent facility at another former salt mine at gorleben , lower saxony .
but problems at asse raise questions about the feasibility of the gorleben site at a time when germany ’ s grand coalition government is split on whether or not to reverse plans to abandon all nuclear power by 2021 .
political fallout chancellor angela merkel 's conservative christian democratic union -lrb- cdu -rrb- , which supports continued use of nuclear power , is worried that asse will undermine its calls for a rethink of the planned phase-out .
in a radio interview on sunday , merkel said there needed to be decisions about what to do with highly radioactive material .
" we do also need to make progress in the storage of highly radioactive material .
it 's about atomic plants .
a moratorium has been agreed for gorleben and of course decisions must be made on how things go from here , " merkel told deutschlandfunk radio .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : environment minister gabriel has assumed control of asse in its latest issue , der spiegel magazine quoted a strategy paper in which conservative lawmaker katherine reiche demanded that environment minister gabriel immediately lift the moratorium on exploring options for storing atomic waste at gorleben .
the moratorium is the result of battles between supporters of nuclear power , who unsuccessfully tried to rush through gorleben 's commissioning in the 1970s , and a powerful lobby of opponents for whom the unresolved storage question buys time to discredit nuclear energy .
der spiegel reports that a search for alternatives elsewhere , which gabriel and the social democrats prefer , would cost at least one billion euros .

since tokio hotel was formed in magdeburg in 2001 , the quartet of bill and tom kaulitz , georg listing and gustav schaefer have enjoyed much success in their native germany , wirth four number one singles and two chart-topping albums , selling nearly five million cds and dvds .
tokio hotel released their first album “ schrei ” -lrb- scream -rrb- in may 2006 and sold some 600,000 copies in six days in germany .
it also quickly became a major success in france , austria and switzerland .
persistent pop disaster doll britney spears stole the mtv show , however , winning awards in all three categories she was nominated in : video of the year , best pop video and best female video .
the row of awards marked a comeback after her disastrous performance at last year 's vmas .
ever growing international success bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : despite the band 's popularity , their hair has had mixed reviews after starting to sing more in english , tokio hotel 's international popularity has been growing rapidly with large fan bases in other european countries , particularly in france and belgium .
the award marks the band 's growing success in north america , reaching 39 in the official us billboard charts and climbing as high as sixth place in the canadian charts .
that makes tokio hotel one of the few german bands to enjoy such international success .
tokio hotel is well known for what some describe as shrewd marketing tactics - playing on the singer 's androgynous look , the band members ' young ages and edgy hairstyles to reach icon status among many teenage girls .
as well as singing more in english , the band has recently adopted a more serious " emo " image , which is reflected in their now award-winning video depicting a mass of soulless people marching in uniforms - apparently the victims of a dystopic regime .
the vma award is already being seen as a potential breakthrough for the band to further success in america .
speaking ahead of the ceremony , bill kaulitz said : " we do n't expect it , so for us , it 's so cool to be nominated .
i think it 's really , really special for us - it 's america and it 's our first american award and that 's so huge . "
the youngsters showed they are getting used to the international pop-star lifestyle when they turned up for the awards on a monster truck , though they were upstaged by rapper t-pain who arrived on elephant accompanied by various circus performers . dw staff -lrb- ah -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

11 attacks have provided fertile ground for conspiracy theories italian film-maker giulietto chiesa , who was in berlin for a screening of his documentary which questions the official us version of the 9/11 terrorist attacks , has called for an international tribunal to probe events . chiesa was in berlin at the weekend for a screening of his film which features , among others , novelist gore vidal and playwright dario fo as well as retired american professor of philosophy david ray griffin who advances conspiracy theories that contradict mainstream accounts of events of 11 september , 2001 .
federal aviation administration controllers , us air force pilots , military commanders and physicists also appear in the critical documentary , which the director hopes will create " political awareness " of the " faulty " official investigation into the events by the 9/11 commission .
" some of the individuals appearing in the film are former fbi and cia agents , people who have in a sense taken a very big risk in speaking out .
i am very grateful to them because they have done a big job , " said chiesa .
" the film would not have been possible without them , " he said , adding that zero had been seen in france and belgium at individual screenings , and by more than 20,000 people in italy .
but the film so far has not gained a distributor in europe .
pushing for an international tribunal chiesa , one of italy 's most respected journalists and a la stampa foreign correspondent for more than 20 years , told his berlin audience an 9/11 international tribunal could serve a useful purpose .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : alternative theories abound about what actually happened at the site of the twin towers " if feelings were strong enough a positive result could be obtained , but it would not happen immediately .
so far it 's been the us administration that has won the information fight and obtained their result - unfortunately , " chiesa said . " our task is to inform millions of people of the true situation .
everybody should be involved in this struggle with a tribunal or commission helping once we win approval for the idea , " he said .
in an interview with german news agency dpa , chiesa , a european parliamentary deputy , said russian television is to give prime time airing to his film on the eve of this week 's seventh anniversary of the attacks in new york and washington .
" that means that some 30 million russian citizens will learn the truth about what happened , which is a very big result for me . "
chiesa , whose documentary was first screened to a large german audience at the goethe institute in munich in may , was clearly delighted at his reception in berlin .
" it 's important that so many people have shown up , " he said .
one of a panel of six experts debating the 9/11 topic in berlin , chiesa said he was eager for his film to gain more public support and become a " multiplicator " across germany .
" if that happens it means we are making politics in the right sense of the word . "
critics question government version of attacks andreas von buelow , a controversial former german minister of technology , and ex-state secretary in the defense ministry , was among the berlin participants who said further investigation was needed into 9/11 .
he told dpa it was " one of life 's characteristics that governments are prone to lie in order to achieve their agendas .
the americans told us that in iraq , saddam hussein had something to do with al-qaeda , which was absolutely untrue .
even the cia knew this , " he said .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some say the us invasion of iraq on a false pretext is proof of government lies of international events " then , they told us that saddam hussein was preparing weapons of mass destruction , which was also untrue , so they have been lying all over the place and are still fighting there .
meanwhile a million people have been killed . "
asked if there was any prospect of a policy change once the next us president was elected , he replied bluntly " no ! "
juergen elsaesser , 51 , a berlin-based journalist and author whose latest book is titled " terror target europe : the dangerous double game of the secret services , " spoke of the huge contradictions in the official us version of the 9/11 events .
" critics find themselves accused of conspiracy theories , but the biggest conspiracy is to be found in the official 9/11 version of the us government which maintains that osama bin laden , from a cave in afghanistan , along with 19 young arabs , combined to carry out the most perfidious attack in the history of mankind , " he said .
" that just does n't add up .
for me the most important contradiction is how the air defences of the greatest military power on the planet failed to prevent such attacks occurring and that no interceptor fighter planes or rocket systems were ever activated .

in addition , the new bank aimed to realize synergies worth 5 billion euros , he said .
analysts were critical following sunday 's deal , and commerzbank 's shares dived to trade as low as 16.66 euros during friday trade in frankfurt .
on friday aug .
29 , the last day of trading before the widely anticipated announcement , commerzbank had traded in a range around 20 euros .
the new bank , which aims to challenge the dominance in germany of deutsche bank through its widespread branch network , aims to shed some 9,000 of its staff complement of 67,000 full-time employees .
regarding the reported interest shown in dresdner bank by the state-owned china development bank , blessing told the weekly : " if there had been a game of bluff over the price with a bank backed by the chinese state , we would not have had a chance . "
a new banking force he said there would be substantial cuts at the london-based dresdner investment banking unit dresdner kleinwort , but refused to be drawn on a potential purchaser for the subsidiary , which has been hit by the us subprime crisis .
on monday , german finance minister peer steinbrueck welcomed the deal .
" this is good for germany as a financial location , " steinbrueck said from beijing where he was meeting chinese officials .
with total assets of about 1.09 trillion euros and 11 million german customers , a merged commerzbank-dresdner will result in the emergence of new banking force in europe 's biggest economy .
deutsche bank , which failed in a bid to merge with dresdner eight years ago , remains the largest bank in germany with assets totaling about 2 trillion euros . munich-based allianz , europe 's biggest insurer , is to retain a stake of about 30 percent in the new banking group and to take over risks totaling 975 million euros which are linked to the global financial crisis and credit crunch .
allianz paid about 23 billion euros for dresdner in 2001 as part of an ambitious plan to sell its pension and insurance schemes through dresdner 's branch network .

31 commerzbank chief executive martin blessing has defended the price germany 's second-largest bank paid to take over rival dresdner , in the country 's biggest shake-up in the banking sector . in an interview with german news magazine der spiegel , blessing described the 9.8 billion euros -lrb- $ 14.4 billion -rrb- paid to insurer allianz as " not cheap but fair , " highlighting the fact that much of the deal had been done with commerzbank shares .
in addition , the new bank aimed to realize synergies worth 5 billion euros , he said .
analysts were critical following sunday 's deal , and commerzbank 's shares dived to trade as low as 16.66 euros during friday trade in frankfurt .
on friday aug .
29 , the last day of trading before the widely anticipated announcement , commerzbank had traded in a range around 20 euros .
the new bank , which aims to challenge the dominance in germany of deutsche bank through its widespread branch network , aims to shed some 9,000 of its staff complement of 67,000 full-time employees .
regarding the reported interest shown in dresdner bank by the state-owned china development bank , blessing told the weekly : " if there had been a game of bluff over the price with a bank backed by the chinese state , we would not have had a chance . "
a new banking force he said there would be substantial cuts at the london-based dresdner investment banking unit dresdner kleinwort , but refused to be drawn on a potential purchaser for the subsidiary , which has been hit by the us subprime crisis .
on monday , german finance minister peer steinbrueck welcomed the deal .
" this is good for germany as a financial location , " steinbrueck said from beijing where he was meeting chinese officials .
with total assets of about 1.09 trillion euros and 11 million german customers , a merged commerzbank-dresdner will result in the emergence of new banking force in europe 's biggest economy .
deutsche bank , which failed in a bid to merge with dresdner eight years ago , remains the largest bank in germany with assets totaling about 2 trillion euros . munich-based allianz , europe 's biggest insurer , is to retain a stake of about 30 percent in the new banking group and to take over risks totaling 975 million euros which are linked to the global financial crisis and credit crunch .
allianz paid about 23 billion euros for dresdner in 2001 as part of an ambitious plan to sell its pension and insurance schemes through dresdner 's branch network .
analysts see the dresdner-commerzbank deal as a prelude to the two banks ' launching a bid for deutsche postbank , which has 14.5 million customers and more than 800 branches . dpa news agency -lrb- ah -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?
dw-world.de board meeting to decide fate of german postbank there has been a lot of attention focused on german banks in the last few months .

after two years of evaluation , experts warned that areas near the south-western edge of asse were unsafe .
their 1993 report found that up to 4,000 litres of water were flooding into the mine 's shafts each day .
it recommended that all shafts and caverns less than 750 metres below the earth ’ s surface should be stabilised to prevent possible collapse .
focus reports that although spd leaders in lower saxony received an updated report highlighting safety concerns in 1998 , they chose to keep the warnings under wraps .
the extent of the safety problems at asse were made public last week , prompting environment minister sigmar gabriel to transfer responsibility of the facility from the munich-based helmholtz institute for scientific research to the federal office for radiation protection .

bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : in the 1960s researchers thought salt mines were ideal for storing nuclear waste nuclear power is often touted as being clean and carbon-friendly , but opponents point out that no one has yet found a durable solution for storing nuclear waste , which remains highly radioactive for centuries .
asse was converted into an atomic waste storage facility in the 1960s as a pilot project linked to plans for a permanent facility at another former salt mine at gorleben , lower saxony .
but problems at asse raise questions about the feasibility of the gorleben site at a time when germany ’ s grand coalition government is split on whether or not to reverse plans to abandon all nuclear power by 2021 .
political fallout chancellor angela merkel 's conservative christian democratic union -lrb- cdu -rrb- , which supports continued use of nuclear power , is worried that asse will undermine its calls for a rethink of the planned phase-out .
in a radio interview on sunday , merkel said there needed to be decisions about what to do with highly radioactive material .
" we do also need to make progress in the storage of highly radioactive material .
it 's about atomic plants .
a moratorium has been agreed for gorleben and of course decisions must be made on how things go from here , " merkel told deutschlandfunk radio .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : environment minister gabriel has assumed control of asse in its latest issue , der spiegel magazine quoted a strategy paper in which conservative lawmaker katherine reiche demanded that environment minister gabriel immediately lift the moratorium on exploring options for storing atomic waste at gorleben .
the moratorium is the result of battles between supporters of nuclear power , who unsuccessfully tried to rush through gorleben 's commissioning in the 1970s , and a powerful lobby of opponents for whom the unresolved storage question buys time to discredit nuclear energy .
der spiegel reports that a search for alternatives elsewhere , which gabriel and the social democrats prefer , would cost at least one billion euros .

after two years of evaluation , experts warned that areas near the south-western edge of asse were unsafe .
their 1993 report found that up to 4,000 litres of water were flooding into the mine 's shafts each day .
it recommended that all shafts and caverns less than 750 metres below the earth ’ s surface should be stabilised to prevent possible collapse .
focus reports that although spd leaders in lower saxony received an updated report highlighting safety concerns in 1998 , they chose to keep the warnings under wraps .
the extent of the safety problems at asse were made public last week , prompting environment minister sigmar gabriel to transfer responsibility of the facility from the munich-based helmholtz institute for scientific research to the federal office for radiation protection .

bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : in the 1960s researchers thought salt mines were ideal for storing nuclear waste nuclear power is often touted as being clean and carbon-friendly , but opponents point out that no one has yet found a durable solution for storing nuclear waste , which remains highly radioactive for centuries .
asse was converted into an atomic waste storage facility in the 1960s as a pilot project linked to plans for a permanent facility at another former salt mine at gorleben , lower saxony .
but problems at asse raise questions about the feasibility of the gorleben site at a time when germany ’ s grand coalition government is split on whether or not to reverse plans to abandon all nuclear power by 2021 .
political fallout chancellor angela merkel 's conservative christian democratic union -lrb- cdu -rrb- , which supports continued use of nuclear power , is worried that asse will undermine its calls for a rethink of the planned phase-out .
in a radio interview on sunday , merkel said there needed to be decisions about what to do with highly radioactive material .
" we do also need to make progress in the storage of highly radioactive material .
it 's about atomic plants .
a moratorium has been agreed for gorleben and of course decisions must be made on how things go from here , " merkel told deutschlandfunk radio .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : environment minister gabriel has assumed control of asse in its latest issue , der spiegel magazine quoted a strategy paper in which conservative lawmaker katherine reiche demanded that environment minister gabriel immediately lift the moratorium on exploring options for storing atomic waste at gorleben .
the moratorium is the result of battles between supporters of nuclear power , who unsuccessfully tried to rush through gorleben 's commissioning in the 1970s , and a powerful lobby of opponents for whom the unresolved storage question buys time to discredit nuclear energy .
der spiegel reports that a search for alternatives elsewhere , which gabriel and the social democrats prefer , would cost at least one billion euros .

31 commerzbank chief executive martin blessing has defended the price germany 's second-largest bank paid to take over rival dresdner , in the country 's biggest shake-up in the banking sector . in an interview with german news magazine der spiegel , blessing described the 9.8 billion euros -lrb- $ 14.4 billion -rrb- paid to insurer allianz as " not cheap but fair , " highlighting the fact that much of the deal had been done with commerzbank shares .
in addition , the new bank aimed to realize synergies worth 5 billion euros , he said .
analysts were critical following sunday 's deal , and commerzbank 's shares dived to trade as low as 16.66 euros during friday trade in frankfurt .
on friday aug .
29 , the last day of trading before the widely anticipated announcement , commerzbank had traded in a range around 20 euros .
the new bank , which aims to challenge the dominance in germany of deutsche bank through its widespread branch network , aims to shed some 9,000 of its staff complement of 67,000 full-time employees .
regarding the reported interest shown in dresdner bank by the state-owned china development bank , blessing told the weekly : " if there had been a game of bluff over the price with a bank backed by the chinese state , we would not have had a chance . "
a new banking force he said there would be substantial cuts at the london-based dresdner investment banking unit dresdner kleinwort , but refused to be drawn on a potential purchaser for the subsidiary , which has been hit by the us subprime crisis .
on monday , german finance minister peer steinbrueck welcomed the deal .
" this is good for germany as a financial location , " steinbrueck said from beijing where he was meeting chinese officials .
with total assets of about 1.09 trillion euros and 11 million german customers , a merged commerzbank-dresdner will result in the emergence of new banking force in europe 's biggest economy .
deutsche bank , which failed in a bid to merge with dresdner eight years ago , remains the largest bank in germany with assets totaling about 2 trillion euros . munich-based allianz , europe 's biggest insurer , is to retain a stake of about 30 percent in the new banking group and to take over risks totaling 975 million euros which are linked to the global financial crisis and credit crunch .
allianz paid about 23 billion euros for dresdner in 2001 as part of an ambitious plan to sell its pension and insurance schemes through dresdner 's branch network .
analysts see the dresdner-commerzbank deal as a prelude to the two banks ' launching a bid for deutsche postbank , which has 14.5 million customers and more than 800 branches . dpa news agency -lrb- ah -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

according to monday 's financial times germany -lrb- ftd -rrb- , the cdu leadership has prepared a keynote speech for its party conference in december in which east germany is described as the " germany 's second dictatorship " .
the document cited by the ftd stresses the lack of civil liberties in the german democratic republic .

but that is not the case .
the crisis which has supposedly been resolved by the very dubiously financed american real estate market has just reached a new hazard level .
banks have lost $ 500 billion -lrb- 350 billion euros -rrb- .
a whole array of finance companies are in financial disorder .
in the usa a number of banks have been closed and more will follow .
that is bad enough .
it would be much worse if the big mortgage financers fannie mae and freddie mac broke down , a fate which has so far been hindered only through massive intervention by finance minister henry paulson and the federal reserve .
state forced to intervene bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : karl zawadzky the ministry of finance and the federal reserve had no choice but to intervene due to one single reason : the collapse of fannie mae and freddie mac could have precipitated a core meltdown of the american bank and stock market systems , dragging the rest of the world with it into the abyss .
that is because these two banks are responsible for $ 5.3 billion -lrb- 3.7 billion euros -rrb- of america 's $ 12 billion -lrb- 8.4 billion euro -rrb- total mortgage debt .
that corresponds to one third of america 's gross domestic product .
besides that , pretty much all other banks have turned their backs on the mortgage market .
an economic crisis in the usa would have very quickly become a depression - and it would have had worldwide consequences .
in the end the government and the federal reserve felt compelled to act , since the two institutions play a central role on the mortgage market .
they are practically the reinsurance for the mortgage banks - they sell credit claims to the regional mortgage banks and , as the case may be , guarantee the claims and thus back them up .
crisis still looming yet there is no longer much new business , quite the opposite : more and more real estate companies are coming under foreclosure .
experts take it for granted that in this year more than one million americans will cut their debt service .
the risks with fannie mae and freddie mac are piling up .
in the case of a property crisis , this is the least favorable business model .
in addition , fannie mae and freddie mac trade under the names of private corporations , but cooperate closely with the state .
the state had to act as the confidence crisis was getting more and more out of hand .
after they already obtained federal reserve credit on advance conditions , the state took them completely under its wing and supplied them with fresh money .
the free-enterprise rules are being overridden , economic misconduct is going unpunished , and the state is stepping onto the scene as a savior .
after the profits are privatized in good times , the losses are socialized by the state .
the amount under fire , which is financed by selling bonds from investors , including governments and central banks from all over the world , is simply too big to let the two mortgage financers slip into bankruptcy .
that shows to what extent the fire is blazing over the rooftops of the global finance systems .
the danger of a finance system core meltdown may have been momentarily averted , but the bank crisis is still far from over . karl zawadzky is dw-radio 's business editor -lrb- ah -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

but that is not the case .
the crisis which has supposedly been resolved by the very dubiously financed american real estate market has just reached a new hazard level .
banks have lost $ 500 billion -lrb- 350 billion euros -rrb- .
a whole array of finance companies are in financial disorder .
in the usa a number of banks have been closed and more will follow .

state forced to intervene bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : karl zawadzky the ministry of finance and the federal reserve had no choice but to intervene due to one single reason : the collapse of fannie mae and freddie mac could have precipitated a core meltdown of the american bank and stock market systems , dragging the rest of the world with it into the abyss .
that is because these two banks are responsible for $ 5.3 billion -lrb- 3.7 billion euros -rrb- of america 's $ 12 billion -lrb- 8.4 billion euro -rrb- total mortgage debt .
that corresponds to one third of america 's gross domestic product .
besides that , pretty much all other banks have turned their backs on the mortgage market .
an economic crisis in the usa would have very quickly become a depression - and it would have had worldwide consequences .
in the end the government and the federal reserve felt compelled to act , since the two institutions play a central role on the mortgage market .

crisis still looming yet there is no longer much new business , quite the opposite : more and more real estate companies are coming under foreclosure .
experts take it for granted that in this year more than one million americans will cut their debt service .

but forces will remain in the rebel regions of south ossetia and abkhazia . dmitry medvedev said russian forces would pull back to pre-conflict positions by october 1 , when replaced by 200 european monitors in the buffer zones around georgia 's breakaway regions of south ossetia and abkhazia .
under monday 's agreement , russia is also due to pull out in a week 's time from outstanding checkpoints between sinaki and the black sea port of poti , deep inside georgia .
" russia has obtained a guarantee from the european union and france which holds the eu presidency , on the non-use of force by the georgian side , " medvedev said at a joint press conference after meeting with eu negotiators .
nicolas sarkozy , whose country holds the rotating eu presidency , said he had given medvedev a letter from georgian president mikhail saakashvili , vowing to abstain from any use of force .
difficult negotiations still ahead both leaders said international peace talks would start october 15 in geneva .
but negotiations look set to be fraught .
despite the accord , moscow is refusing to reverse its recognition of the independence of georgia 's two separatist regions of south ossetia and abkhazia .
and medevev attacked georgia for its " hair-brained " assault on ossetia , which he said had been launched with the direct or tacit support of the united states .
" russia is fully complying with the settlement plan , but i ca n't say the same for the georgian side that is actively trying to re-establish its military positions , and the united states , unfortunately , is supporting this , " medvedev said .
bildunterschrift : monday also saw the first of three days of hearings brought by georgia against russia meanwhile , georgia was accusing russia before the un 's highest court in the hague of conducting a long-running campaign of " ethnic cleansing " in georgian territory . russia defended its actions before the international court of justice -lrb- icj -rrb- , saying a georgian assault on the rebel region of south ossetia last month left it no choice but to send in tanks and troops .
thaw between eu and russia ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hundreds are estimated to have been killed on both sides after talks with the russian president , sarkozy said negotiations on a new eu-russia partnership could resume " as early as october " if the measures were enforced .
the meetings had been originally scheduled for september , but were frozen until moscow pulls out of georgia .
" things are perfectly clear : we want partnership and we want peace , " said sarkozy .
his sentiments were chimed by the russian president .
" our country values the european efforts ... we do not want a deterioration of our relations , " medvedev told sarkozy , who was also accompanied by eu foreign policy envoy javier solana and european commission president jose manuel barroso .
in an exercise of shuttle diplomacy after russia and georgia refused to take part in direct talks , the three left for tbilisi to meet with georgian president saakashvili immediately after the talks .
the talks , launched in july , were aimed at agreeing a new framework for eu-russia ties .
the existing accord dates from 1997 , when russia was still suffering economically from the break-up of the soviet union . washington is sticking to a firm line , however , with us president george w. bush taking a long-awaited decision to postpone talks with russia on a nuclear agreement .
" the president intends to notify congress that he has today rescinded his prior determination regarding the us-russia agreement for peaceful nuclear cooperation , " a statement said .
russian troops entered georgia on august 8 to push back georgian forces attempting to regain control of south ossetia , the moscow-backed region that broke away from tbilisi in the early 1990s . dw staff -lrb- jg -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

but forces will remain in the rebel regions of south ossetia and abkhazia . dmitry medvedev said russian forces would pull back to pre-conflict positions by october 1 , when replaced by 200 european monitors in the buffer zones around georgia 's breakaway regions of south ossetia and abkhazia .
under monday 's agreement , russia is also due to pull out in a week 's time from outstanding checkpoints between sinaki and the black sea port of poti , deep inside georgia .
" russia has obtained a guarantee from the european union and france which holds the eu presidency , on the non-use of force by the georgian side , " medvedev said at a joint press conference after meeting with eu negotiators .
nicolas sarkozy , whose country holds the rotating eu presidency , said he had given medvedev a letter from georgian president mikhail saakashvili , vowing to abstain from any use of force .
difficult negotiations still ahead both leaders said international peace talks would start october 15 in geneva .
but negotiations look set to be fraught .
despite the accord , moscow is refusing to reverse its recognition of the independence of georgia 's two separatist regions of south ossetia and abkhazia .
and medevev attacked georgia for its " hair-brained " assault on ossetia , which he said had been launched with the direct or tacit support of the united states .
" russia is fully complying with the settlement plan , but i ca n't say the same for the georgian side that is actively trying to re-establish its military positions , and the united states , unfortunately , is supporting this , " medvedev said .

11 attacks have provided fertile ground for conspiracy theories italian film-maker giulietto chiesa , who was in berlin for a screening of his documentary which questions the official us version of the 9/11 terrorist attacks , has called for an international tribunal to probe events . chiesa was in berlin at the weekend for a screening of his film which features , among others , novelist gore vidal and playwright dario fo as well as retired american professor of philosophy david ray griffin who advances conspiracy theories that contradict mainstream accounts of events of 11 september , 2001 .
federal aviation administration controllers , us air force pilots , military commanders and physicists also appear in the critical documentary , which the director hopes will create " political awareness " of the " faulty " official investigation into the events by the 9/11 commission .
" some of the individuals appearing in the film are former fbi and cia agents , people who have in a sense taken a very big risk in speaking out .
i am very grateful to them because they have done a big job , " said chiesa .
" the film would not have been possible without them , " he said , adding that zero had been seen in france and belgium at individual screenings , and by more than 20,000 people in italy .
but the film so far has not gained a distributor in europe .
pushing for an international tribunal chiesa , one of italy 's most respected journalists and a la stampa foreign correspondent for more than 20 years , told his berlin audience an 9/11 international tribunal could serve a useful purpose .

everybody should be involved in this struggle with a tribunal or commission helping once we win approval for the idea , " he said .
in an interview with german news agency dpa , chiesa , a european parliamentary deputy , said russian television is to give prime time airing to his film on the eve of this week 's seventh anniversary of the attacks in new york and washington .
" that means that some 30 million russian citizens will learn the truth about what happened , which is a very big result for me . "
chiesa , whose documentary was first screened to a large german audience at the goethe institute in munich in may , was clearly delighted at his reception in berlin .
" it 's important that so many people have shown up , " he said .
one of a panel of six experts debating the 9/11 topic in berlin , chiesa said he was eager for his film to gain more public support and become a " multiplicator " across germany .
" if that happens it means we are making politics in the right sense of the word . "
critics question government version of attacks andreas von buelow , a controversial former german minister of technology , and ex-state secretary in the defense ministry , was among the berlin participants who said further investigation was needed into 9/11 .
he told dpa it was " one of life 's characteristics that governments are prone to lie in order to achieve their agendas .

meanwhile a million people have been killed . "
asked if there was any prospect of a policy change once the next us president was elected , he replied bluntly " no ! "
juergen elsaesser , 51 , a berlin-based journalist and author whose latest book is titled " terror target europe : the dangerous double game of the secret services , " spoke of the huge contradictions in the official us version of the 9/11 events .
" critics find themselves accused of conspiracy theories , but the biggest conspiracy is to be found in the official 9/11 version of the us government which maintains that osama bin laden , from a cave in afghanistan , along with 19 young arabs , combined to carry out the most perfidious attack in the history of mankind , " he said .
" that just does n't add up .

11 attacks have provided fertile ground for conspiracy theories italian film-maker giulietto chiesa , who was in berlin for a screening of his documentary which questions the official us version of the 9/11 terrorist attacks , has called for an international tribunal to probe events . chiesa was in berlin at the weekend for a screening of his film which features , among others , novelist gore vidal and playwright dario fo as well as retired american professor of philosophy david ray griffin who advances conspiracy theories that contradict mainstream accounts of events of 11 september , 2001 .
federal aviation administration controllers , us air force pilots , military commanders and physicists also appear in the critical documentary , which the director hopes will create " political awareness " of the " faulty " official investigation into the events by the 9/11 commission .
" some of the individuals appearing in the film are former fbi and cia agents , people who have in a sense taken a very big risk in speaking out .
i am very grateful to them because they have done a big job , " said chiesa .
" the film would not have been possible without them , " he said , adding that zero had been seen in france and belgium at individual screenings , and by more than 20,000 people in italy .
but the film so far has not gained a distributor in europe .
pushing for an international tribunal chiesa , one of italy 's most respected journalists and a la stampa foreign correspondent for more than 20 years , told his berlin audience an 9/11 international tribunal could serve a useful purpose .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : alternative theories abound about what actually happened at the site of the twin towers " if feelings were strong enough a positive result could be obtained , but it would not happen immediately .
so far it 's been the us administration that has won the information fight and obtained their result - unfortunately , " chiesa said . " our task is to inform millions of people of the true situation .
everybody should be involved in this struggle with a tribunal or commission helping once we win approval for the idea , " he said .
in an interview with german news agency dpa , chiesa , a european parliamentary deputy , said russian television is to give prime time airing to his film on the eve of this week 's seventh anniversary of the attacks in new york and washington .
" that means that some 30 million russian citizens will learn the truth about what happened , which is a very big result for me . "
chiesa , whose documentary was first screened to a large german audience at the goethe institute in munich in may , was clearly delighted at his reception in berlin .
" it 's important that so many people have shown up , " he said .
one of a panel of six experts debating the 9/11 topic in berlin , chiesa said he was eager for his film to gain more public support and become a " multiplicator " across germany .
" if that happens it means we are making politics in the right sense of the word . "
critics question government version of attacks andreas von buelow , a controversial former german minister of technology , and ex-state secretary in the defense ministry , was among the berlin participants who said further investigation was needed into 9/11 .
he told dpa it was " one of life 's characteristics that governments are prone to lie in order to achieve their agendas .
the americans told us that in iraq , saddam hussein had something to do with al-qaeda , which was absolutely untrue .
even the cia knew this , " he said .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some say the us invasion of iraq on a false pretext is proof of government lies of international events " then , they told us that saddam hussein was preparing weapons of mass destruction , which was also untrue , so they have been lying all over the place and are still fighting there .
meanwhile a million people have been killed . "
asked if there was any prospect of a policy change once the next us president was elected , he replied bluntly " no ! "
juergen elsaesser , 51 , a berlin-based journalist and author whose latest book is titled " terror target europe : the dangerous double game of the secret services , " spoke of the huge contradictions in the official us version of the 9/11 events .
" critics find themselves accused of conspiracy theories , but the biggest conspiracy is to be found in the official 9/11 version of the us government which maintains that osama bin laden , from a cave in afghanistan , along with 19 young arabs , combined to carry out the most perfidious attack in the history of mankind , " he said .
" that just does n't add up .
for me the most important contradiction is how the air defences of the greatest military power on the planet failed to prevent such attacks occurring and that no interceptor fighter planes or rocket systems were ever activated .

dw-world.de takes a closer look at the man the spd is pinning its hopes on for the top job . for several years , frank walter steinmeier has consistently been among germany ’ s three most popular politicians , at times right at the top of the list or trailing slightly behind christian democrat chancellor angela merkel whom he will now strive to dethrone at the general election next year . the grey-haired 52-year-old 's nomination as candidate for chancellor did n't come as a real surprise .
but doubts persist about whether he can inspire on the campaign trail since steinmeier is an untested challenger - he has never run for public office steinmeier was born in the western german town of detmold .
he joined the spd in 1976 without ever becoming an entrenched party soldier .
a lawyer , steinmeier became gerhard schroeder ’ s chief of staff when the former chancellor was premier of the state of lower saxony . following gerhard schröder 's election as chancellor in 1998 , frank-walter steinmeier was appointed head of the chancellory and commissioner for the federal intelligence services . steinmeier was entrusted with responsibility for overall policy coordination within the federal government . he became one of schroeder 's closest advisors , coordinating the security services and shaping the agenda 2010 package of economic reforms - the unpopular centrepiece of the administration . since 2005 , he ’ s been the country ’ s foreign minister , serving chancellor angela merkel and often standing in her shadow , even in foreign policy matters .
this is why political analysts often refer to steinmeier as germany ’ s biggest number two who ’ s never had to lead a single election campaign . tough road ahead bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : steinmeier 's opponent and boss is the current chancellor , angela merkel however , steinmeier is certainly not without merits .
as foreign minister , he ’ s cut an excellent figure in operations to free german hostages in iraq , afghanistan and elsewhere .
he ’ s also played a pivotal role in keeping up the dialogue with iran over tehran ’ s nuclear arms program , as well as in fostering the process of european integration and enlargement . steinmeier has quite a challenge ahead of him .
he is soft spoken and often looks out of place in large crowds .
he tends to lean towards prepared statements rather than off the cuff remarks to the press .
many germans , including spd supporters , are worried that steinmeier won ’ t have the killer political instinct it will take to unseat angela merkel , who has become quite popular . the foreign minister does have a sense of authority about him , and when he speaks it ’ s difficult to argue with what he says .
as one observer told dw-radio however , it ’ s usually equally difficult to remember a single sentence the minister has uttered .
perhaps he ’ ll have something more memorable up his sleeve now that he ’ s the spd ’ s candidate for chancellor . so far , he ’ s steered clear of scoring political points by throwing mud at opponents or rivals , saying it is more important to tell people what you yourself stand for so that they can judge in which way you ’ re different .

according to monday 's financial times germany -lrb- ftd -rrb- , the cdu leadership has prepared a keynote speech for its party conference in december in which east germany is described as the " germany 's second dictatorship " .
the document cited by the ftd stresses the lack of civil liberties in the german democratic republic .
it also stresses the desperate economic situation of the state at the time the wall came down .
the country was , according to the cdu paper , on the brink of " economic collapse " in 1989 . limbering up for the elections bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : its logo may be red , but that 's about the only thing the document , which is due to be discussed by the party executive over the next few days before being presented to december 's party conference , is intended to serve as the basis for the cdu 's electoral campaign in national elections in 2009 .
the cdu is searching for the right strategy to improve its support in eastern germany .
recent polls have put the conservatives and the left party neck-and-neck at 28 percent in the region .
the social democrats are trailing by several points .
the left has its main support base in the formerly communist eastern states but has also made strong inroads in western states in recent months .
in order to counter any tendencies to play down harmful aspects of the regime in the future , the cdu is also calling for more museums to be set up in former east german stasi -lrb- secret service -rrb- prisons and remaining border installations to be placed under preservation orders .
it also favors erecting freedom and unity monuments in leipzig , the center of opposition rallies against the gdr regime , and the german capital berlin . the cdu is also planning to use the speech to set out its differences from the social democrats , accusing the spd party leadership of attempting to block reunification .
recent years have seen a growing tendency in eastern germany - both culturally and socio-politically - towards " ostalgie , " a german expression made up of the words ost -lrb- east -rrb- and " nostalgia " . studies have also indicated an alarming lack of knowledge about the former communist regime among german schoolchildren . dw staff -lrb- jg -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

after two years of evaluation , experts warned that areas near the south-western edge of asse were unsafe .
their 1993 report found that up to 4,000 litres of water were flooding into the mine 's shafts each day .
it recommended that all shafts and caverns less than 750 metres below the earth ’ s surface should be stabilised to prevent possible collapse .
focus reports that although spd leaders in lower saxony received an updated report highlighting safety concerns in 1998 , they chose to keep the warnings under wraps .
the extent of the safety problems at asse were made public last week , prompting environment minister sigmar gabriel to transfer responsibility of the facility from the munich-based helmholtz institute for scientific research to the federal office for radiation protection .
waste disposal ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : in the 1960s researchers thought salt mines were ideal for storing nuclear waste nuclear power is often touted as being clean and carbon-friendly , but opponents point out that no one has yet found a durable solution for storing nuclear waste , which remains highly radioactive for centuries .
asse was converted into an atomic waste storage facility in the 1960s as a pilot project linked to plans for a permanent facility at another former salt mine at gorleben , lower saxony .
but problems at asse raise questions about the feasibility of the gorleben site at a time when germany ’ s grand coalition government is split on whether or not to reverse plans to abandon all nuclear power by 2021 .
political fallout chancellor angela merkel 's conservative christian democratic union -lrb- cdu -rrb- , which supports continued use of nuclear power , is worried that asse will undermine its calls for a rethink of the planned phase-out .
in a radio interview on sunday , merkel said there needed to be decisions about what to do with highly radioactive material .
" we do also need to make progress in the storage of highly radioactive material .
it 's about atomic plants .
a moratorium has been agreed for gorleben and of course decisions must be made on how things go from here , " merkel told deutschlandfunk radio .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : environment minister gabriel has assumed control of asse in its latest issue , der spiegel magazine quoted a strategy paper in which conservative lawmaker katherine reiche demanded that environment minister gabriel immediately lift the moratorium on exploring options for storing atomic waste at gorleben .
the moratorium is the result of battles between supporters of nuclear power , who unsuccessfully tried to rush through gorleben 's commissioning in the 1970s , and a powerful lobby of opponents for whom the unresolved storage question buys time to discredit nuclear energy .
der spiegel reports that a search for alternatives elsewhere , which gabriel and the social democrats prefer , would cost at least one billion euros .
if plans for the waste storage facility at gorleben are given up completely , energy companies could make compensation demands worth billions of euros . dw staff -lrb- sje -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" i ca n't describe in any words what we 're feeling right now , " singer bill kaulitz said , thanking the band 's fans worldwide .

in addition , the new bank aimed to realize synergies worth 5 billion euros , he said .
analysts were critical following sunday 's deal , and commerzbank 's shares dived to trade as low as 16.66 euros during friday trade in frankfurt .

regarding the reported interest shown in dresdner bank by the state-owned china development bank , blessing told the weekly : " if there had been a game of bluff over the price with a bank backed by the chinese state , we would not have had a chance . "
a new banking force he said there would be substantial cuts at the london-based dresdner investment banking unit dresdner kleinwort , but refused to be drawn on a potential purchaser for the subsidiary , which has been hit by the us subprime crisis .

with total assets of about 1.09 trillion euros and 11 million german customers , a merged commerzbank-dresdner will result in the emergence of new banking force in europe 's biggest economy .
deutsche bank , which failed in a bid to merge with dresdner eight years ago , remains the largest bank in germany with assets totaling about 2 trillion euros . munich-based allianz , europe 's biggest insurer , is to retain a stake of about 30 percent in the new banking group and to take over risks totaling 975 million euros which are linked to the global financial crisis and credit crunch .
allianz paid about 23 billion euros for dresdner in 2001 as part of an ambitious plan to sell its pension and insurance schemes through dresdner 's branch network .
analysts see the dresdner-commerzbank deal as a prelude to the two banks ' launching a bid for deutsche postbank , which has 14.5 million customers and more than 800 branches . dpa news agency -lrb- ah -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

11 attacks have provided fertile ground for conspiracy theories italian film-maker giulietto chiesa , who was in berlin for a screening of his documentary which questions the official us version of the 9/11 terrorist attacks , has called for an international tribunal to probe events . chiesa was in berlin at the weekend for a screening of his film which features , among others , novelist gore vidal and playwright dario fo as well as retired american professor of philosophy david ray griffin who advances conspiracy theories that contradict mainstream accounts of events of 11 september , 2001 .
federal aviation administration controllers , us air force pilots , military commanders and physicists also appear in the critical documentary , which the director hopes will create " political awareness " of the " faulty " official investigation into the events by the 9/11 commission .
" some of the individuals appearing in the film are former fbi and cia agents , people who have in a sense taken a very big risk in speaking out .
i am very grateful to them because they have done a big job , " said chiesa .
" the film would not have been possible without them , " he said , adding that zero had been seen in france and belgium at individual screenings , and by more than 20,000 people in italy .
but the film so far has not gained a distributor in europe .
pushing for an international tribunal chiesa , one of italy 's most respected journalists and a la stampa foreign correspondent for more than 20 years , told his berlin audience an 9/11 international tribunal could serve a useful purpose .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : alternative theories abound about what actually happened at the site of the twin towers " if feelings were strong enough a positive result could be obtained , but it would not happen immediately .
so far it 's been the us administration that has won the information fight and obtained their result - unfortunately , " chiesa said . " our task is to inform millions of people of the true situation .
everybody should be involved in this struggle with a tribunal or commission helping once we win approval for the idea , " he said .
in an interview with german news agency dpa , chiesa , a european parliamentary deputy , said russian television is to give prime time airing to his film on the eve of this week 's seventh anniversary of the attacks in new york and washington .
" that means that some 30 million russian citizens will learn the truth about what happened , which is a very big result for me . "
chiesa , whose documentary was first screened to a large german audience at the goethe institute in munich in may , was clearly delighted at his reception in berlin .
" it 's important that so many people have shown up , " he said .
one of a panel of six experts debating the 9/11 topic in berlin , chiesa said he was eager for his film to gain more public support and become a " multiplicator " across germany .
" if that happens it means we are making politics in the right sense of the word . "
critics question government version of attacks andreas von buelow , a controversial former german minister of technology , and ex-state secretary in the defense ministry , was among the berlin participants who said further investigation was needed into 9/11 .
he told dpa it was " one of life 's characteristics that governments are prone to lie in order to achieve their agendas .
the americans told us that in iraq , saddam hussein had something to do with al-qaeda , which was absolutely untrue .
even the cia knew this , " he said .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some say the us invasion of iraq on a false pretext is proof of government lies of international events " then , they told us that saddam hussein was preparing weapons of mass destruction , which was also untrue , so they have been lying all over the place and are still fighting there .
meanwhile a million people have been killed . "
asked if there was any prospect of a policy change once the next us president was elected , he replied bluntly " no ! "
juergen elsaesser , 51 , a berlin-based journalist and author whose latest book is titled " terror target europe : the dangerous double game of the secret services , " spoke of the huge contradictions in the official us version of the 9/11 events .
" critics find themselves accused of conspiracy theories , but the biggest conspiracy is to be found in the official 9/11 version of the us government which maintains that osama bin laden , from a cave in afghanistan , along with 19 young arabs , combined to carry out the most perfidious attack in the history of mankind , " he said .
" that just does n't add up .
for me the most important contradiction is how the air defences of the greatest military power on the planet failed to prevent such attacks occurring and that no interceptor fighter planes or rocket systems were ever activated .

china ’ s insistence on adherence to the nuclear non-proliferation mechanism at the meeting of nuclear suppliers group , which adopted a resolution on civil nuclear cooperation with india at the weekend , has been criticised widely by indian officials . in a historic decision at the weekend , the nuclear suppliers group lifted a 34-year old ban on nuclear trade with india , a country which has not signed the non-proliferation treaty .
the move will now enable energy-hungry new delhi to buy nuclear fuel , technology and reactors and is vital for its civilian nuclear deal with the us .
india was able to win the support of the 45 nation body only after it gave an assurance that it will stand by nuclear non-proliferation commitments and uphold a moratorium on testing atomic weapons .
however critics fear the nsg ’ s approval sets a precedent allowing other nations to follow the suit .
china ’ s concerns one of the countries , which voiced its concerns at the nsg meeting in vienna , was china .
in a statement , cheng jingye , head of the chinese delegation at vienna , pointed out that beijing hoped that the decision made by the group would ‘ contribute to the goals of nuclear non-proliferation and peaceful use of nuclear power ’ .
the remarks have sparked disappointment among indian experts and officials , who say beijing had repeatedly assured india that it would not oppose a consensus on new delhi ’ s inclusion in the nsg .
sujit dutta , an expert on chinese affairs at the institute of defence studies and analysis in new delhi , finds beijing ’ s stance surprising . “ when indian pm singh met wen jiabao earlier this year , the chinese said they understood india ’ s energy requirements .
they would not obstruct the deal .
so what is this new position , why didn ’ t they mention this so-called non-proliferation earlier ? ”
n-deal for pakistan ?
in a bid to soothe ties , chinese foreign ministry spokesperson jiang yu on monday said beijing welcomed the lifting of a nuclear embargo on india .
but she said that china 's stance is that that all nations are entitled to use nuclear energy peacefully .
though it is not clear what china means by " all nations " , experts in india believe beijing is seeking agreement with pakistan now , which is beijing ’ s key ally and is aspiring to use nuclear energy .
expert sujit dutta explains : “ only three countries are outside npt : india , pakistan and israel .
since israel is not asking for it , so china is actually lobbying for pakistan . ”
economic ties between new delhi and beijing have improved in recent years .
their bilateral trade currently accounts for more than 38 billion dollars and the two sides have agreed to double it by 2010 .
existing mistrust however the mistrust , which was created between the two sides after a bitter border conflict in 1962 , persists . dietmar rothermund is a professor of south asian history at the university of heidelberg in germany : “ india is concerned that china has been doing a lot for pakistan , whose nuclear programme is supported by china .
moreover china ’ s interest on the indian ocean has been seen in india with some degree of nervousness and tension . ”
however he doesn ’ t believe that the two countries will resort to confrontation to resolve their differences : “ both countries are big and have their own problems and are not really keen on disputes with each other . ”
the chinese foreign minister yang jiechi is currently on a three day visit to india to boost bilateral ties . one of the key issues at the discussions will be the disputed 4,000-kilometre border , which is claimed by both sides .
both sides have so far held at least 11 rounds of talks over the boundary issue , which however have failed to produce any breakthrough . dw staff 08/09/08 send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic threatened communities preserving tribal communities and their habitats can help sustain the environment .

in a bid to soothe ties , chinese foreign ministry spokesperson jiang yu on monday said beijing welcomed the lifting of a nuclear embargo on india .
but she said that china 's stance is that that all nations are entitled to use nuclear energy peacefully .
though it is not clear what china means by " all nations " , experts in india believe beijing is seeking agreement with pakistan now , which is beijing ’ s key ally and is aspiring to use nuclear energy .
expert sujit dutta explains : “ only three countries are outside npt : india , pakistan and israel .
since israel is not asking for it , so china is actually lobbying for pakistan . ”
economic ties between new delhi and beijing have improved in recent years .
their bilateral trade currently accounts for more than 38 billion dollars and the two sides have agreed to double it by 2010 .

moreover china ’ s interest on the indian ocean has been seen in india with some degree of nervousness and tension . ”
however he doesn ’ t believe that the two countries will resort to confrontation to resolve their differences : “ both countries are big and have their own problems and are not really keen on disputes with each other . ”
the chinese foreign minister yang jiechi is currently on a three day visit to india to boost bilateral ties . one of the key issues at the discussions will be the disputed 4,000-kilometre border , which is claimed by both sides .

the goal is to be able to offer high-speed train service when the rail network in the european union is liberalized in 2010 . the project had been in the air for some time and the two companies signed a confidential draft agreement at the end of june , the newspaper aujourd 'hui france reported .
the diversification amounted to a " change in flight direction for air france " which was responding to " the difficult position of airlines for journeys of less than three hours . " the two companies had already contacted french group alstom , which makes the tgv high-speed trains for the sncf , because they were interested in a new generation of train developed by alstom called the agv .
the new company is hoping to purchase several agv trains , which can reach a maximum speed of 350 km / h -lrb- 217 mph -rrb- , to run between paris and london and paris and amsterdam . this is not the first partnership between an airline and a rail company .

11 attacks have provided fertile ground for conspiracy theories italian film-maker giulietto chiesa , who was in berlin for a screening of his documentary which questions the official us version of the 9/11 terrorist attacks , has called for an international tribunal to probe events . chiesa was in berlin at the weekend for a screening of his film which features , among others , novelist gore vidal and playwright dario fo as well as retired american professor of philosophy david ray griffin who advances conspiracy theories that contradict mainstream accounts of events of 11 september , 2001 .
federal aviation administration controllers , us air force pilots , military commanders and physicists also appear in the critical documentary , which the director hopes will create " political awareness " of the " faulty " official investigation into the events by the 9/11 commission .
" some of the individuals appearing in the film are former fbi and cia agents , people who have in a sense taken a very big risk in speaking out .
i am very grateful to them because they have done a big job , " said chiesa .
" the film would not have been possible without them , " he said , adding that zero had been seen in france and belgium at individual screenings , and by more than 20,000 people in italy .
but the film so far has not gained a distributor in europe .
pushing for an international tribunal chiesa , one of italy 's most respected journalists and a la stampa foreign correspondent for more than 20 years , told his berlin audience an 9/11 international tribunal could serve a useful purpose .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : alternative theories abound about what actually happened at the site of the twin towers " if feelings were strong enough a positive result could be obtained , but it would not happen immediately .
so far it 's been the us administration that has won the information fight and obtained their result - unfortunately , " chiesa said . " our task is to inform millions of people of the true situation .
everybody should be involved in this struggle with a tribunal or commission helping once we win approval for the idea , " he said .
in an interview with german news agency dpa , chiesa , a european parliamentary deputy , said russian television is to give prime time airing to his film on the eve of this week 's seventh anniversary of the attacks in new york and washington .
" that means that some 30 million russian citizens will learn the truth about what happened , which is a very big result for me . "
chiesa , whose documentary was first screened to a large german audience at the goethe institute in munich in may , was clearly delighted at his reception in berlin .
" it 's important that so many people have shown up , " he said .
one of a panel of six experts debating the 9/11 topic in berlin , chiesa said he was eager for his film to gain more public support and become a " multiplicator " across germany .
" if that happens it means we are making politics in the right sense of the word . "
critics question government version of attacks andreas von buelow , a controversial former german minister of technology , and ex-state secretary in the defense ministry , was among the berlin participants who said further investigation was needed into 9/11 .
he told dpa it was " one of life 's characteristics that governments are prone to lie in order to achieve their agendas .
the americans told us that in iraq , saddam hussein had something to do with al-qaeda , which was absolutely untrue .
even the cia knew this , " he said .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some say the us invasion of iraq on a false pretext is proof of government lies of international events " then , they told us that saddam hussein was preparing weapons of mass destruction , which was also untrue , so they have been lying all over the place and are still fighting there .
meanwhile a million people have been killed . "
asked if there was any prospect of a policy change once the next us president was elected , he replied bluntly " no ! "
juergen elsaesser , 51 , a berlin-based journalist and author whose latest book is titled " terror target europe : the dangerous double game of the secret services , " spoke of the huge contradictions in the official us version of the 9/11 events .
" critics find themselves accused of conspiracy theories , but the biggest conspiracy is to be found in the official 9/11 version of the us government which maintains that osama bin laden , from a cave in afghanistan , along with 19 young arabs , combined to carry out the most perfidious attack in the history of mankind , " he said .
" that just does n't add up .
for me the most important contradiction is how the air defences of the greatest military power on the planet failed to prevent such attacks occurring and that no interceptor fighter planes or rocket systems were ever activated .

11 attacks have provided fertile ground for conspiracy theories italian film-maker giulietto chiesa , who was in berlin for a screening of his documentary which questions the official us version of the 9/11 terrorist attacks , has called for an international tribunal to probe events . chiesa was in berlin at the weekend for a screening of his film which features , among others , novelist gore vidal and playwright dario fo as well as retired american professor of philosophy david ray griffin who advances conspiracy theories that contradict mainstream accounts of events of 11 september , 2001 .
federal aviation administration controllers , us air force pilots , military commanders and physicists also appear in the critical documentary , which the director hopes will create " political awareness " of the " faulty " official investigation into the events by the 9/11 commission .
" some of the individuals appearing in the film are former fbi and cia agents , people who have in a sense taken a very big risk in speaking out .
i am very grateful to them because they have done a big job , " said chiesa .
" the film would not have been possible without them , " he said , adding that zero had been seen in france and belgium at individual screenings , and by more than 20,000 people in italy .
but the film so far has not gained a distributor in europe .
pushing for an international tribunal chiesa , one of italy 's most respected journalists and a la stampa foreign correspondent for more than 20 years , told his berlin audience an 9/11 international tribunal could serve a useful purpose .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : alternative theories abound about what actually happened at the site of the twin towers " if feelings were strong enough a positive result could be obtained , but it would not happen immediately .
so far it 's been the us administration that has won the information fight and obtained their result - unfortunately , " chiesa said . " our task is to inform millions of people of the true situation .
everybody should be involved in this struggle with a tribunal or commission helping once we win approval for the idea , " he said .
in an interview with german news agency dpa , chiesa , a european parliamentary deputy , said russian television is to give prime time airing to his film on the eve of this week 's seventh anniversary of the attacks in new york and washington .
" that means that some 30 million russian citizens will learn the truth about what happened , which is a very big result for me . "
chiesa , whose documentary was first screened to a large german audience at the goethe institute in munich in may , was clearly delighted at his reception in berlin .
" it 's important that so many people have shown up , " he said .
one of a panel of six experts debating the 9/11 topic in berlin , chiesa said he was eager for his film to gain more public support and become a " multiplicator " across germany .
" if that happens it means we are making politics in the right sense of the word . "
critics question government version of attacks andreas von buelow , a controversial former german minister of technology , and ex-state secretary in the defense ministry , was among the berlin participants who said further investigation was needed into 9/11 .
he told dpa it was " one of life 's characteristics that governments are prone to lie in order to achieve their agendas .

even the cia knew this , " he said .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some say the us invasion of iraq on a false pretext is proof of government lies of international events " then , they told us that saddam hussein was preparing weapons of mass destruction , which was also untrue , so they have been lying all over the place and are still fighting there .
meanwhile a million people have been killed . "
asked if there was any prospect of a policy change once the next us president was elected , he replied bluntly " no ! "
juergen elsaesser , 51 , a berlin-based journalist and author whose latest book is titled " terror target europe : the dangerous double game of the secret services , " spoke of the huge contradictions in the official us version of the 9/11 events .
" critics find themselves accused of conspiracy theories , but the biggest conspiracy is to be found in the official 9/11 version of the us government which maintains that osama bin laden , from a cave in afghanistan , along with 19 young arabs , combined to carry out the most perfidious attack in the history of mankind , " he said .
" that just does n't add up .
for me the most important contradiction is how the air defences of the greatest military power on the planet failed to prevent such attacks occurring and that no interceptor fighter planes or rocket systems were ever activated .

11 attacks have provided fertile ground for conspiracy theories italian film-maker giulietto chiesa , who was in berlin for a screening of his documentary which questions the official us version of the 9/11 terrorist attacks , has called for an international tribunal to probe events . chiesa was in berlin at the weekend for a screening of his film which features , among others , novelist gore vidal and playwright dario fo as well as retired american professor of philosophy david ray griffin who advances conspiracy theories that contradict mainstream accounts of events of 11 september , 2001 .
federal aviation administration controllers , us air force pilots , military commanders and physicists also appear in the critical documentary , which the director hopes will create " political awareness " of the " faulty " official investigation into the events by the 9/11 commission .

in addition , the new bank aimed to realize synergies worth 5 billion euros , he said .

a new banking force he said there would be substantial cuts at the london-based dresdner investment banking unit dresdner kleinwort , but refused to be drawn on a potential purchaser for the subsidiary , which has been hit by the us subprime crisis .

in addition , the new bank aimed to realize synergies worth 5 billion euros , he said .
analysts were critical following sunday 's deal , and commerzbank 's shares dived to trade as low as 16.66 euros during friday trade in frankfurt .
on friday aug .
29 , the last day of trading before the widely anticipated announcement , commerzbank had traded in a range around 20 euros .
the new bank , which aims to challenge the dominance in germany of deutsche bank through its widespread branch network , aims to shed some 9,000 of its staff complement of 67,000 full-time employees .
regarding the reported interest shown in dresdner bank by the state-owned china development bank , blessing told the weekly : " if there had been a game of bluff over the price with a bank backed by the chinese state , we would not have had a chance . "
a new banking force he said there would be substantial cuts at the london-based dresdner investment banking unit dresdner kleinwort , but refused to be drawn on a potential purchaser for the subsidiary , which has been hit by the us subprime crisis .

dw-world.de takes a closer look at the man the spd is pinning its hopes on for the top job . for several years , frank walter steinmeier has consistently been among germany ’ s three most popular politicians , at times right at the top of the list or trailing slightly behind christian democrat chancellor angela merkel whom he will now strive to dethrone at the general election next year . the grey-haired 52-year-old 's nomination as candidate for chancellor did n't come as a real surprise .
but doubts persist about whether he can inspire on the campaign trail since steinmeier is an untested challenger - he has never run for public office steinmeier was born in the western german town of detmold .
he joined the spd in 1976 without ever becoming an entrenched party soldier .
a lawyer , steinmeier became gerhard schroeder ’ s chief of staff when the former chancellor was premier of the state of lower saxony . following gerhard schröder 's election as chancellor in 1998 , frank-walter steinmeier was appointed head of the chancellory and commissioner for the federal intelligence services . steinmeier was entrusted with responsibility for overall policy coordination within the federal government . he became one of schroeder 's closest advisors , coordinating the security services and shaping the agenda 2010 package of economic reforms - the unpopular centrepiece of the administration . since 2005 , he ’ s been the country ’ s foreign minister , serving chancellor angela merkel and often standing in her shadow , even in foreign policy matters .
this is why political analysts often refer to steinmeier as germany ’ s biggest number two who ’ s never had to lead a single election campaign . tough road ahead bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : steinmeier 's opponent and boss is the current chancellor , angela merkel however , steinmeier is certainly not without merits .
as foreign minister , he ’ s cut an excellent figure in operations to free german hostages in iraq , afghanistan and elsewhere .
he ’ s also played a pivotal role in keeping up the dialogue with iran over tehran ’ s nuclear arms program , as well as in fostering the process of european integration and enlargement . steinmeier has quite a challenge ahead of him .
he is soft spoken and often looks out of place in large crowds .
he tends to lean towards prepared statements rather than off the cuff remarks to the press .
many germans , including spd supporters , are worried that steinmeier won ’ t have the killer political instinct it will take to unseat angela merkel , who has become quite popular . the foreign minister does have a sense of authority about him , and when he speaks it ’ s difficult to argue with what he says .
as one observer told dw-radio however , it ’ s usually equally difficult to remember a single sentence the minister has uttered .
perhaps he ’ ll have something more memorable up his sleeve now that he ’ s the spd ’ s candidate for chancellor . so far , he ’ s steered clear of scoring political points by throwing mud at opponents or rivals , saying it is more important to tell people what you yourself stand for so that they can judge in which way you ’ re different .
whether this strategy will pay off during the 2009 general election remains to be seen . dw staff -lrb- mrm -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

dw-world.de takes a closer look at the man the spd is pinning its hopes on for the top job . for several years , frank walter steinmeier has consistently been among germany ’ s three most popular politicians , at times right at the top of the list or trailing slightly behind christian democrat chancellor angela merkel whom he will now strive to dethrone at the general election next year . the grey-haired 52-year-old 's nomination as candidate for chancellor did n't come as a real surprise .
but doubts persist about whether he can inspire on the campaign trail since steinmeier is an untested challenger - he has never run for public office steinmeier was born in the western german town of detmold .
he joined the spd in 1976 without ever becoming an entrenched party soldier .
a lawyer , steinmeier became gerhard schroeder ’ s chief of staff when the former chancellor was premier of the state of lower saxony . following gerhard schröder 's election as chancellor in 1998 , frank-walter steinmeier was appointed head of the chancellory and commissioner for the federal intelligence services . steinmeier was entrusted with responsibility for overall policy coordination within the federal government . he became one of schroeder 's closest advisors , coordinating the security services and shaping the agenda 2010 package of economic reforms - the unpopular centrepiece of the administration . since 2005 , he ’ s been the country ’ s foreign minister , serving chancellor angela merkel and often standing in her shadow , even in foreign policy matters .
this is why political analysts often refer to steinmeier as germany ’ s biggest number two who ’ s never had to lead a single election campaign . tough road ahead bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : steinmeier 's opponent and boss is the current chancellor , angela merkel however , steinmeier is certainly not without merits .
as foreign minister , he ’ s cut an excellent figure in operations to free german hostages in iraq , afghanistan and elsewhere .
he ’ s also played a pivotal role in keeping up the dialogue with iran over tehran ’ s nuclear arms program , as well as in fostering the process of european integration and enlargement . steinmeier has quite a challenge ahead of him .
he is soft spoken and often looks out of place in large crowds .
he tends to lean towards prepared statements rather than off the cuff remarks to the press .
many germans , including spd supporters , are worried that steinmeier won ’ t have the killer political instinct it will take to unseat angela merkel , who has become quite popular . the foreign minister does have a sense of authority about him , and when he speaks it ’ s difficult to argue with what he says .
as one observer told dw-radio however , it ’ s usually equally difficult to remember a single sentence the minister has uttered .
perhaps he ’ ll have something more memorable up his sleeve now that he ’ s the spd ’ s candidate for chancellor . so far , he ’ s steered clear of scoring political points by throwing mud at opponents or rivals , saying it is more important to tell people what you yourself stand for so that they can judge in which way you ’ re different .
whether this strategy will pay off during the 2009 general election remains to be seen . dw staff -lrb- mrm -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

7 for their post-apocalyptic style music video for the song ready , set , go ! the quartet 's win as the only male and only non-american nominees in their category came as a surprise to the young musicians . " i ca n't describe in any words what we 're feeling right now , " singer bill kaulitz said , thanking the band 's fans worldwide .
since tokio hotel was formed in magdeburg in 2001 , the quartet of bill and tom kaulitz , georg listing and gustav schaefer have enjoyed much success in their native germany , wirth four number one singles and two chart-topping albums , selling nearly five million cds and dvds .
tokio hotel released their first album “ schrei ” -lrb- scream -rrb- in may 2006 and sold some 600,000 copies in six days in germany .
it also quickly became a major success in france , austria and switzerland .
persistent pop disaster doll britney spears stole the mtv show , however , winning awards in all three categories she was nominated in : video of the year , best pop video and best female video .
the row of awards marked a comeback after her disastrous performance at last year 's vmas .
ever growing international success bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : despite the band 's popularity , their hair has had mixed reviews after starting to sing more in english , tokio hotel 's international popularity has been growing rapidly with large fan bases in other european countries , particularly in france and belgium .
the award marks the band 's growing success in north america , reaching 39 in the official us billboard charts and climbing as high as sixth place in the canadian charts .
that makes tokio hotel one of the few german bands to enjoy such international success .
tokio hotel is well known for what some describe as shrewd marketing tactics - playing on the singer 's androgynous look , the band members ' young ages and edgy hairstyles to reach icon status among many teenage girls .
as well as singing more in english , the band has recently adopted a more serious " emo " image , which is reflected in their now award-winning video depicting a mass of soulless people marching in uniforms - apparently the victims of a dystopic regime .
the vma award is already being seen as a potential breakthrough for the band to further success in america .
speaking ahead of the ceremony , bill kaulitz said : " we do n't expect it , so for us , it 's so cool to be nominated .
i think it 's really , really special for us - it 's america and it 's our first american award and that 's so huge . "
the youngsters showed they are getting used to the international pop-star lifestyle when they turned up for the awards on a monster truck , though they were upstaged by rapper t-pain who arrived on elephant accompanied by various circus performers . dw staff -lrb- ah -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de asia -pipe- 08.09.2008 chinese fm visits india amid nuclear row großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : china 's foreign minister yang jiechi is on a three day visit to india chinese foreign minister yang jiechi ’ s visit comes amid fresh tensions in bilateral relations between the two neighbours .
china ’ s insistence on adherence to the nuclear non-proliferation mechanism at the meeting of nuclear suppliers group , which adopted a resolution on civil nuclear cooperation with india at the weekend , has been criticised widely by indian officials . in a historic decision at the weekend , the nuclear suppliers group lifted a 34-year old ban on nuclear trade with india , a country which has not signed the non-proliferation treaty .
the move will now enable energy-hungry new delhi to buy nuclear fuel , technology and reactors and is vital for its civilian nuclear deal with the us .
india was able to win the support of the 45 nation body only after it gave an assurance that it will stand by nuclear non-proliferation commitments and uphold a moratorium on testing atomic weapons .
however critics fear the nsg ’ s approval sets a precedent allowing other nations to follow the suit .
china ’ s concerns one of the countries , which voiced its concerns at the nsg meeting in vienna , was china .
in a statement , cheng jingye , head of the chinese delegation at vienna , pointed out that beijing hoped that the decision made by the group would ‘ contribute to the goals of nuclear non-proliferation and peaceful use of nuclear power ’ .
the remarks have sparked disappointment among indian experts and officials , who say beijing had repeatedly assured india that it would not oppose a consensus on new delhi ’ s inclusion in the nsg .
sujit dutta , an expert on chinese affairs at the institute of defence studies and analysis in new delhi , finds beijing ’ s stance surprising . “ when indian pm singh met wen jiabao earlier this year , the chinese said they understood india ’ s energy requirements .
they would not obstruct the deal .
so what is this new position , why didn ’ t they mention this so-called non-proliferation earlier ? ”
n-deal for pakistan ?
in a bid to soothe ties , chinese foreign ministry spokesperson jiang yu on monday said beijing welcomed the lifting of a nuclear embargo on india .
but she said that china 's stance is that that all nations are entitled to use nuclear energy peacefully .
though it is not clear what china means by " all nations " , experts in india believe beijing is seeking agreement with pakistan now , which is beijing ’ s key ally and is aspiring to use nuclear energy .
expert sujit dutta explains : “ only three countries are outside npt : india , pakistan and israel .
since israel is not asking for it , so china is actually lobbying for pakistan . ”
economic ties between new delhi and beijing have improved in recent years .
their bilateral trade currently accounts for more than 38 billion dollars and the two sides have agreed to double it by 2010 .
existing mistrust however the mistrust , which was created between the two sides after a bitter border conflict in 1962 , persists . dietmar rothermund is a professor of south asian history at the university of heidelberg in germany : “ india is concerned that china has been doing a lot for pakistan , whose nuclear programme is supported by china .
moreover china ’ s interest on the indian ocean has been seen in india with some degree of nervousness and tension . ”
however he doesn ’ t believe that the two countries will resort to confrontation to resolve their differences : “ both countries are big and have their own problems and are not really keen on disputes with each other . ”
the chinese foreign minister yang jiechi is currently on a three day visit to india to boost bilateral ties . one of the key issues at the discussions will be the disputed 4,000-kilometre border , which is claimed by both sides .
both sides have so far held at least 11 rounds of talks over the boundary issue , which however have failed to produce any breakthrough . dw staff 08/09/08 send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic 9797 media center watch and listen explore new content daily in dw 's multimedia archive .

after two years of evaluation , experts warned that areas near the south-western edge of asse were unsafe .
their 1993 report found that up to 4,000 litres of water were flooding into the mine 's shafts each day .
it recommended that all shafts and caverns less than 750 metres below the earth ’ s surface should be stabilised to prevent possible collapse .
focus reports that although spd leaders in lower saxony received an updated report highlighting safety concerns in 1998 , they chose to keep the warnings under wraps .
the extent of the safety problems at asse were made public last week , prompting environment minister sigmar gabriel to transfer responsibility of the facility from the munich-based helmholtz institute for scientific research to the federal office for radiation protection .
waste disposal ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : in the 1960s researchers thought salt mines were ideal for storing nuclear waste nuclear power is often touted as being clean and carbon-friendly , but opponents point out that no one has yet found a durable solution for storing nuclear waste , which remains highly radioactive for centuries .
asse was converted into an atomic waste storage facility in the 1960s as a pilot project linked to plans for a permanent facility at another former salt mine at gorleben , lower saxony .
but problems at asse raise questions about the feasibility of the gorleben site at a time when germany ’ s grand coalition government is split on whether or not to reverse plans to abandon all nuclear power by 2021 .
political fallout chancellor angela merkel 's conservative christian democratic union -lrb- cdu -rrb- , which supports continued use of nuclear power , is worried that asse will undermine its calls for a rethink of the planned phase-out .
in a radio interview on sunday , merkel said there needed to be decisions about what to do with highly radioactive material .
" we do also need to make progress in the storage of highly radioactive material .
it 's about atomic plants .
a moratorium has been agreed for gorleben and of course decisions must be made on how things go from here , " merkel told deutschlandfunk radio .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : environment minister gabriel has assumed control of asse in its latest issue , der spiegel magazine quoted a strategy paper in which conservative lawmaker katherine reiche demanded that environment minister gabriel immediately lift the moratorium on exploring options for storing atomic waste at gorleben .
the moratorium is the result of battles between supporters of nuclear power , who unsuccessfully tried to rush through gorleben 's commissioning in the 1970s , and a powerful lobby of opponents for whom the unresolved storage question buys time to discredit nuclear energy .
der spiegel reports that a search for alternatives elsewhere , which gabriel and the social democrats prefer , would cost at least one billion euros .
if plans for the waste storage facility at gorleben are given up completely , energy companies could make compensation demands worth billions of euros . dw staff -lrb- sje -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

but that is not the case .
the crisis which has supposedly been resolved by the very dubiously financed american real estate market has just reached a new hazard level .
banks have lost $ 500 billion -lrb- 350 billion euros -rrb- .
a whole array of finance companies are in financial disorder .
in the usa a number of banks have been closed and more will follow .
that is bad enough .
it would be much worse if the big mortgage financers fannie mae and freddie mac broke down , a fate which has so far been hindered only through massive intervention by finance minister henry paulson and the federal reserve .
state forced to intervene bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : karl zawadzky the ministry of finance and the federal reserve had no choice but to intervene due to one single reason : the collapse of fannie mae and freddie mac could have precipitated a core meltdown of the american bank and stock market systems , dragging the rest of the world with it into the abyss .
that is because these two banks are responsible for $ 5.3 billion -lrb- 3.7 billion euros -rrb- of america 's $ 12 billion -lrb- 8.4 billion euro -rrb- total mortgage debt .
that corresponds to one third of america 's gross domestic product .
besides that , pretty much all other banks have turned their backs on the mortgage market .
an economic crisis in the usa would have very quickly become a depression - and it would have had worldwide consequences .
in the end the government and the federal reserve felt compelled to act , since the two institutions play a central role on the mortgage market .
they are practically the reinsurance for the mortgage banks - they sell credit claims to the regional mortgage banks and , as the case may be , guarantee the claims and thus back them up .
crisis still looming yet there is no longer much new business , quite the opposite : more and more real estate companies are coming under foreclosure .
experts take it for granted that in this year more than one million americans will cut their debt service .
the risks with fannie mae and freddie mac are piling up .
in the case of a property crisis , this is the least favorable business model .
in addition , fannie mae and freddie mac trade under the names of private corporations , but cooperate closely with the state .
the state had to act as the confidence crisis was getting more and more out of hand .
after they already obtained federal reserve credit on advance conditions , the state took them completely under its wing and supplied them with fresh money .
the free-enterprise rules are being overridden , economic misconduct is going unpunished , and the state is stepping onto the scene as a savior .
after the profits are privatized in good times , the losses are socialized by the state .

after two years of evaluation , experts warned that areas near the south-western edge of asse were unsafe .
their 1993 report found that up to 4,000 litres of water were flooding into the mine 's shafts each day .
it recommended that all shafts and caverns less than 750 metres below the earth ’ s surface should be stabilised to prevent possible collapse .
focus reports that although spd leaders in lower saxony received an updated report highlighting safety concerns in 1998 , they chose to keep the warnings under wraps .
the extent of the safety problems at asse were made public last week , prompting environment minister sigmar gabriel to transfer responsibility of the facility from the munich-based helmholtz institute for scientific research to the federal office for radiation protection .

asse was converted into an atomic waste storage facility in the 1960s as a pilot project linked to plans for a permanent facility at another former salt mine at gorleben , lower saxony .
but problems at asse raise questions about the feasibility of the gorleben site at a time when germany ’ s grand coalition government is split on whether or not to reverse plans to abandon all nuclear power by 2021 .
political fallout chancellor angela merkel 's conservative christian democratic union -lrb- cdu -rrb- , which supports continued use of nuclear power , is worried that asse will undermine its calls for a rethink of the planned phase-out .
in a radio interview on sunday , merkel said there needed to be decisions about what to do with highly radioactive material .
" we do also need to make progress in the storage of highly radioactive material .
it 's about atomic plants .
a moratorium has been agreed for gorleben and of course decisions must be made on how things go from here , " merkel told deutschlandfunk radio .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : environment minister gabriel has assumed control of asse in its latest issue , der spiegel magazine quoted a strategy paper in which conservative lawmaker katherine reiche demanded that environment minister gabriel immediately lift the moratorium on exploring options for storing atomic waste at gorleben .
the moratorium is the result of battles between supporters of nuclear power , who unsuccessfully tried to rush through gorleben 's commissioning in the 1970s , and a powerful lobby of opponents for whom the unresolved storage question buys time to discredit nuclear energy .
der spiegel reports that a search for alternatives elsewhere , which gabriel and the social democrats prefer , would cost at least one billion euros .

after two years of evaluation , experts warned that areas near the south-western edge of asse were unsafe .
their 1993 report found that up to 4,000 litres of water were flooding into the mine 's shafts each day .
it recommended that all shafts and caverns less than 750 metres below the earth ’ s surface should be stabilised to prevent possible collapse .
focus reports that although spd leaders in lower saxony received an updated report highlighting safety concerns in 1998 , they chose to keep the warnings under wraps .
the extent of the safety problems at asse were made public last week , prompting environment minister sigmar gabriel to transfer responsibility of the facility from the munich-based helmholtz institute for scientific research to the federal office for radiation protection .
waste disposal ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : in the 1960s researchers thought salt mines were ideal for storing nuclear waste nuclear power is often touted as being clean and carbon-friendly , but opponents point out that no one has yet found a durable solution for storing nuclear waste , which remains highly radioactive for centuries .
asse was converted into an atomic waste storage facility in the 1960s as a pilot project linked to plans for a permanent facility at another former salt mine at gorleben , lower saxony .
but problems at asse raise questions about the feasibility of the gorleben site at a time when germany ’ s grand coalition government is split on whether or not to reverse plans to abandon all nuclear power by 2021 .
political fallout chancellor angela merkel 's conservative christian democratic union -lrb- cdu -rrb- , which supports continued use of nuclear power , is worried that asse will undermine its calls for a rethink of the planned phase-out .
in a radio interview on sunday , merkel said there needed to be decisions about what to do with highly radioactive material .
" we do also need to make progress in the storage of highly radioactive material .
it 's about atomic plants .
a moratorium has been agreed for gorleben and of course decisions must be made on how things go from here , " merkel told deutschlandfunk radio .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : environment minister gabriel has assumed control of asse in its latest issue , der spiegel magazine quoted a strategy paper in which conservative lawmaker katherine reiche demanded that environment minister gabriel immediately lift the moratorium on exploring options for storing atomic waste at gorleben .
the moratorium is the result of battles between supporters of nuclear power , who unsuccessfully tried to rush through gorleben 's commissioning in the 1970s , and a powerful lobby of opponents for whom the unresolved storage question buys time to discredit nuclear energy .
der spiegel reports that a search for alternatives elsewhere , which gabriel and the social democrats prefer , would cost at least one billion euros .

according to monday 's financial times germany -lrb- ftd -rrb- , the cdu leadership has prepared a keynote speech for its party conference in december in which east germany is described as the " germany 's second dictatorship " .
the document cited by the ftd stresses the lack of civil liberties in the german democratic republic .
it also stresses the desperate economic situation of the state at the time the wall came down .
the country was , according to the cdu paper , on the brink of " economic collapse " in 1989 . limbering up for the elections bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : its logo may be red , but that 's about the only thing the document , which is due to be discussed by the party executive over the next few days before being presented to december 's party conference , is intended to serve as the basis for the cdu 's electoral campaign in national elections in 2009 .
the cdu is searching for the right strategy to improve its support in eastern germany .
recent polls have put the conservatives and the left party neck-and-neck at 28 percent in the region .
the social democrats are trailing by several points .
the left has its main support base in the formerly communist eastern states but has also made strong inroads in western states in recent months .
in order to counter any tendencies to play down harmful aspects of the regime in the future , the cdu is also calling for more museums to be set up in former east german stasi -lrb- secret service -rrb- prisons and remaining border installations to be placed under preservation orders .
it also favors erecting freedom and unity monuments in leipzig , the center of opposition rallies against the gdr regime , and the german capital berlin . the cdu is also planning to use the speech to set out its differences from the social democrats , accusing the spd party leadership of attempting to block reunification .
recent years have seen a growing tendency in eastern germany - both culturally and socio-politically - towards " ostalgie , " a german expression made up of the words ost -lrb- east -rrb- and " nostalgia " . studies have also indicated an alarming lack of knowledge about the former communist regime among german schoolchildren . dw staff -lrb- jg -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

after two years of evaluation , experts warned that areas near the south-western edge of asse were unsafe .
their 1993 report found that up to 4,000 litres of water were flooding into the mine 's shafts each day .
it recommended that all shafts and caverns less than 750 metres below the earth ’ s surface should be stabilised to prevent possible collapse .
focus reports that although spd leaders in lower saxony received an updated report highlighting safety concerns in 1998 , they chose to keep the warnings under wraps .
the extent of the safety problems at asse were made public last week , prompting environment minister sigmar gabriel to transfer responsibility of the facility from the munich-based helmholtz institute for scientific research to the federal office for radiation protection .

bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : in the 1960s researchers thought salt mines were ideal for storing nuclear waste nuclear power is often touted as being clean and carbon-friendly , but opponents point out that no one has yet found a durable solution for storing nuclear waste , which remains highly radioactive for centuries .
asse was converted into an atomic waste storage facility in the 1960s as a pilot project linked to plans for a permanent facility at another former salt mine at gorleben , lower saxony .
but problems at asse raise questions about the feasibility of the gorleben site at a time when germany ’ s grand coalition government is split on whether or not to reverse plans to abandon all nuclear power by 2021 .
political fallout chancellor angela merkel 's conservative christian democratic union -lrb- cdu -rrb- , which supports continued use of nuclear power , is worried that asse will undermine its calls for a rethink of the planned phase-out .
in a radio interview on sunday , merkel said there needed to be decisions about what to do with highly radioactive material .
" we do also need to make progress in the storage of highly radioactive material .
it 's about atomic plants .
a moratorium has been agreed for gorleben and of course decisions must be made on how things go from here , " merkel told deutschlandfunk radio .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : environment minister gabriel has assumed control of asse in its latest issue , der spiegel magazine quoted a strategy paper in which conservative lawmaker katherine reiche demanded that environment minister gabriel immediately lift the moratorium on exploring options for storing atomic waste at gorleben .
the moratorium is the result of battles between supporters of nuclear power , who unsuccessfully tried to rush through gorleben 's commissioning in the 1970s , and a powerful lobby of opponents for whom the unresolved storage question buys time to discredit nuclear energy .
der spiegel reports that a search for alternatives elsewhere , which gabriel and the social democrats prefer , would cost at least one billion euros .

but forces will remain in the rebel regions of south ossetia and abkhazia . dmitry medvedev said russian forces would pull back to pre-conflict positions by october 1 , when replaced by 200 european monitors in the buffer zones around georgia 's breakaway regions of south ossetia and abkhazia .
under monday 's agreement , russia is also due to pull out in a week 's time from outstanding checkpoints between sinaki and the black sea port of poti , deep inside georgia .
" russia has obtained a guarantee from the european union and france which holds the eu presidency , on the non-use of force by the georgian side , " medvedev said at a joint press conference after meeting with eu negotiators .
nicolas sarkozy , whose country holds the rotating eu presidency , said he had given medvedev a letter from georgian president mikhail saakashvili , vowing to abstain from any use of force .
difficult negotiations still ahead both leaders said international peace talks would start october 15 in geneva .
but negotiations look set to be fraught .
despite the accord , moscow is refusing to reverse its recognition of the independence of georgia 's two separatist regions of south ossetia and abkhazia .
and medevev attacked georgia for its " hair-brained " assault on ossetia , which he said had been launched with the direct or tacit support of the united states .
" russia is fully complying with the settlement plan , but i ca n't say the same for the georgian side that is actively trying to re-establish its military positions , and the united states , unfortunately , is supporting this , " medvedev said .
bildunterschrift : monday also saw the first of three days of hearings brought by georgia against russia meanwhile , georgia was accusing russia before the un 's highest court in the hague of conducting a long-running campaign of " ethnic cleansing " in georgian territory . russia defended its actions before the international court of justice -lrb- icj -rrb- , saying a georgian assault on the rebel region of south ossetia last month left it no choice but to send in tanks and troops .
thaw between eu and russia ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hundreds are estimated to have been killed on both sides after talks with the russian president , sarkozy said negotiations on a new eu-russia partnership could resume " as early as october " if the measures were enforced .
the meetings had been originally scheduled for september , but were frozen until moscow pulls out of georgia .
" things are perfectly clear : we want partnership and we want peace , " said sarkozy .
his sentiments were chimed by the russian president .
" our country values the european efforts ... we do not want a deterioration of our relations , " medvedev told sarkozy , who was also accompanied by eu foreign policy envoy javier solana and european commission president jose manuel barroso .
in an exercise of shuttle diplomacy after russia and georgia refused to take part in direct talks , the three left for tbilisi to meet with georgian president saakashvili immediately after the talks .
the talks , launched in july , were aimed at agreeing a new framework for eu-russia ties .
the existing accord dates from 1997 , when russia was still suffering economically from the break-up of the soviet union . washington is sticking to a firm line , however , with us president george w. bush taking a long-awaited decision to postpone talks with russia on a nuclear agreement .
" the president intends to notify congress that he has today rescinded his prior determination regarding the us-russia agreement for peaceful nuclear cooperation , " a statement said .

but that is not the case .
the crisis which has supposedly been resolved by the very dubiously financed american real estate market has just reached a new hazard level .
banks have lost $ 500 billion -lrb- 350 billion euros -rrb- .
a whole array of finance companies are in financial disorder .
in the usa a number of banks have been closed and more will follow .
that is bad enough .
it would be much worse if the big mortgage financers fannie mae and freddie mac broke down , a fate which has so far been hindered only through massive intervention by finance minister henry paulson and the federal reserve .
state forced to intervene bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : karl zawadzky the ministry of finance and the federal reserve had no choice but to intervene due to one single reason : the collapse of fannie mae and freddie mac could have precipitated a core meltdown of the american bank and stock market systems , dragging the rest of the world with it into the abyss .
that is because these two banks are responsible for $ 5.3 billion -lrb- 3.7 billion euros -rrb- of america 's $ 12 billion -lrb- 8.4 billion euro -rrb- total mortgage debt .
that corresponds to one third of america 's gross domestic product .
besides that , pretty much all other banks have turned their backs on the mortgage market .
an economic crisis in the usa would have very quickly become a depression - and it would have had worldwide consequences .
in the end the government and the federal reserve felt compelled to act , since the two institutions play a central role on the mortgage market .
they are practically the reinsurance for the mortgage banks - they sell credit claims to the regional mortgage banks and , as the case may be , guarantee the claims and thus back them up .
crisis still looming yet there is no longer much new business , quite the opposite : more and more real estate companies are coming under foreclosure .
experts take it for granted that in this year more than one million americans will cut their debt service .
the risks with fannie mae and freddie mac are piling up .
in the case of a property crisis , this is the least favorable business model .
in addition , fannie mae and freddie mac trade under the names of private corporations , but cooperate closely with the state .
the state had to act as the confidence crisis was getting more and more out of hand .
after they already obtained federal reserve credit on advance conditions , the state took them completely under its wing and supplied them with fresh money .
the free-enterprise rules are being overridden , economic misconduct is going unpunished , and the state is stepping onto the scene as a savior .
after the profits are privatized in good times , the losses are socialized by the state .
the amount under fire , which is financed by selling bonds from investors , including governments and central banks from all over the world , is simply too big to let the two mortgage financers slip into bankruptcy .
that shows to what extent the fire is blazing over the rooftops of the global finance systems .

that is because these two banks are responsible for $ 5.3 billion -lrb- 3.7 billion euros -rrb- of america 's $ 12 billion -lrb- 8.4 billion euro -rrb- total mortgage debt .

in the case of a property crisis , this is the least favorable business model .
in addition , fannie mae and freddie mac trade under the names of private corporations , but cooperate closely with the state .
the state had to act as the confidence crisis was getting more and more out of hand .
after they already obtained federal reserve credit on advance conditions , the state took them completely under its wing and supplied them with fresh money .

but forces will remain in the rebel regions of south ossetia and abkhazia . dmitry medvedev said russian forces would pull back to pre-conflict positions by october 1 , when replaced by 200 european monitors in the buffer zones around georgia 's breakaway regions of south ossetia and abkhazia .
under monday 's agreement , russia is also due to pull out in a week 's time from outstanding checkpoints between sinaki and the black sea port of poti , deep inside georgia .
" russia has obtained a guarantee from the european union and france which holds the eu presidency , on the non-use of force by the georgian side , " medvedev said at a joint press conference after meeting with eu negotiators .
nicolas sarkozy , whose country holds the rotating eu presidency , said he had given medvedev a letter from georgian president mikhail saakashvili , vowing to abstain from any use of force .
difficult negotiations still ahead both leaders said international peace talks would start october 15 in geneva .
but negotiations look set to be fraught .
despite the accord , moscow is refusing to reverse its recognition of the independence of georgia 's two separatist regions of south ossetia and abkhazia .
and medevev attacked georgia for its " hair-brained " assault on ossetia , which he said had been launched with the direct or tacit support of the united states .
" russia is fully complying with the settlement plan , but i ca n't say the same for the georgian side that is actively trying to re-establish its military positions , and the united states , unfortunately , is supporting this , " medvedev said .
bildunterschrift : monday also saw the first of three days of hearings brought by georgia against russia meanwhile , georgia was accusing russia before the un 's highest court in the hague of conducting a long-running campaign of " ethnic cleansing " in georgian territory . russia defended its actions before the international court of justice -lrb- icj -rrb- , saying a georgian assault on the rebel region of south ossetia last month left it no choice but to send in tanks and troops .
thaw between eu and russia ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hundreds are estimated to have been killed on both sides after talks with the russian president , sarkozy said negotiations on a new eu-russia partnership could resume " as early as october " if the measures were enforced .
the meetings had been originally scheduled for september , but were frozen until moscow pulls out of georgia .
" things are perfectly clear : we want partnership and we want peace , " said sarkozy .
his sentiments were chimed by the russian president .
" our country values the european efforts ... we do not want a deterioration of our relations , " medvedev told sarkozy , who was also accompanied by eu foreign policy envoy javier solana and european commission president jose manuel barroso .
in an exercise of shuttle diplomacy after russia and georgia refused to take part in direct talks , the three left for tbilisi to meet with georgian president saakashvili immediately after the talks .
the talks , launched in july , were aimed at agreeing a new framework for eu-russia ties .
the existing accord dates from 1997 , when russia was still suffering economically from the break-up of the soviet union . washington is sticking to a firm line , however , with us president george w. bush taking a long-awaited decision to postpone talks with russia on a nuclear agreement .
" the president intends to notify congress that he has today rescinded his prior determination regarding the us-russia agreement for peaceful nuclear cooperation , " a statement said .

it would be much worse if the big mortgage financers fannie mae and freddie mac broke down , a fate which has so far been hindered only through massive intervention by finance minister henry paulson and the federal reserve .
state forced to intervene bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : karl zawadzky the ministry of finance and the federal reserve had no choice but to intervene due to one single reason : the collapse of fannie mae and freddie mac could have precipitated a core meltdown of the american bank and stock market systems , dragging the rest of the world with it into the abyss .
that is because these two banks are responsible for $ 5.3 billion -lrb- 3.7 billion euros -rrb- of america 's $ 12 billion -lrb- 8.4 billion euro -rrb- total mortgage debt .
that corresponds to one third of america 's gross domestic product .
besides that , pretty much all other banks have turned their backs on the mortgage market .
an economic crisis in the usa would have very quickly become a depression - and it would have had worldwide consequences .
in the end the government and the federal reserve felt compelled to act , since the two institutions play a central role on the mortgage market .
they are practically the reinsurance for the mortgage banks - they sell credit claims to the regional mortgage banks and , as the case may be , guarantee the claims and thus back them up .
crisis still looming yet there is no longer much new business , quite the opposite : more and more real estate companies are coming under foreclosure .
experts take it for granted that in this year more than one million americans will cut their debt service .
the risks with fannie mae and freddie mac are piling up .
in the case of a property crisis , this is the least favorable business model .
in addition , fannie mae and freddie mac trade under the names of private corporations , but cooperate closely with the state .
the state had to act as the confidence crisis was getting more and more out of hand .
after they already obtained federal reserve credit on advance conditions , the state took them completely under its wing and supplied them with fresh money .
the free-enterprise rules are being overridden , economic misconduct is going unpunished , and the state is stepping onto the scene as a savior .
after the profits are privatized in good times , the losses are socialized by the state .
the amount under fire , which is financed by selling bonds from investors , including governments and central banks from all over the world , is simply too big to let the two mortgage financers slip into bankruptcy .
that shows to what extent the fire is blazing over the rooftops of the global finance systems .
the danger of a finance system core meltdown may have been momentarily averted , but the bank crisis is still far from over . karl zawadzky is dw-radio 's business editor -lrb- ah -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

according to monday 's financial times germany -lrb- ftd -rrb- , the cdu leadership has prepared a keynote speech for its party conference in december in which east germany is described as the " germany 's second dictatorship " .
the document cited by the ftd stresses the lack of civil liberties in the german democratic republic .
it also stresses the desperate economic situation of the state at the time the wall came down .

the cdu is searching for the right strategy to improve its support in eastern germany .
recent polls have put the conservatives and the left party neck-and-neck at 28 percent in the region .
the social democrats are trailing by several points .
the left has its main support base in the formerly communist eastern states but has also made strong inroads in western states in recent months .
in order to counter any tendencies to play down harmful aspects of the regime in the future , the cdu is also calling for more museums to be set up in former east german stasi -lrb- secret service -rrb- prisons and remaining border installations to be placed under preservation orders .
it also favors erecting freedom and unity monuments in leipzig , the center of opposition rallies against the gdr regime , and the german capital berlin . the cdu is also planning to use the speech to set out its differences from the social democrats , accusing the spd party leadership of attempting to block reunification .

according to monday 's financial times germany -lrb- ftd -rrb- , the cdu leadership has prepared a keynote speech for its party conference in december in which east germany is described as the " germany 's second dictatorship " .
the document cited by the ftd stresses the lack of civil liberties in the german democratic republic .
it also stresses the desperate economic situation of the state at the time the wall came down .
the country was , according to the cdu paper , on the brink of " economic collapse " in 1989 . limbering up for the elections bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : its logo may be red , but that 's about the only thing the document , which is due to be discussed by the party executive over the next few days before being presented to december 's party conference , is intended to serve as the basis for the cdu 's electoral campaign in national elections in 2009 .
the cdu is searching for the right strategy to improve its support in eastern germany .
recent polls have put the conservatives and the left party neck-and-neck at 28 percent in the region .
the social democrats are trailing by several points .
the left has its main support base in the formerly communist eastern states but has also made strong inroads in western states in recent months .
in order to counter any tendencies to play down harmful aspects of the regime in the future , the cdu is also calling for more museums to be set up in former east german stasi -lrb- secret service -rrb- prisons and remaining border installations to be placed under preservation orders .
it also favors erecting freedom and unity monuments in leipzig , the center of opposition rallies against the gdr regime , and the german capital berlin . the cdu is also planning to use the speech to set out its differences from the social democrats , accusing the spd party leadership of attempting to block reunification .
recent years have seen a growing tendency in eastern germany - both culturally and socio-politically - towards " ostalgie , " a german expression made up of the words ost -lrb- east -rrb- and " nostalgia " . studies have also indicated an alarming lack of knowledge about the former communist regime among german schoolchildren . dw staff -lrb- jg -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de opinion -pipe- 08.09.2008 opinion : fannie mae and freddie mac bail-out is not the end großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the us government and federal reserve has saved mortgage companies freddie mac and fannie mae , which together lost $ 14 billion -lrb- 9.9 billion euros -rrb- , but dw 's karl zawadzky still thinks crisis is too close for comfort . the bosses of the big banks always want to make us believe that the financial crisis is leading towards its end and that the worldwide finance and banking system has come away again with a black eye .
but that is not the case .
the crisis which has supposedly been resolved by the very dubiously financed american real estate market has just reached a new hazard level .
banks have lost $ 500 billion -lrb- 350 billion euros -rrb- .
a whole array of finance companies are in financial disorder .
in the usa a number of banks have been closed and more will follow .
that is bad enough .
it would be much worse if the big mortgage financers fannie mae and freddie mac broke down , a fate which has so far been hindered only through massive intervention by finance minister henry paulson and the federal reserve .
state forced to intervene bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : karl zawadzky the ministry of finance and the federal reserve had no choice but to intervene due to one single reason : the collapse of fannie mae and freddie mac could have precipitated a core meltdown of the american bank and stock market systems , dragging the rest of the world with it into the abyss .
that is because these two banks are responsible for $ 5.3 billion -lrb- 3.7 billion euros -rrb- of america 's $ 12 billion -lrb- 8.4 billion euro -rrb- total mortgage debt .
that corresponds to one third of america 's gross domestic product .
besides that , pretty much all other banks have turned their backs on the mortgage market .
an economic crisis in the usa would have very quickly become a depression - and it would have had worldwide consequences .
in the end the government and the federal reserve felt compelled to act , since the two institutions play a central role on the mortgage market .
they are practically the reinsurance for the mortgage banks - they sell credit claims to the regional mortgage banks and , as the case may be , guarantee the claims and thus back them up .
crisis still looming yet there is no longer much new business , quite the opposite : more and more real estate companies are coming under foreclosure .
experts take it for granted that in this year more than one million americans will cut their debt service .
the risks with fannie mae and freddie mac are piling up .
in the case of a property crisis , this is the least favorable business model .
in addition , fannie mae and freddie mac trade under the names of private corporations , but cooperate closely with the state .
the state had to act as the confidence crisis was getting more and more out of hand .
after they already obtained federal reserve credit on advance conditions , the state took them completely under its wing and supplied them with fresh money .
the free-enterprise rules are being overridden , economic misconduct is going unpunished , and the state is stepping onto the scene as a savior .
after the profits are privatized in good times , the losses are socialized by the state .
the amount under fire , which is financed by selling bonds from investors , including governments and central banks from all over the world , is simply too big to let the two mortgage financers slip into bankruptcy .
that shows to what extent the fire is blazing over the rooftops of the global finance systems .
the danger of a finance system core meltdown may have been momentarily averted , but the bank crisis is still far from over . karl zawadzky is dw-radio 's business editor -lrb- ah -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

but that is not the case .
the crisis which has supposedly been resolved by the very dubiously financed american real estate market has just reached a new hazard level .
banks have lost $ 500 billion -lrb- 350 billion euros -rrb- .
a whole array of finance companies are in financial disorder .
in the usa a number of banks have been closed and more will follow .
that is bad enough .
it would be much worse if the big mortgage financers fannie mae and freddie mac broke down , a fate which has so far been hindered only through massive intervention by finance minister henry paulson and the federal reserve .
state forced to intervene bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : karl zawadzky the ministry of finance and the federal reserve had no choice but to intervene due to one single reason : the collapse of fannie mae and freddie mac could have precipitated a core meltdown of the american bank and stock market systems , dragging the rest of the world with it into the abyss .
that is because these two banks are responsible for $ 5.3 billion -lrb- 3.7 billion euros -rrb- of america 's $ 12 billion -lrb- 8.4 billion euro -rrb- total mortgage debt .
that corresponds to one third of america 's gross domestic product .
besides that , pretty much all other banks have turned their backs on the mortgage market .
an economic crisis in the usa would have very quickly become a depression - and it would have had worldwide consequences .
in the end the government and the federal reserve felt compelled to act , since the two institutions play a central role on the mortgage market .
they are practically the reinsurance for the mortgage banks - they sell credit claims to the regional mortgage banks and , as the case may be , guarantee the claims and thus back them up .
crisis still looming yet there is no longer much new business , quite the opposite : more and more real estate companies are coming under foreclosure .
experts take it for granted that in this year more than one million americans will cut their debt service .
the risks with fannie mae and freddie mac are piling up .
in the case of a property crisis , this is the least favorable business model .
in addition , fannie mae and freddie mac trade under the names of private corporations , but cooperate closely with the state .
the state had to act as the confidence crisis was getting more and more out of hand .
after they already obtained federal reserve credit on advance conditions , the state took them completely under its wing and supplied them with fresh money .
the free-enterprise rules are being overridden , economic misconduct is going unpunished , and the state is stepping onto the scene as a savior .
after the profits are privatized in good times , the losses are socialized by the state .
the amount under fire , which is financed by selling bonds from investors , including governments and central banks from all over the world , is simply too big to let the two mortgage financers slip into bankruptcy .
that shows to what extent the fire is blazing over the rooftops of the global finance systems .
the danger of a finance system core meltdown may have been momentarily averted , but the bank crisis is still far from over . karl zawadzky is dw-radio 's business editor -lrb- ah -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de opinion -pipe- 08.09.2008 opinion : fannie mae and freddie mac bail-out is not the end großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the us government and federal reserve has saved mortgage companies freddie mac and fannie mae , which together lost $ 14 billion -lrb- 9.9 billion euros -rrb- , but dw 's karl zawadzky still thinks crisis is too close for comfort . the bosses of the big banks always want to make us believe that the financial crisis is leading towards its end and that the worldwide finance and banking system has come away again with a black eye .
but that is not the case .
the crisis which has supposedly been resolved by the very dubiously financed american real estate market has just reached a new hazard level .
banks have lost $ 500 billion -lrb- 350 billion euros -rrb- .
a whole array of finance companies are in financial disorder .
in the usa a number of banks have been closed and more will follow .
that is bad enough .
it would be much worse if the big mortgage financers fannie mae and freddie mac broke down , a fate which has so far been hindered only through massive intervention by finance minister henry paulson and the federal reserve .
state forced to intervene bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : karl zawadzky the ministry of finance and the federal reserve had no choice but to intervene due to one single reason : the collapse of fannie mae and freddie mac could have precipitated a core meltdown of the american bank and stock market systems , dragging the rest of the world with it into the abyss .
that is because these two banks are responsible for $ 5.3 billion -lrb- 3.7 billion euros -rrb- of america 's $ 12 billion -lrb- 8.4 billion euro -rrb- total mortgage debt .
that corresponds to one third of america 's gross domestic product .
besides that , pretty much all other banks have turned their backs on the mortgage market .
an economic crisis in the usa would have very quickly become a depression - and it would have had worldwide consequences .
in the end the government and the federal reserve felt compelled to act , since the two institutions play a central role on the mortgage market .
they are practically the reinsurance for the mortgage banks - they sell credit claims to the regional mortgage banks and , as the case may be , guarantee the claims and thus back them up .
crisis still looming yet there is no longer much new business , quite the opposite : more and more real estate companies are coming under foreclosure .
experts take it for granted that in this year more than one million americans will cut their debt service .
the risks with fannie mae and freddie mac are piling up .
in the case of a property crisis , this is the least favorable business model .
in addition , fannie mae and freddie mac trade under the names of private corporations , but cooperate closely with the state .
the state had to act as the confidence crisis was getting more and more out of hand .
after they already obtained federal reserve credit on advance conditions , the state took them completely under its wing and supplied them with fresh money .
the free-enterprise rules are being overridden , economic misconduct is going unpunished , and the state is stepping onto the scene as a savior .
after the profits are privatized in good times , the losses are socialized by the state .
the amount under fire , which is financed by selling bonds from investors , including governments and central banks from all over the world , is simply too big to let the two mortgage financers slip into bankruptcy .
that shows to what extent the fire is blazing over the rooftops of the global finance systems .
the danger of a finance system core meltdown may have been momentarily averted , but the bank crisis is still far from over . karl zawadzky is dw-radio 's business editor -lrb- ah -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

according to monday 's financial times germany -lrb- ftd -rrb- , the cdu leadership has prepared a keynote speech for its party conference in december in which east germany is described as the " germany 's second dictatorship " .
the document cited by the ftd stresses the lack of civil liberties in the german democratic republic .

the cdu is searching for the right strategy to improve its support in eastern germany .
recent polls have put the conservatives and the left party neck-and-neck at 28 percent in the region .
the social democrats are trailing by several points .
the left has its main support base in the formerly communist eastern states but has also made strong inroads in western states in recent months .
in order to counter any tendencies to play down harmful aspects of the regime in the future , the cdu is also calling for more museums to be set up in former east german stasi -lrb- secret service -rrb- prisons and remaining border installations to be placed under preservation orders .
it also favors erecting freedom and unity monuments in leipzig , the center of opposition rallies against the gdr regime , and the german capital berlin . the cdu is also planning to use the speech to set out its differences from the social democrats , accusing the spd party leadership of attempting to block reunification .
recent years have seen a growing tendency in eastern germany - both culturally and socio-politically - towards " ostalgie , " a german expression made up of the words ost -lrb- east -rrb- and " nostalgia " . studies have also indicated an alarming lack of knowledge about the former communist regime among german schoolchildren . dw staff -lrb- jg -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the cdu is searching for the right strategy to improve its support in eastern germany .
recent polls have put the conservatives and the left party neck-and-neck at 28 percent in the region .
the social democrats are trailing by several points .
the left has its main support base in the formerly communist eastern states but has also made strong inroads in western states in recent months .
in order to counter any tendencies to play down harmful aspects of the regime in the future , the cdu is also calling for more museums to be set up in former east german stasi -lrb- secret service -rrb- prisons and remaining border installations to be placed under preservation orders .
it also favors erecting freedom and unity monuments in leipzig , the center of opposition rallies against the gdr regime , and the german capital berlin . the cdu is also planning to use the speech to set out its differences from the social democrats , accusing the spd party leadership of attempting to block reunification .
recent years have seen a growing tendency in eastern germany - both culturally and socio-politically - towards " ostalgie , " a german expression made up of the words ost -lrb- east -rrb- and " nostalgia " . studies have also indicated an alarming lack of knowledge about the former communist regime among german schoolchildren . dw staff -lrb- jg -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

after two years of evaluation , experts warned that areas near the south-western edge of asse were unsafe .
their 1993 report found that up to 4,000 litres of water were flooding into the mine 's shafts each day .
it recommended that all shafts and caverns less than 750 metres below the earth ’ s surface should be stabilised to prevent possible collapse .
focus reports that although spd leaders in lower saxony received an updated report highlighting safety concerns in 1998 , they chose to keep the warnings under wraps .
the extent of the safety problems at asse were made public last week , prompting environment minister sigmar gabriel to transfer responsibility of the facility from the munich-based helmholtz institute for scientific research to the federal office for radiation protection .

bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : in the 1960s researchers thought salt mines were ideal for storing nuclear waste nuclear power is often touted as being clean and carbon-friendly , but opponents point out that no one has yet found a durable solution for storing nuclear waste , which remains highly radioactive for centuries .
asse was converted into an atomic waste storage facility in the 1960s as a pilot project linked to plans for a permanent facility at another former salt mine at gorleben , lower saxony .
but problems at asse raise questions about the feasibility of the gorleben site at a time when germany ’ s grand coalition government is split on whether or not to reverse plans to abandon all nuclear power by 2021 .
political fallout chancellor angela merkel 's conservative christian democratic union -lrb- cdu -rrb- , which supports continued use of nuclear power , is worried that asse will undermine its calls for a rethink of the planned phase-out .
in a radio interview on sunday , merkel said there needed to be decisions about what to do with highly radioactive material .
" we do also need to make progress in the storage of highly radioactive material .
it 's about atomic plants .
a moratorium has been agreed for gorleben and of course decisions must be made on how things go from here , " merkel told deutschlandfunk radio .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : environment minister gabriel has assumed control of asse in its latest issue , der spiegel magazine quoted a strategy paper in which conservative lawmaker katherine reiche demanded that environment minister gabriel immediately lift the moratorium on exploring options for storing atomic waste at gorleben .
the moratorium is the result of battles between supporters of nuclear power , who unsuccessfully tried to rush through gorleben 's commissioning in the 1970s , and a powerful lobby of opponents for whom the unresolved storage question buys time to discredit nuclear energy .
der spiegel reports that a search for alternatives elsewhere , which gabriel and the social democrats prefer , would cost at least one billion euros .

after two years of evaluation , experts warned that areas near the south-western edge of asse were unsafe .
their 1993 report found that up to 4,000 litres of water were flooding into the mine 's shafts each day .
it recommended that all shafts and caverns less than 750 metres below the earth ’ s surface should be stabilised to prevent possible collapse .
focus reports that although spd leaders in lower saxony received an updated report highlighting safety concerns in 1998 , they chose to keep the warnings under wraps .
the extent of the safety problems at asse were made public last week , prompting environment minister sigmar gabriel to transfer responsibility of the facility from the munich-based helmholtz institute for scientific research to the federal office for radiation protection .
waste disposal ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : in the 1960s researchers thought salt mines were ideal for storing nuclear waste nuclear power is often touted as being clean and carbon-friendly , but opponents point out that no one has yet found a durable solution for storing nuclear waste , which remains highly radioactive for centuries .
asse was converted into an atomic waste storage facility in the 1960s as a pilot project linked to plans for a permanent facility at another former salt mine at gorleben , lower saxony .
but problems at asse raise questions about the feasibility of the gorleben site at a time when germany ’ s grand coalition government is split on whether or not to reverse plans to abandon all nuclear power by 2021 .
political fallout chancellor angela merkel 's conservative christian democratic union -lrb- cdu -rrb- , which supports continued use of nuclear power , is worried that asse will undermine its calls for a rethink of the planned phase-out .
in a radio interview on sunday , merkel said there needed to be decisions about what to do with highly radioactive material .
" we do also need to make progress in the storage of highly radioactive material .
it 's about atomic plants .
a moratorium has been agreed for gorleben and of course decisions must be made on how things go from here , " merkel told deutschlandfunk radio .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : environment minister gabriel has assumed control of asse in its latest issue , der spiegel magazine quoted a strategy paper in which conservative lawmaker katherine reiche demanded that environment minister gabriel immediately lift the moratorium on exploring options for storing atomic waste at gorleben .
the moratorium is the result of battles between supporters of nuclear power , who unsuccessfully tried to rush through gorleben 's commissioning in the 1970s , and a powerful lobby of opponents for whom the unresolved storage question buys time to discredit nuclear energy .
der spiegel reports that a search for alternatives elsewhere , which gabriel and the social democrats prefer , would cost at least one billion euros .
if plans for the waste storage facility at gorleben are given up completely , energy companies could make compensation demands worth billions of euros . dw staff -lrb- sje -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de politics -pipe- 08.09.2008 frank-walter steinmeier sets his sights on germany 's top job großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : steinmeier has never run for political office germany 's social democrats have picked foreign minister steinmeier to run against angela merkel in the 2009 elections .
dw-world.de takes a closer look at the man the spd is pinning its hopes on for the top job . for several years , frank walter steinmeier has consistently been among germany ’ s three most popular politicians , at times right at the top of the list or trailing slightly behind christian democrat chancellor angela merkel whom he will now strive to dethrone at the general election next year . the grey-haired 52-year-old 's nomination as candidate for chancellor did n't come as a real surprise .
but doubts persist about whether he can inspire on the campaign trail since steinmeier is an untested challenger - he has never run for public office steinmeier was born in the western german town of detmold .
he joined the spd in 1976 without ever becoming an entrenched party soldier .
a lawyer , steinmeier became gerhard schroeder ’ s chief of staff when the former chancellor was premier of the state of lower saxony . following gerhard schröder 's election as chancellor in 1998 , frank-walter steinmeier was appointed head of the chancellory and commissioner for the federal intelligence services . steinmeier was entrusted with responsibility for overall policy coordination within the federal government . he became one of schroeder 's closest advisors , coordinating the security services and shaping the agenda 2010 package of economic reforms - the unpopular centrepiece of the administration . since 2005 , he ’ s been the country ’ s foreign minister , serving chancellor angela merkel and often standing in her shadow , even in foreign policy matters .
this is why political analysts often refer to steinmeier as germany ’ s biggest number two who ’ s never had to lead a single election campaign . tough road ahead bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : steinmeier 's opponent and boss is the current chancellor , angela merkel however , steinmeier is certainly not without merits .
as foreign minister , he ’ s cut an excellent figure in operations to free german hostages in iraq , afghanistan and elsewhere .
he ’ s also played a pivotal role in keeping up the dialogue with iran over tehran ’ s nuclear arms program , as well as in fostering the process of european integration and enlargement . steinmeier has quite a challenge ahead of him .
he is soft spoken and often looks out of place in large crowds .
he tends to lean towards prepared statements rather than off the cuff remarks to the press .
many germans , including spd supporters , are worried that steinmeier won ’ t have the killer political instinct it will take to unseat angela merkel , who has become quite popular . the foreign minister does have a sense of authority about him , and when he speaks it ’ s difficult to argue with what he says .
as one observer told dw-radio however , it ’ s usually equally difficult to remember a single sentence the minister has uttered .
perhaps he ’ ll have something more memorable up his sleeve now that he ’ s the spd ’ s candidate for chancellor . so far , he ’ s steered clear of scoring political points by throwing mud at opponents or rivals , saying it is more important to tell people what you yourself stand for so that they can judge in which way you ’ re different .
whether this strategy will pay off during the 2009 general election remains to be seen . dw staff -lrb- mrm -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

but forces will remain in the rebel regions of south ossetia and abkhazia . dmitry medvedev said russian forces would pull back to pre-conflict positions by october 1 , when replaced by 200 european monitors in the buffer zones around georgia 's breakaway regions of south ossetia and abkhazia .
under monday 's agreement , russia is also due to pull out in a week 's time from outstanding checkpoints between sinaki and the black sea port of poti , deep inside georgia .
" russia has obtained a guarantee from the european union and france which holds the eu presidency , on the non-use of force by the georgian side , " medvedev said at a joint press conference after meeting with eu negotiators .
nicolas sarkozy , whose country holds the rotating eu presidency , said he had given medvedev a letter from georgian president mikhail saakashvili , vowing to abstain from any use of force .
difficult negotiations still ahead both leaders said international peace talks would start october 15 in geneva .
but negotiations look set to be fraught .
despite the accord , moscow is refusing to reverse its recognition of the independence of georgia 's two separatist regions of south ossetia and abkhazia .
and medevev attacked georgia for its " hair-brained " assault on ossetia , which he said had been launched with the direct or tacit support of the united states .
" russia is fully complying with the settlement plan , but i ca n't say the same for the georgian side that is actively trying to re-establish its military positions , and the united states , unfortunately , is supporting this , " medvedev said .
bildunterschrift : monday also saw the first of three days of hearings brought by georgia against russia meanwhile , georgia was accusing russia before the un 's highest court in the hague of conducting a long-running campaign of " ethnic cleansing " in georgian territory . russia defended its actions before the international court of justice -lrb- icj -rrb- , saying a georgian assault on the rebel region of south ossetia last month left it no choice but to send in tanks and troops .
thaw between eu and russia ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hundreds are estimated to have been killed on both sides after talks with the russian president , sarkozy said negotiations on a new eu-russia partnership could resume " as early as october " if the measures were enforced .
the meetings had been originally scheduled for september , but were frozen until moscow pulls out of georgia .
" things are perfectly clear : we want partnership and we want peace , " said sarkozy .
his sentiments were chimed by the russian president .
" our country values the european efforts ... we do not want a deterioration of our relations , " medvedev told sarkozy , who was also accompanied by eu foreign policy envoy javier solana and european commission president jose manuel barroso .
in an exercise of shuttle diplomacy after russia and georgia refused to take part in direct talks , the three left for tbilisi to meet with georgian president saakashvili immediately after the talks .
the talks , launched in july , were aimed at agreeing a new framework for eu-russia ties .
the existing accord dates from 1997 , when russia was still suffering economically from the break-up of the soviet union . washington is sticking to a firm line , however , with us president george w. bush taking a long-awaited decision to postpone talks with russia on a nuclear agreement .
" the president intends to notify congress that he has today rescinded his prior determination regarding the us-russia agreement for peaceful nuclear cooperation , " a statement said .

but forces will remain in the rebel regions of south ossetia and abkhazia . dmitry medvedev said russian forces would pull back to pre-conflict positions by october 1 , when replaced by 200 european monitors in the buffer zones around georgia 's breakaway regions of south ossetia and abkhazia .
under monday 's agreement , russia is also due to pull out in a week 's time from outstanding checkpoints between sinaki and the black sea port of poti , deep inside georgia .
" russia has obtained a guarantee from the european union and france which holds the eu presidency , on the non-use of force by the georgian side , " medvedev said at a joint press conference after meeting with eu negotiators .
nicolas sarkozy , whose country holds the rotating eu presidency , said he had given medvedev a letter from georgian president mikhail saakashvili , vowing to abstain from any use of force .
difficult negotiations still ahead both leaders said international peace talks would start october 15 in geneva .
but negotiations look set to be fraught .
despite the accord , moscow is refusing to reverse its recognition of the independence of georgia 's two separatist regions of south ossetia and abkhazia .
and medevev attacked georgia for its " hair-brained " assault on ossetia , which he said had been launched with the direct or tacit support of the united states .
" russia is fully complying with the settlement plan , but i ca n't say the same for the georgian side that is actively trying to re-establish its military positions , and the united states , unfortunately , is supporting this , " medvedev said .
bildunterschrift : monday also saw the first of three days of hearings brought by georgia against russia meanwhile , georgia was accusing russia before the un 's highest court in the hague of conducting a long-running campaign of " ethnic cleansing " in georgian territory . russia defended its actions before the international court of justice -lrb- icj -rrb- , saying a georgian assault on the rebel region of south ossetia last month left it no choice but to send in tanks and troops .
thaw between eu and russia ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hundreds are estimated to have been killed on both sides after talks with the russian president , sarkozy said negotiations on a new eu-russia partnership could resume " as early as october " if the measures were enforced .
the meetings had been originally scheduled for september , but were frozen until moscow pulls out of georgia .
" things are perfectly clear : we want partnership and we want peace , " said sarkozy .
his sentiments were chimed by the russian president .
" our country values the european efforts ... we do not want a deterioration of our relations , " medvedev told sarkozy , who was also accompanied by eu foreign policy envoy javier solana and european commission president jose manuel barroso .
in an exercise of shuttle diplomacy after russia and georgia refused to take part in direct talks , the three left for tbilisi to meet with georgian president saakashvili immediately after the talks .
the talks , launched in july , were aimed at agreeing a new framework for eu-russia ties .
the existing accord dates from 1997 , when russia was still suffering economically from the break-up of the soviet union . washington is sticking to a firm line , however , with us president george w. bush taking a long-awaited decision to postpone talks with russia on a nuclear agreement .
" the president intends to notify congress that he has today rescinded his prior determination regarding the us-russia agreement for peaceful nuclear cooperation , " a statement said .
russian troops entered georgia on august 8 to push back georgian forces attempting to regain control of south ossetia , the moscow-backed region that broke away from tbilisi in the early 1990s . dw staff -lrb- jg -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de politics -pipe- 08.09.2008 frank-walter steinmeier sets his sights on germany 's top job großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : steinmeier has never run for political office germany 's social democrats have picked foreign minister steinmeier to run against angela merkel in the 2009 elections .
dw-world.de takes a closer look at the man the spd is pinning its hopes on for the top job . for several years , frank walter steinmeier has consistently been among germany ’ s three most popular politicians , at times right at the top of the list or trailing slightly behind christian democrat chancellor angela merkel whom he will now strive to dethrone at the general election next year . the grey-haired 52-year-old 's nomination as candidate for chancellor did n't come as a real surprise .
but doubts persist about whether he can inspire on the campaign trail since steinmeier is an untested challenger - he has never run for public office steinmeier was born in the western german town of detmold .
he joined the spd in 1976 without ever becoming an entrenched party soldier .
a lawyer , steinmeier became gerhard schroeder ’ s chief of staff when the former chancellor was premier of the state of lower saxony . following gerhard schröder 's election as chancellor in 1998 , frank-walter steinmeier was appointed head of the chancellory and commissioner for the federal intelligence services . steinmeier was entrusted with responsibility for overall policy coordination within the federal government . he became one of schroeder 's closest advisors , coordinating the security services and shaping the agenda 2010 package of economic reforms - the unpopular centrepiece of the administration . since 2005 , he ’ s been the country ’ s foreign minister , serving chancellor angela merkel and often standing in her shadow , even in foreign policy matters .
this is why political analysts often refer to steinmeier as germany ’ s biggest number two who ’ s never had to lead a single election campaign . tough road ahead bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : steinmeier 's opponent and boss is the current chancellor , angela merkel however , steinmeier is certainly not without merits .
as foreign minister , he ’ s cut an excellent figure in operations to free german hostages in iraq , afghanistan and elsewhere .

there is already a un mission in abkhazia and the organisation for security and cooperation in europe -lrb- osce -rrb- is trying to set up observers in and around south ossetia , the spark for the start of the fighting . a spokesman for the french presidency told news agency afp that sarkozy also wants " precise dates , mechanisms and commitments " for a russian military withdrawal from georgian territory outside of the breakaway regions . russia claims it has withdrawn from georgia in line with the ceasefire accord , but france believes there are about 1,000 troops in georgia around south ossetia and abkhazia , officials said . sarkozy 's third priority is to obtain a date for international talks on the future of south ossetia and abkhazia , which russia has recognized as independent states , angering the west .
so far russia has been immune to international pressure over the war with georgia , and it showed little concern after the eu summit decided to suspend talks with moscow on a new partnership accord . hope for progress bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the german chancellor is optimistic about the trip chancellor angela merkel told a german radio station she is optimistic that sarkozy will make progress during his discussions with medvedev .
merkel said she was heartened by russia ’ s response to the eu agreement last week which avoided imposing sanctions on moscow . “ i see grounds for hope , as the -lrb- russian -rrb- prime minister and the president welcomed the eu 's decisions , " merkel added . in the interview she also reiterated her view that russia had reacted disproportionately to georgia 's actions in south ossetia and that russia 's recognition as independent states of south ossetia and abkhazia did not comply with international law . " that will be fodder for future meetings but it does n't mean we can not continue to work together in other areas , " she said .
" we in the eu want to further contacts -lrb- with russia -rrb- .
but it can not be that the six-point plan which we have developed together is not fulfilled . " german minister calls for international probe meanwhile , german foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier has called on the united nations or the organization for security and cooperation in europe -lrb- osce -rrb- to open an investigation into the conflict . in an interview with the german daily hannoverschen allgemeinen zeitung last week , steinmeier said both russia and georgia needed to be open to an independent investigation . " i see no lack of institutions , for example in the framework of the un or the osce that could run the probe , he said .
" but until now , there has above all been unwillingness on both sides to take part in such an investigation , " steinmeier said . steinmeier added that he believes it is in the best interest of both sides that they cooperate with any investigation .
he warned however , that determining who was responsible isn ’ t something that can happen overnight . dw staff -lrb- mrm -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

11 attacks have provided fertile ground for conspiracy theories italian film-maker giulietto chiesa , who was in berlin for a screening of his documentary which questions the official us version of the 9/11 terrorist attacks , has called for an international tribunal to probe events . chiesa was in berlin at the weekend for a screening of his film which features , among others , novelist gore vidal and playwright dario fo as well as retired american professor of philosophy david ray griffin who advances conspiracy theories that contradict mainstream accounts of events of 11 september , 2001 .
federal aviation administration controllers , us air force pilots , military commanders and physicists also appear in the critical documentary , which the director hopes will create " political awareness " of the " faulty " official investigation into the events by the 9/11 commission .
" some of the individuals appearing in the film are former fbi and cia agents , people who have in a sense taken a very big risk in speaking out .
i am very grateful to them because they have done a big job , " said chiesa .
" the film would not have been possible without them , " he said , adding that zero had been seen in france and belgium at individual screenings , and by more than 20,000 people in italy .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de georgia -pipe- 08.09.2008 eu brokers pull-out agreement with russia over georgia großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the eu-russia talks appear to have made important headway russia 's president agreed to pull his troops out of georgia and allow the deployment of european monitors after meeting with eu diplomats .
but forces will remain in the rebel regions of south ossetia and abkhazia . dmitry medvedev said russian forces would pull back to pre-conflict positions by october 1 , when replaced by 200 european monitors in the buffer zones around georgia 's breakaway regions of south ossetia and abkhazia .
under monday 's agreement , russia is also due to pull out in a week 's time from outstanding checkpoints between sinaki and the black sea port of poti , deep inside georgia .
" russia has obtained a guarantee from the european union and france which holds the eu presidency , on the non-use of force by the georgian side , " medvedev said at a joint press conference after meeting with eu negotiators .
nicolas sarkozy , whose country holds the rotating eu presidency , said he had given medvedev a letter from georgian president mikhail saakashvili , vowing to abstain from any use of force .
difficult negotiations still ahead both leaders said international peace talks would start october 15 in geneva .
but negotiations look set to be fraught .
despite the accord , moscow is refusing to reverse its recognition of the independence of georgia 's two separatist regions of south ossetia and abkhazia .
and medevev attacked georgia for its " hair-brained " assault on ossetia , which he said had been launched with the direct or tacit support of the united states .
" russia is fully complying with the settlement plan , but i ca n't say the same for the georgian side that is actively trying to re-establish its military positions , and the united states , unfortunately , is supporting this , " medvedev said .
bildunterschrift : monday also saw the first of three days of hearings brought by georgia against russia meanwhile , georgia was accusing russia before the un 's highest court in the hague of conducting a long-running campaign of " ethnic cleansing " in georgian territory . russia defended its actions before the international court of justice -lrb- icj -rrb- , saying a georgian assault on the rebel region of south ossetia last month left it no choice but to send in tanks and troops .
thaw between eu and russia ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hundreds are estimated to have been killed on both sides after talks with the russian president , sarkozy said negotiations on a new eu-russia partnership could resume " as early as october " if the measures were enforced .
the meetings had been originally scheduled for september , but were frozen until moscow pulls out of georgia .
" things are perfectly clear : we want partnership and we want peace , " said sarkozy .
his sentiments were chimed by the russian president .
" our country values the european efforts ... we do not want a deterioration of our relations , " medvedev told sarkozy , who was also accompanied by eu foreign policy envoy javier solana and european commission president jose manuel barroso .
in an exercise of shuttle diplomacy after russia and georgia refused to take part in direct talks , the three left for tbilisi to meet with georgian president saakashvili immediately after the talks .
the talks , launched in july , were aimed at agreeing a new framework for eu-russia ties .
the existing accord dates from 1997 , when russia was still suffering economically from the break-up of the soviet union . washington is sticking to a firm line , however , with us president george w. bush taking a long-awaited decision to postpone talks with russia on a nuclear agreement .
" the president intends to notify congress that he has today rescinded his prior determination regarding the us-russia agreement for peaceful nuclear cooperation , " a statement said .
russian troops entered georgia on august 8 to push back georgian forces attempting to regain control of south ossetia , the moscow-backed region that broke away from tbilisi in the early 1990s . dw staff -lrb- jg -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

11 attacks have provided fertile ground for conspiracy theories italian film-maker giulietto chiesa , who was in berlin for a screening of his documentary which questions the official us version of the 9/11 terrorist attacks , has called for an international tribunal to probe events . chiesa was in berlin at the weekend for a screening of his film which features , among others , novelist gore vidal and playwright dario fo as well as retired american professor of philosophy david ray griffin who advances conspiracy theories that contradict mainstream accounts of events of 11 september , 2001 .
federal aviation administration controllers , us air force pilots , military commanders and physicists also appear in the critical documentary , which the director hopes will create " political awareness " of the " faulty " official investigation into the events by the 9/11 commission .
" some of the individuals appearing in the film are former fbi and cia agents , people who have in a sense taken a very big risk in speaking out .
i am very grateful to them because they have done a big job , " said chiesa .
" the film would not have been possible without them , " he said , adding that zero had been seen in france and belgium at individual screenings , and by more than 20,000 people in italy .
but the film so far has not gained a distributor in europe .
pushing for an international tribunal chiesa , one of italy 's most respected journalists and a la stampa foreign correspondent for more than 20 years , told his berlin audience an 9/11 international tribunal could serve a useful purpose .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : alternative theories abound about what actually happened at the site of the twin towers " if feelings were strong enough a positive result could be obtained , but it would not happen immediately .
so far it 's been the us administration that has won the information fight and obtained their result - unfortunately , " chiesa said . " our task is to inform millions of people of the true situation .
everybody should be involved in this struggle with a tribunal or commission helping once we win approval for the idea , " he said .
in an interview with german news agency dpa , chiesa , a european parliamentary deputy , said russian television is to give prime time airing to his film on the eve of this week 's seventh anniversary of the attacks in new york and washington .
" that means that some 30 million russian citizens will learn the truth about what happened , which is a very big result for me . "
chiesa , whose documentary was first screened to a large german audience at the goethe institute in munich in may , was clearly delighted at his reception in berlin .
" it 's important that so many people have shown up , " he said .
one of a panel of six experts debating the 9/11 topic in berlin , chiesa said he was eager for his film to gain more public support and become a " multiplicator " across germany .
" if that happens it means we are making politics in the right sense of the word . "
critics question government version of attacks andreas von buelow , a controversial former german minister of technology , and ex-state secretary in the defense ministry , was among the berlin participants who said further investigation was needed into 9/11 .
he told dpa it was " one of life 's characteristics that governments are prone to lie in order to achieve their agendas .
the americans told us that in iraq , saddam hussein had something to do with al-qaeda , which was absolutely untrue .
even the cia knew this , " he said .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some say the us invasion of iraq on a false pretext is proof of government lies of international events " then , they told us that saddam hussein was preparing weapons of mass destruction , which was also untrue , so they have been lying all over the place and are still fighting there .
meanwhile a million people have been killed . "
asked if there was any prospect of a policy change once the next us president was elected , he replied bluntly " no ! "
juergen elsaesser , 51 , a berlin-based journalist and author whose latest book is titled " terror target europe : the dangerous double game of the secret services , " spoke of the huge contradictions in the official us version of the 9/11 events .
" critics find themselves accused of conspiracy theories , but the biggest conspiracy is to be found in the official 9/11 version of the us government which maintains that osama bin laden , from a cave in afghanistan , along with 19 young arabs , combined to carry out the most perfidious attack in the history of mankind , " he said .
" that just does n't add up .
for me the most important contradiction is how the air defences of the greatest military power on the planet failed to prevent such attacks occurring and that no interceptor fighter planes or rocket systems were ever activated .

8 it would seek a wage increase of between seven and eight percent for 3.6 million workers in the key sector , its highest demand in 16 years . ig metall boss berthold huber told journalists in frankfurt discussions with shop stewards were continuing and that the final demand should become clear in a fortnight .
he based the demand , which is well above german consumer inflation of around 3.3 per cent on the year , on price increases , increased productivity and strong profits in the sector , which is a major component of germany 's highly successful export machine .
huber highlighted another key concern in germany ; soaring executive pay , saying there was a need for social justice to be taken into account .
german trade unionists have long argued that while workers showed restraint through a long economic slowdown at the beginning of the decade , they have not seen any rewards for the upswing over the past two years .
the european central bank -lrb- ecb -rrb- has maintained a strong anti-inflationary stance , despite indications of a slowdown in the european economy in general and in its largest economy , germany , in particular .
ecb president jean-claude trichet has warned repeatedly of " second-round inflationary effects " following on from the higher commodity prices that have driven up the cost of fuels and food in recent months , warning against high wage demands . dpa news agency -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de asia -pipe- 08.09.2008 chinese fm visits india amid nuclear row großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : china 's foreign minister yang jiechi is on a three day visit to india chinese foreign minister yang jiechi ’ s visit comes amid fresh tensions in bilateral relations between the two neighbours .
china ’ s insistence on adherence to the nuclear non-proliferation mechanism at the meeting of nuclear suppliers group , which adopted a resolution on civil nuclear cooperation with india at the weekend , has been criticised widely by indian officials . in a historic decision at the weekend , the nuclear suppliers group lifted a 34-year old ban on nuclear trade with india , a country which has not signed the non-proliferation treaty .
the move will now enable energy-hungry new delhi to buy nuclear fuel , technology and reactors and is vital for its civilian nuclear deal with the us .
india was able to win the support of the 45 nation body only after it gave an assurance that it will stand by nuclear non-proliferation commitments and uphold a moratorium on testing atomic weapons .
however critics fear the nsg ’ s approval sets a precedent allowing other nations to follow the suit .
china ’ s concerns one of the countries , which voiced its concerns at the nsg meeting in vienna , was china .
in a statement , cheng jingye , head of the chinese delegation at vienna , pointed out that beijing hoped that the decision made by the group would ‘ contribute to the goals of nuclear non-proliferation and peaceful use of nuclear power ’ .
the remarks have sparked disappointment among indian experts and officials , who say beijing had repeatedly assured india that it would not oppose a consensus on new delhi ’ s inclusion in the nsg .
sujit dutta , an expert on chinese affairs at the institute of defence studies and analysis in new delhi , finds beijing ’ s stance surprising . “ when indian pm singh met wen jiabao earlier this year , the chinese said they understood india ’ s energy requirements .
they would not obstruct the deal .
so what is this new position , why didn ’ t they mention this so-called non-proliferation earlier ? ”
n-deal for pakistan ?
in a bid to soothe ties , chinese foreign ministry spokesperson jiang yu on monday said beijing welcomed the lifting of a nuclear embargo on india .
but she said that china 's stance is that that all nations are entitled to use nuclear energy peacefully .
though it is not clear what china means by " all nations " , experts in india believe beijing is seeking agreement with pakistan now , which is beijing ’ s key ally and is aspiring to use nuclear energy .
expert sujit dutta explains : “ only three countries are outside npt : india , pakistan and israel .
since israel is not asking for it , so china is actually lobbying for pakistan . ”
economic ties between new delhi and beijing have improved in recent years .
their bilateral trade currently accounts for more than 38 billion dollars and the two sides have agreed to double it by 2010 .
existing mistrust however the mistrust , which was created between the two sides after a bitter border conflict in 1962 , persists . dietmar rothermund is a professor of south asian history at the university of heidelberg in germany : “ india is concerned that china has been doing a lot for pakistan , whose nuclear programme is supported by china .
moreover china ’ s interest on the indian ocean has been seen in india with some degree of nervousness and tension . ”
however he doesn ’ t believe that the two countries will resort to confrontation to resolve their differences : “ both countries are big and have their own problems and are not really keen on disputes with each other . ”
the chinese foreign minister yang jiechi is currently on a three day visit to india to boost bilateral ties . one of the key issues at the discussions will be the disputed 4,000-kilometre border , which is claimed by both sides .
both sides have so far held at least 11 rounds of talks over the boundary issue , which however have failed to produce any breakthrough . dw staff 08/09/08 send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic 9799 media center watch and listen explore new content daily in dw 's multimedia archive .

china ’ s insistence on adherence to the nuclear non-proliferation mechanism at the meeting of nuclear suppliers group , which adopted a resolution on civil nuclear cooperation with india at the weekend , has been criticised widely by indian officials . in a historic decision at the weekend , the nuclear suppliers group lifted a 34-year old ban on nuclear trade with india , a country which has not signed the non-proliferation treaty .
the move will now enable energy-hungry new delhi to buy nuclear fuel , technology and reactors and is vital for its civilian nuclear deal with the us .
india was able to win the support of the 45 nation body only after it gave an assurance that it will stand by nuclear non-proliferation commitments and uphold a moratorium on testing atomic weapons .
however critics fear the nsg ’ s approval sets a precedent allowing other nations to follow the suit .
china ’ s concerns one of the countries , which voiced its concerns at the nsg meeting in vienna , was china .
in a statement , cheng jingye , head of the chinese delegation at vienna , pointed out that beijing hoped that the decision made by the group would ‘ contribute to the goals of nuclear non-proliferation and peaceful use of nuclear power ’ .
the remarks have sparked disappointment among indian experts and officials , who say beijing had repeatedly assured india that it would not oppose a consensus on new delhi ’ s inclusion in the nsg .
sujit dutta , an expert on chinese affairs at the institute of defence studies and analysis in new delhi , finds beijing ’ s stance surprising . “ when indian pm singh met wen jiabao earlier this year , the chinese said they understood india ’ s energy requirements .
they would not obstruct the deal .
so what is this new position , why didn ’ t they mention this so-called non-proliferation earlier ? ”
n-deal for pakistan ?
in a bid to soothe ties , chinese foreign ministry spokesperson jiang yu on monday said beijing welcomed the lifting of a nuclear embargo on india .
but she said that china 's stance is that that all nations are entitled to use nuclear energy peacefully .
though it is not clear what china means by " all nations " , experts in india believe beijing is seeking agreement with pakistan now , which is beijing ’ s key ally and is aspiring to use nuclear energy .
expert sujit dutta explains : “ only three countries are outside npt : india , pakistan and israel .
since israel is not asking for it , so china is actually lobbying for pakistan . ”
economic ties between new delhi and beijing have improved in recent years .
their bilateral trade currently accounts for more than 38 billion dollars and the two sides have agreed to double it by 2010 .
existing mistrust however the mistrust , which was created between the two sides after a bitter border conflict in 1962 , persists . dietmar rothermund is a professor of south asian history at the university of heidelberg in germany : “ india is concerned that china has been doing a lot for pakistan , whose nuclear programme is supported by china .
moreover china ’ s interest on the indian ocean has been seen in india with some degree of nervousness and tension . ”
however he doesn ’ t believe that the two countries will resort to confrontation to resolve their differences : “ both countries are big and have their own problems and are not really keen on disputes with each other . ”
the chinese foreign minister yang jiechi is currently on a three day visit to india to boost bilateral ties . one of the key issues at the discussions will be the disputed 4,000-kilometre border , which is claimed by both sides .
both sides have so far held at least 11 rounds of talks over the boundary issue , which however have failed to produce any breakthrough . dw staff 08/09/08 send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic 9798 threatened communities preserving tribal communities and their habitats can help sustain the environment .

according to monday 's financial times germany -lrb- ftd -rrb- , the cdu leadership has prepared a keynote speech for its party conference in december in which east germany is described as the " germany 's second dictatorship " .
the document cited by the ftd stresses the lack of civil liberties in the german democratic republic .
it also stresses the desperate economic situation of the state at the time the wall came down .
the country was , according to the cdu paper , on the brink of " economic collapse " in 1989 . limbering up for the elections bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : its logo may be red , but that 's about the only thing the document , which is due to be discussed by the party executive over the next few days before being presented to december 's party conference , is intended to serve as the basis for the cdu 's electoral campaign in national elections in 2009 .
the cdu is searching for the right strategy to improve its support in eastern germany .
recent polls have put the conservatives and the left party neck-and-neck at 28 percent in the region .
the social democrats are trailing by several points .
the left has its main support base in the formerly communist eastern states but has also made strong inroads in western states in recent months .
in order to counter any tendencies to play down harmful aspects of the regime in the future , the cdu is also calling for more museums to be set up in former east german stasi -lrb- secret service -rrb- prisons and remaining border installations to be placed under preservation orders .
it also favors erecting freedom and unity monuments in leipzig , the center of opposition rallies against the gdr regime , and the german capital berlin . the cdu is also planning to use the speech to set out its differences from the social democrats , accusing the spd party leadership of attempting to block reunification .
recent years have seen a growing tendency in eastern germany - both culturally and socio-politically - towards " ostalgie , " a german expression made up of the words ost -lrb- east -rrb- and " nostalgia " . studies have also indicated an alarming lack of knowledge about the former communist regime among german schoolchildren . dw staff -lrb- jg -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

dw-world.de takes a closer look at the man the spd is pinning its hopes on for the top job . for several years , frank walter steinmeier has consistently been among germany ’ s three most popular politicians , at times right at the top of the list or trailing slightly behind christian democrat chancellor angela merkel whom he will now strive to dethrone at the general election next year . the grey-haired 52-year-old 's nomination as candidate for chancellor did n't come as a real surprise .
but doubts persist about whether he can inspire on the campaign trail since steinmeier is an untested challenger - he has never run for public office steinmeier was born in the western german town of detmold .
he joined the spd in 1976 without ever becoming an entrenched party soldier .
a lawyer , steinmeier became gerhard schroeder ’ s chief of staff when the former chancellor was premier of the state of lower saxony . following gerhard schröder 's election as chancellor in 1998 , frank-walter steinmeier was appointed head of the chancellory and commissioner for the federal intelligence services . steinmeier was entrusted with responsibility for overall policy coordination within the federal government . he became one of schroeder 's closest advisors , coordinating the security services and shaping the agenda 2010 package of economic reforms - the unpopular centrepiece of the administration . since 2005 , he ’ s been the country ’ s foreign minister , serving chancellor angela merkel and often standing in her shadow , even in foreign policy matters .
this is why political analysts often refer to steinmeier as germany ’ s biggest number two who ’ s never had to lead a single election campaign . tough road ahead bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : steinmeier 's opponent and boss is the current chancellor , angela merkel however , steinmeier is certainly not without merits .
as foreign minister , he ’ s cut an excellent figure in operations to free german hostages in iraq , afghanistan and elsewhere .
he ’ s also played a pivotal role in keeping up the dialogue with iran over tehran ’ s nuclear arms program , as well as in fostering the process of european integration and enlargement . steinmeier has quite a challenge ahead of him .
he is soft spoken and often looks out of place in large crowds .
he tends to lean towards prepared statements rather than off the cuff remarks to the press .
many germans , including spd supporters , are worried that steinmeier won ’ t have the killer political instinct it will take to unseat angela merkel , who has become quite popular . the foreign minister does have a sense of authority about him , and when he speaks it ’ s difficult to argue with what he says .
as one observer told dw-radio however , it ’ s usually equally difficult to remember a single sentence the minister has uttered .
perhaps he ’ ll have something more memorable up his sleeve now that he ’ s the spd ’ s candidate for chancellor . so far , he ’ s steered clear of scoring political points by throwing mud at opponents or rivals , saying it is more important to tell people what you yourself stand for so that they can judge in which way you ’ re different .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de opinion -pipe- 08.09.2008 opinion : fannie mae and freddie mac bail-out is not the end großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the us government and federal reserve has saved mortgage companies freddie mac and fannie mae , which together lost $ 14 billion -lrb- 9.9 billion euros -rrb- , but dw 's karl zawadzky still thinks crisis is too close for comfort . the bosses of the big banks always want to make us believe that the financial crisis is leading towards its end and that the worldwide finance and banking system has come away again with a black eye .
but that is not the case .
the crisis which has supposedly been resolved by the very dubiously financed american real estate market has just reached a new hazard level .
banks have lost $ 500 billion -lrb- 350 billion euros -rrb- .
a whole array of finance companies are in financial disorder .
in the usa a number of banks have been closed and more will follow .
that is bad enough .
it would be much worse if the big mortgage financers fannie mae and freddie mac broke down , a fate which has so far been hindered only through massive intervention by finance minister henry paulson and the federal reserve .
state forced to intervene bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : karl zawadzky the ministry of finance and the federal reserve had no choice but to intervene due to one single reason : the collapse of fannie mae and freddie mac could have precipitated a core meltdown of the american bank and stock market systems , dragging the rest of the world with it into the abyss .
that is because these two banks are responsible for $ 5.3 billion -lrb- 3.7 billion euros -rrb- of america 's $ 12 billion -lrb- 8.4 billion euro -rrb- total mortgage debt .
that corresponds to one third of america 's gross domestic product .
besides that , pretty much all other banks have turned their backs on the mortgage market .
an economic crisis in the usa would have very quickly become a depression - and it would have had worldwide consequences .
in the end the government and the federal reserve felt compelled to act , since the two institutions play a central role on the mortgage market .
they are practically the reinsurance for the mortgage banks - they sell credit claims to the regional mortgage banks and , as the case may be , guarantee the claims and thus back them up .
crisis still looming yet there is no longer much new business , quite the opposite : more and more real estate companies are coming under foreclosure .
experts take it for granted that in this year more than one million americans will cut their debt service .
the risks with fannie mae and freddie mac are piling up .
in the case of a property crisis , this is the least favorable business model .
in addition , fannie mae and freddie mac trade under the names of private corporations , but cooperate closely with the state .
the state had to act as the confidence crisis was getting more and more out of hand .
after they already obtained federal reserve credit on advance conditions , the state took them completely under its wing and supplied them with fresh money .
the free-enterprise rules are being overridden , economic misconduct is going unpunished , and the state is stepping onto the scene as a savior .
after the profits are privatized in good times , the losses are socialized by the state .
the amount under fire , which is financed by selling bonds from investors , including governments and central banks from all over the world , is simply too big to let the two mortgage financers slip into bankruptcy .
that shows to what extent the fire is blazing over the rooftops of the global finance systems .
the danger of a finance system core meltdown may have been momentarily averted , but the bank crisis is still far from over . karl zawadzky is dw-radio 's business editor -lrb- ah -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

in addition , the new bank aimed to realize synergies worth 5 billion euros , he said .

on friday aug .
29 , the last day of trading before the widely anticipated announcement , commerzbank had traded in a range around 20 euros .
the new bank , which aims to challenge the dominance in germany of deutsche bank through its widespread branch network , aims to shed some 9,000 of its staff complement of 67,000 full-time employees .
regarding the reported interest shown in dresdner bank by the state-owned china development bank , blessing told the weekly : " if there had been a game of bluff over the price with a bank backed by the chinese state , we would not have had a chance . "
a new banking force he said there would be substantial cuts at the london-based dresdner investment banking unit dresdner kleinwort , but refused to be drawn on a potential purchaser for the subsidiary , which has been hit by the us subprime crisis .

with total assets of about 1.09 trillion euros and 11 million german customers , a merged commerzbank-dresdner will result in the emergence of new banking force in europe 's biggest economy .
deutsche bank , which failed in a bid to merge with dresdner eight years ago , remains the largest bank in germany with assets totaling about 2 trillion euros . munich-based allianz , europe 's biggest insurer , is to retain a stake of about 30 percent in the new banking group and to take over risks totaling 975 million euros which are linked to the global financial crisis and credit crunch .

according to monday 's financial times germany -lrb- ftd -rrb- , the cdu leadership has prepared a keynote speech for its party conference in december in which east germany is described as the " germany 's second dictatorship " .
the document cited by the ftd stresses the lack of civil liberties in the german democratic republic .
it also stresses the desperate economic situation of the state at the time the wall came down .
the country was , according to the cdu paper , on the brink of " economic collapse " in 1989 . limbering up for the elections bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : its logo may be red , but that 's about the only thing the document , which is due to be discussed by the party executive over the next few days before being presented to december 's party conference , is intended to serve as the basis for the cdu 's electoral campaign in national elections in 2009 .
the cdu is searching for the right strategy to improve its support in eastern germany .
recent polls have put the conservatives and the left party neck-and-neck at 28 percent in the region .
the social democrats are trailing by several points .
the left has its main support base in the formerly communist eastern states but has also made strong inroads in western states in recent months .
in order to counter any tendencies to play down harmful aspects of the regime in the future , the cdu is also calling for more museums to be set up in former east german stasi -lrb- secret service -rrb- prisons and remaining border installations to be placed under preservation orders .
it also favors erecting freedom and unity monuments in leipzig , the center of opposition rallies against the gdr regime , and the german capital berlin . the cdu is also planning to use the speech to set out its differences from the social democrats , accusing the spd party leadership of attempting to block reunification .
recent years have seen a growing tendency in eastern germany - both culturally and socio-politically - towards " ostalgie , " a german expression made up of the words ost -lrb- east -rrb- and " nostalgia " . studies have also indicated an alarming lack of knowledge about the former communist regime among german schoolchildren . dw staff -lrb- jg -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

there is already a un mission in abkhazia and the organisation for security and cooperation in europe -lrb- osce -rrb- is trying to set up observers in and around south ossetia , the spark for the start of the fighting . a spokesman for the french presidency told news agency afp that sarkozy also wants " precise dates , mechanisms and commitments " for a russian military withdrawal from georgian territory outside of the breakaway regions . russia claims it has withdrawn from georgia in line with the ceasefire accord , but france believes there are about 1,000 troops in georgia around south ossetia and abkhazia , officials said . sarkozy 's third priority is to obtain a date for international talks on the future of south ossetia and abkhazia , which russia has recognized as independent states , angering the west .
so far russia has been immune to international pressure over the war with georgia , and it showed little concern after the eu summit decided to suspend talks with moscow on a new partnership accord . hope for progress bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the german chancellor is optimistic about the trip chancellor angela merkel told a german radio station she is optimistic that sarkozy will make progress during his discussions with medvedev .
merkel said she was heartened by russia ’ s response to the eu agreement last week which avoided imposing sanctions on moscow . “ i see grounds for hope , as the -lrb- russian -rrb- prime minister and the president welcomed the eu 's decisions , " merkel added . in the interview she also reiterated her view that russia had reacted disproportionately to georgia 's actions in south ossetia and that russia 's recognition as independent states of south ossetia and abkhazia did not comply with international law . " that will be fodder for future meetings but it does n't mean we can not continue to work together in other areas , " she said .
" we in the eu want to further contacts -lrb- with russia -rrb- .
but it can not be that the six-point plan which we have developed together is not fulfilled . " german minister calls for international probe meanwhile , german foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier has called on the united nations or the organization for security and cooperation in europe -lrb- osce -rrb- to open an investigation into the conflict . in an interview with the german daily hannoverschen allgemeinen zeitung last week , steinmeier said both russia and georgia needed to be open to an independent investigation . " i see no lack of institutions , for example in the framework of the un or the osce that could run the probe , he said .
" but until now , there has above all been unwillingness on both sides to take part in such an investigation , " steinmeier said . steinmeier added that he believes it is in the best interest of both sides that they cooperate with any investigation .
he warned however , that determining who was responsible isn ’ t something that can happen overnight . dw staff -lrb- mrm -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

11 attacks have provided fertile ground for conspiracy theories italian film-maker giulietto chiesa , who was in berlin for a screening of his documentary which questions the official us version of the 9/11 terrorist attacks , has called for an international tribunal to probe events . chiesa was in berlin at the weekend for a screening of his film which features , among others , novelist gore vidal and playwright dario fo as well as retired american professor of philosophy david ray griffin who advances conspiracy theories that contradict mainstream accounts of events of 11 september , 2001 .
federal aviation administration controllers , us air force pilots , military commanders and physicists also appear in the critical documentary , which the director hopes will create " political awareness " of the " faulty " official investigation into the events by the 9/11 commission .
" some of the individuals appearing in the film are former fbi and cia agents , people who have in a sense taken a very big risk in speaking out .
i am very grateful to them because they have done a big job , " said chiesa .
" the film would not have been possible without them , " he said , adding that zero had been seen in france and belgium at individual screenings , and by more than 20,000 people in italy .
but the film so far has not gained a distributor in europe .
pushing for an international tribunal chiesa , one of italy 's most respected journalists and a la stampa foreign correspondent for more than 20 years , told his berlin audience an 9/11 international tribunal could serve a useful purpose .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : alternative theories abound about what actually happened at the site of the twin towers " if feelings were strong enough a positive result could be obtained , but it would not happen immediately .
so far it 's been the us administration that has won the information fight and obtained their result - unfortunately , " chiesa said . " our task is to inform millions of people of the true situation .
everybody should be involved in this struggle with a tribunal or commission helping once we win approval for the idea , " he said .
in an interview with german news agency dpa , chiesa , a european parliamentary deputy , said russian television is to give prime time airing to his film on the eve of this week 's seventh anniversary of the attacks in new york and washington .
" that means that some 30 million russian citizens will learn the truth about what happened , which is a very big result for me . "
chiesa , whose documentary was first screened to a large german audience at the goethe institute in munich in may , was clearly delighted at his reception in berlin .
" it 's important that so many people have shown up , " he said .
one of a panel of six experts debating the 9/11 topic in berlin , chiesa said he was eager for his film to gain more public support and become a " multiplicator " across germany .
" if that happens it means we are making politics in the right sense of the word . "
critics question government version of attacks andreas von buelow , a controversial former german minister of technology , and ex-state secretary in the defense ministry , was among the berlin participants who said further investigation was needed into 9/11 .
he told dpa it was " one of life 's characteristics that governments are prone to lie in order to achieve their agendas .

meanwhile a million people have been killed . "
asked if there was any prospect of a policy change once the next us president was elected , he replied bluntly " no ! "
juergen elsaesser , 51 , a berlin-based journalist and author whose latest book is titled " terror target europe : the dangerous double game of the secret services , " spoke of the huge contradictions in the official us version of the 9/11 events .
" critics find themselves accused of conspiracy theories , but the biggest conspiracy is to be found in the official 9/11 version of the us government which maintains that osama bin laden , from a cave in afghanistan , along with 19 young arabs , combined to carry out the most perfidious attack in the history of mankind , " he said .
" that just does n't add up .

11 attacks have provided fertile ground for conspiracy theories italian film-maker giulietto chiesa , who was in berlin for a screening of his documentary which questions the official us version of the 9/11 terrorist attacks , has called for an international tribunal to probe events . chiesa was in berlin at the weekend for a screening of his film which features , among others , novelist gore vidal and playwright dario fo as well as retired american professor of philosophy david ray griffin who advances conspiracy theories that contradict mainstream accounts of events of 11 september , 2001 .
federal aviation administration controllers , us air force pilots , military commanders and physicists also appear in the critical documentary , which the director hopes will create " political awareness " of the " faulty " official investigation into the events by the 9/11 commission .
" some of the individuals appearing in the film are former fbi and cia agents , people who have in a sense taken a very big risk in speaking out .
i am very grateful to them because they have done a big job , " said chiesa .
" the film would not have been possible without them , " he said , adding that zero had been seen in france and belgium at individual screenings , and by more than 20,000 people in italy .
but the film so far has not gained a distributor in europe .
pushing for an international tribunal chiesa , one of italy 's most respected journalists and a la stampa foreign correspondent for more than 20 years , told his berlin audience an 9/11 international tribunal could serve a useful purpose .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : alternative theories abound about what actually happened at the site of the twin towers " if feelings were strong enough a positive result could be obtained , but it would not happen immediately .
so far it 's been the us administration that has won the information fight and obtained their result - unfortunately , " chiesa said . " our task is to inform millions of people of the true situation .
everybody should be involved in this struggle with a tribunal or commission helping once we win approval for the idea , " he said .
in an interview with german news agency dpa , chiesa , a european parliamentary deputy , said russian television is to give prime time airing to his film on the eve of this week 's seventh anniversary of the attacks in new york and washington .
" that means that some 30 million russian citizens will learn the truth about what happened , which is a very big result for me . "
chiesa , whose documentary was first screened to a large german audience at the goethe institute in munich in may , was clearly delighted at his reception in berlin .
" it 's important that so many people have shown up , " he said .
one of a panel of six experts debating the 9/11 topic in berlin , chiesa said he was eager for his film to gain more public support and become a " multiplicator " across germany .
" if that happens it means we are making politics in the right sense of the word . "
critics question government version of attacks andreas von buelow , a controversial former german minister of technology , and ex-state secretary in the defense ministry , was among the berlin participants who said further investigation was needed into 9/11 .
he told dpa it was " one of life 's characteristics that governments are prone to lie in order to achieve their agendas .
the americans told us that in iraq , saddam hussein had something to do with al-qaeda , which was absolutely untrue .
even the cia knew this , " he said .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some say the us invasion of iraq on a false pretext is proof of government lies of international events " then , they told us that saddam hussein was preparing weapons of mass destruction , which was also untrue , so they have been lying all over the place and are still fighting there .
meanwhile a million people have been killed . "
asked if there was any prospect of a policy change once the next us president was elected , he replied bluntly " no ! "
juergen elsaesser , 51 , a berlin-based journalist and author whose latest book is titled " terror target europe : the dangerous double game of the secret services , " spoke of the huge contradictions in the official us version of the 9/11 events .
" critics find themselves accused of conspiracy theories , but the biggest conspiracy is to be found in the official 9/11 version of the us government which maintains that osama bin laden , from a cave in afghanistan , along with 19 young arabs , combined to carry out the most perfidious attack in the history of mankind , " he said .
" that just does n't add up .
for me the most important contradiction is how the air defences of the greatest military power on the planet failed to prevent such attacks occurring and that no interceptor fighter planes or rocket systems were ever activated .

there is already a un mission in abkhazia and the organisation for security and cooperation in europe -lrb- osce -rrb- is trying to set up observers in and around south ossetia , the spark for the start of the fighting . a spokesman for the french presidency told news agency afp that sarkozy also wants " precise dates , mechanisms and commitments " for a russian military withdrawal from georgian territory outside of the breakaway regions . russia claims it has withdrawn from georgia in line with the ceasefire accord , but france believes there are about 1,000 troops in georgia around south ossetia and abkhazia , officials said . sarkozy 's third priority is to obtain a date for international talks on the future of south ossetia and abkhazia , which russia has recognized as independent states , angering the west .
so far russia has been immune to international pressure over the war with georgia , and it showed little concern after the eu summit decided to suspend talks with moscow on a new partnership accord . hope for progress bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the german chancellor is optimistic about the trip chancellor angela merkel told a german radio station she is optimistic that sarkozy will make progress during his discussions with medvedev .
merkel said she was heartened by russia ’ s response to the eu agreement last week which avoided imposing sanctions on moscow . “ i see grounds for hope , as the -lrb- russian -rrb- prime minister and the president welcomed the eu 's decisions , " merkel added . in the interview she also reiterated her view that russia had reacted disproportionately to georgia 's actions in south ossetia and that russia 's recognition as independent states of south ossetia and abkhazia did not comply with international law . " that will be fodder for future meetings but it does n't mean we can not continue to work together in other areas , " she said .
" we in the eu want to further contacts -lrb- with russia -rrb- .
but it can not be that the six-point plan which we have developed together is not fulfilled . " german minister calls for international probe meanwhile , german foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier has called on the united nations or the organization for security and cooperation in europe -lrb- osce -rrb- to open an investigation into the conflict . in an interview with the german daily hannoverschen allgemeinen zeitung last week , steinmeier said both russia and georgia needed to be open to an independent investigation . " i see no lack of institutions , for example in the framework of the un or the osce that could run the probe , he said .
" but until now , there has above all been unwillingness on both sides to take part in such an investigation , " steinmeier said . steinmeier added that he believes it is in the best interest of both sides that they cooperate with any investigation .
he warned however , that determining who was responsible isn ’ t something that can happen overnight . dw staff -lrb- mrm -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de terrorism -pipe- 08.09.2008 filmmaker urges international tribunal to probe 9/11 großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the sept .
11 attacks have provided fertile ground for conspiracy theories italian film-maker giulietto chiesa , who was in berlin for a screening of his documentary which questions the official us version of the 9/11 terrorist attacks , has called for an international tribunal to probe events . chiesa was in berlin at the weekend for a screening of his film which features , among others , novelist gore vidal and playwright dario fo as well as retired american professor of philosophy david ray griffin who advances conspiracy theories that contradict mainstream accounts of events of 11 september , 2001 .
federal aviation administration controllers , us air force pilots , military commanders and physicists also appear in the critical documentary , which the director hopes will create " political awareness " of the " faulty " official investigation into the events by the 9/11 commission .
" some of the individuals appearing in the film are former fbi and cia agents , people who have in a sense taken a very big risk in speaking out .
i am very grateful to them because they have done a big job , " said chiesa .
" the film would not have been possible without them , " he said , adding that zero had been seen in france and belgium at individual screenings , and by more than 20,000 people in italy .
but the film so far has not gained a distributor in europe .
pushing for an international tribunal chiesa , one of italy 's most respected journalists and a la stampa foreign correspondent for more than 20 years , told his berlin audience an 9/11 international tribunal could serve a useful purpose .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : alternative theories abound about what actually happened at the site of the twin towers " if feelings were strong enough a positive result could be obtained , but it would not happen immediately .
so far it 's been the us administration that has won the information fight and obtained their result - unfortunately , " chiesa said . " our task is to inform millions of people of the true situation .
everybody should be involved in this struggle with a tribunal or commission helping once we win approval for the idea , " he said .
in an interview with german news agency dpa , chiesa , a european parliamentary deputy , said russian television is to give prime time airing to his film on the eve of this week 's seventh anniversary of the attacks in new york and washington .
" that means that some 30 million russian citizens will learn the truth about what happened , which is a very big result for me . "
chiesa , whose documentary was first screened to a large german audience at the goethe institute in munich in may , was clearly delighted at his reception in berlin .
" it 's important that so many people have shown up , " he said .
one of a panel of six experts debating the 9/11 topic in berlin , chiesa said he was eager for his film to gain more public support and become a " multiplicator " across germany .
" if that happens it means we are making politics in the right sense of the word . "
critics question government version of attacks andreas von buelow , a controversial former german minister of technology , and ex-state secretary in the defense ministry , was among the berlin participants who said further investigation was needed into 9/11 .
he told dpa it was " one of life 's characteristics that governments are prone to lie in order to achieve their agendas .
the americans told us that in iraq , saddam hussein had something to do with al-qaeda , which was absolutely untrue .
even the cia knew this , " he said .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some say the us invasion of iraq on a false pretext is proof of government lies of international events " then , they told us that saddam hussein was preparing weapons of mass destruction , which was also untrue , so they have been lying all over the place and are still fighting there .
meanwhile a million people have been killed . "
asked if there was any prospect of a policy change once the next us president was elected , he replied bluntly " no ! "
juergen elsaesser , 51 , a berlin-based journalist and author whose latest book is titled " terror target europe : the dangerous double game of the secret services , " spoke of the huge contradictions in the official us version of the 9/11 events .
" critics find themselves accused of conspiracy theories , but the biggest conspiracy is to be found in the official 9/11 version of the us government which maintains that osama bin laden , from a cave in afghanistan , along with 19 young arabs , combined to carry out the most perfidious attack in the history of mankind , " he said .
" that just does n't add up .
for me the most important contradiction is how the air defences of the greatest military power on the planet failed to prevent such attacks occurring and that no interceptor fighter planes or rocket systems were ever activated .

difficult negotiations still ahead both leaders said international peace talks would start october 15 in geneva .

his sentiments were chimed by the russian president .
" our country values the european efforts ... we do not want a deterioration of our relations , " medvedev told sarkozy , who was also accompanied by eu foreign policy envoy javier solana and european commission president jose manuel barroso .

people who , though able to function in everyday society , have trouble reading bank statements , menus , instructions or bills .
" there are illiterate people all over germany , " peter hubertus told the dpa news agency .
people are afraid of the stigma connected to illiteracy and have difficulties finding a job , hubertus said .
" the map of people with little education has come to mirror the map of german unemployment , " he said .
nice people who do n't want to offend bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany wants literacy courses to be offered nationwide in order to get the necessary reading and writing skills to leave the ranks of the unemployed , uwe , who declined to have his last name used , decided to enroll in literacy courses at berlin 's federal association for literacy and basic education -lrb- avlb -rrb- .
" i 'm learning to write " said the 46-year-old , who had earlier worked as a truck driver in a family business .
" to really write correctly in real sentences . "
in germany , there are 23,000 adults attending literary course annually .
some 69 percent of them are unskilled male workers .
a further 75,000 are young people who left school early .
bettina did n't drop out of school , but she said she was never at the head of the class .
" if i were to show you my diploma , you 'd never believe that i ca n't read or write , " she said .
" i had average grades .
i guess people are nice and do n't want to offend someone with these things , but it was n't aboveboard .
if someone had been honest i could have got help earlier . "
instead , the 45-year old mother of three said she always had a children ’ s book in her hand , but she " didn ’ t read from the book i made up the stories myself . "
new literacy foundation the avlb , supported with 30 million euros -lrb- $ 42.6 million -rrb- from the federal education ministry , opened the alfa foundation on monday to help people like uwe and bettina .

but forces will remain in the rebel regions of south ossetia and abkhazia . dmitry medvedev said russian forces would pull back to pre-conflict positions by october 1 , when replaced by 200 european monitors in the buffer zones around georgia 's breakaway regions of south ossetia and abkhazia .
under monday 's agreement , russia is also due to pull out in a week 's time from outstanding checkpoints between sinaki and the black sea port of poti , deep inside georgia .
" russia has obtained a guarantee from the european union and france which holds the eu presidency , on the non-use of force by the georgian side , " medvedev said at a joint press conference after meeting with eu negotiators .
nicolas sarkozy , whose country holds the rotating eu presidency , said he had given medvedev a letter from georgian president mikhail saakashvili , vowing to abstain from any use of force .
difficult negotiations still ahead both leaders said international peace talks would start october 15 in geneva .
but negotiations look set to be fraught .
despite the accord , moscow is refusing to reverse its recognition of the independence of georgia 's two separatist regions of south ossetia and abkhazia .
and medevev attacked georgia for its " hair-brained " assault on ossetia , which he said had been launched with the direct or tacit support of the united states .
" russia is fully complying with the settlement plan , but i ca n't say the same for the georgian side that is actively trying to re-establish its military positions , and the united states , unfortunately , is supporting this , " medvedev said .
bildunterschrift : monday also saw the first of three days of hearings brought by georgia against russia meanwhile , georgia was accusing russia before the un 's highest court in the hague of conducting a long-running campaign of " ethnic cleansing " in georgian territory . russia defended its actions before the international court of justice -lrb- icj -rrb- , saying a georgian assault on the rebel region of south ossetia last month left it no choice but to send in tanks and troops .

the meetings had been originally scheduled for september , but were frozen until moscow pulls out of georgia .
" things are perfectly clear : we want partnership and we want peace , " said sarkozy .
his sentiments were chimed by the russian president .
" our country values the european efforts ... we do not want a deterioration of our relations , " medvedev told sarkozy , who was also accompanied by eu foreign policy envoy javier solana and european commission president jose manuel barroso .
in an exercise of shuttle diplomacy after russia and georgia refused to take part in direct talks , the three left for tbilisi to meet with georgian president saakashvili immediately after the talks .
the talks , launched in july , were aimed at agreeing a new framework for eu-russia ties .
the existing accord dates from 1997 , when russia was still suffering economically from the break-up of the soviet union . washington is sticking to a firm line , however , with us president george w. bush taking a long-awaited decision to postpone talks with russia on a nuclear agreement .

but forces will remain in the rebel regions of south ossetia and abkhazia . dmitry medvedev said russian forces would pull back to pre-conflict positions by october 1 , when replaced by 200 european monitors in the buffer zones around georgia 's breakaway regions of south ossetia and abkhazia .
under monday 's agreement , russia is also due to pull out in a week 's time from outstanding checkpoints between sinaki and the black sea port of poti , deep inside georgia .
" russia has obtained a guarantee from the european union and france which holds the eu presidency , on the non-use of force by the georgian side , " medvedev said at a joint press conference after meeting with eu negotiators .
nicolas sarkozy , whose country holds the rotating eu presidency , said he had given medvedev a letter from georgian president mikhail saakashvili , vowing to abstain from any use of force .
difficult negotiations still ahead both leaders said international peace talks would start october 15 in geneva .
but negotiations look set to be fraught .
despite the accord , moscow is refusing to reverse its recognition of the independence of georgia 's two separatist regions of south ossetia and abkhazia .
and medevev attacked georgia for its " hair-brained " assault on ossetia , which he said had been launched with the direct or tacit support of the united states .
" russia is fully complying with the settlement plan , but i ca n't say the same for the georgian side that is actively trying to re-establish its military positions , and the united states , unfortunately , is supporting this , " medvedev said .
bildunterschrift : monday also saw the first of three days of hearings brought by georgia against russia meanwhile , georgia was accusing russia before the un 's highest court in the hague of conducting a long-running campaign of " ethnic cleansing " in georgian territory . russia defended its actions before the international court of justice -lrb- icj -rrb- , saying a georgian assault on the rebel region of south ossetia last month left it no choice but to send in tanks and troops .
thaw between eu and russia ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hundreds are estimated to have been killed on both sides after talks with the russian president , sarkozy said negotiations on a new eu-russia partnership could resume " as early as october " if the measures were enforced .
the meetings had been originally scheduled for september , but were frozen until moscow pulls out of georgia .
" things are perfectly clear : we want partnership and we want peace , " said sarkozy .
his sentiments were chimed by the russian president .
" our country values the european efforts ... we do not want a deterioration of our relations , " medvedev told sarkozy , who was also accompanied by eu foreign policy envoy javier solana and european commission president jose manuel barroso .
in an exercise of shuttle diplomacy after russia and georgia refused to take part in direct talks , the three left for tbilisi to meet with georgian president saakashvili immediately after the talks .
the talks , launched in july , were aimed at agreeing a new framework for eu-russia ties .
the existing accord dates from 1997 , when russia was still suffering economically from the break-up of the soviet union . washington is sticking to a firm line , however , with us president george w. bush taking a long-awaited decision to postpone talks with russia on a nuclear agreement .

the diversification amounted to a " change in flight direction for air france " which was responding to " the difficult position of airlines for journeys of less than three hours . " the two companies had already contacted french group alstom , which makes the tgv high-speed trains for the sncf , because they were interested in a new generation of train developed by alstom called the agv .

after two years of evaluation , experts warned that areas near the south-western edge of asse were unsafe .
their 1993 report found that up to 4,000 litres of water were flooding into the mine 's shafts each day .
it recommended that all shafts and caverns less than 750 metres below the earth ’ s surface should be stabilised to prevent possible collapse .
focus reports that although spd leaders in lower saxony received an updated report highlighting safety concerns in 1998 , they chose to keep the warnings under wraps .
the extent of the safety problems at asse were made public last week , prompting environment minister sigmar gabriel to transfer responsibility of the facility from the munich-based helmholtz institute for scientific research to the federal office for radiation protection .
waste disposal ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : in the 1960s researchers thought salt mines were ideal for storing nuclear waste nuclear power is often touted as being clean and carbon-friendly , but opponents point out that no one has yet found a durable solution for storing nuclear waste , which remains highly radioactive for centuries .
asse was converted into an atomic waste storage facility in the 1960s as a pilot project linked to plans for a permanent facility at another former salt mine at gorleben , lower saxony .
but problems at asse raise questions about the feasibility of the gorleben site at a time when germany ’ s grand coalition government is split on whether or not to reverse plans to abandon all nuclear power by 2021 .
political fallout chancellor angela merkel 's conservative christian democratic union -lrb- cdu -rrb- , which supports continued use of nuclear power , is worried that asse will undermine its calls for a rethink of the planned phase-out .
in a radio interview on sunday , merkel said there needed to be decisions about what to do with highly radioactive material .
" we do also need to make progress in the storage of highly radioactive material .
it 's about atomic plants .
a moratorium has been agreed for gorleben and of course decisions must be made on how things go from here , " merkel told deutschlandfunk radio .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : environment minister gabriel has assumed control of asse in its latest issue , der spiegel magazine quoted a strategy paper in which conservative lawmaker katherine reiche demanded that environment minister gabriel immediately lift the moratorium on exploring options for storing atomic waste at gorleben .
the moratorium is the result of battles between supporters of nuclear power , who unsuccessfully tried to rush through gorleben 's commissioning in the 1970s , and a powerful lobby of opponents for whom the unresolved storage question buys time to discredit nuclear energy .
der spiegel reports that a search for alternatives elsewhere , which gabriel and the social democrats prefer , would cost at least one billion euros .

after two years of evaluation , experts warned that areas near the south-western edge of asse were unsafe .
their 1993 report found that up to 4,000 litres of water were flooding into the mine 's shafts each day .
it recommended that all shafts and caverns less than 750 metres below the earth ’ s surface should be stabilised to prevent possible collapse .
focus reports that although spd leaders in lower saxony received an updated report highlighting safety concerns in 1998 , they chose to keep the warnings under wraps .
the extent of the safety problems at asse were made public last week , prompting environment minister sigmar gabriel to transfer responsibility of the facility from the munich-based helmholtz institute for scientific research to the federal office for radiation protection .
waste disposal ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : in the 1960s researchers thought salt mines were ideal for storing nuclear waste nuclear power is often touted as being clean and carbon-friendly , but opponents point out that no one has yet found a durable solution for storing nuclear waste , which remains highly radioactive for centuries .
asse was converted into an atomic waste storage facility in the 1960s as a pilot project linked to plans for a permanent facility at another former salt mine at gorleben , lower saxony .
but problems at asse raise questions about the feasibility of the gorleben site at a time when germany ’ s grand coalition government is split on whether or not to reverse plans to abandon all nuclear power by 2021 .
political fallout chancellor angela merkel 's conservative christian democratic union -lrb- cdu -rrb- , which supports continued use of nuclear power , is worried that asse will undermine its calls for a rethink of the planned phase-out .
in a radio interview on sunday , merkel said there needed to be decisions about what to do with highly radioactive material .
" we do also need to make progress in the storage of highly radioactive material .
it 's about atomic plants .
a moratorium has been agreed for gorleben and of course decisions must be made on how things go from here , " merkel told deutschlandfunk radio .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : environment minister gabriel has assumed control of asse in its latest issue , der spiegel magazine quoted a strategy paper in which conservative lawmaker katherine reiche demanded that environment minister gabriel immediately lift the moratorium on exploring options for storing atomic waste at gorleben .
the moratorium is the result of battles between supporters of nuclear power , who unsuccessfully tried to rush through gorleben 's commissioning in the 1970s , and a powerful lobby of opponents for whom the unresolved storage question buys time to discredit nuclear energy .
der spiegel reports that a search for alternatives elsewhere , which gabriel and the social democrats prefer , would cost at least one billion euros .
if plans for the waste storage facility at gorleben are given up completely , energy companies could make compensation demands worth billions of euros . dw staff -lrb- sje -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

but that is not the case .
the crisis which has supposedly been resolved by the very dubiously financed american real estate market has just reached a new hazard level .
banks have lost $ 500 billion -lrb- 350 billion euros -rrb- .
a whole array of finance companies are in financial disorder .
in the usa a number of banks have been closed and more will follow .
that is bad enough .
it would be much worse if the big mortgage financers fannie mae and freddie mac broke down , a fate which has so far been hindered only through massive intervention by finance minister henry paulson and the federal reserve .
state forced to intervene bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : karl zawadzky the ministry of finance and the federal reserve had no choice but to intervene due to one single reason : the collapse of fannie mae and freddie mac could have precipitated a core meltdown of the american bank and stock market systems , dragging the rest of the world with it into the abyss .
that is because these two banks are responsible for $ 5.3 billion -lrb- 3.7 billion euros -rrb- of america 's $ 12 billion -lrb- 8.4 billion euro -rrb- total mortgage debt .
that corresponds to one third of america 's gross domestic product .
besides that , pretty much all other banks have turned their backs on the mortgage market .
an economic crisis in the usa would have very quickly become a depression - and it would have had worldwide consequences .
in the end the government and the federal reserve felt compelled to act , since the two institutions play a central role on the mortgage market .
they are practically the reinsurance for the mortgage banks - they sell credit claims to the regional mortgage banks and , as the case may be , guarantee the claims and thus back them up .
crisis still looming yet there is no longer much new business , quite the opposite : more and more real estate companies are coming under foreclosure .
experts take it for granted that in this year more than one million americans will cut their debt service .
the risks with fannie mae and freddie mac are piling up .
in the case of a property crisis , this is the least favorable business model .
in addition , fannie mae and freddie mac trade under the names of private corporations , but cooperate closely with the state .
the state had to act as the confidence crisis was getting more and more out of hand .
after they already obtained federal reserve credit on advance conditions , the state took them completely under its wing and supplied them with fresh money .
the free-enterprise rules are being overridden , economic misconduct is going unpunished , and the state is stepping onto the scene as a savior .
after the profits are privatized in good times , the losses are socialized by the state .
the amount under fire , which is financed by selling bonds from investors , including governments and central banks from all over the world , is simply too big to let the two mortgage financers slip into bankruptcy .
that shows to what extent the fire is blazing over the rooftops of the global finance systems .
the danger of a finance system core meltdown may have been momentarily averted , but the bank crisis is still far from over . karl zawadzky is dw-radio 's business editor -lrb- ah -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

but forces will remain in the rebel regions of south ossetia and abkhazia . dmitry medvedev said russian forces would pull back to pre-conflict positions by october 1 , when replaced by 200 european monitors in the buffer zones around georgia 's breakaway regions of south ossetia and abkhazia .
under monday 's agreement , russia is also due to pull out in a week 's time from outstanding checkpoints between sinaki and the black sea port of poti , deep inside georgia .
" russia has obtained a guarantee from the european union and france which holds the eu presidency , on the non-use of force by the georgian side , " medvedev said at a joint press conference after meeting with eu negotiators .
nicolas sarkozy , whose country holds the rotating eu presidency , said he had given medvedev a letter from georgian president mikhail saakashvili , vowing to abstain from any use of force .
difficult negotiations still ahead both leaders said international peace talks would start october 15 in geneva .
but negotiations look set to be fraught .
despite the accord , moscow is refusing to reverse its recognition of the independence of georgia 's two separatist regions of south ossetia and abkhazia .
and medevev attacked georgia for its " hair-brained " assault on ossetia , which he said had been launched with the direct or tacit support of the united states .
" russia is fully complying with the settlement plan , but i ca n't say the same for the georgian side that is actively trying to re-establish its military positions , and the united states , unfortunately , is supporting this , " medvedev said .
bildunterschrift : monday also saw the first of three days of hearings brought by georgia against russia meanwhile , georgia was accusing russia before the un 's highest court in the hague of conducting a long-running campaign of " ethnic cleansing " in georgian territory . russia defended its actions before the international court of justice -lrb- icj -rrb- , saying a georgian assault on the rebel region of south ossetia last month left it no choice but to send in tanks and troops .
thaw between eu and russia ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hundreds are estimated to have been killed on both sides after talks with the russian president , sarkozy said negotiations on a new eu-russia partnership could resume " as early as october " if the measures were enforced .
the meetings had been originally scheduled for september , but were frozen until moscow pulls out of georgia .
" things are perfectly clear : we want partnership and we want peace , " said sarkozy .
his sentiments were chimed by the russian president .
" our country values the european efforts ... we do not want a deterioration of our relations , " medvedev told sarkozy , who was also accompanied by eu foreign policy envoy javier solana and european commission president jose manuel barroso .
in an exercise of shuttle diplomacy after russia and georgia refused to take part in direct talks , the three left for tbilisi to meet with georgian president saakashvili immediately after the talks .
the talks , launched in july , were aimed at agreeing a new framework for eu-russia ties .
the existing accord dates from 1997 , when russia was still suffering economically from the break-up of the soviet union . washington is sticking to a firm line , however , with us president george w. bush taking a long-awaited decision to postpone talks with russia on a nuclear agreement .
" the president intends to notify congress that he has today rescinded his prior determination regarding the us-russia agreement for peaceful nuclear cooperation , " a statement said .

air france-klm , europe ’ s largest airline , is hoping to use this development to its advantage . air france-klm , europe 's largest airline , wants to get even bigger by entering the high-speed train market by 2010 .
an air france spokesperson told german television station ard that they were planning to form a strategic partnership with the transport firm veolia .
the goal is to be able to offer high-speed train service when the rail network in the european union is liberalized in 2010 . the project had been in the air for some time and the two companies signed a confidential draft agreement at the end of june , the newspaper aujourd 'hui france reported .
the diversification amounted to a " change in flight direction for air france " which was responding to " the difficult position of airlines for journeys of less than three hours . " the two companies had already contacted french group alstom , which makes the tgv high-speed trains for the sncf , because they were interested in a new generation of train developed by alstom called the agv .
the new company is hoping to purchase several agv trains , which can reach a maximum speed of 350 km / h -lrb- 217 mph -rrb- , to run between paris and london and paris and amsterdam . this is not the first partnership between an airline and a rail company .

but that is not the case .
the crisis which has supposedly been resolved by the very dubiously financed american real estate market has just reached a new hazard level .
banks have lost $ 500 billion -lrb- 350 billion euros -rrb- .
a whole array of finance companies are in financial disorder .
in the usa a number of banks have been closed and more will follow .
that is bad enough .
it would be much worse if the big mortgage financers fannie mae and freddie mac broke down , a fate which has so far been hindered only through massive intervention by finance minister henry paulson and the federal reserve .
state forced to intervene bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : karl zawadzky the ministry of finance and the federal reserve had no choice but to intervene due to one single reason : the collapse of fannie mae and freddie mac could have precipitated a core meltdown of the american bank and stock market systems , dragging the rest of the world with it into the abyss .
that is because these two banks are responsible for $ 5.3 billion -lrb- 3.7 billion euros -rrb- of america 's $ 12 billion -lrb- 8.4 billion euro -rrb- total mortgage debt .
that corresponds to one third of america 's gross domestic product .
besides that , pretty much all other banks have turned their backs on the mortgage market .
an economic crisis in the usa would have very quickly become a depression - and it would have had worldwide consequences .
in the end the government and the federal reserve felt compelled to act , since the two institutions play a central role on the mortgage market .
they are practically the reinsurance for the mortgage banks - they sell credit claims to the regional mortgage banks and , as the case may be , guarantee the claims and thus back them up .
crisis still looming yet there is no longer much new business , quite the opposite : more and more real estate companies are coming under foreclosure .
experts take it for granted that in this year more than one million americans will cut their debt service .
the risks with fannie mae and freddie mac are piling up .
in the case of a property crisis , this is the least favorable business model .
in addition , fannie mae and freddie mac trade under the names of private corporations , but cooperate closely with the state .
the state had to act as the confidence crisis was getting more and more out of hand .
after they already obtained federal reserve credit on advance conditions , the state took them completely under its wing and supplied them with fresh money .
the free-enterprise rules are being overridden , economic misconduct is going unpunished , and the state is stepping onto the scene as a savior .
after the profits are privatized in good times , the losses are socialized by the state .
the amount under fire , which is financed by selling bonds from investors , including governments and central banks from all over the world , is simply too big to let the two mortgage financers slip into bankruptcy .
that shows to what extent the fire is blazing over the rooftops of the global finance systems .
the danger of a finance system core meltdown may have been momentarily averted , but the bank crisis is still far from over . karl zawadzky is dw-radio 's business editor -lrb- ah -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

dw-world.de takes a closer look at the man the spd is pinning its hopes on for the top job . for several years , frank walter steinmeier has consistently been among germany ’ s three most popular politicians , at times right at the top of the list or trailing slightly behind christian democrat chancellor angela merkel whom he will now strive to dethrone at the general election next year . the grey-haired 52-year-old 's nomination as candidate for chancellor did n't come as a real surprise .
but doubts persist about whether he can inspire on the campaign trail since steinmeier is an untested challenger - he has never run for public office steinmeier was born in the western german town of detmold .
he joined the spd in 1976 without ever becoming an entrenched party soldier .
a lawyer , steinmeier became gerhard schroeder ’ s chief of staff when the former chancellor was premier of the state of lower saxony . following gerhard schröder 's election as chancellor in 1998 , frank-walter steinmeier was appointed head of the chancellory and commissioner for the federal intelligence services . steinmeier was entrusted with responsibility for overall policy coordination within the federal government . he became one of schroeder 's closest advisors , coordinating the security services and shaping the agenda 2010 package of economic reforms - the unpopular centrepiece of the administration . since 2005 , he ’ s been the country ’ s foreign minister , serving chancellor angela merkel and often standing in her shadow , even in foreign policy matters .
this is why political analysts often refer to steinmeier as germany ’ s biggest number two who ’ s never had to lead a single election campaign . tough road ahead bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : steinmeier 's opponent and boss is the current chancellor , angela merkel however , steinmeier is certainly not without merits .
as foreign minister , he ’ s cut an excellent figure in operations to free german hostages in iraq , afghanistan and elsewhere .
he ’ s also played a pivotal role in keeping up the dialogue with iran over tehran ’ s nuclear arms program , as well as in fostering the process of european integration and enlargement . steinmeier has quite a challenge ahead of him .
he is soft spoken and often looks out of place in large crowds .
he tends to lean towards prepared statements rather than off the cuff remarks to the press .
many germans , including spd supporters , are worried that steinmeier won ’ t have the killer political instinct it will take to unseat angela merkel , who has become quite popular . the foreign minister does have a sense of authority about him , and when he speaks it ’ s difficult to argue with what he says .
as one observer told dw-radio however , it ’ s usually equally difficult to remember a single sentence the minister has uttered .
perhaps he ’ ll have something more memorable up his sleeve now that he ’ s the spd ’ s candidate for chancellor . so far , he ’ s steered clear of scoring political points by throwing mud at opponents or rivals , saying it is more important to tell people what you yourself stand for so that they can judge in which way you ’ re different .

according to monday 's financial times germany -lrb- ftd -rrb- , the cdu leadership has prepared a keynote speech for its party conference in december in which east germany is described as the " germany 's second dictatorship " .
the document cited by the ftd stresses the lack of civil liberties in the german democratic republic .
it also stresses the desperate economic situation of the state at the time the wall came down .
the country was , according to the cdu paper , on the brink of " economic collapse " in 1989 . limbering up for the elections bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : its logo may be red , but that 's about the only thing the document , which is due to be discussed by the party executive over the next few days before being presented to december 's party conference , is intended to serve as the basis for the cdu 's electoral campaign in national elections in 2009 .
the cdu is searching for the right strategy to improve its support in eastern germany .
recent polls have put the conservatives and the left party neck-and-neck at 28 percent in the region .
the social democrats are trailing by several points .
the left has its main support base in the formerly communist eastern states but has also made strong inroads in western states in recent months .
in order to counter any tendencies to play down harmful aspects of the regime in the future , the cdu is also calling for more museums to be set up in former east german stasi -lrb- secret service -rrb- prisons and remaining border installations to be placed under preservation orders .
it also favors erecting freedom and unity monuments in leipzig , the center of opposition rallies against the gdr regime , and the german capital berlin . the cdu is also planning to use the speech to set out its differences from the social democrats , accusing the spd party leadership of attempting to block reunification .
recent years have seen a growing tendency in eastern germany - both culturally and socio-politically - towards " ostalgie , " a german expression made up of the words ost -lrb- east -rrb- and " nostalgia " . studies have also indicated an alarming lack of knowledge about the former communist regime among german schoolchildren . dw staff -lrb- jg -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

according to monday 's financial times germany -lrb- ftd -rrb- , the cdu leadership has prepared a keynote speech for its party conference in december in which east germany is described as the " germany 's second dictatorship " .

air france-klm , europe ’ s largest airline , is hoping to use this development to its advantage . air france-klm , europe 's largest airline , wants to get even bigger by entering the high-speed train market by 2010 .
an air france spokesperson told german television station ard that they were planning to form a strategic partnership with the transport firm veolia .
the goal is to be able to offer high-speed train service when the rail network in the european union is liberalized in 2010 . the project had been in the air for some time and the two companies signed a confidential draft agreement at the end of june , the newspaper aujourd 'hui france reported .
the diversification amounted to a " change in flight direction for air france " which was responding to " the difficult position of airlines for journeys of less than three hours . " the two companies had already contacted french group alstom , which makes the tgv high-speed trains for the sncf , because they were interested in a new generation of train developed by alstom called the agv .
the new company is hoping to purchase several agv trains , which can reach a maximum speed of 350 km / h -lrb- 217 mph -rrb- , to run between paris and london and paris and amsterdam . this is not the first partnership between an airline and a rail company .

but that is not the case .
the crisis which has supposedly been resolved by the very dubiously financed american real estate market has just reached a new hazard level .
banks have lost $ 500 billion -lrb- 350 billion euros -rrb- .
a whole array of finance companies are in financial disorder .
in the usa a number of banks have been closed and more will follow .
that is bad enough .
it would be much worse if the big mortgage financers fannie mae and freddie mac broke down , a fate which has so far been hindered only through massive intervention by finance minister henry paulson and the federal reserve .
state forced to intervene bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : karl zawadzky the ministry of finance and the federal reserve had no choice but to intervene due to one single reason : the collapse of fannie mae and freddie mac could have precipitated a core meltdown of the american bank and stock market systems , dragging the rest of the world with it into the abyss .
that is because these two banks are responsible for $ 5.3 billion -lrb- 3.7 billion euros -rrb- of america 's $ 12 billion -lrb- 8.4 billion euro -rrb- total mortgage debt .
that corresponds to one third of america 's gross domestic product .
besides that , pretty much all other banks have turned their backs on the mortgage market .
an economic crisis in the usa would have very quickly become a depression - and it would have had worldwide consequences .
in the end the government and the federal reserve felt compelled to act , since the two institutions play a central role on the mortgage market .
they are practically the reinsurance for the mortgage banks - they sell credit claims to the regional mortgage banks and , as the case may be , guarantee the claims and thus back them up .
crisis still looming yet there is no longer much new business , quite the opposite : more and more real estate companies are coming under foreclosure .
experts take it for granted that in this year more than one million americans will cut their debt service .
the risks with fannie mae and freddie mac are piling up .
in the case of a property crisis , this is the least favorable business model .
in addition , fannie mae and freddie mac trade under the names of private corporations , but cooperate closely with the state .
the state had to act as the confidence crisis was getting more and more out of hand .
after they already obtained federal reserve credit on advance conditions , the state took them completely under its wing and supplied them with fresh money .
the free-enterprise rules are being overridden , economic misconduct is going unpunished , and the state is stepping onto the scene as a savior .
after the profits are privatized in good times , the losses are socialized by the state .
the amount under fire , which is financed by selling bonds from investors , including governments and central banks from all over the world , is simply too big to let the two mortgage financers slip into bankruptcy .
that shows to what extent the fire is blazing over the rooftops of the global finance systems .
the danger of a finance system core meltdown may have been momentarily averted , but the bank crisis is still far from over . karl zawadzky is dw-radio 's business editor -lrb- ah -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

but that is not the case .
the crisis which has supposedly been resolved by the very dubiously financed american real estate market has just reached a new hazard level .
banks have lost $ 500 billion -lrb- 350 billion euros -rrb- .
a whole array of finance companies are in financial disorder .
in the usa a number of banks have been closed and more will follow .
that is bad enough .
it would be much worse if the big mortgage financers fannie mae and freddie mac broke down , a fate which has so far been hindered only through massive intervention by finance minister henry paulson and the federal reserve .
state forced to intervene bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : karl zawadzky the ministry of finance and the federal reserve had no choice but to intervene due to one single reason : the collapse of fannie mae and freddie mac could have precipitated a core meltdown of the american bank and stock market systems , dragging the rest of the world with it into the abyss .
that is because these two banks are responsible for $ 5.3 billion -lrb- 3.7 billion euros -rrb- of america 's $ 12 billion -lrb- 8.4 billion euro -rrb- total mortgage debt .
that corresponds to one third of america 's gross domestic product .
besides that , pretty much all other banks have turned their backs on the mortgage market .
an economic crisis in the usa would have very quickly become a depression - and it would have had worldwide consequences .
in the end the government and the federal reserve felt compelled to act , since the two institutions play a central role on the mortgage market .
they are practically the reinsurance for the mortgage banks - they sell credit claims to the regional mortgage banks and , as the case may be , guarantee the claims and thus back them up .
crisis still looming yet there is no longer much new business , quite the opposite : more and more real estate companies are coming under foreclosure .

he based the demand , which is well above german consumer inflation of around 3.3 per cent on the year , on price increases , increased productivity and strong profits in the sector , which is a major component of germany 's highly successful export machine .
huber highlighted another key concern in germany ; soaring executive pay , saying there was a need for social justice to be taken into account .
german trade unionists have long argued that while workers showed restraint through a long economic slowdown at the beginning of the decade , they have not seen any rewards for the upswing over the past two years .

after two years of evaluation , experts warned that areas near the south-western edge of asse were unsafe .
their 1993 report found that up to 4,000 litres of water were flooding into the mine 's shafts each day .
it recommended that all shafts and caverns less than 750 metres below the earth ’ s surface should be stabilised to prevent possible collapse .
focus reports that although spd leaders in lower saxony received an updated report highlighting safety concerns in 1998 , they chose to keep the warnings under wraps .
the extent of the safety problems at asse were made public last week , prompting environment minister sigmar gabriel to transfer responsibility of the facility from the munich-based helmholtz institute for scientific research to the federal office for radiation protection .
waste disposal ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : in the 1960s researchers thought salt mines were ideal for storing nuclear waste nuclear power is often touted as being clean and carbon-friendly , but opponents point out that no one has yet found a durable solution for storing nuclear waste , which remains highly radioactive for centuries .
asse was converted into an atomic waste storage facility in the 1960s as a pilot project linked to plans for a permanent facility at another former salt mine at gorleben , lower saxony .
but problems at asse raise questions about the feasibility of the gorleben site at a time when germany ’ s grand coalition government is split on whether or not to reverse plans to abandon all nuclear power by 2021 .
political fallout chancellor angela merkel 's conservative christian democratic union -lrb- cdu -rrb- , which supports continued use of nuclear power , is worried that asse will undermine its calls for a rethink of the planned phase-out .
in a radio interview on sunday , merkel said there needed to be decisions about what to do with highly radioactive material .
" we do also need to make progress in the storage of highly radioactive material .
it 's about atomic plants .
a moratorium has been agreed for gorleben and of course decisions must be made on how things go from here , " merkel told deutschlandfunk radio .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : environment minister gabriel has assumed control of asse in its latest issue , der spiegel magazine quoted a strategy paper in which conservative lawmaker katherine reiche demanded that environment minister gabriel immediately lift the moratorium on exploring options for storing atomic waste at gorleben .
the moratorium is the result of battles between supporters of nuclear power , who unsuccessfully tried to rush through gorleben 's commissioning in the 1970s , and a powerful lobby of opponents for whom the unresolved storage question buys time to discredit nuclear energy .
der spiegel reports that a search for alternatives elsewhere , which gabriel and the social democrats prefer , would cost at least one billion euros .
if plans for the waste storage facility at gorleben are given up completely , energy companies could make compensation demands worth billions of euros . dw staff -lrb- sje -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

after two years of evaluation , experts warned that areas near the south-western edge of asse were unsafe .
their 1993 report found that up to 4,000 litres of water were flooding into the mine 's shafts each day .
it recommended that all shafts and caverns less than 750 metres below the earth ’ s surface should be stabilised to prevent possible collapse .
focus reports that although spd leaders in lower saxony received an updated report highlighting safety concerns in 1998 , they chose to keep the warnings under wraps .
the extent of the safety problems at asse were made public last week , prompting environment minister sigmar gabriel to transfer responsibility of the facility from the munich-based helmholtz institute for scientific research to the federal office for radiation protection .

bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : in the 1960s researchers thought salt mines were ideal for storing nuclear waste nuclear power is often touted as being clean and carbon-friendly , but opponents point out that no one has yet found a durable solution for storing nuclear waste , which remains highly radioactive for centuries .
asse was converted into an atomic waste storage facility in the 1960s as a pilot project linked to plans for a permanent facility at another former salt mine at gorleben , lower saxony .
but problems at asse raise questions about the feasibility of the gorleben site at a time when germany ’ s grand coalition government is split on whether or not to reverse plans to abandon all nuclear power by 2021 .
political fallout chancellor angela merkel 's conservative christian democratic union -lrb- cdu -rrb- , which supports continued use of nuclear power , is worried that asse will undermine its calls for a rethink of the planned phase-out .
in a radio interview on sunday , merkel said there needed to be decisions about what to do with highly radioactive material .
" we do also need to make progress in the storage of highly radioactive material .
it 's about atomic plants .
a moratorium has been agreed for gorleben and of course decisions must be made on how things go from here , " merkel told deutschlandfunk radio .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : environment minister gabriel has assumed control of asse in its latest issue , der spiegel magazine quoted a strategy paper in which conservative lawmaker katherine reiche demanded that environment minister gabriel immediately lift the moratorium on exploring options for storing atomic waste at gorleben .
the moratorium is the result of battles between supporters of nuclear power , who unsuccessfully tried to rush through gorleben 's commissioning in the 1970s , and a powerful lobby of opponents for whom the unresolved storage question buys time to discredit nuclear energy .
der spiegel reports that a search for alternatives elsewhere , which gabriel and the social democrats prefer , would cost at least one billion euros .

31 commerzbank chief executive martin blessing has defended the price germany 's second-largest bank paid to take over rival dresdner , in the country 's biggest shake-up in the banking sector . in an interview with german news magazine der spiegel , blessing described the 9.8 billion euros -lrb- $ 14.4 billion -rrb- paid to insurer allianz as " not cheap but fair , " highlighting the fact that much of the deal had been done with commerzbank shares .
in addition , the new bank aimed to realize synergies worth 5 billion euros , he said .
analysts were critical following sunday 's deal , and commerzbank 's shares dived to trade as low as 16.66 euros during friday trade in frankfurt .
on friday aug .
29 , the last day of trading before the widely anticipated announcement , commerzbank had traded in a range around 20 euros .
the new bank , which aims to challenge the dominance in germany of deutsche bank through its widespread branch network , aims to shed some 9,000 of its staff complement of 67,000 full-time employees .
regarding the reported interest shown in dresdner bank by the state-owned china development bank , blessing told the weekly : " if there had been a game of bluff over the price with a bank backed by the chinese state , we would not have had a chance . "
a new banking force he said there would be substantial cuts at the london-based dresdner investment banking unit dresdner kleinwort , but refused to be drawn on a potential purchaser for the subsidiary , which has been hit by the us subprime crisis .
on monday , german finance minister peer steinbrueck welcomed the deal .
" this is good for germany as a financial location , " steinbrueck said from beijing where he was meeting chinese officials .
with total assets of about 1.09 trillion euros and 11 million german customers , a merged commerzbank-dresdner will result in the emergence of new banking force in europe 's biggest economy .
deutsche bank , which failed in a bid to merge with dresdner eight years ago , remains the largest bank in germany with assets totaling about 2 trillion euros . munich-based allianz , europe 's biggest insurer , is to retain a stake of about 30 percent in the new banking group and to take over risks totaling 975 million euros which are linked to the global financial crisis and credit crunch .
allianz paid about 23 billion euros for dresdner in 2001 as part of an ambitious plan to sell its pension and insurance schemes through dresdner 's branch network .
analysts see the dresdner-commerzbank deal as a prelude to the two banks ' launching a bid for deutsche postbank , which has 14.5 million customers and more than 800 branches . dpa news agency -lrb- ah -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

according to monday 's financial times germany -lrb- ftd -rrb- , the cdu leadership has prepared a keynote speech for its party conference in december in which east germany is described as the " germany 's second dictatorship " .
the document cited by the ftd stresses the lack of civil liberties in the german democratic republic .
it also stresses the desperate economic situation of the state at the time the wall came down .
the country was , according to the cdu paper , on the brink of " economic collapse " in 1989 . limbering up for the elections bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : its logo may be red , but that 's about the only thing the document , which is due to be discussed by the party executive over the next few days before being presented to december 's party conference , is intended to serve as the basis for the cdu 's electoral campaign in national elections in 2009 .
the cdu is searching for the right strategy to improve its support in eastern germany .
recent polls have put the conservatives and the left party neck-and-neck at 28 percent in the region .
the social democrats are trailing by several points .
the left has its main support base in the formerly communist eastern states but has also made strong inroads in western states in recent months .
in order to counter any tendencies to play down harmful aspects of the regime in the future , the cdu is also calling for more museums to be set up in former east german stasi -lrb- secret service -rrb- prisons and remaining border installations to be placed under preservation orders .
it also favors erecting freedom and unity monuments in leipzig , the center of opposition rallies against the gdr regime , and the german capital berlin . the cdu is also planning to use the speech to set out its differences from the social democrats , accusing the spd party leadership of attempting to block reunification .
recent years have seen a growing tendency in eastern germany - both culturally and socio-politically - towards " ostalgie , " a german expression made up of the words ost -lrb- east -rrb- and " nostalgia " . studies have also indicated an alarming lack of knowledge about the former communist regime among german schoolchildren . dw staff -lrb- jg -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

11 attacks have provided fertile ground for conspiracy theories italian film-maker giulietto chiesa , who was in berlin for a screening of his documentary which questions the official us version of the 9/11 terrorist attacks , has called for an international tribunal to probe events . chiesa was in berlin at the weekend for a screening of his film which features , among others , novelist gore vidal and playwright dario fo as well as retired american professor of philosophy david ray griffin who advances conspiracy theories that contradict mainstream accounts of events of 11 september , 2001 .
federal aviation administration controllers , us air force pilots , military commanders and physicists also appear in the critical documentary , which the director hopes will create " political awareness " of the " faulty " official investigation into the events by the 9/11 commission .
" some of the individuals appearing in the film are former fbi and cia agents , people who have in a sense taken a very big risk in speaking out .
i am very grateful to them because they have done a big job , " said chiesa .
" the film would not have been possible without them , " he said , adding that zero had been seen in france and belgium at individual screenings , and by more than 20,000 people in italy .
but the film so far has not gained a distributor in europe .
pushing for an international tribunal chiesa , one of italy 's most respected journalists and a la stampa foreign correspondent for more than 20 years , told his berlin audience an 9/11 international tribunal could serve a useful purpose .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : alternative theories abound about what actually happened at the site of the twin towers " if feelings were strong enough a positive result could be obtained , but it would not happen immediately .
so far it 's been the us administration that has won the information fight and obtained their result - unfortunately , " chiesa said . " our task is to inform millions of people of the true situation .
everybody should be involved in this struggle with a tribunal or commission helping once we win approval for the idea , " he said .
in an interview with german news agency dpa , chiesa , a european parliamentary deputy , said russian television is to give prime time airing to his film on the eve of this week 's seventh anniversary of the attacks in new york and washington .
" that means that some 30 million russian citizens will learn the truth about what happened , which is a very big result for me . "
chiesa , whose documentary was first screened to a large german audience at the goethe institute in munich in may , was clearly delighted at his reception in berlin .
" it 's important that so many people have shown up , " he said .
one of a panel of six experts debating the 9/11 topic in berlin , chiesa said he was eager for his film to gain more public support and become a " multiplicator " across germany .
" if that happens it means we are making politics in the right sense of the word . "
critics question government version of attacks andreas von buelow , a controversial former german minister of technology , and ex-state secretary in the defense ministry , was among the berlin participants who said further investigation was needed into 9/11 .
he told dpa it was " one of life 's characteristics that governments are prone to lie in order to achieve their agendas .
the americans told us that in iraq , saddam hussein had something to do with al-qaeda , which was absolutely untrue .
even the cia knew this , " he said .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some say the us invasion of iraq on a false pretext is proof of government lies of international events " then , they told us that saddam hussein was preparing weapons of mass destruction , which was also untrue , so they have been lying all over the place and are still fighting there .
meanwhile a million people have been killed . "
asked if there was any prospect of a policy change once the next us president was elected , he replied bluntly " no ! "
juergen elsaesser , 51 , a berlin-based journalist and author whose latest book is titled " terror target europe : the dangerous double game of the secret services , " spoke of the huge contradictions in the official us version of the 9/11 events .
" critics find themselves accused of conspiracy theories , but the biggest conspiracy is to be found in the official 9/11 version of the us government which maintains that osama bin laden , from a cave in afghanistan , along with 19 young arabs , combined to carry out the most perfidious attack in the history of mankind , " he said .
" that just does n't add up .
for me the most important contradiction is how the air defences of the greatest military power on the planet failed to prevent such attacks occurring and that no interceptor fighter planes or rocket systems were ever activated .

11 attacks have provided fertile ground for conspiracy theories italian film-maker giulietto chiesa , who was in berlin for a screening of his documentary which questions the official us version of the 9/11 terrorist attacks , has called for an international tribunal to probe events . chiesa was in berlin at the weekend for a screening of his film which features , among others , novelist gore vidal and playwright dario fo as well as retired american professor of philosophy david ray griffin who advances conspiracy theories that contradict mainstream accounts of events of 11 september , 2001 .
federal aviation administration controllers , us air force pilots , military commanders and physicists also appear in the critical documentary , which the director hopes will create " political awareness " of the " faulty " official investigation into the events by the 9/11 commission .
" some of the individuals appearing in the film are former fbi and cia agents , people who have in a sense taken a very big risk in speaking out .
i am very grateful to them because they have done a big job , " said chiesa .
" the film would not have been possible without them , " he said , adding that zero had been seen in france and belgium at individual screenings , and by more than 20,000 people in italy .
but the film so far has not gained a distributor in europe .
pushing for an international tribunal chiesa , one of italy 's most respected journalists and a la stampa foreign correspondent for more than 20 years , told his berlin audience an 9/11 international tribunal could serve a useful purpose .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : alternative theories abound about what actually happened at the site of the twin towers " if feelings were strong enough a positive result could be obtained , but it would not happen immediately .
so far it 's been the us administration that has won the information fight and obtained their result - unfortunately , " chiesa said . " our task is to inform millions of people of the true situation .
everybody should be involved in this struggle with a tribunal or commission helping once we win approval for the idea , " he said .
in an interview with german news agency dpa , chiesa , a european parliamentary deputy , said russian television is to give prime time airing to his film on the eve of this week 's seventh anniversary of the attacks in new york and washington .
" that means that some 30 million russian citizens will learn the truth about what happened , which is a very big result for me . "
chiesa , whose documentary was first screened to a large german audience at the goethe institute in munich in may , was clearly delighted at his reception in berlin .
" it 's important that so many people have shown up , " he said .
one of a panel of six experts debating the 9/11 topic in berlin , chiesa said he was eager for his film to gain more public support and become a " multiplicator " across germany .
" if that happens it means we are making politics in the right sense of the word . "
critics question government version of attacks andreas von buelow , a controversial former german minister of technology , and ex-state secretary in the defense ministry , was among the berlin participants who said further investigation was needed into 9/11 .
he told dpa it was " one of life 's characteristics that governments are prone to lie in order to achieve their agendas .
the americans told us that in iraq , saddam hussein had something to do with al-qaeda , which was absolutely untrue .
even the cia knew this , " he said .

" i ca n't describe in any words what we 're feeling right now , " singer bill kaulitz said , thanking the band 's fans worldwide .
since tokio hotel was formed in magdeburg in 2001 , the quartet of bill and tom kaulitz , georg listing and gustav schaefer have enjoyed much success in their native germany , wirth four number one singles and two chart-topping albums , selling nearly five million cds and dvds .
tokio hotel released their first album “ schrei ” -lrb- scream -rrb- in may 2006 and sold some 600,000 copies in six days in germany .
it also quickly became a major success in france , austria and switzerland .

that makes tokio hotel one of the few german bands to enjoy such international success .

as well as singing more in english , the band has recently adopted a more serious " emo " image , which is reflected in their now award-winning video depicting a mass of soulless people marching in uniforms - apparently the victims of a dystopic regime .
the vma award is already being seen as a potential breakthrough for the band to further success in america .
speaking ahead of the ceremony , bill kaulitz said : " we do n't expect it , so for us , it 's so cool to be nominated .
i think it 's really , really special for us - it 's america and it 's our first american award and that 's so huge . "
the youngsters showed they are getting used to the international pop-star lifestyle when they turned up for the awards on a monster truck , though they were upstaged by rapper t-pain who arrived on elephant accompanied by various circus performers . dw staff -lrb- ah -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

dw-world.de takes a closer look at the man the spd is pinning its hopes on for the top job . for several years , frank walter steinmeier has consistently been among germany ’ s three most popular politicians , at times right at the top of the list or trailing slightly behind christian democrat chancellor angela merkel whom he will now strive to dethrone at the general election next year . the grey-haired 52-year-old 's nomination as candidate for chancellor did n't come as a real surprise .
but doubts persist about whether he can inspire on the campaign trail since steinmeier is an untested challenger - he has never run for public office steinmeier was born in the western german town of detmold .
he joined the spd in 1976 without ever becoming an entrenched party soldier .
a lawyer , steinmeier became gerhard schroeder ’ s chief of staff when the former chancellor was premier of the state of lower saxony . following gerhard schröder 's election as chancellor in 1998 , frank-walter steinmeier was appointed head of the chancellory and commissioner for the federal intelligence services . steinmeier was entrusted with responsibility for overall policy coordination within the federal government . he became one of schroeder 's closest advisors , coordinating the security services and shaping the agenda 2010 package of economic reforms - the unpopular centrepiece of the administration . since 2005 , he ’ s been the country ’ s foreign minister , serving chancellor angela merkel and often standing in her shadow , even in foreign policy matters .
this is why political analysts often refer to steinmeier as germany ’ s biggest number two who ’ s never had to lead a single election campaign . tough road ahead bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : steinmeier 's opponent and boss is the current chancellor , angela merkel however , steinmeier is certainly not without merits .
as foreign minister , he ’ s cut an excellent figure in operations to free german hostages in iraq , afghanistan and elsewhere .
he ’ s also played a pivotal role in keeping up the dialogue with iran over tehran ’ s nuclear arms program , as well as in fostering the process of european integration and enlargement . steinmeier has quite a challenge ahead of him .
he is soft spoken and often looks out of place in large crowds .
he tends to lean towards prepared statements rather than off the cuff remarks to the press .
many germans , including spd supporters , are worried that steinmeier won ’ t have the killer political instinct it will take to unseat angela merkel , who has become quite popular . the foreign minister does have a sense of authority about him , and when he speaks it ’ s difficult to argue with what he says .
as one observer told dw-radio however , it ’ s usually equally difficult to remember a single sentence the minister has uttered .
perhaps he ’ ll have something more memorable up his sleeve now that he ’ s the spd ’ s candidate for chancellor . so far , he ’ s steered clear of scoring political points by throwing mud at opponents or rivals , saying it is more important to tell people what you yourself stand for so that they can judge in which way you ’ re different .

according to monday 's financial times germany -lrb- ftd -rrb- , the cdu leadership has prepared a keynote speech for its party conference in december in which east germany is described as the " germany 's second dictatorship " .
the document cited by the ftd stresses the lack of civil liberties in the german democratic republic .
it also stresses the desperate economic situation of the state at the time the wall came down .
the country was , according to the cdu paper , on the brink of " economic collapse " in 1989 . limbering up for the elections bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : its logo may be red , but that 's about the only thing the document , which is due to be discussed by the party executive over the next few days before being presented to december 's party conference , is intended to serve as the basis for the cdu 's electoral campaign in national elections in 2009 .
the cdu is searching for the right strategy to improve its support in eastern germany .
recent polls have put the conservatives and the left party neck-and-neck at 28 percent in the region .
the social democrats are trailing by several points .
the left has its main support base in the formerly communist eastern states but has also made strong inroads in western states in recent months .
in order to counter any tendencies to play down harmful aspects of the regime in the future , the cdu is also calling for more museums to be set up in former east german stasi -lrb- secret service -rrb- prisons and remaining border installations to be placed under preservation orders .
it also favors erecting freedom and unity monuments in leipzig , the center of opposition rallies against the gdr regime , and the german capital berlin . the cdu is also planning to use the speech to set out its differences from the social democrats , accusing the spd party leadership of attempting to block reunification .
recent years have seen a growing tendency in eastern germany - both culturally and socio-politically - towards " ostalgie , " a german expression made up of the words ost -lrb- east -rrb- and " nostalgia " . studies have also indicated an alarming lack of knowledge about the former communist regime among german schoolchildren . dw staff -lrb- jg -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de politics -pipe- 08.09.2008 report : cdu attempts to brake rise of left party großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the cdu aims to stress the inhumanity of east germany chancellor angela merkel 's christian democrats are planning to attempt to halt growing support for the left party with a campaign against the romanticization of former communist east germany . the party accuses the left party of playing down the negative aspects of east germany .
according to monday 's financial times germany -lrb- ftd -rrb- , the cdu leadership has prepared a keynote speech for its party conference in december in which east germany is described as the " germany 's second dictatorship " .
the document cited by the ftd stresses the lack of civil liberties in the german democratic republic .
it also stresses the desperate economic situation of the state at the time the wall came down .
the country was , according to the cdu paper , on the brink of " economic collapse " in 1989 . limbering up for the elections bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : its logo may be red , but that 's about the only thing the document , which is due to be discussed by the party executive over the next few days before being presented to december 's party conference , is intended to serve as the basis for the cdu 's electoral campaign in national elections in 2009 .
the cdu is searching for the right strategy to improve its support in eastern germany .
recent polls have put the conservatives and the left party neck-and-neck at 28 percent in the region .
the social democrats are trailing by several points .
the left has its main support base in the formerly communist eastern states but has also made strong inroads in western states in recent months .
in order to counter any tendencies to play down harmful aspects of the regime in the future , the cdu is also calling for more museums to be set up in former east german stasi -lrb- secret service -rrb- prisons and remaining border installations to be placed under preservation orders .
it also favors erecting freedom and unity monuments in leipzig , the center of opposition rallies against the gdr regime , and the german capital berlin . the cdu is also planning to use the speech to set out its differences from the social democrats , accusing the spd party leadership of attempting to block reunification .
recent years have seen a growing tendency in eastern germany - both culturally and socio-politically - towards " ostalgie , " a german expression made up of the words ost -lrb- east -rrb- and " nostalgia " . studies have also indicated an alarming lack of knowledge about the former communist regime among german schoolchildren . dw staff -lrb- jg -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the area he studies is in the indian ocean , off the coast of pakistan . there , at depths down to 3,000 meters , something fascinating is happening .
natural gas is emerging from the sea bed , to produce a surreal world of millions of tiny bubbles , which has already spurred the fancy of science fiction authors .
in these exotic surroundings , the scientist has discovered both new animal species and communities and new geological truths .
but the main questions that drive him are concerned with the methane gas emitted here .
how much is emitted , how does it affect the biological world of the deep sea , and how much reaches the surface to enter the atmosphere ?
that is also relevant to climate researchers , because methane is a major greenhouse gas that increases global warming .
heiko sahling takes tomorrow today viewers on an expedition on the meteor research vessel .

after two years of evaluation , experts warned that areas near the south-western edge of asse were unsafe .
their 1993 report found that up to 4,000 litres of water were flooding into the mine 's shafts each day .
it recommended that all shafts and caverns less than 750 metres below the earth ’ s surface should be stabilised to prevent possible collapse .
focus reports that although spd leaders in lower saxony received an updated report highlighting safety concerns in 1998 , they chose to keep the warnings under wraps .
the extent of the safety problems at asse were made public last week , prompting environment minister sigmar gabriel to transfer responsibility of the facility from the munich-based helmholtz institute for scientific research to the federal office for radiation protection .
waste disposal ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : in the 1960s researchers thought salt mines were ideal for storing nuclear waste nuclear power is often touted as being clean and carbon-friendly , but opponents point out that no one has yet found a durable solution for storing nuclear waste , which remains highly radioactive for centuries .
asse was converted into an atomic waste storage facility in the 1960s as a pilot project linked to plans for a permanent facility at another former salt mine at gorleben , lower saxony .
but problems at asse raise questions about the feasibility of the gorleben site at a time when germany ’ s grand coalition government is split on whether or not to reverse plans to abandon all nuclear power by 2021 .
political fallout chancellor angela merkel 's conservative christian democratic union -lrb- cdu -rrb- , which supports continued use of nuclear power , is worried that asse will undermine its calls for a rethink of the planned phase-out .
in a radio interview on sunday , merkel said there needed to be decisions about what to do with highly radioactive material .
" we do also need to make progress in the storage of highly radioactive material .
it 's about atomic plants .
a moratorium has been agreed for gorleben and of course decisions must be made on how things go from here , " merkel told deutschlandfunk radio .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : environment minister gabriel has assumed control of asse in its latest issue , der spiegel magazine quoted a strategy paper in which conservative lawmaker katherine reiche demanded that environment minister gabriel immediately lift the moratorium on exploring options for storing atomic waste at gorleben .
the moratorium is the result of battles between supporters of nuclear power , who unsuccessfully tried to rush through gorleben 's commissioning in the 1970s , and a powerful lobby of opponents for whom the unresolved storage question buys time to discredit nuclear energy .
der spiegel reports that a search for alternatives elsewhere , which gabriel and the social democrats prefer , would cost at least one billion euros .
if plans for the waste storage facility at gorleben are given up completely , energy companies could make compensation demands worth billions of euros . dw staff -lrb- sje -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?
dw-world.de dw-world : german nuclear storage facility hit by safety scandal german ministers agreed today that the asse nuclear waste deposit will be under the jurisdiction of the federal environment ministry after revelations this week of serious safety violations at the site .

power companies also admitted security procedures needed to be revamped .

for the last five years of her life she had been hounded by fraudsters from all over the world .
it all started when my mother replied to a very convincing letter telling her she had won a large amount of money and that she needed to send an administration fee to receive her prize .
although her cheque never arrived that letter was quickly followed by dozens more , all were saying that there was money waiting to be dispatched , and all giving reasons why she had to send off more money .
as soon as i realised what she was doing i tried to stop her , but it was useless .
relationship the scammers started to build up a relationship with her and the hold they had over her was so strong . "
it did n't take long before she started to send away all of her pension except for about £ 15 a week she would keep to live off " the letters ranged from looking really official to being very personal and friendly but they all had one thing in common , that they all gave a reason as to why her winnings were delayed .
either the money was in a so-called holding company or some other fictitious place that needed her cash to release it .
my mother became more and more hooked as the amount of mail increased .
some days she would receive around 30 letters a day .
it did n't take long before she started to send away all of her pension except for about £ 15 a week she would keep to live off .
the more i tried to persuade her that she was on a suckers list , the more we argued .
there was no way i could reason with her and although my mother and i were very close , these scammers started to tear us apart .
i could n't get her mail redirected without her consent and although i tried through every channel i could think of , nobody could help .
prediction as she continued to respond so called clairvoyants started to jump on the bandwagon , of course they also wanted money .
the clairvoyants all knew she had " won " large amounts of money and they also knew she was " surrounded by bad luck " so they promised to remove this negative energy for a fee , and so it went on .
there would be times she would sit up until about 3am struggling to read through the piles of what she started to call documents .
all this started to have an effect on both her physical and mental health .
at times she would telephone me in the early hours saying she had been threatened by firebombs from these evil beings if she did n't pay up .
i have recorded some of these phone calls .
i realised that she was also being plagued by phone calls and changed her phone number , but they soon found it again .
my mother must have put it on another bogus claim form .
many times my mother would tell me she had stopped sending off her money .
but now have seen her bank books and spoken to the staff at the building society , i realised she had been doing it continually for five years .
tragic eventually at the beginning of august 2007 the scam mail took its toll and my mother was admitted to hospital . "
many of the letters swore her to secrecy or told her to read away from prying eyes " it was at this time that i took her building society pass book and forged her signature to get her mail redirected .
but it was too late , i knew she did n't have long to live so i decided to go along with her to stop the arguing .
it broke my heart but i even took her out in the wheelchair looking for things she could buy with her " winnings " .
my mother only came home for a short while and died on 24 october .
she still spoke about sharing the money between the family days before she died .
when clearing her house i removed about 30,000 letters all tightly knotted in carrier bags .
they were pushed in drawers and cupboards and her shed was full of them .
many of the letters swore her to secrecy or told her to read away from prying eyes .
some asked for passport photos saying they were for a winners magazine .
others asked for personal information about the victim and family members in a quest to discover passwords or steal her identity .
some were threatening .
it sickens me to think how my lovely mother was hounded and robbed of the last five years of her life .
its easy for people to say " just throw this kind of mail in the bin " but because of her age my mother 's mind was not as sharp as others , and receiving this kind of mail started her to deteriorate mentally .
although i could see this happening , without her cooperation i could n't get medical help .
the last five years of my mother 's life were a nightmare not only for her but for me as well .
that is why we need to raise awareness of this evil crime and stop this happening to the elderly and vulnerable people of our society .

for the last five years of her life she had been hounded by fraudsters from all over the world .
it all started when my mother replied to a very convincing letter telling her she had won a large amount of money and that she needed to send an administration fee to receive her prize .
although her cheque never arrived that letter was quickly followed by dozens more , all were saying that there was money waiting to be dispatched , and all giving reasons why she had to send off more money .
as soon as i realised what she was doing i tried to stop her , but it was useless .
relationship the scammers started to build up a relationship with her and the hold they had over her was so strong .
it did n't take long before she started to send away all of her pension except for about £ 15 a week she would keep to live off the letters ranged from looking really official to being very personal and friendly but they all had one thing in common , that they all gave a reason as to why her winnings were delayed .
either the money was in a so-called holding company or some other fictitious place that needed her cash to release it .
my mother became more and more hooked as the amount of mail increased .
some days she would receive around 30 letters a day .
it did n't take long before she started to send away all of her pension except for about £ 15 a week she would keep to live off .
the more i tried to persuade her that she was on a suckers list , the more we argued .
there was no way i could reason with her and although my mother and i were very close , these scammers started to tear us apart .
i could n't get her mail redirected without her consent and although i tried through every channel i could think of , nobody could help .
prediction as she continued to respond so called clairvoyants started to jump on the bandwagon , of course they also wanted money .
the situation strained the relationship between mother and daughter the clairvoyants all knew she had " won " large amounts of money and they also knew she was " surrounded by bad luck " so they promised to remove this negative energy for a fee , and so it went on .
there would be times she would sit up until about 3am struggling to read through the piles of what she started to call documents .
all this started to have an effect on both her physical and mental health .
at times she would telephone me in the early hours saying she had been threatened by firebombs from these evil beings if she did n't pay up .
i have recorded some of these phone calls .
i realised that she was also being plagued by phone calls and changed her phone number , but they soon found it again .

by vaudine england bbc news fierce fighting erupted in the southern philippines at the start of august just over a month ago , prospects for peace in the troubled southern philippines looked brighter than in a long time .
a memorandum of agreement on ancestral domain had been drawn up , extending the land area to be administered by autonomous muslim leaders .
mediators had helped maintain a ceasefire ; a compromise definition of the eternally sticky concept of ancestral domain appeared possible .
now , the moa is dead , the negotiating panel abolished , the ceasefire abandoned and hopes for peace dashed .
" it was in 1996 that then president -lrb- fidel -rrb- ramos reached a peace deal with the mnlf -lrb- moro national liberation front -rrb- .
negotiations resumed under president -lrb- gloria -rrb- arroyo in 2001 .
" so now we 've lost 12 years , we 've lost ground , we 've lost goodwill , " said marites vitug , author of several books about mindanao and editor of newsbreak , a philippines news magazine .
the mnlf and the moro islamic liberation front -lrb- milf -rrb- have been fighting for greater autonomy in the south for four decades .
muslims make up about 5 % of the mainly catholic philippines and have long felt marginalised .
conflict returns in the past few months , negotiations between the arroyo government and the milf appeared to be making progress - until the philippine supreme court blocked ratification .
on 5 august , government officials and foreign diplomats flocked to malaysia - which mediated the process - for the planned signing of the moa , only to retreat red-faced .
the court was responding to virulent protests by christian communities in areas of mindanao that the agreement would convert into muslim-controlled lands .
conflict immediately broke out on the ground , with philippine military claims that muslim rebels were occupying villages being countered by milf complaints that the government could not be trusted .
with perhaps half a million people displaced and some hundreds killed , observers now concur that two milf commanders - kato and bravo - did launch attacks in lanao del norte and north cotabato .
the milf leadership has blamed the attacks on what it calls these two " renegade " commanders , but refuses to hand them over .
" we were informed that long before 5 august , the military had been moving troops into an area in lanao del norte that was close to an milf camp and so the milf shored up their forces - this could explain why hostilities were so quick to break out , " said amina rasul , director of the philippine council for islam and democracy , a manila-based think tank .
what she can not understand is why long-standing mechanisms of ceasefire enforcement were not activated , mediators brought in and the violence stopped .
" instead , both sides went at each other .
instead of cool heads prevailing , military action immediately took place , " ms rasul said .
mutual weakness with the peace process in tatters , analysts are now trying to work out where it all went wrong .
not only have communities been shattered by the worst outbreak of fighting in five years , but the credibility of both sides has been perhaps fatally damaged .
for milf commander ebrahim murad , his ability to keep his group united after the death of his admired predecessor salamat hashim had rested in part on his ability to deliver benefits from the peace process .
his achievement of a deal had raised his stock considerably , and its collapse weakens him and the moderate voices for peace within the milf .
as for ms arroyo , explanations for her government 's failure to achieve peace in the south range from conspiracy to incompetence .
my own conclusion is that there was simply no strategic thinking about any of this marites vitug , writer and journalist her supporters insist that their intentions in pushing the moa through government were honourable , but when the milf launched attacks on villages last month , the armed forces had no choice but to react to protect civilians .
the government says it can not negotiate further with groups that conduct violent attacks and that the focus is now to talk with " communities " .
the government 's new approach , said executive secretary eduardo ermita , was that talks with the milf could only resume after its disarmament , demobilisation and rehabilitation .
" it was like we were being blackmailed and threatened at the expense of the civilians , " he said .
conspiracy theory outside government , determining moral ascendancy is much more difficult , with some analysts suggesting the deal was designed to fail .
a devious plan is attributed to ms arroyo , based on an unsupported claim that it suited the government for the peace deal to collapse - that her government was eager for a return to fighting to justify a declaration of martial law to prolong her time in office .
" we look at her track record of promises and broken promises , and it does n't give us confidence that she has put the interests of the country as paramount , " said ms rasul .
but some analysts discount the conspiracy approach entirely .
aid agencies are trying to help communities displaced by the violence " i do n't buy any of these theories ; my own conclusion is that there was simply no strategic thinking about any of this , " said ms vitug .
she argues that throughout the process , ms arroyo sent mixed signals to her negotiators on the deal .
other analysts suggest the arroyo administration appeared to lose interest in the process from time to time and failed to build necessary support and alliances to see the deal through .
" maybe a more popular president could have pulled this off , " said ms vitug .
return to war ?
predicting what happens next is a fool 's game , with some analysts saying a return to all-out fighting is imminent , a split in the milf likely , and the link-up of milf splinter groups with radical islamists around south east asia a real danger .
philippine defence officials say they intend to pour troops into lanao del norte and north cotabato in order to dampen tensions and protect civilians .
some leading generals , committed to the peace process , would not want to see the milf break up or forge links with regional terror groups .
these generals note that the milf is a local ethnic insurgency that wants peace , and the door to future talks must be kept open .
if that attitude prevails , fresh outbreaks of violence could be limited and , though undoubtedly weakened , the milf leadership could keep a leash on its younger , more radical members .
two presidential advisers are supposed to visit kuala lumpur to discuss the naming of a new negotiating panel .
but while the veneer of a continuing process exists , any return to talks will take time .
what is certain is that mutual trust has been destroyed for now , and many analysts are concluding that little positive will be achieved until after the arroyo government 's term ends in 2010 .

" so now we 've lost 12 years , we 've lost ground , we 've lost goodwill , " said marites vitug , author of several books about mindanao and editor of newsbreak , a philippines news magazine .
the mnlf and the moro islamic liberation front -lrb- milf -rrb- have been fighting for greater autonomy in the south for four decades .
muslims make up about 5 % of the mainly catholic philippines and have long felt marginalised .
conflict returns in the past few months , negotiations between the arroyo government and the milf appeared to be making progress - until the philippine supreme court blocked ratification .
on 5 august , government officials and foreign diplomats flocked to malaysia - which mediated the process - for the planned signing of the moa , only to retreat red-faced .
the court was responding to virulent protests by christian communities in areas of mindanao that the agreement would convert into muslim-controlled lands .
conflict immediately broke out on the ground , with philippine military claims that muslim rebels were occupying villages being countered by milf complaints that the government could not be trusted .
with perhaps half a million people displaced and some hundreds killed , observers now concur that two milf commanders - kato and bravo - did launch attacks in lanao del norte and north cotabato .
the milf leadership has blamed the attacks on what it calls these two " renegade " commanders , but refuses to hand them over .
" we were informed that long before 5 august , the military had been moving troops into an area in lanao del norte that was close to an milf camp and so the milf shored up their forces - this could explain why hostilities were so quick to break out , " said amina rasul , director of the philippine council for islam and democracy , a manila-based think tank .
what she can not understand is why long-standing mechanisms of ceasefire enforcement were not activated , mediators brought in and the violence stopped .
" instead , both sides went at each other .
instead of cool heads prevailing , military action immediately took place , " ms rasul said .
mutual weakness with the peace process in tatters , analysts are now trying to work out where it all went wrong .
not only have communities been shattered by the worst outbreak of fighting in five years , but the credibility of both sides has been perhaps fatally damaged .
for milf commander ebrahim murad , his ability to keep his group united after the death of his admired predecessor salamat hashim had rested in part on his ability to deliver benefits from the peace process .
his achievement of a deal had raised his stock considerably , and its collapse weakens him and the moderate voices for peace within the milf .
as for ms arroyo , explanations for her government 's failure to achieve peace in the south range from conspiracy to incompetence .
my own conclusion is that there was simply no strategic thinking about any of this marites vitug , writer and journalist her supporters insist that their intentions in pushing the moa through government were honourable , but when the milf launched attacks on villages last month , the armed forces had no choice but to react to protect civilians .
the government says it can not negotiate further with groups that conduct violent attacks and that the focus is now to talk with " communities " .
the government 's new approach , said executive secretary eduardo ermita , was that talks with the milf could only resume after its disarmament , demobilisation and rehabilitation .
" it was like we were being blackmailed and threatened at the expense of the civilians , " he said .
conspiracy theory outside government , determining moral ascendancy is much more difficult , with some analysts suggesting the deal was designed to fail .
a devious plan is attributed to ms arroyo , based on an unsupported claim that it suited the government for the peace deal to collapse - that her government was eager for a return to fighting to justify a declaration of martial law to prolong her time in office .
" we look at her track record of promises and broken promises , and it does n't give us confidence that she has put the interests of the country as paramount , " said ms rasul .
but some analysts discount the conspiracy approach entirely .
aid agencies are trying to help communities displaced by the violence " i do n't buy any of these theories ; my own conclusion is that there was simply no strategic thinking about any of this , " said ms vitug .
she argues that throughout the process , ms arroyo sent mixed signals to her negotiators on the deal .
other analysts suggest the arroyo administration appeared to lose interest in the process from time to time and failed to build necessary support and alliances to see the deal through .
" maybe a more popular president could have pulled this off , " said ms vitug .
return to war ?
predicting what happens next is a fool 's game , with some analysts saying a return to all-out fighting is imminent , a split in the milf likely , and the link-up of milf splinter groups with radical islamists around south east asia a real danger .
philippine defence officials say they intend to pour troops into lanao del norte and north cotabato in order to dampen tensions and protect civilians .
some leading generals , committed to the peace process , would not want to see the milf break up or forge links with regional terror groups .
these generals note that the milf is a local ethnic insurgency that wants peace , and the door to future talks must be kept open .
if that attitude prevails , fresh outbreaks of violence could be limited and , though undoubtedly weakened , the milf leadership could keep a leash on its younger , more radical members .
two presidential advisers are supposed to visit kuala lumpur to discuss the naming of a new negotiating panel .
but while the veneer of a continuing process exists , any return to talks will take time .
what is certain is that mutual trust has been destroyed for now , and many analysts are concluding that little positive will be achieved until after the arroyo government 's term ends in 2010 .

some leading generals , committed to the peace process , would not want to see the milf break up or forge links with regional terror groups .
these generals note that the milf is a local ethnic insurgency that wants peace , and the door to future talks must be kept open .
if that attitude prevails , fresh outbreaks of violence could be limited and , though undoubtedly weakened , the milf leadership could keep a leash on its younger , more radical members .
two presidential advisers are supposed to visit kuala lumpur to discuss the naming of a new negotiating panel .
but while the veneer of a continuing process exists , any return to talks will take time .
what is certain is that mutual trust has been destroyed for now , and many analysts are concluding that little positive will be achieved until after the arroyo government 's term ends in 2010 .

the club has announced outline plans to build a 50,000-seat , £ 100m stadium close to the watersports venue .
the club said the city ground could not handle large events and an earlier proposal to move to clifton had been rejected .
rushcliffe borough council has welcomed the idea and said fears over flooding could be overcome with planning .
the club said access problems at the city ground on the river trent , which has been its home since 1898 , were the main reason it was keen to find a new venue .
it originally announced plans to move to clifton by 2014 , but the club said developers decided against that location . "
we recognise there are engineering solutions to these things in this day and age " allen graham officials admitted the holme pierrepont site was on a flood plain deemed unsuitable for housing - but said this did not make the idea unworkable .
rushcliffe borough council 's chief executive allen graham recognised there were " a number of hurdles " before the plan could become reality .
" it is important that the people sign up for the vision , i think that is the first thing to say .
" in the longer term - when the plans come in - obviously because it is on a flood plain it would have to be looked at very carefully .
" but we recognise there are engineering solutions to these things in this day and age and that is something that would have to be looked at . "
the stadium would be part of a bid to attract the 2018 world cup to england .
the city needs to put in an official bid by 2010 in order to host world cup matches and needs a stadium with a capacity of 45,000 .
a new bridge over the river trent is also thought to be necessary for a successful project , forest officials have suggested .

the club has announced outline plans to build a 50,000-seat , £ 100m stadium close to the watersports venue .
the club said the city ground could not handle large events and an earlier proposal to move to clifton had been rejected .
rushcliffe borough council has welcomed the idea and said fears over flooding could be overcome with planning .
the club said access problems at the city ground on the river trent , which has been its home since 1898 , were the main reason it was keen to find a new venue .
it originally announced plans to move to clifton by 2014 , but the club said developers decided against that location .
we recognise there are engineering solutions to these things in this day and age allen graham officials admitted the holme pierrepont site was on a flood plain deemed unsuitable for housing - but said this did not make the idea unworkable .
rushcliffe borough council 's chief executive allen graham recognised there were " a number of hurdles " before the plan could become reality .
" it is important that the people sign up for the vision , i think that is the first thing to say .
" in the longer term - when the plans come in - obviously because it is on a flood plain it would have to be looked at very carefully .
" but we recognise there are engineering solutions to these things in this day and age and that is something that would have to be looked at . "
the stadium would be part of a bid to attract the 2018 world cup to england .
the city needs to put in an official bid by 2010 in order to host world cup matches and needs a stadium with a capacity of 45,000 .
a new bridge over the river trent is also thought to be necessary for a successful project , forest officials have suggested .

the club said access problems at the city ground on the river trent , which has been its home since 1898 , were the main reason it was keen to find a new venue .

bbc news -pipe- science & environment -pipe- germany leads ' clean coal ' pilot bbc news / science & environment graphics version bbc sport home news front page -pipe- africa -pipe- americas -pipe- asia-pacific -pipe- europe -pipe- middle east -pipe- south asia -pipe- uk -pipe- business -pipe- health -pipe- science & environment -pipe- technology -pipe- entertainment -pipe- also in the news -pipe- have your say -pipe- 08:25 gmt , monday , 8 september 2008 09:25 uk germany leads ' clean coal ' pilot by roger harrabin environment analyst , bbc news , germany beneath the gargantuan grey boiler towers of schwarze pumpe power station which pierce the skies of northern germany , a lilliputian puzzle of metal boxes and shining canisters is about to mark a moment of industrial history .
this mini power plant is a pilot project for carbon capture and storage -lrb- ccs -rrb- - the first coal-fired plant in the world ready to capture and store its own co2 emissions .
next week the pilot - an oxyfuel boiler - will be formally commissioned .
a cloud of pure oxygen will be breathed into the boiler .
the flame will be lit .
then a cloud of powdered lignite will be injected .
the outcome will be heat , water vapour , impurities , nine tonnes of co2 an hour , and a landmark in clean technology .
because the co2 will then be separated , squashed to one 500th of its original volume and squeezed into a cylinder ready to be transported to a gas field and forced 1,000m below the surface into porous rock where it should stay until long after mankind has stopped worrying about climate change .
this is the technology once lavishly described by the former uk chief scientist sir david king as " the only hope for mankind " .
the plant operators , vattenfall , have worked furiously for two years to get the pilot running .
" we are very proud - we think this is the future for coal , " says vattenfall 's hubertus altmann .
they funded the 70m-euro project themselves because they wanted to lead a technology they believe solves the conundrum of providing energy security through plentiful coal supplies whilst avoiding the co2 emissions officially blamed for climate change .
' too expensive , too late ' green-carpeted marquees are currently being furnished for the guests who will swell the applause at the grand inauguration .
but big questions hang over this technology overall , particularly over where the co2 will be stored and who will pay the high costs of building and running the ccs plants .
greenpeace is among the environmental groups expressing reservations .
access all areas in video : inside the ccs plant " our concern is that this technology is used to justify the construction of more coal power plants , " says tobias munchmeyer .
" it 's too expensive , it will come too late and it will divert money from the real solutions , renewable energies and energy efficiency . "
the eu wants to see 10-12 full-scale power plants demonstrating co2 capture within the next few years .
but although a number of other firms will soon join the race with pilot projects , no full-scale ccs coal plant has yet been commissioned .
the british government has promised a decision in october on how it will fund a full-scale ccs in the uk .
it hopes to avoid landing the taxpayer with the bill , but questions over ccs funding in europe are as yet unresolved by the european commission and the european parliament .
the main options are : new rules mandating that all coal power plants must be fitted with ccs - ie industry and the consumer will pay direct funding from the eu or member states -lrb- but member states do not want to pay -rrb- a feed-in tariff so generators get a premium for the amount of co2 they sequester .
monitoring may be difficult creating a new fund within the eu 's emission trading scheme -lrb- euets -rrb- , which would give firms valuable carbon credits for every stored tonne of co2 .
this would cost nothing but might undermine the co2 market setting a co2 emission limit for all new power stations of , say , 350g of co2 per kilowatt hour of electricity .
this would make it impossible to build a coal plant which did not capture at least some of its co2 .
this option is being pushed hard by uk conservatives taking cash from euets auctioning .
the permits for big firms to emit co2 will be auctioned from 2013 -lrb- at the moment , they are given away -rrb- .
this will raise many billions - some of which could be diverted to fund ccs projects .
all the options would benefit from the sort of certainty over future carbon prices that would be provided by the successor to the kyoto protocol - but that is facing severe difficulties .
and , meanwhile , industry is crying out for politicians to make an early decision so it can invest the billions that are needed .
from the today programme more from today programme " we need ccs urgently because the world is building a whole new generation of coal power plants and unless we find out whether this technology operates at scale and we can make these plants zero-carbon in the future , those will be a liability , " says nick mabey of the think-tank e3g .
" the uk has talked a good game on this , it has said it wants to build a demonstration , but it 's yet to show where the money is going to come from for the plants it wants built in europe and worldwide . "
part of the problem is that the exact cost of large-scale ccs is unknown .
this has left green groups uncertain and divided on the topic .
the latest estimates suggest ccs power will cost roughly the same as wind power - maybe 50 % more than it does at the moment .
the firms providing the technology are doing their best to re-assure national treasuries that they can do it at a price which leaves coal competitive .
philippe joubert , of alstom , who built the oxyfuel boiler at schwarze pumpe , said : " we will have a very good indication one or two years from now where we will have the first result of the bigger size demonstration plant .
" currently we are at 5 mw ; it 's not enough to set a price .
in our business , the size is a real issue , and if you start to have a real market , probably the price will drop . "
the real test of ccs , though , is not in europe .
the global co2 savings many scientists believe are needed to control global warming are only likely to happen if politicians in rich nations are ready to ignore high energy prices , put up the price of their cheapest fuel through ccs - and then help developing countries to do the same .

this mini power plant is a pilot project for carbon capture and storage -lrb- ccs -rrb- - the first coal-fired plant in the world ready to capture and store its own co2 emissions .
next week the pilot - an oxyfuel boiler - will be formally commissioned .
a cloud of pure oxygen will be breathed into the boiler .
the flame will be lit .
then a cloud of powdered lignite will be injected .
the outcome will be heat , water vapour , impurities , nine tonnes of co2 an hour , and a landmark in clean technology .
because the co2 will then be separated , squashed to one 500th of its original volume and squeezed into a cylinder ready to be transported to a gas field and forced 1,000m below the surface into porous rock where it should stay until long after mankind has stopped worrying about climate change .
this is the technology once lavishly described by the former uk chief scientist sir david king as " the only hope for mankind " .
the plant operators , vattenfall , have worked furiously for two years to get the pilot running .
" we are very proud - we think this is the future for coal , " says vattenfall 's hubertus altmann .
they funded the 70m-euro project themselves because they wanted to lead a technology they believe solves the conundrum of providing energy security through plentiful coal supplies whilst avoiding the co2 emissions officially blamed for climate change .
' too expensive , too late ' green-carpeted marquees are currently being furnished for the guests who will swell the applause at the grand inauguration .
but big questions hang over this technology overall , particularly over where the co2 will be stored and who will pay the high costs of building and running the ccs plants .
greenpeace is among the environmental groups expressing reservations .
access all areas in video : inside the ccs plant " our concern is that this technology is used to justify the construction of more coal power plants , " says tobias munchmeyer .
" it 's too expensive , it will come too late and it will divert money from the real solutions , renewable energies and energy efficiency . "
the eu wants to see 10-12 full-scale power plants demonstrating co2 capture within the next few years .
but although a number of other firms will soon join the race with pilot projects , no full-scale ccs coal plant has yet been commissioned .
the british government has promised a decision in october on how it will fund a full-scale ccs in the uk .
it hopes to avoid landing the taxpayer with the bill , but questions over ccs funding in europe are as yet unresolved by the european commission and the european parliament .
the main options are : new rules mandating that all coal power plants must be fitted with ccs - ie industry and the consumer will pay direct funding from the eu or member states -lrb- but member states do not want to pay -rrb- a feed-in tariff so generators get a premium for the amount of co2 they sequester .
monitoring may be difficult creating a new fund within the eu 's emission trading scheme -lrb- euets -rrb- , which would give firms valuable carbon credits for every stored tonne of co2 .
this would cost nothing but might undermine the co2 market setting a co2 emission limit for all new power stations of , say , 350g of co2 per kilowatt hour of electricity .
this would make it impossible to build a coal plant which did not capture at least some of its co2 .
this option is being pushed hard by uk conservatives taking cash from euets auctioning .
the permits for big firms to emit co2 will be auctioned from 2013 -lrb- at the moment , they are given away -rrb- .
this will raise many billions - some of which could be diverted to fund ccs projects .

" the uk has talked a good game on this , it has said it wants to build a demonstration , but it 's yet to show where the money is going to come from for the plants it wants built in europe and worldwide . "
part of the problem is that the exact cost of large-scale ccs is unknown .
this has left green groups uncertain and divided on the topic .
the latest estimates suggest ccs power will cost roughly the same as wind power - maybe 50 % more than it does at the moment .
coal supplies are plentiful ; the issue is co2 emissions the firms providing the technology are doing their best to re-assure national treasuries that they can do it at a price which leaves coal competitive .
philippe joubert , of alstom , who built the oxyfuel boiler at schwarze pumpe , said : " we will have a very good indication one or two years from now where we will have the first result of the bigger size demonstration plant .
" currently we are at 5 mw ; it 's not enough to set a price .
in our business , the size is a real issue , and if you start to have a real market , probably the price will drop . "
the real test of ccs , though , is not in europe .
the global co2 savings many scientists believe are needed to control global warming are only likely to happen if politicians in rich nations are ready to ignore high energy prices , put up the price of their cheapest fuel through ccs - and then help developing countries to do the same .

this mini power plant is a pilot project for carbon capture and storage -lrb- ccs -rrb- - the first coal-fired plant in the world ready to capture and store its own co2 emissions .
next week the pilot - an oxyfuel boiler - will be formally commissioned .
a cloud of pure oxygen will be breathed into the boiler .
the flame will be lit .
then a cloud of powdered lignite will be injected .
the outcome will be heat , water vapour , impurities , nine tonnes of co2 an hour , and a landmark in clean technology .
because the co2 will then be separated , squashed to one 500th of its original volume and squeezed into a cylinder ready to be transported to a gas field and forced 1,000m below the surface into porous rock where it should stay until long after mankind has stopped worrying about climate change .
this is the technology once lavishly described by the former uk chief scientist sir david king as " the only hope for mankind " .
the plant operators , vattenfall , have worked furiously for two years to get the pilot running .
" we are very proud - we think this is the future for coal , " says vattenfall 's hubertus altmann .
they funded the 70m-euro project themselves because they wanted to lead a technology they believe solves the conundrum of providing energy security through plentiful coal supplies whilst avoiding the co2 emissions officially blamed for climate change .
' too expensive , too late ' green-carpeted marquees are currently being furnished for the guests who will swell the applause at the grand inauguration .
but big questions hang over this technology overall , particularly over where the co2 will be stored and who will pay the high costs of building and running the ccs plants .
greenpeace is among the environmental groups expressing reservations .
access all areas in video : inside the ccs plant " our concern is that this technology is used to justify the construction of more coal power plants , " says tobias munchmeyer .
" it 's too expensive , it will come too late and it will divert money from the real solutions , renewable energies and energy efficiency . "
the eu wants to see 10-12 full-scale power plants demonstrating co2 capture within the next few years .
but although a number of other firms will soon join the race with pilot projects , no full-scale ccs coal plant has yet been commissioned .
the british government has promised a decision in october on how it will fund a full-scale ccs in the uk .
it hopes to avoid landing the taxpayer with the bill , but questions over ccs funding in europe are as yet unresolved by the european commission and the european parliament .
the main options are : new rules mandating that all coal power plants must be fitted with ccs - ie industry and the consumer will pay direct funding from the eu or member states -lrb- but member states do not want to pay -rrb- a feed-in tariff so generators get a premium for the amount of co2 they sequester .
monitoring may be difficult creating a new fund within the eu 's emission trading scheme -lrb- euets -rrb- , which would give firms valuable carbon credits for every stored tonne of co2 .
this would cost nothing but might undermine the co2 market setting a co2 emission limit for all new power stations of , say , 350g of co2 per kilowatt hour of electricity .
this would make it impossible to build a coal plant which did not capture at least some of its co2 .
this option is being pushed hard by uk conservatives taking cash from euets auctioning .
the permits for big firms to emit co2 will be auctioned from 2013 -lrb- at the moment , they are given away -rrb- .
this will raise many billions - some of which could be diverted to fund ccs projects .
all the options would benefit from the sort of certainty over future carbon prices that would be provided by the successor to the kyoto protocol - but that is facing severe difficulties .
and , meanwhile , industry is crying out for politicians to make an early decision so it can invest the billions that are needed .

more than 1,000 properties were affected , with morpeth being hardest hit as about 400 people were moved to safety .
no-one was seriously hurt .
council officials say it will be months before everyone affected will be allowed back into their homes .
floods recovery minister john healey was due to meet residents in morpeth and emergency services staff on monday .
water levels were subsiding on monday , but forecasts for more rain on tuesday could see the river wansbeck burst its banks again .
more than 40 flood warnings remain in force in the north-east of england and cumbria .
at its peak morpeth high street was under 2ft -lrb- 0.6m -rrb- of water , with the environment agency recording almost 6ins -lrb- 150mm -rrb- of rain falling in the area on friday and saturday .
the town 's library suffered some structural damage , with local authority engineers assessing its safety .
ken dunbar , chief executive of castle morpeth council , said : " the biggest problem is the hundreds of families that were evacuated from their homes .
" we will have to accommodate a lot of homeless people and they need to know that this will take weeks if not months .
" this has been a highly traumatic experience , but we should be glad that there was no loss of life . "
prime minister gordon brown has asked mr healey to report back to him on the situation in the north east .
while in northumberland , mr healey will announce the government will operate the bellwin scheme , which provides emergency state financial aid to local authorities to meet the costs of an emergency or disaster .
later in the week , the minister will meet insurance industry chiefs to discuss their plans for dealing with what may be a large number of claims in affected areas as quickly and effectively as possible .
paul hedley , of northumberland fire and rescue service , described morpeth as " a scene of utter devastation . "
firefighters , ambulance crews , the raf and the rnli were among the emergency services involved in rescue an recovery operations over the weekend .
other parts of the region were bit by torrential rainfall , including parts of county durham and teesside .
lustrum beck , in stockton-on-tees , and keswick campsite in cumbria were also flooded .
the chief executive of northumberland county council , steve stewart , praised the town 's residents for their " spirit " .
most major road routes in the region are open .
but a section of the tyne and wear metro between kingston park and newcastle airport remains closed after callerston parkway station was flooded .
the environment agency 's regional flood defence manager mark tinnion said flood defences helped to prevent the situation worsening .
he said recently completed defence schemes for south church and west auckland and hexham operated as planned , along with defences at ponteland , yarm , croft and stokesley .
together , these prevented around 1,200 properties from flooding .
mr tinnion added : " river levels are now starting to fall , however we would ask people to remain vigilant . "

in a tv address , president lula said brazil would not squander the money but invest in technology and education .
the exact scale of the deepwater fields , discovered last year , is not known but president lula believes they could triple brazil 's reserves .
their discovery has sparked an intense debate over how to use the profits .
in an address marking brazil 's independence day , president lula said test drilling on 2 september was a symbolic moment in the country 's life , " the opening of a direct bridge between natural wealth and the eradication of poverty " .
it was not clear how many billions of barrels the reserves of oil and gas contained but they would make brazil one of the biggest producers in the world , the president said .
" brazil does not wish to be a mere exporter of crude .
on the contrary , we want to add value to our oil by exporting derivatives which are worth more , " he said .
brazil aimed to have a sophisticated oil industry and in the coming years would build five new refineries , dozens of drilling rigs and platforms , as well as hundreds of ships , lula said .
" we wo n't allow ourselves to be dazzled and go spending money that we still do n't have on silly things , " he added .
" -lrb- the reserves -rrb- are a passport for the future .
their main destination , i repeat , must be for the education of new generations and combating poverty . "

in a tv address , president lula said brazil would not squander the money but invest in technology and education .
the exact scale of the deepwater fields , discovered last year , is not known but president lula believes they could triple brazil 's reserves .
their discovery has sparked an intense debate over how to use the profits .
in an address marking brazil 's independence day , president lula said test drilling on 2 september was a symbolic moment in the country 's life , " the opening of a direct bridge between natural wealth and the eradication of poverty " .
it was not clear how many billions of barrels the reserves of oil and gas contained but they would make brazil one of the biggest producers in the world , the president said .
" brazil does not wish to be a mere exporter of crude .
on the contrary , we want to add value to our oil by exporting derivatives which are worth more , " he said .
brazil aimed to have a sophisticated oil industry and in the coming years would build five new refineries , dozens of drilling rigs and platforms , as well as hundreds of ships , lula said .
" we wo n't allow ourselves to be dazzled and go spending money that we still do n't have on silly things , " he added .
