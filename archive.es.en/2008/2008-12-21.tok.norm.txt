detthold aden , head of the blg logistics group , which administers the facility said they ca n't move the cars , work on them or deliver them until they find buyers .
roll-on roll-off vessels delivering new cars or loading them up for export have always been a welcome sight in the bustling port .
that is not the case for the nine large car carriers tied up this weekend .
the vessels are bringing cars that nobody wants .
instead of setting a turnover record , the terminal is rapidly becoming one of the world 's biggest parking lots .
japanese family cars compete for the few remaining spaces available with korean sports utility vehicles , german sports cars , delivery vans and even combined harvesters and bulldozers .
normally there are between 60,000 and 80,000 vehicles in the terminal at any given time .
some for as little as several hours , others for up to a month .
in two adjacent technical centers , newly imported vehicles are cleaned and polished , or given a " haircut and shave , " as the workers jokingly say .
other models are fitted with special parts .
changing times bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : many of the cars waiting are asian imports which were on their way to germany before the crisis hit the auto industry it was less than year ago that the terminal set a turnover record of two million vehicles for a 12-month period .
there were cars from asia , from factories in germany or from the plants of german carmakers overseas .
" now we 're on course for 2.2 million new vehicles , " said ralf nagel , the senator in charge of the region 's economic development , just five months ago .
some 1.08 million vehicles passed through the terminal in the first six months of this year , 9.3 percent more than in the corresponding period of 2007 .
but the economic crisis has brought activity almost to a standstill .
when cars roll off ships like the danube highway or morning champion , they come to a halt after just a few meters because there is no room for them on land .
blg has been forced to find extra space in the area of the port normally reserved for shipping containers .
other cars are temporarily stored on freight trains .
ships normally jam-packed with vehicles destined for the united states are now leaving almost empty because of the dramatic downturn on the us car market .

when automobile manufactures published details of their shrinking sales , many of the cars now languishing in the port were already on their way to germany .
" it 's a difficult situation , because many imported cars and those destined for export are still on their way here " said aden .
the terminal and its surrounding area have a maximum capacity of around 100,000 vehicles .
this figure could be reached at the end of the year , ader said .
after that the storage situation might ease because many car firms have slashed production .
" we anticipate a 25 percent reduction in the number of vehicles transiting bremerhaven in the first quarter of 2009 , " said ader .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de health -pipe- 21.12.2008 " a new chance at life " : a look at organ donation in germany großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a new kidney can put an end to lengthy dialysis treatments organ failure often means death , especially when there is a shortage of organ donors .
in germany , over 4,000 transplants occur each year , but there are still too few organ donors when compared to those in need . to help even the balance - and increase the chances of survival for many - the european commission recently set forth two new proposals for making organ donations and transplants easier .
one of the most important aspects laid out in these proposals is the introduction of transplantation coordinators for all large hospitals .
it 's a move that 's been quite successful in several eu countries , including spain .
and it 's one that germany will soon make , too .
“ there are far too few organ donors in germany , ” said wolfgang arns , head of the transplantation station at cologne 's merheim hospital .
“ patients sometimes have to wait five , six , seven years and while they wait , they become sicker and sicker .
unfortunately that means watching as a patient 's health slips away , making them no longer ideal recipients of a transplant .
they simply die while they wait . ”
like winning the lottery in germany , three people die every day while waiting on the transplant list .
with only 4,000 organs donated each year , making it off the waiting list can seem like winning the lottery .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a donor shortage can make transplant recipients feel like lottery winners “ when the call comes , you 're just beside yourself , ” said hermann meters , a recent recipient of a new kidney .
“ you 're so happy at that moment , you become absolutely scatterbrained . ”
benjamin hoffmann , who got a second chance at life recently when he received a new kidney , agreed .
for seven-and-a-half years , the 27-year-old had to endure dialysis while waiting for an organ donor to come along .
“ three times a week , for five hours at a time , i 'd be stuck with a needle and have to wait as my blood was filtered , ” said hoffmann .
kidneys , which cleanse the body of impurities while also making sure that the body has enough salt and fluid , are the most frequently transplanted organs in germany .
though hoffmann is quite happy to have finally made if off the waiting list , he prefers not think about where his new organ came from .
“ it 's better not to think that it may have come from someone who died , ” he said .
“ it 's better to simply enjoy it , this beginning of a new life . ”
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some recipients feel guilty about having taken another 's heart though one person who is listed as an organ donor can save up to seven lives when he or she dies , kidney donations can likewise come from living donors .
for now , hoffmann only knows that his organ donor was about 50 years old .
ensuring neutrality eurotransplant , an organization based in leiden , the netherlands , arranged the transplant with hoffmann 's physician , arns .
they wo n't reveal more details , as some recipients have problems coming to terms with the idea that they are living with an organ donated by someone who may be dead .
“ working with a distribution center like eurotransplant ensures that decisions remain neutral , ” said arns .
“ they have a compulsory schedule that they use to seek out potential recipients . ”
following set criteria - blood type , urgency of need , the patient 's time spent on the waiting list , among other things - the center chooses who will receive the next transplant .
the organ is then shipped to one of the seven european countries which subscribe to the center 's services and is delivered to the appropriate hospital .
the bad news : side effects once selected , the patients have to undergo a physical to ensure they 're healthy enough to handle the new transplant .
and afterwards , they need to maintain a strict medication regiment for the rest of their lives .
“ these medications , of course , have side effects , ” said arns .
“ one of which is infection .
another is that it can cause damage in other organs .
and the third is , of course , the problem that after taking the medication for a while , the body 's natural ‘ health police ' get triggered and often this creates tumors after a transplant . ”
the “ health police ” is the body 's natural immune system .
but as artificial kidneys are n't yet available , these side effects are chances that patients have to be willing to take .
and arns , who has done transplants for over thirty years , is happy about his success .
“ it 's quite a wonderful feeling , ” he said .
“ it 's a real sense of pleasure – most of all when a former patient comes back and you just see how good they feel .
it 's written all over their face . ” jana pareigis -lrb- cat -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

activists in germany fed up with the over-the-top commercialism of the christmas season want santa to retire .
the " santa-free zone " movement says saint nicholas , a fourth-century bishop , is a more appropriate symbol . armed with stickers of a santa figure in a circle crossed through with a slash that they 're passing out in shopping districts and at christmas markets , members of the anti-santa campaign are for the sixth year in a row on a mission to convince others that the jolly fat man is a distraction from the real meaning of christmas . " the movement is intended to raise awareness of the fact that the consumption-oriented santa launched by the christmas gift industry has very little to do with the holy bishop saint nicholas , " christoph schommer of the catholic aid group bonifatiuswerk , which is rallying the santa opposition , told the afp news agency . the movement has been helped out , schommer added , by the current financial crisis as people begin to rethink the focus on money and conspicuous consumption . a real saint saint nicholas was a bishop who lived in what is today 's turkey during the fourth century .
the best-known story about him says he saved three girls from being sold into prostitution by their poor father by leaving three lumps of gold over three nights in their room while they were sleeping . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the gift-giving and commercialism has gotten out of control , say the christmas reformers while catholics and orthodox christians in many parts of the world still celebrate saint nicholas day on december 6 , during which children receive chocolates in their shoes they 've left out overnight , the holiday has been largely overshadowed by the gift-giving extravaganza later in the month . santa claus , or father christmas in england and canada , is of a much more recent vintage than nicholas .
his appearance is thought to have been the invention of advertising men at coca-cola , who came up with the red-clad , bearded man for a campaign in the 1930s . " we are not trying to take away santa from anyone , but we want to make clear who the original father christmas is , " schommer said . " nicholas promoted values such as solidarity , loving thy neighbor , sharing what you have and santa does just the opposite - he 's a pack horse of consumer society , nothing more . " new momentum over the six years since the santa-free zone movement has been underway , it has passed out 100,000 of its " no santa " stickers , and this year launched a new website that lays out the differences between santa and saint nicholas . schommer said the current financial crisis has increased interest in the movement , as people begin to rethink the shop- ' til-you-drop mentality that has characterized the holiday for a long time . " there are several interesting parallels with the financial crisis , " he said . " investing in stocks can make your money disappear in a flash but the values that saint nicholas stood for - that giving to others makes you richer and not poorer - is something that endures .

in germany , over 4,000 transplants occur each year , but there are still too few organ donors when compared to those in need . to help even the balance - and increase the chances of survival for many - the european commission recently set forth two new proposals for making organ donations and transplants easier .
one of the most important aspects laid out in these proposals is the introduction of transplantation coordinators for all large hospitals .
it 's a move that 's been quite successful in several eu countries , including spain .
and it 's one that germany will soon make , too .
“ there are far too few organ donors in germany , ” said wolfgang arns , head of the transplantation station at cologne 's merheim hospital .
“ patients sometimes have to wait five , six , seven years and while they wait , they become sicker and sicker .
unfortunately that means watching as a patient 's health slips away , making them no longer ideal recipients of a transplant .
they simply die while they wait . ”
like winning the lottery in germany , three people die every day while waiting on the transplant list .
with only 4,000 organs donated each year , making it off the waiting list can seem like winning the lottery .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a donor shortage can make transplant recipients feel like lottery winners “ when the call comes , you 're just beside yourself , ” said hermann meters , a recent recipient of a new kidney .
“ you 're so happy at that moment , you become absolutely scatterbrained . ”
benjamin hoffmann , who got a second chance at life recently when he received a new kidney , agreed .
for seven-and-a-half years , the 27-year-old had to endure dialysis while waiting for an organ donor to come along .
“ three times a week , for five hours at a time , i 'd be stuck with a needle and have to wait as my blood was filtered , ” said hoffmann .
kidneys , which cleanse the body of impurities while also making sure that the body has enough salt and fluid , are the most frequently transplanted organs in germany .
though hoffmann is quite happy to have finally made if off the waiting list , he prefers not think about where his new organ came from .
“ it 's better not to think that it may have come from someone who died , ” he said .
“ it 's better to simply enjoy it , this beginning of a new life . ”
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some recipients feel guilty about having taken another 's heart though one person who is listed as an organ donor can save up to seven lives when he or she dies , kidney donations can likewise come from living donors .
for now , hoffmann only knows that his organ donor was about 50 years old .
ensuring neutrality eurotransplant , an organization based in leiden , the netherlands , arranged the transplant with hoffmann 's physician , arns .
they wo n't reveal more details , as some recipients have problems coming to terms with the idea that they are living with an organ donated by someone who may be dead .
“ working with a distribution center like eurotransplant ensures that decisions remain neutral , ” said arns .
“ they have a compulsory schedule that they use to seek out potential recipients . ”
following set criteria - blood type , urgency of need , the patient 's time spent on the waiting list , among other things - the center chooses who will receive the next transplant .
the organ is then shipped to one of the seven european countries which subscribe to the center 's services and is delivered to the appropriate hospital .
the bad news : side effects once selected , the patients have to undergo a physical to ensure they 're healthy enough to handle the new transplant .
and afterwards , they need to maintain a strict medication regiment for the rest of their lives .
“ these medications , of course , have side effects , ” said arns .
“ one of which is infection .
another is that it can cause damage in other organs .
and the third is , of course , the problem that after taking the medication for a while , the body 's natural ‘ health police ' get triggered and often this creates tumors after a transplant . ”
the “ health police ” is the body 's natural immune system .
but as artificial kidneys are n't yet available , these side effects are chances that patients have to be willing to take .
and arns , who has done transplants for over thirty years , is happy about his success .
“ it 's quite a wonderful feeling , ” he said .
“ it 's a real sense of pleasure – most of all when a former patient comes back and you just see how good they feel .
it 's written all over their face . ” jana pareigis -lrb- cat -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : nooke wants germany to help close guantanamo bay " guantanamo is an american problem .
but you ca n't allow its closure to fail because no-one knows where to put the prisoners , " nooke told the paper .
in particular , germany should be prepared to take in some of the 17 uighurs held at the prison camp in cuba , nooke said .
germany urged to take in uighur prisoners a muslim minority native to central asia , the uighurs face political persecution in their homeland china , according to human rights groups .
their struggle for independence is strongly opposed by china .
germany has a small uighur community , many of whom live in munich .
the head of amnesty international 's germany chapter , barbara lochbiler too urged the german government to lay particular emphasis on the uighurs at guantanamo - there is no evidence of their involvement in terrorist activities - while considering taking in prisoners .
" the uighurs have a network in germany .
that 's why it would be easier for them to start a new life here , " lochbiler told german news agency dpa .
lochbiler said the german government together with other european union nations should show its readiness to take in apparently innocent guantanamo inmates .

bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : nooke wants germany to help close guantanamo bay " guantanamo is an american problem .
but you ca n't allow its closure to fail because no-one knows where to put the prisoners , " nooke told the paper .
in particular , germany should be prepared to take in some of the 17 uighurs held at the prison camp in cuba , nooke said .
germany urged to take in uighur prisoners a muslim minority native to central asia , the uighurs face political persecution in their homeland china , according to human rights groups .
their struggle for independence is strongly opposed by china .
germany has a small uighur community , many of whom live in munich .
the head of amnesty international 's germany chapter , barbara lochbiler too urged the german government to lay particular emphasis on the uighurs at guantanamo - there is no evidence of their involvement in terrorist activities - while considering taking in prisoners .
" the uighurs have a network in germany .
that 's why it would be easier for them to start a new life here , " lochbiler told german news agency dpa .
lochbiler said the german government together with other european union nations should show its readiness to take in apparently innocent guantanamo inmates .
" quick action is more than overdue , " she said .

activists in germany fed up with the over-the-top commercialism of the christmas season want santa to retire .
the " santa-free zone " movement says saint nicholas , a fourth-century bishop , is a more appropriate symbol . armed with stickers of a santa figure in a circle crossed through with a slash that they 're passing out in shopping districts and at christmas markets , members of the anti-santa campaign are for the sixth year in a row on a mission to convince others that the jolly fat man is a distraction from the real meaning of christmas . " the movement is intended to raise awareness of the fact that the consumption-oriented santa launched by the christmas gift industry has very little to do with the holy bishop saint nicholas , " christoph schommer of the catholic aid group bonifatiuswerk , which is rallying the santa opposition , told the afp news agency . the movement has been helped out , schommer added , by the current financial crisis as people begin to rethink the focus on money and conspicuous consumption . a real saint saint nicholas was a bishop who lived in what is today 's turkey during the fourth century .
the best-known story about him says he saved three girls from being sold into prostitution by their poor father by leaving three lumps of gold over three nights in their room while they were sleeping . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the gift-giving and commercialism has gotten out of control , say the christmas reformers while catholics and orthodox christians in many parts of the world still celebrate saint nicholas day on december 6 , during which children receive chocolates in their shoes they 've left out overnight , the holiday has been largely overshadowed by the gift-giving extravaganza later in the month . santa claus , or father christmas in england and canada , is of a much more recent vintage than nicholas .
his appearance is thought to have been the invention of advertising men at coca-cola , who came up with the red-clad , bearded man for a campaign in the 1930s . " we are not trying to take away santa from anyone , but we want to make clear who the original father christmas is , " schommer said . " nicholas promoted values such as solidarity , loving thy neighbor , sharing what you have and santa does just the opposite - he 's a pack horse of consumer society , nothing more . " new momentum over the six years since the santa-free zone movement has been underway , it has passed out 100,000 of its " no santa " stickers , and this year launched a new website that lays out the differences between santa and saint nicholas . schommer said the current financial crisis has increased interest in the movement , as people begin to rethink the shop- ' til-you-drop mentality that has characterized the holiday for a long time . " there are several interesting parallels with the financial crisis , " he said . " investing in stocks can make your money disappear in a flash but the values that saint nicholas stood for - that giving to others makes you richer and not poorer - is something that endures .

detthold aden , head of the blg logistics group , which administers the facility said they ca n't move the cars , work on them or deliver them until they find buyers .
roll-on roll-off vessels delivering new cars or loading them up for export have always been a welcome sight in the bustling port .
that is not the case for the nine large car carriers tied up this weekend .
the vessels are bringing cars that nobody wants .
instead of setting a turnover record , the terminal is rapidly becoming one of the world 's biggest parking lots .
japanese family cars compete for the few remaining spaces available with korean sports utility vehicles , german sports cars , delivery vans and even combined harvesters and bulldozers .
normally there are between 60,000 and 80,000 vehicles in the terminal at any given time .
some for as little as several hours , others for up to a month .
in two adjacent technical centers , newly imported vehicles are cleaned and polished , or given a " haircut and shave , " as the workers jokingly say .
other models are fitted with special parts .
changing times bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : many of the cars waiting are asian imports which were on their way to germany before the crisis hit the auto industry it was less than year ago that the terminal set a turnover record of two million vehicles for a 12-month period .
there were cars from asia , from factories in germany or from the plants of german carmakers overseas .
" now we 're on course for 2.2 million new vehicles , " said ralf nagel , the senator in charge of the region 's economic development , just five months ago .
some 1.08 million vehicles passed through the terminal in the first six months of this year , 9.3 percent more than in the corresponding period of 2007 .
but the economic crisis has brought activity almost to a standstill .
when cars roll off ships like the danube highway or morning champion , they come to a halt after just a few meters because there is no room for them on land .
blg has been forced to find extra space in the area of the port normally reserved for shipping containers .
other cars are temporarily stored on freight trains .
ships normally jam-packed with vehicles destined for the united states are now leaving almost empty because of the dramatic downturn on the us car market .
reaching capacity bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the bremerhaven terminal is the largest in europe the speed of the meltdown caught bremerhaven by surprise .
when automobile manufactures published details of their shrinking sales , many of the cars now languishing in the port were already on their way to germany .
" it 's a difficult situation , because many imported cars and those destined for export are still on their way here " said aden .
the terminal and its surrounding area have a maximum capacity of around 100,000 vehicles .
this figure could be reached at the end of the year , ader said .
after that the storage situation might ease because many car firms have slashed production .
" we anticipate a 25 percent reduction in the number of vehicles transiting bremerhaven in the first quarter of 2009 , " said ader .
he added he is optimistic the car market will start to improve from the second quarter and " should be back to normal by the end of the year . " dpa news agency -lrb- mrm -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : nooke wants germany to help close guantanamo bay " guantanamo is an american problem .
but you ca n't allow its closure to fail because no-one knows where to put the prisoners , " nooke told the paper .
in particular , germany should be prepared to take in some of the 17 uighurs held at the prison camp in cuba , nooke said .
germany urged to take in uighur prisoners a muslim minority native to central asia , the uighurs face political persecution in their homeland china , according to human rights groups .
their struggle for independence is strongly opposed by china .
germany has a small uighur community , many of whom live in munich .
the head of amnesty international 's germany chapter , barbara lochbiler too urged the german government to lay particular emphasis on the uighurs at guantanamo - there is no evidence of their involvement in terrorist activities - while considering taking in prisoners .
" the uighurs have a network in germany .
that 's why it would be easier for them to start a new life here , " lochbiler told german news agency dpa .
lochbiler said the german government together with other european union nations should show its readiness to take in apparently innocent guantanamo inmates .
" quick action is more than overdue , " she said .
guantanamo closure wo n't be easy earlier this week , a us defense official said the pentagon is working on a plan to shut guantanamo bay that would be available to president-elect barack obama when he takes office on jan .
20 obama 's decision to close the hugely controversial prison camp located at the us naval station in southeastern cuba , has been welcomed by human rights groups and governments around the world .
the prison has come to symbolize aggressive detention practices and has opened the united states to allegations of torture .
but it 's largely accepted that shuttering the prison , set up by president bush after the sept 11 attack on new york and washington , will be a tricky legal task .
many experts doubt whether any of the suspected taliban and al-qaeda fighters imprisoned there will receive a fair public trial .
the german government has long called for the prison 's closure with chancellor angela merkel repeatedly bringing it up in talks with president bush .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : murat kurnaz has published a book on his imprisonment at guantanamo bay one of the first prisoners brought to guantanamo bay in 2002 included a german-born turkish national murat kurnaz .
he was held in the camp until 2006 and claims to have been tortured .
no trial was held .
the head of germany 's opposition green party , claudia roth , on saturday urged merkel " to convey to the us government that germany was prepared to take in guantanamo inmates .

germany urged to take in uighur prisoners a muslim minority native to central asia , the uighurs face political persecution in their homeland china , according to human rights groups .
their struggle for independence is strongly opposed by china .
germany has a small uighur community , many of whom live in munich .
the head of amnesty international 's germany chapter , barbara lochbiler too urged the german government to lay particular emphasis on the uighurs at guantanamo - there is no evidence of their involvement in terrorist activities - while considering taking in prisoners .
" the uighurs have a network in germany .
that 's why it would be easier for them to start a new life here , " lochbiler told german news agency dpa .
lochbiler said the german government together with other european union nations should show its readiness to take in apparently innocent guantanamo inmates .
" quick action is more than overdue , " she said .

activists in germany fed up with the over-the-top commercialism of the christmas season want santa to retire .
the " santa-free zone " movement says saint nicholas , a fourth-century bishop , is a more appropriate symbol . armed with stickers of a santa figure in a circle crossed through with a slash that they 're passing out in shopping districts and at christmas markets , members of the anti-santa campaign are for the sixth year in a row on a mission to convince others that the jolly fat man is a distraction from the real meaning of christmas . " the movement is intended to raise awareness of the fact that the consumption-oriented santa launched by the christmas gift industry has very little to do with the holy bishop saint nicholas , " christoph schommer of the catholic aid group bonifatiuswerk , which is rallying the santa opposition , told the afp news agency . the movement has been helped out , schommer added , by the current financial crisis as people begin to rethink the focus on money and conspicuous consumption . a real saint saint nicholas was a bishop who lived in what is today 's turkey during the fourth century .
the best-known story about him says he saved three girls from being sold into prostitution by their poor father by leaving three lumps of gold over three nights in their room while they were sleeping . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the gift-giving and commercialism has gotten out of control , say the christmas reformers while catholics and orthodox christians in many parts of the world still celebrate saint nicholas day on december 6 , during which children receive chocolates in their shoes they 've left out overnight , the holiday has been largely overshadowed by the gift-giving extravaganza later in the month . santa claus , or father christmas in england and canada , is of a much more recent vintage than nicholas .
his appearance is thought to have been the invention of advertising men at coca-cola , who came up with the red-clad , bearded man for a campaign in the 1930s . " we are not trying to take away santa from anyone , but we want to make clear who the original father christmas is , " schommer said . " nicholas promoted values such as solidarity , loving thy neighbor , sharing what you have and santa does just the opposite - he 's a pack horse of consumer society , nothing more . " new momentum over the six years since the santa-free zone movement has been underway , it has passed out 100,000 of its " no santa " stickers , and this year launched a new website that lays out the differences between santa and saint nicholas . schommer said the current financial crisis has increased interest in the movement , as people begin to rethink the shop- ' til-you-drop mentality that has characterized the holiday for a long time . " there are several interesting parallels with the financial crisis , " he said . " investing in stocks can make your money disappear in a flash but the values that saint nicholas stood for - that giving to others makes you richer and not poorer - is something that endures .

activists in germany fed up with the over-the-top commercialism of the christmas season want santa to retire .
the " santa-free zone " movement says saint nicholas , a fourth-century bishop , is a more appropriate symbol . armed with stickers of a santa figure in a circle crossed through with a slash that they 're passing out in shopping districts and at christmas markets , members of the anti-santa campaign are for the sixth year in a row on a mission to convince others that the jolly fat man is a distraction from the real meaning of christmas . " the movement is intended to raise awareness of the fact that the consumption-oriented santa launched by the christmas gift industry has very little to do with the holy bishop saint nicholas , " christoph schommer of the catholic aid group bonifatiuswerk , which is rallying the santa opposition , told the afp news agency . the movement has been helped out , schommer added , by the current financial crisis as people begin to rethink the focus on money and conspicuous consumption . a real saint saint nicholas was a bishop who lived in what is today 's turkey during the fourth century .
the best-known story about him says he saved three girls from being sold into prostitution by their poor father by leaving three lumps of gold over three nights in their room while they were sleeping . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the gift-giving and commercialism has gotten out of control , say the christmas reformers while catholics and orthodox christians in many parts of the world still celebrate saint nicholas day on december 6 , during which children receive chocolates in their shoes they 've left out overnight , the holiday has been largely overshadowed by the gift-giving extravaganza later in the month . santa claus , or father christmas in england and canada , is of a much more recent vintage than nicholas .
his appearance is thought to have been the invention of advertising men at coca-cola , who came up with the red-clad , bearded man for a campaign in the 1930s . " we are not trying to take away santa from anyone , but we want to make clear who the original father christmas is , " schommer said . " nicholas promoted values such as solidarity , loving thy neighbor , sharing what you have and santa does just the opposite - he 's a pack horse of consumer society , nothing more . " new momentum over the six years since the santa-free zone movement has been underway , it has passed out 100,000 of its " no santa " stickers , and this year launched a new website that lays out the differences between santa and saint nicholas . schommer said the current financial crisis has increased interest in the movement , as people begin to rethink the shop- ' til-you-drop mentality that has characterized the holiday for a long time . " there are several interesting parallels with the financial crisis , " he said . " investing in stocks can make your money disappear in a flash but the values that saint nicholas stood for - that giving to others makes you richer and not poorer - is something that endures .

bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : nooke wants germany to help close guantanamo bay " guantanamo is an american problem .
but you ca n't allow its closure to fail because no-one knows where to put the prisoners , " nooke told the paper .
in particular , germany should be prepared to take in some of the 17 uighurs held at the prison camp in cuba , nooke said .
germany urged to take in uighur prisoners a muslim minority native to central asia , the uighurs face political persecution in their homeland china , according to human rights groups .
their struggle for independence is strongly opposed by china .
germany has a small uighur community , many of whom live in munich .
the head of amnesty international 's germany chapter , barbara lochbiler too urged the german government to lay particular emphasis on the uighurs at guantanamo - there is no evidence of their involvement in terrorist activities - while considering taking in prisoners .
" the uighurs have a network in germany .
that 's why it would be easier for them to start a new life here , " lochbiler told german news agency dpa .
lochbiler said the german government together with other european union nations should show its readiness to take in apparently innocent guantanamo inmates .
" quick action is more than overdue , " she said .
guantanamo closure wo n't be easy earlier this week , a us defense official said the pentagon is working on a plan to shut guantanamo bay that would be available to president-elect barack obama when he takes office on jan .
20 obama 's decision to close the hugely controversial prison camp located at the us naval station in southeastern cuba , has been welcomed by human rights groups and governments around the world .
the prison has come to symbolize aggressive detention practices and has opened the united states to allegations of torture .
but it 's largely accepted that shuttering the prison , set up by president bush after the sept 11 attack on new york and washington , will be a tricky legal task .
many experts doubt whether any of the suspected taliban and al-qaeda fighters imprisoned there will receive a fair public trial .

bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : nooke wants germany to help close guantanamo bay " guantanamo is an american problem .
but you ca n't allow its closure to fail because no-one knows where to put the prisoners , " nooke told the paper .
in particular , germany should be prepared to take in some of the 17 uighurs held at the prison camp in cuba , nooke said .
germany urged to take in uighur prisoners a muslim minority native to central asia , the uighurs face political persecution in their homeland china , according to human rights groups .
their struggle for independence is strongly opposed by china .
germany has a small uighur community , many of whom live in munich .
the head of amnesty international 's germany chapter , barbara lochbiler too urged the german government to lay particular emphasis on the uighurs at guantanamo - there is no evidence of their involvement in terrorist activities - while considering taking in prisoners .
" the uighurs have a network in germany .
that 's why it would be easier for them to start a new life here , " lochbiler told german news agency dpa .
lochbiler said the german government together with other european union nations should show its readiness to take in apparently innocent guantanamo inmates .

20 obama 's decision to close the hugely controversial prison camp located at the us naval station in southeastern cuba , has been welcomed by human rights groups and governments around the world .
the prison has come to symbolize aggressive detention practices and has opened the united states to allegations of torture .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de auto industry -pipe- 21.12.2008 europe 's biggest car terminal bursting at the seams großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : more than 90,000 cars , trucks and vans are gathering dust in bremerhaven europe 's biggest car terminal is bursting at the seams as unsold cars pile up , mirroring the dramatic situation in the automobile industry . more than 90,000 vehicles are clogging the shipping terminal in the north german port of bremerhaven , waiting to find new owners .
detthold aden , head of the blg logistics group , which administers the facility said they ca n't move the cars , work on them or deliver them until they find buyers .
roll-on roll-off vessels delivering new cars or loading them up for export have always been a welcome sight in the bustling port .
that is not the case for the nine large car carriers tied up this weekend .
the vessels are bringing cars that nobody wants .
instead of setting a turnover record , the terminal is rapidly becoming one of the world 's biggest parking lots .
japanese family cars compete for the few remaining spaces available with korean sports utility vehicles , german sports cars , delivery vans and even combined harvesters and bulldozers .
normally there are between 60,000 and 80,000 vehicles in the terminal at any given time .
some for as little as several hours , others for up to a month .
in two adjacent technical centers , newly imported vehicles are cleaned and polished , or given a " haircut and shave , " as the workers jokingly say .
other models are fitted with special parts .
changing times bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : many of the cars waiting are asian imports which were on their way to germany before the crisis hit the auto industry it was less than year ago that the terminal set a turnover record of two million vehicles for a 12-month period .
there were cars from asia , from factories in germany or from the plants of german carmakers overseas .
" now we 're on course for 2.2 million new vehicles , " said ralf nagel , the senator in charge of the region 's economic development , just five months ago .
some 1.08 million vehicles passed through the terminal in the first six months of this year , 9.3 percent more than in the corresponding period of 2007 .
but the economic crisis has brought activity almost to a standstill .
when cars roll off ships like the danube highway or morning champion , they come to a halt after just a few meters because there is no room for them on land .
blg has been forced to find extra space in the area of the port normally reserved for shipping containers .
other cars are temporarily stored on freight trains .
ships normally jam-packed with vehicles destined for the united states are now leaving almost empty because of the dramatic downturn on the us car market .
reaching capacity bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the bremerhaven terminal is the largest in europe the speed of the meltdown caught bremerhaven by surprise .
when automobile manufactures published details of their shrinking sales , many of the cars now languishing in the port were already on their way to germany .
" it 's a difficult situation , because many imported cars and those destined for export are still on their way here " said aden .
the terminal and its surrounding area have a maximum capacity of around 100,000 vehicles .
this figure could be reached at the end of the year , ader said .
after that the storage situation might ease because many car firms have slashed production .
" we anticipate a 25 percent reduction in the number of vehicles transiting bremerhaven in the first quarter of 2009 , " said ader .
he added he is optimistic the car market will start to improve from the second quarter and " should be back to normal by the end of the year . " dpa news agency -lrb- mrm -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

detthold aden , head of the blg logistics group , which administers the facility said they ca n't move the cars , work on them or deliver them until they find buyers .
roll-on roll-off vessels delivering new cars or loading them up for export have always been a welcome sight in the bustling port .
that is not the case for the nine large car carriers tied up this weekend .
the vessels are bringing cars that nobody wants .
instead of setting a turnover record , the terminal is rapidly becoming one of the world 's biggest parking lots .
japanese family cars compete for the few remaining spaces available with korean sports utility vehicles , german sports cars , delivery vans and even combined harvesters and bulldozers .
normally there are between 60,000 and 80,000 vehicles in the terminal at any given time .
some for as little as several hours , others for up to a month .
in two adjacent technical centers , newly imported vehicles are cleaned and polished , or given a " haircut and shave , " as the workers jokingly say .
other models are fitted with special parts .
changing times bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : many of the cars waiting are asian imports which were on their way to germany before the crisis hit the auto industry it was less than year ago that the terminal set a turnover record of two million vehicles for a 12-month period .
there were cars from asia , from factories in germany or from the plants of german carmakers overseas .
" now we 're on course for 2.2 million new vehicles , " said ralf nagel , the senator in charge of the region 's economic development , just five months ago .
some 1.08 million vehicles passed through the terminal in the first six months of this year , 9.3 percent more than in the corresponding period of 2007 .
but the economic crisis has brought activity almost to a standstill .
when cars roll off ships like the danube highway or morning champion , they come to a halt after just a few meters because there is no room for them on land .
blg has been forced to find extra space in the area of the port normally reserved for shipping containers .
other cars are temporarily stored on freight trains .
ships normally jam-packed with vehicles destined for the united states are now leaving almost empty because of the dramatic downturn on the us car market .
reaching capacity bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the bremerhaven terminal is the largest in europe the speed of the meltdown caught bremerhaven by surprise .
when automobile manufactures published details of their shrinking sales , many of the cars now languishing in the port were already on their way to germany .
" it 's a difficult situation , because many imported cars and those destined for export are still on their way here " said aden .
the terminal and its surrounding area have a maximum capacity of around 100,000 vehicles .
this figure could be reached at the end of the year , ader said .
after that the storage situation might ease because many car firms have slashed production .
" we anticipate a 25 percent reduction in the number of vehicles transiting bremerhaven in the first quarter of 2009 , " said ader .

activists in germany fed up with the over-the-top commercialism of the christmas season want santa to retire .
the " santa-free zone " movement says saint nicholas , a fourth-century bishop , is a more appropriate symbol . armed with stickers of a santa figure in a circle crossed through with a slash that they 're passing out in shopping districts and at christmas markets , members of the anti-santa campaign are for the sixth year in a row on a mission to convince others that the jolly fat man is a distraction from the real meaning of christmas . " the movement is intended to raise awareness of the fact that the consumption-oriented santa launched by the christmas gift industry has very little to do with the holy bishop saint nicholas , " christoph schommer of the catholic aid group bonifatiuswerk , which is rallying the santa opposition , told the afp news agency . the movement has been helped out , schommer added , by the current financial crisis as people begin to rethink the focus on money and conspicuous consumption . a real saint saint nicholas was a bishop who lived in what is today 's turkey during the fourth century .
the best-known story about him says he saved three girls from being sold into prostitution by their poor father by leaving three lumps of gold over three nights in their room while they were sleeping . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the gift-giving and commercialism has gotten out of control , say the christmas reformers while catholics and orthodox christians in many parts of the world still celebrate saint nicholas day on december 6 , during which children receive chocolates in their shoes they 've left out overnight , the holiday has been largely overshadowed by the gift-giving extravaganza later in the month . santa claus , or father christmas in england and canada , is of a much more recent vintage than nicholas .
his appearance is thought to have been the invention of advertising men at coca-cola , who came up with the red-clad , bearded man for a campaign in the 1930s . " we are not trying to take away santa from anyone , but we want to make clear who the original father christmas is , " schommer said . " nicholas promoted values such as solidarity , loving thy neighbor , sharing what you have and santa does just the opposite - he 's a pack horse of consumer society , nothing more . " new momentum over the six years since the santa-free zone movement has been underway , it has passed out 100,000 of its " no santa " stickers , and this year launched a new website that lays out the differences between santa and saint nicholas . schommer said the current financial crisis has increased interest in the movement , as people begin to rethink the shop- ' til-you-drop mentality that has characterized the holiday for a long time . " there are several interesting parallels with the financial crisis , " he said . " investing in stocks can make your money disappear in a flash but the values that saint nicholas stood for - that giving to others makes you richer and not poorer - is something that endures .

detthold aden , head of the blg logistics group , which administers the facility said they ca n't move the cars , work on them or deliver them until they find buyers .
roll-on roll-off vessels delivering new cars or loading them up for export have always been a welcome sight in the bustling port .
that is not the case for the nine large car carriers tied up this weekend .
the vessels are bringing cars that nobody wants .
instead of setting a turnover record , the terminal is rapidly becoming one of the world 's biggest parking lots .
japanese family cars compete for the few remaining spaces available with korean sports utility vehicles , german sports cars , delivery vans and even combined harvesters and bulldozers .
normally there are between 60,000 and 80,000 vehicles in the terminal at any given time .
some for as little as several hours , others for up to a month .
in two adjacent technical centers , newly imported vehicles are cleaned and polished , or given a " haircut and shave , " as the workers jokingly say .
other models are fitted with special parts .
changing times bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : many of the cars waiting are asian imports which were on their way to germany before the crisis hit the auto industry it was less than year ago that the terminal set a turnover record of two million vehicles for a 12-month period .
there were cars from asia , from factories in germany or from the plants of german carmakers overseas .
" now we 're on course for 2.2 million new vehicles , " said ralf nagel , the senator in charge of the region 's economic development , just five months ago .
some 1.08 million vehicles passed through the terminal in the first six months of this year , 9.3 percent more than in the corresponding period of 2007 .
but the economic crisis has brought activity almost to a standstill .
when cars roll off ships like the danube highway or morning champion , they come to a halt after just a few meters because there is no room for them on land .
blg has been forced to find extra space in the area of the port normally reserved for shipping containers .
other cars are temporarily stored on freight trains .
ships normally jam-packed with vehicles destined for the united states are now leaving almost empty because of the dramatic downturn on the us car market .
reaching capacity bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the bremerhaven terminal is the largest in europe the speed of the meltdown caught bremerhaven by surprise .
when automobile manufactures published details of their shrinking sales , many of the cars now languishing in the port were already on their way to germany .
" it 's a difficult situation , because many imported cars and those destined for export are still on their way here " said aden .
the terminal and its surrounding area have a maximum capacity of around 100,000 vehicles .
this figure could be reached at the end of the year , ader said .
after that the storage situation might ease because many car firms have slashed production .
" we anticipate a 25 percent reduction in the number of vehicles transiting bremerhaven in the first quarter of 2009 , " said ader .

detthold aden , head of the blg logistics group , which administers the facility said they ca n't move the cars , work on them or deliver them until they find buyers .
roll-on roll-off vessels delivering new cars or loading them up for export have always been a welcome sight in the bustling port .
that is not the case for the nine large car carriers tied up this weekend .
the vessels are bringing cars that nobody wants .
instead of setting a turnover record , the terminal is rapidly becoming one of the world 's biggest parking lots .
japanese family cars compete for the few remaining spaces available with korean sports utility vehicles , german sports cars , delivery vans and even combined harvesters and bulldozers .
normally there are between 60,000 and 80,000 vehicles in the terminal at any given time .
some for as little as several hours , others for up to a month .
in two adjacent technical centers , newly imported vehicles are cleaned and polished , or given a " haircut and shave , " as the workers jokingly say .
other models are fitted with special parts .
changing times bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : many of the cars waiting are asian imports which were on their way to germany before the crisis hit the auto industry it was less than year ago that the terminal set a turnover record of two million vehicles for a 12-month period .
there were cars from asia , from factories in germany or from the plants of german carmakers overseas .
" now we 're on course for 2.2 million new vehicles , " said ralf nagel , the senator in charge of the region 's economic development , just five months ago .
some 1.08 million vehicles passed through the terminal in the first six months of this year , 9.3 percent more than in the corresponding period of 2007 .
but the economic crisis has brought activity almost to a standstill .
when cars roll off ships like the danube highway or morning champion , they come to a halt after just a few meters because there is no room for them on land .
blg has been forced to find extra space in the area of the port normally reserved for shipping containers .
other cars are temporarily stored on freight trains .
ships normally jam-packed with vehicles destined for the united states are now leaving almost empty because of the dramatic downturn on the us car market .
reaching capacity bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the bremerhaven terminal is the largest in europe the speed of the meltdown caught bremerhaven by surprise .
when automobile manufactures published details of their shrinking sales , many of the cars now languishing in the port were already on their way to germany .
" it 's a difficult situation , because many imported cars and those destined for export are still on their way here " said aden .
the terminal and its surrounding area have a maximum capacity of around 100,000 vehicles .
this figure could be reached at the end of the year , ader said .
after that the storage situation might ease because many car firms have slashed production .
" we anticipate a 25 percent reduction in the number of vehicles transiting bremerhaven in the first quarter of 2009 , " said ader .

activists in germany fed up with the over-the-top commercialism of the christmas season want santa to retire .
the " santa-free zone " movement says saint nicholas , a fourth-century bishop , is a more appropriate symbol . armed with stickers of a santa figure in a circle crossed through with a slash that they 're passing out in shopping districts and at christmas markets , members of the anti-santa campaign are for the sixth year in a row on a mission to convince others that the jolly fat man is a distraction from the real meaning of christmas . " the movement is intended to raise awareness of the fact that the consumption-oriented santa launched by the christmas gift industry has very little to do with the holy bishop saint nicholas , " christoph schommer of the catholic aid group bonifatiuswerk , which is rallying the santa opposition , told the afp news agency . the movement has been helped out , schommer added , by the current financial crisis as people begin to rethink the focus on money and conspicuous consumption . a real saint saint nicholas was a bishop who lived in what is today 's turkey during the fourth century .

bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : nooke wants germany to help close guantanamo bay " guantanamo is an american problem .
but you ca n't allow its closure to fail because no-one knows where to put the prisoners , " nooke told the paper .
in particular , germany should be prepared to take in some of the 17 uighurs held at the prison camp in cuba , nooke said .
germany urged to take in uighur prisoners a muslim minority native to central asia , the uighurs face political persecution in their homeland china , according to human rights groups .
their struggle for independence is strongly opposed by china .
germany has a small uighur community , many of whom live in munich .
the head of amnesty international 's germany chapter , barbara lochbiler too urged the german government to lay particular emphasis on the uighurs at guantanamo - there is no evidence of their involvement in terrorist activities - while considering taking in prisoners .
" the uighurs have a network in germany .
that 's why it would be easier for them to start a new life here , " lochbiler told german news agency dpa .
lochbiler said the german government together with other european union nations should show its readiness to take in apparently innocent guantanamo inmates .
" quick action is more than overdue , " she said .
guantanamo closure wo n't be easy earlier this week , a us defense official said the pentagon is working on a plan to shut guantanamo bay that would be available to president-elect barack obama when he takes office on jan .
20 obama 's decision to close the hugely controversial prison camp located at the us naval station in southeastern cuba , has been welcomed by human rights groups and governments around the world .
the prison has come to symbolize aggressive detention practices and has opened the united states to allegations of torture .
but it 's largely accepted that shuttering the prison , set up by president bush after the sept 11 attack on new york and washington , will be a tricky legal task .
many experts doubt whether any of the suspected taliban and al-qaeda fighters imprisoned there will receive a fair public trial .
the german government has long called for the prison 's closure with chancellor angela merkel repeatedly bringing it up in talks with president bush .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : murat kurnaz has published a book on his imprisonment at guantanamo bay one of the first prisoners brought to guantanamo bay in 2002 included a german-born turkish national murat kurnaz .

bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : nooke wants germany to help close guantanamo bay " guantanamo is an american problem .
but you ca n't allow its closure to fail because no-one knows where to put the prisoners , " nooke told the paper .
in particular , germany should be prepared to take in some of the 17 uighurs held at the prison camp in cuba , nooke said .
germany urged to take in uighur prisoners a muslim minority native to central asia , the uighurs face political persecution in their homeland china , according to human rights groups .
their struggle for independence is strongly opposed by china .
germany has a small uighur community , many of whom live in munich .
the head of amnesty international 's germany chapter , barbara lochbiler too urged the german government to lay particular emphasis on the uighurs at guantanamo - there is no evidence of their involvement in terrorist activities - while considering taking in prisoners .
" the uighurs have a network in germany .
that 's why it would be easier for them to start a new life here , " lochbiler told german news agency dpa .
lochbiler said the german government together with other european union nations should show its readiness to take in apparently innocent guantanamo inmates .
" quick action is more than overdue , " she said .
guantanamo closure wo n't be easy earlier this week , a us defense official said the pentagon is working on a plan to shut guantanamo bay that would be available to president-elect barack obama when he takes office on jan .
20 obama 's decision to close the hugely controversial prison camp located at the us naval station in southeastern cuba , has been welcomed by human rights groups and governments around the world .
the prison has come to symbolize aggressive detention practices and has opened the united states to allegations of torture .
but it 's largely accepted that shuttering the prison , set up by president bush after the sept 11 attack on new york and washington , will be a tricky legal task .
many experts doubt whether any of the suspected taliban and al-qaeda fighters imprisoned there will receive a fair public trial .

bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : nooke wants germany to help close guantanamo bay " guantanamo is an american problem .
but you ca n't allow its closure to fail because no-one knows where to put the prisoners , " nooke told the paper .
in particular , germany should be prepared to take in some of the 17 uighurs held at the prison camp in cuba , nooke said .
germany urged to take in uighur prisoners a muslim minority native to central asia , the uighurs face political persecution in their homeland china , according to human rights groups .
their struggle for independence is strongly opposed by china .
germany has a small uighur community , many of whom live in munich .
the head of amnesty international 's germany chapter , barbara lochbiler too urged the german government to lay particular emphasis on the uighurs at guantanamo - there is no evidence of their involvement in terrorist activities - while considering taking in prisoners .
" the uighurs have a network in germany .
that 's why it would be easier for them to start a new life here , " lochbiler told german news agency dpa .
lochbiler said the german government together with other european union nations should show its readiness to take in apparently innocent guantanamo inmates .
" quick action is more than overdue , " she said .
guantanamo closure wo n't be easy earlier this week , a us defense official said the pentagon is working on a plan to shut guantanamo bay that would be available to president-elect barack obama when he takes office on jan .
20 obama 's decision to close the hugely controversial prison camp located at the us naval station in southeastern cuba , has been welcomed by human rights groups and governments around the world .
the prison has come to symbolize aggressive detention practices and has opened the united states to allegations of torture .
but it 's largely accepted that shuttering the prison , set up by president bush after the sept 11 attack on new york and washington , will be a tricky legal task .
many experts doubt whether any of the suspected taliban and al-qaeda fighters imprisoned there will receive a fair public trial .
the german government has long called for the prison 's closure with chancellor angela merkel repeatedly bringing it up in talks with president bush .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : murat kurnaz has published a book on his imprisonment at guantanamo bay one of the first prisoners brought to guantanamo bay in 2002 included a german-born turkish national murat kurnaz .
he was held in the camp until 2006 and claims to have been tortured .
no trial was held .
the head of germany 's opposition green party , claudia roth , on saturday urged merkel " to convey to the us government that germany was prepared to take in guantanamo inmates .

bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : nooke wants germany to help close guantanamo bay " guantanamo is an american problem .
but you ca n't allow its closure to fail because no-one knows where to put the prisoners , " nooke told the paper .
in particular , germany should be prepared to take in some of the 17 uighurs held at the prison camp in cuba , nooke said .
germany urged to take in uighur prisoners a muslim minority native to central asia , the uighurs face political persecution in their homeland china , according to human rights groups .
their struggle for independence is strongly opposed by china .
germany has a small uighur community , many of whom live in munich .
the head of amnesty international 's germany chapter , barbara lochbiler too urged the german government to lay particular emphasis on the uighurs at guantanamo - there is no evidence of their involvement in terrorist activities - while considering taking in prisoners .
" the uighurs have a network in germany .
that 's why it would be easier for them to start a new life here , " lochbiler told german news agency dpa .
lochbiler said the german government together with other european union nations should show its readiness to take in apparently innocent guantanamo inmates .
" quick action is more than overdue , " she said .
guantanamo closure wo n't be easy earlier this week , a us defense official said the pentagon is working on a plan to shut guantanamo bay that would be available to president-elect barack obama when he takes office on jan .
20 obama 's decision to close the hugely controversial prison camp located at the us naval station in southeastern cuba , has been welcomed by human rights groups and governments around the world .
the prison has come to symbolize aggressive detention practices and has opened the united states to allegations of torture .
but it 's largely accepted that shuttering the prison , set up by president bush after the sept 11 attack on new york and washington , will be a tricky legal task .
many experts doubt whether any of the suspected taliban and al-qaeda fighters imprisoned there will receive a fair public trial .
the german government has long called for the prison 's closure with chancellor angela merkel repeatedly bringing it up in talks with president bush .

activists in germany fed up with the over-the-top commercialism of the christmas season want santa to retire .
the " santa-free zone " movement says saint nicholas , a fourth-century bishop , is a more appropriate symbol . armed with stickers of a santa figure in a circle crossed through with a slash that they 're passing out in shopping districts and at christmas markets , members of the anti-santa campaign are for the sixth year in a row on a mission to convince others that the jolly fat man is a distraction from the real meaning of christmas . " the movement is intended to raise awareness of the fact that the consumption-oriented santa launched by the christmas gift industry has very little to do with the holy bishop saint nicholas , " christoph schommer of the catholic aid group bonifatiuswerk , which is rallying the santa opposition , told the afp news agency . the movement has been helped out , schommer added , by the current financial crisis as people begin to rethink the focus on money and conspicuous consumption . a real saint saint nicholas was a bishop who lived in what is today 's turkey during the fourth century .
the best-known story about him says he saved three girls from being sold into prostitution by their poor father by leaving three lumps of gold over three nights in their room while they were sleeping . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the gift-giving and commercialism has gotten out of control , say the christmas reformers while catholics and orthodox christians in many parts of the world still celebrate saint nicholas day on december 6 , during which children receive chocolates in their shoes they 've left out overnight , the holiday has been largely overshadowed by the gift-giving extravaganza later in the month . santa claus , or father christmas in england and canada , is of a much more recent vintage than nicholas .
his appearance is thought to have been the invention of advertising men at coca-cola , who came up with the red-clad , bearded man for a campaign in the 1930s . " we are not trying to take away santa from anyone , but we want to make clear who the original father christmas is , " schommer said . " nicholas promoted values such as solidarity , loving thy neighbor , sharing what you have and santa does just the opposite - he 's a pack horse of consumer society , nothing more . " new momentum over the six years since the santa-free zone movement has been underway , it has passed out 100,000 of its " no santa " stickers , and this year launched a new website that lays out the differences between santa and saint nicholas . schommer said the current financial crisis has increased interest in the movement , as people begin to rethink the shop- ' til-you-drop mentality that has characterized the holiday for a long time . " there are several interesting parallels with the financial crisis , " he said . " investing in stocks can make your money disappear in a flash but the values that saint nicholas stood for - that giving to others makes you richer and not poorer - is something that endures .

bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : nooke wants germany to help close guantanamo bay " guantanamo is an american problem .
but you ca n't allow its closure to fail because no-one knows where to put the prisoners , " nooke told the paper .
in particular , germany should be prepared to take in some of the 17 uighurs held at the prison camp in cuba , nooke said .
germany urged to take in uighur prisoners a muslim minority native to central asia , the uighurs face political persecution in their homeland china , according to human rights groups .
their struggle for independence is strongly opposed by china .
germany has a small uighur community , many of whom live in munich .
the head of amnesty international 's germany chapter , barbara lochbiler too urged the german government to lay particular emphasis on the uighurs at guantanamo - there is no evidence of their involvement in terrorist activities - while considering taking in prisoners .
" the uighurs have a network in germany .
that 's why it would be easier for them to start a new life here , " lochbiler told german news agency dpa .
lochbiler said the german government together with other european union nations should show its readiness to take in apparently innocent guantanamo inmates .
" quick action is more than overdue , " she said .
guantanamo closure wo n't be easy earlier this week , a us defense official said the pentagon is working on a plan to shut guantanamo bay that would be available to president-elect barack obama when he takes office on jan .
20 obama 's decision to close the hugely controversial prison camp located at the us naval station in southeastern cuba , has been welcomed by human rights groups and governments around the world .
the prison has come to symbolize aggressive detention practices and has opened the united states to allegations of torture .
but it 's largely accepted that shuttering the prison , set up by president bush after the sept 11 attack on new york and washington , will be a tricky legal task .
many experts doubt whether any of the suspected taliban and al-qaeda fighters imprisoned there will receive a fair public trial .
the german government has long called for the prison 's closure with chancellor angela merkel repeatedly bringing it up in talks with president bush .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : murat kurnaz has published a book on his imprisonment at guantanamo bay one of the first prisoners brought to guantanamo bay in 2002 included a german-born turkish national murat kurnaz .
he was held in the camp until 2006 and claims to have been tortured .
no trial was held .
the head of germany 's opposition green party , claudia roth , on saturday urged merkel " to convey to the us government that germany was prepared to take in guantanamo inmates .

bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : nooke wants germany to help close guantanamo bay " guantanamo is an american problem .
but you ca n't allow its closure to fail because no-one knows where to put the prisoners , " nooke told the paper .
in particular , germany should be prepared to take in some of the 17 uighurs held at the prison camp in cuba , nooke said .
germany urged to take in uighur prisoners a muslim minority native to central asia , the uighurs face political persecution in their homeland china , according to human rights groups .
their struggle for independence is strongly opposed by china .
germany has a small uighur community , many of whom live in munich .
the head of amnesty international 's germany chapter , barbara lochbiler too urged the german government to lay particular emphasis on the uighurs at guantanamo - there is no evidence of their involvement in terrorist activities - while considering taking in prisoners .
" the uighurs have a network in germany .
that 's why it would be easier for them to start a new life here , " lochbiler told german news agency dpa .
lochbiler said the german government together with other european union nations should show its readiness to take in apparently innocent guantanamo inmates .
" quick action is more than overdue , " she said .
guantanamo closure wo n't be easy earlier this week , a us defense official said the pentagon is working on a plan to shut guantanamo bay that would be available to president-elect barack obama when he takes office on jan .
20 obama 's decision to close the hugely controversial prison camp located at the us naval station in southeastern cuba , has been welcomed by human rights groups and governments around the world .
the prison has come to symbolize aggressive detention practices and has opened the united states to allegations of torture .
but it 's largely accepted that shuttering the prison , set up by president bush after the sept 11 attack on new york and washington , will be a tricky legal task .
many experts doubt whether any of the suspected taliban and al-qaeda fighters imprisoned there will receive a fair public trial .
the german government has long called for the prison 's closure with chancellor angela merkel repeatedly bringing it up in talks with president bush .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : murat kurnaz has published a book on his imprisonment at guantanamo bay one of the first prisoners brought to guantanamo bay in 2002 included a german-born turkish national murat kurnaz .
he was held in the camp until 2006 and claims to have been tortured .
no trial was held .

activists in germany fed up with the over-the-top commercialism of the christmas season want santa to retire .
the " santa-free zone " movement says saint nicholas , a fourth-century bishop , is a more appropriate symbol . armed with stickers of a santa figure in a circle crossed through with a slash that they 're passing out in shopping districts and at christmas markets , members of the anti-santa campaign are for the sixth year in a row on a mission to convince others that the jolly fat man is a distraction from the real meaning of christmas . " the movement is intended to raise awareness of the fact that the consumption-oriented santa launched by the christmas gift industry has very little to do with the holy bishop saint nicholas , " christoph schommer of the catholic aid group bonifatiuswerk , which is rallying the santa opposition , told the afp news agency . the movement has been helped out , schommer added , by the current financial crisis as people begin to rethink the focus on money and conspicuous consumption . a real saint saint nicholas was a bishop who lived in what is today 's turkey during the fourth century .
the best-known story about him says he saved three girls from being sold into prostitution by their poor father by leaving three lumps of gold over three nights in their room while they were sleeping . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the gift-giving and commercialism has gotten out of control , say the christmas reformers while catholics and orthodox christians in many parts of the world still celebrate saint nicholas day on december 6 , during which children receive chocolates in their shoes they 've left out overnight , the holiday has been largely overshadowed by the gift-giving extravaganza later in the month . santa claus , or father christmas in england and canada , is of a much more recent vintage than nicholas .
his appearance is thought to have been the invention of advertising men at coca-cola , who came up with the red-clad , bearded man for a campaign in the 1930s . " we are not trying to take away santa from anyone , but we want to make clear who the original father christmas is , " schommer said . " nicholas promoted values such as solidarity , loving thy neighbor , sharing what you have and santa does just the opposite - he 's a pack horse of consumer society , nothing more . " new momentum over the six years since the santa-free zone movement has been underway , it has passed out 100,000 of its " no santa " stickers , and this year launched a new website that lays out the differences between santa and saint nicholas . schommer said the current financial crisis has increased interest in the movement , as people begin to rethink the shop- ' til-you-drop mentality that has characterized the holiday for a long time . " there are several interesting parallels with the financial crisis , " he said . " investing in stocks can make your money disappear in a flash but the values that saint nicholas stood for - that giving to others makes you richer and not poorer - is something that endures .

bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : nooke wants germany to help close guantanamo bay " guantanamo is an american problem .
but you ca n't allow its closure to fail because no-one knows where to put the prisoners , " nooke told the paper .
in particular , germany should be prepared to take in some of the 17 uighurs held at the prison camp in cuba , nooke said .
germany urged to take in uighur prisoners a muslim minority native to central asia , the uighurs face political persecution in their homeland china , according to human rights groups .
their struggle for independence is strongly opposed by china .
germany has a small uighur community , many of whom live in munich .
the head of amnesty international 's germany chapter , barbara lochbiler too urged the german government to lay particular emphasis on the uighurs at guantanamo - there is no evidence of their involvement in terrorist activities - while considering taking in prisoners .
" the uighurs have a network in germany .
that 's why it would be easier for them to start a new life here , " lochbiler told german news agency dpa .
lochbiler said the german government together with other european union nations should show its readiness to take in apparently innocent guantanamo inmates .
" quick action is more than overdue , " she said .
guantanamo closure wo n't be easy earlier this week , a us defense official said the pentagon is working on a plan to shut guantanamo bay that would be available to president-elect barack obama when he takes office on jan .
20 obama 's decision to close the hugely controversial prison camp located at the us naval station in southeastern cuba , has been welcomed by human rights groups and governments around the world .
the prison has come to symbolize aggressive detention practices and has opened the united states to allegations of torture .
but it 's largely accepted that shuttering the prison , set up by president bush after the sept 11 attack on new york and washington , will be a tricky legal task .
many experts doubt whether any of the suspected taliban and al-qaeda fighters imprisoned there will receive a fair public trial .
the german government has long called for the prison 's closure with chancellor angela merkel repeatedly bringing it up in talks with president bush .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : murat kurnaz has published a book on his imprisonment at guantanamo bay one of the first prisoners brought to guantanamo bay in 2002 included a german-born turkish national murat kurnaz .
he was held in the camp until 2006 and claims to have been tortured .

bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : nooke wants germany to help close guantanamo bay " guantanamo is an american problem .
but you ca n't allow its closure to fail because no-one knows where to put the prisoners , " nooke told the paper .
in particular , germany should be prepared to take in some of the 17 uighurs held at the prison camp in cuba , nooke said .
germany urged to take in uighur prisoners a muslim minority native to central asia , the uighurs face political persecution in their homeland china , according to human rights groups .
their struggle for independence is strongly opposed by china .
germany has a small uighur community , many of whom live in munich .
the head of amnesty international 's germany chapter , barbara lochbiler too urged the german government to lay particular emphasis on the uighurs at guantanamo - there is no evidence of their involvement in terrorist activities - while considering taking in prisoners .
" the uighurs have a network in germany .
that 's why it would be easier for them to start a new life here , " lochbiler told german news agency dpa .
lochbiler said the german government together with other european union nations should show its readiness to take in apparently innocent guantanamo inmates .
" quick action is more than overdue , " she said .

20 obama 's decision to close the hugely controversial prison camp located at the us naval station in southeastern cuba , has been welcomed by human rights groups and governments around the world .
the prison has come to symbolize aggressive detention practices and has opened the united states to allegations of torture .
but it 's largely accepted that shuttering the prison , set up by president bush after the sept 11 attack on new york and washington , will be a tricky legal task .

activists in germany fed up with the over-the-top commercialism of the christmas season want santa to retire .
the " santa-free zone " movement says saint nicholas , a fourth-century bishop , is a more appropriate symbol . armed with stickers of a santa figure in a circle crossed through with a slash that they 're passing out in shopping districts and at christmas markets , members of the anti-santa campaign are for the sixth year in a row on a mission to convince others that the jolly fat man is a distraction from the real meaning of christmas . " the movement is intended to raise awareness of the fact that the consumption-oriented santa launched by the christmas gift industry has very little to do with the holy bishop saint nicholas , " christoph schommer of the catholic aid group bonifatiuswerk , which is rallying the santa opposition , told the afp news agency . the movement has been helped out , schommer added , by the current financial crisis as people begin to rethink the focus on money and conspicuous consumption . a real saint saint nicholas was a bishop who lived in what is today 's turkey during the fourth century .
the best-known story about him says he saved three girls from being sold into prostitution by their poor father by leaving three lumps of gold over three nights in their room while they were sleeping . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the gift-giving and commercialism has gotten out of control , say the christmas reformers while catholics and orthodox christians in many parts of the world still celebrate saint nicholas day on december 6 , during which children receive chocolates in their shoes they 've left out overnight , the holiday has been largely overshadowed by the gift-giving extravaganza later in the month . santa claus , or father christmas in england and canada , is of a much more recent vintage than nicholas .
his appearance is thought to have been the invention of advertising men at coca-cola , who came up with the red-clad , bearded man for a campaign in the 1930s . " we are not trying to take away santa from anyone , but we want to make clear who the original father christmas is , " schommer said . " nicholas promoted values such as solidarity , loving thy neighbor , sharing what you have and santa does just the opposite - he 's a pack horse of consumer society , nothing more . " new momentum over the six years since the santa-free zone movement has been underway , it has passed out 100,000 of its " no santa " stickers , and this year launched a new website that lays out the differences between santa and saint nicholas . schommer said the current financial crisis has increased interest in the movement , as people begin to rethink the shop- ' til-you-drop mentality that has characterized the holiday for a long time . " there are several interesting parallels with the financial crisis , " he said . " investing in stocks can make your money disappear in a flash but the values that saint nicholas stood for - that giving to others makes you richer and not poorer - is something that endures .

roll-on roll-off vessels delivering new cars or loading them up for export have always been a welcome sight in the bustling port .

detthold aden , head of the blg logistics group , which administers the facility said they ca n't move the cars , work on them or deliver them until they find buyers .
roll-on roll-off vessels delivering new cars or loading them up for export have always been a welcome sight in the bustling port .
that is not the case for the nine large car carriers tied up this weekend .
the vessels are bringing cars that nobody wants .
instead of setting a turnover record , the terminal is rapidly becoming one of the world 's biggest parking lots .
japanese family cars compete for the few remaining spaces available with korean sports utility vehicles , german sports cars , delivery vans and even combined harvesters and bulldozers .
normally there are between 60,000 and 80,000 vehicles in the terminal at any given time .
some for as little as several hours , others for up to a month .

there were cars from asia , from factories in germany or from the plants of german carmakers overseas .
" now we 're on course for 2.2 million new vehicles , " said ralf nagel , the senator in charge of the region 's economic development , just five months ago .

when cars roll off ships like the danube highway or morning champion , they come to a halt after just a few meters because there is no room for them on land .

" it 's a difficult situation , because many imported cars and those destined for export are still on their way here " said aden .
the terminal and its surrounding area have a maximum capacity of around 100,000 vehicles .
this figure could be reached at the end of the year , ader said .
after that the storage situation might ease because many car firms have slashed production .

detthold aden , head of the blg logistics group , which administers the facility said they ca n't move the cars , work on them or deliver them until they find buyers .
roll-on roll-off vessels delivering new cars or loading them up for export have always been a welcome sight in the bustling port .
that is not the case for the nine large car carriers tied up this weekend .
the vessels are bringing cars that nobody wants .
instead of setting a turnover record , the terminal is rapidly becoming one of the world 's biggest parking lots .
japanese family cars compete for the few remaining spaces available with korean sports utility vehicles , german sports cars , delivery vans and even combined harvesters and bulldozers .
normally there are between 60,000 and 80,000 vehicles in the terminal at any given time .
some for as little as several hours , others for up to a month .
in two adjacent technical centers , newly imported vehicles are cleaned and polished , or given a " haircut and shave , " as the workers jokingly say .
other models are fitted with special parts .
changing times bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : many of the cars waiting are asian imports which were on their way to germany before the crisis hit the auto industry it was less than year ago that the terminal set a turnover record of two million vehicles for a 12-month period .
there were cars from asia , from factories in germany or from the plants of german carmakers overseas .
" now we 're on course for 2.2 million new vehicles , " said ralf nagel , the senator in charge of the region 's economic development , just five months ago .
some 1.08 million vehicles passed through the terminal in the first six months of this year , 9.3 percent more than in the corresponding period of 2007 .
but the economic crisis has brought activity almost to a standstill .
when cars roll off ships like the danube highway or morning champion , they come to a halt after just a few meters because there is no room for them on land .
blg has been forced to find extra space in the area of the port normally reserved for shipping containers .

when automobile manufactures published details of their shrinking sales , many of the cars now languishing in the port were already on their way to germany .
" it 's a difficult situation , because many imported cars and those destined for export are still on their way here " said aden .
the terminal and its surrounding area have a maximum capacity of around 100,000 vehicles .
this figure could be reached at the end of the year , ader said .
after that the storage situation might ease because many car firms have slashed production .

" it started out as a fun thing at family functions .
" music was very much a part of our family set-up - my father was an aficionado and all my uncles could play an instrument .
" our grandmother was also a big influence - she was a poet and was fluent in three languages . "
bollywood movies while certainly not a typical pakistani upbringing , it 's hardly exceptional among educated urbanites . "
we are not into politics , but as pakistani women we feel it is important to dispel the stereotypes abroad " haniya despite the growing threat of talebanisation across the country , most pakistanis remain a liberal and tolerant lot .
the country 's top music acts such as junoon , the late nusrat fateh ali khan , adnan sami and atif aslam are south asian superstars and have a strong international following as well .
addicted to their bollywood movies and pakistani pop music , many are at ease with privately imitating their idols .
but , like all other professions in the country , music remains male-dominated .
for women it is another matter altogether - raised eyebrows are the least possible obstacle .
some have broken the barrier , none more so than the late nazia hassan , who took the sub-continental music scene by storm with her pop music in the early 1980s .
there have been others who followed in her footsteps , although none have been able to reach those dizzying heights .
that may account for all the hype surrounding zeb and haniya , pakistan 's first all-female music band .
another is the fact that their debut album , chup -lrb- quiet ! -rrb- , was recently released to rave reviews in pakistan 's major newspapers .
but the most startling fact about these girls , for pakistanis and the world at large , is their origin .
cultural identity both zeb and haniya are ethnic pashtuns , and their families hail from the town of kohat in pakistan 's north west frontier province .
that region has , of late , become synonymous with the taleban and al-qaeda .
" we 've never lived there , but we do keep going back for family functions and get-togethers , " haniya explains .
how accurately the militants represent the cultural identity of the pashtuns is one of the mostly hotly debated topics in the region .
zeb and haniya are a living and vivid example of how much more there is to the pashtun sensibility than the images of gun-toting renegades .
but that is all by default - the girls say they are here to be recognised for the quality of their music , not their background .
so far they seem to have struck all the right chords as the praise keeps on coming from the media .
" it all started five years ago when we were in college in the us and starting writing songs , " zeb explains .
the girls were then undergraduate students at smith and wesleyan college .
" i started experimenting with different instruments and sounds , " haniya recalls .
" zeb had been taking singing classes for a while and we got together to record some songs . "
that might have been that , haniya says , if not for the decision to upload the songs on to the internet .
" when we got back to pakistan , we found out that some of the local fm radio stations had actually been playing them . "
since 2001 , pakistan has seen a boom in local radio channels which broadcast both local and international talent .
' take the plunge ' " that got a lot of our friends encouraging us , so we decided to do it more seriously , " zeb continues .
" that is when we decided to try and make an album .
" before we knew it haniya had put together 10 songs and we had taken the plunge . "
while the girls work as a team when it comes to the music , zeb says haniya is the main music writer and sings in a few of the songs on the album .
" i help out as much as i can , but i am basically a vocalist , " she says .
the pair say that local musicians have also helped them out a lot in the making of the album , which generated a response greater than the girls ever expected .
" we were a bit overwhelmed - it just took a little while to sink in , " says haniya .
" the first time we played in a concert , we were hooted at initially .
" but when the music started the response was stupendous .
it was gratifying as our music is not typical pakistani pop . "
the pair say they felt especially pleased when pashtun boys and girls thanked them for promoting the culture .
in fact , that may well be part of the girls ' appeal - their music blends western and eastern influences seamlessly .
paimona , a pashtun ballad about love , rendered with a blues influence , perhaps best illustrates this .
self-deprecating the music is soft with a lot of blues influence and some eclectic pop flavour .
nadeem farooq paracha , pakistan 's leading music critic , says the pair have " broken new ground being an all-female band " but cautions that the music is good , not extraordinary .
" i would n't like to discourage them though - they need to keep on working .
i think they can produce better music than this . "
both zeb and haniya are self-deprecating when it come to their musical career .
" it 's just started and while it 's going well i think we have much room for improvement , " says haniya .
" we are not into politics , but as pakistani women we feel it is important to dispel the stereotypes abroad .
" pakistani women do face problems and discrimination , but i think we are strong enough to stand up for ourselves .
" as musicians , i think this is especially clear when people get to know we are from pakistan . "

pop music in pakistan has been dominated by male bands that region has , of late , become synonymous with the taleban and al-qaeda .

how accurately the militants represent the cultural identity of the pashtuns is one of the mostly hotly debated topics in the region .

" when we got back to pakistan , we found out that some of the local fm radio stations had actually been playing them . "
since 2001 , pakistan has seen a boom in local radio channels which broadcast both local and international talent .
' take the plunge ' " that got a lot of our friends encouraging us , so we decided to do it more seriously , " zeb continues .
the women come from an area known to be a militant hotbed " that is when we decided to try and make an album .

the pair say that local musicians have also helped them out a lot in the making of the album , which generated a response greater than the girls ever expected .

" the first time we played in a concert , we were hooted at initially .
