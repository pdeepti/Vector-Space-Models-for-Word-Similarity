program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de europe -pipe- 28.01.2008 belgium 's german minority mostly unmoved by autonomy debate großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the belgian unity question centers on flanders and wallonia and neglects other regions the belgian interim government may have silenced separatist rhetoric for now but the divisive problems have not gone away .
the country 's german-speaking minority is maintaining a low profile in the debate . the debate concerning the political crisis in belgium and the unlikely , yet much discussed , possibility of the country splitting , has focused firmly on the disagreements between the two main linguistic areas , french-speaking wallonia and flemish-speaking flanders .
though these two areas are the largest in terms of size , and also importance when it comes to deciding policies which affect the whole country , belgium has in fact been divided into four linguistic regions since the early 1960s .
besides wallonia in the south and flanders in the north , there is the bilingual brussels capital region and the tiny german-speaking area in the east cantons .
while brussels is sometimes left out of the debate over belgium 's future - due mainly to its bilingualism , its self-sufficiency and its status as an international city - the east cantons seem to be ignored altogether when it comes to discussing the linguistic and cultural divide .
a region of 854 square kilometers -lrb- 530 square miles -rrb- with a population of over 73,000 , of which almost 100 percent are german speaking , the east cantons can quite easily be overlooked in belgium 's controversial situation .
the juicy arguments and stubborn nationalist positions of the more powerful flemings and walloons make for far better headlines than a quirky little germanic outpost on the far eastern border .
similar challenges and yet , the german-speaking community of the east cantons , as a linguistic minority within the federal state of belgium , faces similar challenges to those causing strife between " the big two . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the seat of german-speaking power is based in eupen granted internal rule in 1973 , the region has its own parliament in the capital of eupen and control over linguistic and cultural matters .
the parliament organizes elections , supervises the regional government , and adopts decrees for the german-speaking community .
the east cantons also have committees charged with governing areas such as education , social policy , health and employment .
despite this illusion of self-rule , however , the region still remains part of french-speaking wallonia , located as it is in the province of liege , and is therefore kept under the watchful eye of the wallon parliament .
it is not surprising that there are some in the east cantons who have themselves expressed a desire for the kind of autonomy favored by the more extreme elements on either side of the main linguistic divide .
a small but growing number have been voicing their support for an independent mini-state .
as is the case in the rest of the country , this is not a view shared by the whole population of the east cantons .
to get an idea how the german-speaking region and its people view their role in the wider belgian community , dw-world.de talked to jean-claude franken , the secretary of the german-speaking community 's christian social party -lrb- csp -rrb- , a cooperation partner of the francophone humanist democratic center -lrb- cdh -rrb- in the belgian parliament .
dw-world.de : is belgium 's german-speaking minority well integrated ?
jean-claude franken : the german-speaking minority is integrated in the belgian federal state very well .
there are special laws within the belgian constitution that protect the german-speaking community here .
how much power does the german-speaking minority have in belgium ?
the german-speaking community is an equal partner in the belgian federal state .
that is because there is no favoritism towards any of the linguistic minorities in the country in terms of the divulgence of power .
in the federal government , of course , the larger regions have the biggest political parties and therefore more seats in parliament , but our cooperation with the cdh allows us to have our say as part of wallonia .
in regional terms , the parties within the east canton - the csp , the socialist party , the party for freedom and progress and the party for german-speaking belgians - ensure that the autonomy we enjoy is used to make the community as self-reliant and efficient as possible .
does the german-speaking minority in belgium consider itself german or belgian ?
in former times , the region was part of prussia and therefore a small part of germany .
during world war ii , it was annexed again by germany after being part of belgium since the end of the great war .
when the east canton was returned to belgium once more in 1945 , some who lived there regretted this and wanted to stay german ; these were the same people who welcomed the occupying nazi forces .
however , as belgium has grown as a nation of diversity and understanding , the german-speaking community has become very integrated in the country and contact with out neighboring regions has increased over the years .
as a result , the german speakers consider themselves to be fully-fledged belgians and are accepted as such by their flemish and walloon compatriots .
could the german-speaking area support itself if belgium separated ?
if not , would it consider joining another region or hope to become part of germany again ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : lambertz has spoken of his support for regional autonomy the question of splitting belgium is a moot point .
it wo n't happen .
but for the sake of argument , despite its current state of stable and competent government , the german-speaking community would struggle to support itself in this hypothetical scenario and would have to join either wallonia or another state area .
there are some who push for this in the german-speaking community .
the current premier karl-heinz lambertz of the socialist party is one of the most prominent proponents of this idea .
these people say , as do the flemish , that wallonia is too much of a burden with its financial and social problems .
lambertz and others want a full transfer of powers from wallonia to the german-speaking parliament resulting in full regional autonomy .
is the cultural identity of the german-speaking minority strong ?
how is it protected ?
the cultural identity of the german speakers is deeply rooted .
our culture expresses itself in the german language spoken by the region 's people , the traditions that remain strong there and the creative and artistic expression in the region .
the position of the german-speaking community in the belgian federal state and its culture is protected by law in the constitution .
there are no worries within the community that the cultural identity of the german-speaking minority is under threat in belgium or by any policy of enlargement or expansion from the european union .
is the german-speaking minority in belgium influenced by the decisions of the european union ?
of course .
the eu has an influence on all countries which are member states , and that of course means that those people and minorities in those member states are influenced by eu policy .
the difference is that , unlike some minorities across europe , the german-speaking community does not fear these policies but welcomes them . nick amies send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the country 's german-speaking minority is maintaining a low profile in the debate . the debate concerning the political crisis in belgium and the unlikely , yet much discussed , possibility of the country splitting , has focused firmly on the disagreements between the two main linguistic areas , french-speaking wallonia and flemish-speaking flanders .
though these two areas are the largest in terms of size , and also importance when it comes to deciding policies which affect the whole country , belgium has in fact been divided into four linguistic regions since the early 1960s .
besides wallonia in the south and flanders in the north , there is the bilingual brussels capital region and the tiny german-speaking area in the east cantons .
while brussels is sometimes left out of the debate over belgium 's future - due mainly to its bilingualism , its self-sufficiency and its status as an international city - the east cantons seem to be ignored altogether when it comes to discussing the linguistic and cultural divide .
a region of 854 square kilometers -lrb- 530 square miles -rrb- with a population of over 73,000 , of which almost 100 percent are german speaking , the east cantons can quite easily be overlooked in belgium 's controversial situation .
the juicy arguments and stubborn nationalist positions of the more powerful flemings and walloons make for far better headlines than a quirky little germanic outpost on the far eastern border .
similar challenges and yet , the german-speaking community of the east cantons , as a linguistic minority within the federal state of belgium , faces similar challenges to those causing strife between " the big two . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the seat of german-speaking power is based in eupen granted internal rule in 1973 , the region has its own parliament in the capital of eupen and control over linguistic and cultural matters .
the parliament organizes elections , supervises the regional government , and adopts decrees for the german-speaking community .
the east cantons also have committees charged with governing areas such as education , social policy , health and employment .
despite this illusion of self-rule , however , the region still remains part of french-speaking wallonia , located as it is in the province of liege , and is therefore kept under the watchful eye of the wallon parliament .
it is not surprising that there are some in the east cantons who have themselves expressed a desire for the kind of autonomy favored by the more extreme elements on either side of the main linguistic divide .
a small but growing number have been voicing their support for an independent mini-state .
as is the case in the rest of the country , this is not a view shared by the whole population of the east cantons .
to get an idea how the german-speaking region and its people view their role in the wider belgian community , dw-world.de talked to jean-claude franken , the secretary of the german-speaking community 's christian social party -lrb- csp -rrb- , a cooperation partner of the francophone humanist democratic center -lrb- cdh -rrb- in the belgian parliament .
dw-world.de : is belgium 's german-speaking minority well integrated ?
jean-claude franken : the german-speaking minority is integrated in the belgian federal state very well .
there are special laws within the belgian constitution that protect the german-speaking community here .
how much power does the german-speaking minority have in belgium ?
the german-speaking community is an equal partner in the belgian federal state .
that is because there is no favoritism towards any of the linguistic minorities in the country in terms of the divulgence of power .
in the federal government , of course , the larger regions have the biggest political parties and therefore more seats in parliament , but our cooperation with the cdh allows us to have our say as part of wallonia .
in regional terms , the parties within the east canton - the csp , the socialist party , the party for freedom and progress and the party for german-speaking belgians - ensure that the autonomy we enjoy is used to make the community as self-reliant and efficient as possible .
does the german-speaking minority in belgium consider itself german or belgian ?
in former times , the region was part of prussia and therefore a small part of germany .
during world war ii , it was annexed again by germany after being part of belgium since the end of the great war .
when the east canton was returned to belgium once more in 1945 , some who lived there regretted this and wanted to stay german ; these were the same people who welcomed the occupying nazi forces .
however , as belgium has grown as a nation of diversity and understanding , the german-speaking community has become very integrated in the country and contact with out neighboring regions has increased over the years .
as a result , the german speakers consider themselves to be fully-fledged belgians and are accepted as such by their flemish and walloon compatriots .
could the german-speaking area support itself if belgium separated ?
if not , would it consider joining another region or hope to become part of germany again ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : lambertz has spoken of his support for regional autonomy the question of splitting belgium is a moot point .
it wo n't happen .
but for the sake of argument , despite its current state of stable and competent government , the german-speaking community would struggle to support itself in this hypothetical scenario and would have to join either wallonia or another state area .
there are some who push for this in the german-speaking community .
the current premier karl-heinz lambertz of the socialist party is one of the most prominent proponents of this idea .
these people say , as do the flemish , that wallonia is too much of a burden with its financial and social problems .
lambertz and others want a full transfer of powers from wallonia to the german-speaking parliament resulting in full regional autonomy .
is the cultural identity of the german-speaking minority strong ?
how is it protected ?
the cultural identity of the german speakers is deeply rooted .
our culture expresses itself in the german language spoken by the region 's people , the traditions that remain strong there and the creative and artistic expression in the region .
the position of the german-speaking community in the belgian federal state and its culture is protected by law in the constitution .
there are no worries within the community that the cultural identity of the german-speaking minority is under threat in belgium or by any policy of enlargement or expansion from the european union .
is the german-speaking minority in belgium influenced by the decisions of the european union ?
of course .
the eu has an influence on all countries which are member states , and that of course means that those people and minorities in those member states are influenced by eu policy .
the difference is that , unlike some minorities across europe , the german-speaking community does not fear these policies but welcomes them . nick amies send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

a region of 854 square kilometers -lrb- 530 square miles -rrb- with a population of over 73,000 , of which almost 100 percent are german speaking , the east cantons can quite easily be overlooked in belgium 's controversial situation .
the juicy arguments and stubborn nationalist positions of the more powerful flemings and walloons make for far better headlines than a quirky little germanic outpost on the far eastern border .
similar challenges and yet , the german-speaking community of the east cantons , as a linguistic minority within the federal state of belgium , faces similar challenges to those causing strife between " the big two . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the seat of german-speaking power is based in eupen granted internal rule in 1973 , the region has its own parliament in the capital of eupen and control over linguistic and cultural matters .
the parliament organizes elections , supervises the regional government , and adopts decrees for the german-speaking community .
the east cantons also have committees charged with governing areas such as education , social policy , health and employment .
despite this illusion of self-rule , however , the region still remains part of french-speaking wallonia , located as it is in the province of liege , and is therefore kept under the watchful eye of the wallon parliament .
it is not surprising that there are some in the east cantons who have themselves expressed a desire for the kind of autonomy favored by the more extreme elements on either side of the main linguistic divide .
a small but growing number have been voicing their support for an independent mini-state .
as is the case in the rest of the country , this is not a view shared by the whole population of the east cantons .
to get an idea how the german-speaking region and its people view their role in the wider belgian community , dw-world.de talked to jean-claude franken , the secretary of the german-speaking community 's christian social party -lrb- csp -rrb- , a cooperation partner of the francophone humanist democratic center -lrb- cdh -rrb- in the belgian parliament .
dw-world.de : is belgium 's german-speaking minority well integrated ?
jean-claude franken : the german-speaking minority is integrated in the belgian federal state very well .
there are special laws within the belgian constitution that protect the german-speaking community here .
how much power does the german-speaking minority have in belgium ?
the german-speaking community is an equal partner in the belgian federal state .
that is because there is no favoritism towards any of the linguistic minorities in the country in terms of the divulgence of power .
in the federal government , of course , the larger regions have the biggest political parties and therefore more seats in parliament , but our cooperation with the cdh allows us to have our say as part of wallonia .
in regional terms , the parties within the east canton - the csp , the socialist party , the party for freedom and progress and the party for german-speaking belgians - ensure that the autonomy we enjoy is used to make the community as self-reliant and efficient as possible .
does the german-speaking minority in belgium consider itself german or belgian ?
in former times , the region was part of prussia and therefore a small part of germany .
during world war ii , it was annexed again by germany after being part of belgium since the end of the great war .
when the east canton was returned to belgium once more in 1945 , some who lived there regretted this and wanted to stay german ; these were the same people who welcomed the occupying nazi forces .
however , as belgium has grown as a nation of diversity and understanding , the german-speaking community has become very integrated in the country and contact with out neighboring regions has increased over the years .
as a result , the german speakers consider themselves to be fully-fledged belgians and are accepted as such by their flemish and walloon compatriots .
could the german-speaking area support itself if belgium separated ?
if not , would it consider joining another region or hope to become part of germany again ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : lambertz has spoken of his support for regional autonomy the question of splitting belgium is a moot point .
it wo n't happen .
but for the sake of argument , despite its current state of stable and competent government , the german-speaking community would struggle to support itself in this hypothetical scenario and would have to join either wallonia or another state area .
there are some who push for this in the german-speaking community .
the current premier karl-heinz lambertz of the socialist party is one of the most prominent proponents of this idea .
these people say , as do the flemish , that wallonia is too much of a burden with its financial and social problems .
lambertz and others want a full transfer of powers from wallonia to the german-speaking parliament resulting in full regional autonomy .
is the cultural identity of the german-speaking minority strong ?
how is it protected ?
the cultural identity of the german speakers is deeply rooted .
our culture expresses itself in the german language spoken by the region 's people , the traditions that remain strong there and the creative and artistic expression in the region .
the position of the german-speaking community in the belgian federal state and its culture is protected by law in the constitution .
there are no worries within the community that the cultural identity of the german-speaking minority is under threat in belgium or by any policy of enlargement or expansion from the european union .
is the german-speaking minority in belgium influenced by the decisions of the european union ?
of course .
the eu has an influence on all countries which are member states , and that of course means that those people and minorities in those member states are influenced by eu policy .
the difference is that , unlike some minorities across europe , the german-speaking community does not fear these policies but welcomes them . nick amies send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

27 , many in the german press commented on the difference in conservative campaigns and what the results meant for the future of angela merkel 's party . the frankfurter rundschau wrote that incumbent premier roland koch has no one to blame but himself for the result in hesse .
" koch chose the wrong topic to champion and led the wrong election campaign , " it stated .
" he set himself up by making strong announcements which contradicted his own actions .
the public noticed that calls for swift justice from the state with the slowest judicial system in the country were implausible , and they have punished koch for this . "
the paper continued by saying that koch 's losses were also angela merkel 's losses .
" the chancellor supported this tough election campaign , " it wrote , " and now the conservatives must ask whether her governance endangers the future of the -lsb- christian democratic -rsb- union . " the bremer nachrichten pondered the consequences of the state elections for the chancellor and the cdu 's coming parliamentary election campaign .
" which way now for angela merkel ? " the paper asked .
" not only is it that social democrats -lsb- spd -rsb- must find their direction but also the conservatives .
should she take the careful approach or come out fighting like roland koch ?
reading the results from lower saxony and hesse , the decision should be clear . " " rambo koch loses , cuddly wulff wins , " stated the westdeutsche allgemeine zeitung .
" koch 's campaign failed because it focused on his weaknesses not his strengths .
there was no policy substance to his rhetoric and such a thing costs credibility , especially when policy is so important and at a time when the voters look for strong policies not just words . " the thüringer allgemeine zeitung also focused on koch 's performance .
" koch has abandoned his instincts and abandoned the voters , " it wrote .
" that the electorate reacted against this is a good thing .
it would be an ominous sign for the political culture in germany if the people had allowed themselves to have been manipulated by such a campaign .
the majority of people in hesse recognized that sloganeering is not the right approach to the multi-layered subject of juvenile delinquency .
this is why christian wulff , with his low-key election campaign , ran to a clear victory . " the stuttgarter zeitung also picked up on the differences in the conservative candidates ' approaches and results .
" the one winner in the state elections this sunday is christian wulff , which is not so surprising given the weakness of his social democratic spd opponent wolfgang jüttner , " the paper wrote .
the paper acknowledged , however , that despite the spd 's ineptitude , wulff led a winning campaign without the need to resort to the strong-arm tactics and verbal failures of his hessian colleague roland koch .
the paper suggested that wulff should be considered the heir apparent to chancellor merkel and that his victory should signal a rise in his profile within the cdu . the spd 's inability to force home a clear advantage in the state elections was also picked up on by the rhein-neckar zeitung .
" the state elections were less about regional politics and more about the performances of the candidates , " it wrote .
" the most significant signal was the fact that spd leader kurt beck could not lead a socialist election campaign which was better than that fought by the left party . "
the paper also wrote that roland koch 's performance and the chancellor 's support of his campaign should be a wake-up call to merkel , who the paper suggested should follow christian wulff 's approach , and not koch 's , in the future . the frankfurter allgemeine zeitung also lamented the state of german politics highlighted by the inability of the social democrats to capitalize on weakened and disliked conservative candidates .
the paper complained that a weak and directionless spd made the conservatives look good , despite their own poor showing .
" we now know the weaknesses of the spd , " it wrote , " poor in candidates and poor in profile … one wonders how the cdu would have responded to a stronger opponent .

27 , many in the german press commented on the difference in conservative campaigns and what the results meant for the future of angela merkel 's party . the frankfurter rundschau wrote that incumbent premier roland koch has no one to blame but himself for the result in hesse .
" koch chose the wrong topic to champion and led the wrong election campaign , " it stated .
" he set himself up by making strong announcements which contradicted his own actions .
the public noticed that calls for swift justice from the state with the slowest judicial system in the country were implausible , and they have punished koch for this . "
the paper continued by saying that koch 's losses were also angela merkel 's losses .
" the chancellor supported this tough election campaign , " it wrote , " and now the conservatives must ask whether her governance endangers the future of the -lsb- christian democratic -rsb- union . " the bremer nachrichten pondered the consequences of the state elections for the chancellor and the cdu 's coming parliamentary election campaign .
" which way now for angela merkel ? " the paper asked .
" not only is it that social democrats -lsb- spd -rsb- must find their direction but also the conservatives .
should she take the careful approach or come out fighting like roland koch ?
reading the results from lower saxony and hesse , the decision should be clear . " " rambo koch loses , cuddly wulff wins , " stated the westdeutsche allgemeine zeitung .
" koch 's campaign failed because it focused on his weaknesses not his strengths .
there was no policy substance to his rhetoric and such a thing costs credibility , especially when policy is so important and at a time when the voters look for strong policies not just words . " the thüringer allgemeine zeitung also focused on koch 's performance .
" koch has abandoned his instincts and abandoned the voters , " it wrote .
" that the electorate reacted against this is a good thing .
it would be an ominous sign for the political culture in germany if the people had allowed themselves to have been manipulated by such a campaign .
the majority of people in hesse recognized that sloganeering is not the right approach to the multi-layered subject of juvenile delinquency .
this is why christian wulff , with his low-key election campaign , ran to a clear victory . " the stuttgarter zeitung also picked up on the differences in the conservative candidates ' approaches and results .
" the one winner in the state elections this sunday is christian wulff , which is not so surprising given the weakness of his social democratic spd opponent wolfgang jüttner , " the paper wrote .
the paper acknowledged , however , that despite the spd 's ineptitude , wulff led a winning campaign without the need to resort to the strong-arm tactics and verbal failures of his hessian colleague roland koch .
the paper suggested that wulff should be considered the heir apparent to chancellor merkel and that his victory should signal a rise in his profile within the cdu . the spd 's inability to force home a clear advantage in the state elections was also picked up on by the rhein-neckar zeitung .
" the state elections were less about regional politics and more about the performances of the candidates , " it wrote .
" the most significant signal was the fact that spd leader kurt beck could not lead a socialist election campaign which was better than that fought by the left party . "
the paper also wrote that roland koch 's performance and the chancellor 's support of his campaign should be a wake-up call to merkel , who the paper suggested should follow christian wulff 's approach , and not koch 's , in the future . the frankfurter allgemeine zeitung also lamented the state of german politics highlighted by the inability of the social democrats to capitalize on weakened and disliked conservative candidates .
the paper complained that a weak and directionless spd made the conservatives look good , despite their own poor showing .

but foreign ministers agreed to offer belgrade an interim agreement after the vote . the european union 's attempt to sign a full stabilization and association agreement with serbia before the presidential election on feb .
7 was hampered by the netherlands , which demanded full serbian cooperation with the un war crimes tribunal on former yugoslavia -lrb- icty -rrb- before any deal was signed . the pact , which would have secured closer ties ahead of the election run-off between serbia 's pro-european president boris tadic and nationalist challenger tomislav nikolic , a pro-russian hardliner , was intended to boost tadic 's campaign and help ease serbia 's accession to the eu . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the eu wants to boost boris tadic 's campaign instead eu ministers agreed to sign an interim agreement on cooperation covering trade and visas . " this is a text that will open up doors for serbia to the eu , " slovenian foreign minister dimitrij rupel told reporters . serbian foreign minister vuk jeremic welcomed the eu 's invitation to sign an interim political accord after the run-off election . " today is a great day , " he said .
" i hope the citizens of serbia will give us a mandate on feb .
3 to sign this agreement . " dutch european affairs minister frans timmermans said his country , which has led opposition to a lenient line on belgrade , would continue to oppose the signing of the full saa . " we will not sign till we have full cooperation with the icty , " he told reporters . timmermans insisted that his country is " prepared to sign an saa with serbia at the moment serbia hands over the people indicted by the yugoslavia tribunal , " and not before . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : nikolic is russia 's preferred candidate for the post of president the tribunal is seeking the arrest and transfer of former bosnian serb military commander ratko mladic on genocide charges over the 1995 srebrenica massacre of 7,000 bosnian muslims . the european union has made full cooperation with the tribunal a condition for signing the saa , which is a first formal step on the path to eu membership . no change in eu policy german foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier said the signing of an interim deal did not mean the eu was shying away from serbia . " the stabilization and association agreement wo n't be signed in the coming days but this does n't mean that our policy has changed , " he told journalists .
" we want to send a signal that our hand is stretched out to serbia . " the interim agreement could assist tadic in his campaign against nikolic but eu officials admitted that they had received mixed signals from belgrade as to whether a signing ceremony would hurt or help the pro-europe candidate 's prospects . tadic currently trails nikolic who took a five-point lead in the first round this weekend . eu boost to pro-europe candidate ahead of kosovo move eu leaders are keen to see tadic win to bolster pro-european forces ahead of an expected declaration of independence by politicians in the serbian province of kosovo . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the eu plans to boost its forces in kosovo the leaders of kosovo 's ethnic albanian majority , who make up 90 percent of the province 's 2 million people , say they are within weeks of declaring independence from serbia . the eu plans to send a 1,800-persn strong mission to kosovo to help ease its transition to local rule , but is still waiting for a signal from un secretary-general ban ki-moon to do so .
the united nations has run kosovo since 1999 , when a nato bombing campaign drove out belgrade 's forces waging a crackdown on independence-seeking ethnic albanians . failure to deliver may increase serbian distrust in eu bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : serbia " wo n't give away kosovo " to help ease serbia 's pain in losing a province belgrade considers to be an integral part of its territory and culture , the eu has made several moves in recent months to bring serbia into the fold .
but there is much skepticism in serbia of the eu 's motives and the latest stalling on the saa is unlikely to help . a failure to put an agreement in place soon would " fuel a widely present perception of permanent exclusion and unparalleled conditioning , " srdjan gligorijevic , chief analyst for the belgrade-based international and security affairs centre think-tank , told reuters news agency .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de press review -pipe- 28.01.2008 german press review : rambo koch loses out to cuddly wulff großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : chancellor merkel is now taking heat for her support of koch 's failed campaign after the state elections in lower saxony and hesse on sunday , jan .
27 , many in the german press commented on the difference in conservative campaigns and what the results meant for the future of angela merkel 's party . the frankfurter rundschau wrote that incumbent premier roland koch has no one to blame but himself for the result in hesse .
" koch chose the wrong topic to champion and led the wrong election campaign , " it stated .
" he set himself up by making strong announcements which contradicted his own actions .
the public noticed that calls for swift justice from the state with the slowest judicial system in the country were implausible , and they have punished koch for this . "
the paper continued by saying that koch 's losses were also angela merkel 's losses .
" the chancellor supported this tough election campaign , " it wrote , " and now the conservatives must ask whether her governance endangers the future of the -lsb- christian democratic -rsb- union . " the bremer nachrichten pondered the consequences of the state elections for the chancellor and the cdu 's coming parliamentary election campaign .
" which way now for angela merkel ? " the paper asked .
" not only is it that social democrats -lsb- spd -rsb- must find their direction but also the conservatives .
should she take the careful approach or come out fighting like roland koch ?
reading the results from lower saxony and hesse , the decision should be clear . " " rambo koch loses , cuddly wulff wins , " stated the westdeutsche allgemeine zeitung .
" koch 's campaign failed because it focused on his weaknesses not his strengths .
there was no policy substance to his rhetoric and such a thing costs credibility , especially when policy is so important and at a time when the voters look for strong policies not just words . " the thüringer allgemeine zeitung also focused on koch 's performance .
" koch has abandoned his instincts and abandoned the voters , " it wrote .
" that the electorate reacted against this is a good thing .
it would be an ominous sign for the political culture in germany if the people had allowed themselves to have been manipulated by such a campaign .
the majority of people in hesse recognized that sloganeering is not the right approach to the multi-layered subject of juvenile delinquency .
this is why christian wulff , with his low-key election campaign , ran to a clear victory . " the stuttgarter zeitung also picked up on the differences in the conservative candidates ' approaches and results .
" the one winner in the state elections this sunday is christian wulff , which is not so surprising given the weakness of his social democratic spd opponent wolfgang jüttner , " the paper wrote .
the paper acknowledged , however , that despite the spd 's ineptitude , wulff led a winning campaign without the need to resort to the strong-arm tactics and verbal failures of his hessian colleague roland koch .
the paper suggested that wulff should be considered the heir apparent to chancellor merkel and that his victory should signal a rise in his profile within the cdu . the spd 's inability to force home a clear advantage in the state elections was also picked up on by the rhein-neckar zeitung .
" the state elections were less about regional politics and more about the performances of the candidates , " it wrote .
" the most significant signal was the fact that spd leader kurt beck could not lead a socialist election campaign which was better than that fought by the left party . "
the paper also wrote that roland koch 's performance and the chancellor 's support of his campaign should be a wake-up call to merkel , who the paper suggested should follow christian wulff 's approach , and not koch 's , in the future . the frankfurter allgemeine zeitung also lamented the state of german politics highlighted by the inability of the social democrats to capitalize on weakened and disliked conservative candidates .
the paper complained that a weak and directionless spd made the conservatives look good , despite their own poor showing .
" we now know the weaknesses of the spd , " it wrote , " poor in candidates and poor in profile … one wonders how the cdu would have responded to a stronger opponent .

after the votes were counted , hesse 's incumbent premier , roland koch , had a hair-thin majority , making uncertain the sort of coalition that could form a government and what role the candidate koch - who had led a controversial , openly xenophobic campaign - could have in it .
at midmorning on monday , jan .
28 , political advisers from all parties involved had holed up for strategy meetings .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ypsilanti will likely lead a coalition - but with whom ?
official results from hesse showed the conservative cdu had slumped from a majority in the state legislature to finish only nominally ahead of the center-left social democrats -lrb- spd -rrb- , with the same number of seats .
the spd candidate in hesse , andrea ypsilanti , took 36.7 percent of the vote against the cdu 's 36.8 .
search for a coalition a deputy cdu leader in another state , premier christian wulff of lower saxony , won re-election in a separate vote sunday , despite moderate losses .
the left , a combination of former social democrats and eastern ex-communists , extended its reach in western germany to enter both state parliaments .
but gains for the left party and spd in hesse mean the cdu , together with its planned coalition partner free democrats -lrb- fdp -rrb- , no longer have a large enough majority to rule in the state parliament in wiesbaden .
this gives a clear mandate to the spd to enter the state government in hesse , according to acting spd chairwoman andrea nahles .
voters saw to it that koch took " the most brutal beating possible , " nahles told rbb news radio on monday .
while the spd failed " by a nose " to gain a clear majority , it was clear that the voters in the western state increasingly stood behind the center-left party , and it should therefore be part of the government , she said .
ypsilanti is currently in talks with other party representatives to discuss coalition possibilities .
but nahles reiterated ypsilanti 's campaign promise that her party would not enter into a coalition with the upsurge , far-left left party , saying " the program and the people that they represent in hesse do not stand for stability in government . "
" traffic light " coalition possible ?
meanwhile , spd secretary general hubertus heil called for a " traffic light " coalition to rule hesse , which would be made up of the spd -lrb- red -rrb- , free democrats -lrb- yellow -rrb- and green party , under the leadership of ypsilanti .
" there is a koch-must-go mood -lsb- among voters -rsb- that we have to take into account when making up the government , " heil told zdf television talk show morgenmagazin on monday .
" we will present the premier , i am fairly sure of that , " he said .
yet a parliamentary leader of the fdp from hesse , jörg-uwe hahn , said there is no way that his party would enter into a " traffic light " coalition .
the fdp had planned to be coalition partner with the right-wing cdu , and could not be used as " a training wheel for a red-green " coalition , he told the dpa press agency .
hahn predicted a coalition would form between the spd , greens and the left party .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel 's cdu should avoid negative campaigns , one observer said amid the speculations on a new government , political observers took the time to mull over just what went so very wrong in the campaign of incumbent koch - and what it could mean for the larger question of cdu domination in german politics .
koch faulted for polarizing strategy chemnitz-based election researcher eckhard jesse said the cdu should see the campaign as a powerful lesson . with his polarizing , xenophobic rhetoric about youth-crime , koch led the campaign as if he were an opposition candidate , not an incumbent , jesse told the thüringer allgemeine newspaper .
merkel and other cdu candidates need to draw the conclusion that " they should take the same tact as wulff , " who handily won the state election in lower saxony .
" that means that they should run a low-key , feel-good campaign .
they should n't polarize - especially not the chancellor , " he said .
and political scientist theo schiller said koch had reaped what he sowed from his controversial style .
" if koch had n't focused his campaign on youth crime and young offenders , the results might have been slightly different , " the professor at the university of marburg told dpa .
the results were " catastrophic " for the cdu , he said .
by focusing on youth crime , koch aimed to harm the spd , but instead pilloried his own party , schiller said .
" he raised the question of deficits during the years his own government had ruled , " he said .
and was not able to give any satisfactory answers , he added .
no stopping rise of the left like a number of other german political analysts , schiller saw the left party 's gains as a sign of things to come .
" we can expect the left to enter other state parliaments , " he told dpa .
but he also said he did not see the likelihood of the left entering into a ruling coalition in hesse together with the spd .
that would mean ypsilanti would have to go back on her word to too great an extent , he said . dw staff -lrb- jen -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

while the spd failed " by a nose " to gain a clear majority , it was clear that the voters in the western state increasingly stood behind the center-left party , and it should therefore be part of the government , she said .
ypsilanti is currently in talks with other party representatives to discuss coalition possibilities .
but nahles reiterated ypsilanti 's campaign promise that her party would not enter into a coalition with the upsurge , far-left left party , saying " the program and the people that they represent in hesse do not stand for stability in government . "
" traffic light " coalition possible ?
meanwhile , spd secretary general hubertus heil called for a " traffic light " coalition to rule hesse , which would be made up of the spd -lrb- red -rrb- , free democrats -lrb- yellow -rrb- and green party , under the leadership of ypsilanti .
" there is a koch-must-go mood -lsb- among voters -rsb- that we have to take into account when making up the government , " heil told zdf television talk show morgenmagazin on monday .
" we will present the premier , i am fairly sure of that , " he said .
yet a parliamentary leader of the fdp from hesse , jörg-uwe hahn , said there is no way that his party would enter into a " traffic light " coalition .
the fdp had planned to be coalition partner with the right-wing cdu , and could not be used as " a training wheel for a red-green " coalition , he told the dpa press agency .
hahn predicted a coalition would form between the spd , greens and the left party .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel 's cdu should avoid negative campaigns , one observer said amid the speculations on a new government , political observers took the time to mull over just what went so very wrong in the campaign of incumbent koch - and what it could mean for the larger question of cdu domination in german politics .
koch faulted for polarizing strategy chemnitz-based election researcher eckhard jesse said the cdu should see the campaign as a powerful lesson . with his polarizing , xenophobic rhetoric about youth-crime , koch led the campaign as if he were an opposition candidate , not an incumbent , jesse told the thüringer allgemeine newspaper .
merkel and other cdu candidates need to draw the conclusion that " they should take the same tact as wulff , " who handily won the state election in lower saxony .
" that means that they should run a low-key , feel-good campaign .
they should n't polarize - especially not the chancellor , " he said .
and political scientist theo schiller said koch had reaped what he sowed from his controversial style .
" if koch had n't focused his campaign on youth crime and young offenders , the results might have been slightly different , " the professor at the university of marburg told dpa .
the results were " catastrophic " for the cdu , he said .
by focusing on youth crime , koch aimed to harm the spd , but instead pilloried his own party , schiller said .
" he raised the question of deficits during the years his own government had ruled , " he said .
and was not able to give any satisfactory answers , he added .
no stopping rise of the left like a number of other german political analysts , schiller saw the left party 's gains as a sign of things to come .
" we can expect the left to enter other state parliaments , " he told dpa .
but he also said he did not see the likelihood of the left entering into a ruling coalition in hesse together with the spd .
that would mean ypsilanti would have to go back on her word to too great an extent , he said . dw staff -lrb- jen -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

but it 's yet to be seen which party will be able to form a governing coalition . led by merkel ally and incumbent premier roland koch , who ran a controversial campaign focused on crime and immigration , the cdu took 36.8 percent of the vote , down from 48.8 percent in 2003 . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the state election in hesse polarized germans nationwide " we did n't mobilize our own supporters enough , " koch said on public television .
" this is not easily for me personally . " the rival social democrats -lrb- spd -rrb- , who rule together with merkel 's cdu at the national level , saw their support push up to 36.7 percent . " we fought for a different political culture in this country and we won , " said koch 's spd challenger , andrea ypsilanti . it remains unclear , however , which party will take power .
the entry into hesse 's parliament of the new left party - a far-left grouping which came out of a merger of a social democratic splinter group and the successor party to the former east german communists - prevents both cdu and spd from securing a majority in the 110-seat state legislature in coalition with their preferred partners , the free-market liberal fdp and the greens respectively .
the left party took home 5.1 percent , the fdp received 9.4 percent and the greens got 7.5 percent . a different case bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : despite nearly 6-point drop in votes , christian wulff will stay in power in lower saxony in another state election , in lower saxony , incumbent cdu premier christian wulff saw his support fall to 42.5 percent from 48.3 percent in 2003 .
unlike in hesse , however , his result is good enough for him to hold on to power in a coalition with the fdp . here the spd scored its worst result in recent years , declining to around 30.3 percent from 33.4 percent in 2003 . in all , some 10.5 million people were eligible to vote in the two western states , in both of which angela merkel 's christian democrats -lrb- cdu -rrb- have put up the premiers for the past five years . a blow for merkel bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel 's support for koch was not enough to help him win the election the setback which the conservatives were dealt in hesse will also be seen as a blow to the chancellor , who stood firmly behind roland koch during the election campaign and repeatedly defended koch 's proposals for tougher measures against young criminals of foreign origin . " in hesse the conservatives have suffered such losses that it is clear that koch 's election campaign has n't worked , " said richard stöss , a political scientist at berlin 's free university . the spd 's ypsilanti , on the other hand , focused in her campaign on the traditional spd themes of wages , education and the integration of minorities .
this has brought the social democrats a gain of almost 8 percent in comparison to the previous state election . the result is likely to create even more tension in the already strained relations between the cdu and spd on the national level , which some fear could result in a political stalemate in the " grand coalition " until the 2009 national elections . an important race bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : incumbent state premier roland koch has divided the nation the state elections in hesse and lower saxony were widely seen as a test of the cdu 's strength ahead of federal elections , which must be held by september 2009 . merkel remains highly popular in germany but faces risks from a slowing economy ahead of next year 's national vote . " a loss in hesse would be bad for morale for the cdu nationally and for merkel , " political scientist jürgen falter told the bild am sonntag newspaper . ypsilanti 's victory in hesse could potentially give spd chief kurt beck a boost in his bid to dismantle labor market reforms introduced by merkel 's predecessor gerhard schröder , which are credited with helping to fuel a recovery of europe 's biggest economy . social democrats would also be likely to push harder to create a national minimum wage - a popular proposal that many economists have branded a job killer . the left gaining ground bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : left party candidate in hesse , willi van ooyen the fact that both state elections showed a clear shift to the left - after years in which merkel 's conservatives outperformed the social democrats - is , nonetheless , not all good news for the spd . the left party passed the 5-percent threshold to enter the parliament in both states . it is the first time that the party , led by former finance minister oskar lafontaine , will enter parliament in a large western state . spd officials have so far ruled out any possibility of entering into coalition agreements with the left . dw staff -lrb- tt -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

7 was hampered by the netherlands , which demanded full serbian cooperation with the un war crimes tribunal on former yugoslavia -lrb- icty -rrb- before any deal was signed . the pact , which would have secured closer ties ahead of the election run-off between serbia 's pro-european president boris tadic and nationalist challenger tomislav nikolic , a pro-russian hardliner , was intended to boost tadic 's campaign and help ease serbia 's accession to the eu . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the eu wants to boost boris tadic 's campaign instead eu ministers agreed to sign an interim agreement on cooperation covering trade and visas .

" today is a great day , " he said .
" i hope the citizens of serbia will give us a mandate on feb .
3 to sign this agreement . " dutch european affairs minister frans timmermans said his country , which has led opposition to a lenient line on belgrade , would continue to oppose the signing of the full saa . " we will not sign till we have full cooperation with the icty , " he told reporters . timmermans insisted that his country is " prepared to sign an saa with serbia at the moment serbia hands over the people indicted by the yugoslavia tribunal , " and not before . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : nikolic is russia 's preferred candidate for the post of president the tribunal is seeking the arrest and transfer of former bosnian serb military commander ratko mladic on genocide charges over the 1995 srebrenica massacre of 7,000 bosnian muslims . the european union has made full cooperation with the tribunal a condition for signing the saa , which is a first formal step on the path to eu membership . no change in eu policy german foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier said the signing of an interim deal did not mean the eu was shying away from serbia . " the stabilization and association agreement wo n't be signed in the coming days but this does n't mean that our policy has changed , " he told journalists .
" we want to send a signal that our hand is stretched out to serbia . " the interim agreement could assist tadic in his campaign against nikolic but eu officials admitted that they had received mixed signals from belgrade as to whether a signing ceremony would hurt or help the pro-europe candidate 's prospects . tadic currently trails nikolic who took a five-point lead in the first round this weekend . eu boost to pro-europe candidate ahead of kosovo move eu leaders are keen to see tadic win to bolster pro-european forces ahead of an expected declaration of independence by politicians in the serbian province of kosovo . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the eu plans to boost its forces in kosovo the leaders of kosovo 's ethnic albanian majority , who make up 90 percent of the province 's 2 million people , say they are within weeks of declaring independence from serbia . the eu plans to send a 1,800-persn strong mission to kosovo to help ease its transition to local rule , but is still waiting for a signal from un secretary-general ban ki-moon to do so .

but there is much skepticism in serbia of the eu 's motives and the latest stalling on the saa is unlikely to help . a failure to put an agreement in place soon would " fuel a widely present perception of permanent exclusion and unparalleled conditioning , " srdjan gligorijevic , chief analyst for the belgrade-based international and security affairs centre think-tank , told reuters news agency .

after the votes were counted , hesse 's incumbent premier , roland koch , had a hair-thin majority , making uncertain the sort of coalition that could form a government and what role the candidate koch - who had led a controversial , openly xenophobic campaign - could have in it .
at midmorning on monday , jan .
28 , political advisers from all parties involved had holed up for strategy meetings .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ypsilanti will likely lead a coalition - but with whom ?
official results from hesse showed the conservative cdu had slumped from a majority in the state legislature to finish only nominally ahead of the center-left social democrats -lrb- spd -rrb- , with the same number of seats .
the spd candidate in hesse , andrea ypsilanti , took 36.7 percent of the vote against the cdu 's 36.8 .
search for a coalition a deputy cdu leader in another state , premier christian wulff of lower saxony , won re-election in a separate vote sunday , despite moderate losses .
the left , a combination of former social democrats and eastern ex-communists , extended its reach in western germany to enter both state parliaments .
but gains for the left party and spd in hesse mean the cdu , together with its planned coalition partner free democrats -lrb- fdp -rrb- , no longer have a large enough majority to rule in the state parliament in wiesbaden .
this gives a clear mandate to the spd to enter the state government in hesse , according to acting spd chairwoman andrea nahles .
voters saw to it that koch took " the most brutal beating possible , " nahles told rbb news radio on monday .
while the spd failed " by a nose " to gain a clear majority , it was clear that the voters in the western state increasingly stood behind the center-left party , and it should therefore be part of the government , she said .
ypsilanti is currently in talks with other party representatives to discuss coalition possibilities .
but nahles reiterated ypsilanti 's campaign promise that her party would not enter into a coalition with the upsurge , far-left left party , saying " the program and the people that they represent in hesse do not stand for stability in government . "
" traffic light " coalition possible ?
meanwhile , spd secretary general hubertus heil called for a " traffic light " coalition to rule hesse , which would be made up of the spd -lrb- red -rrb- , free democrats -lrb- yellow -rrb- and green party , under the leadership of ypsilanti .
" there is a koch-must-go mood -lsb- among voters -rsb- that we have to take into account when making up the government , " heil told zdf television talk show morgenmagazin on monday .
" we will present the premier , i am fairly sure of that , " he said .
yet a parliamentary leader of the fdp from hesse , jörg-uwe hahn , said there is no way that his party would enter into a " traffic light " coalition .
the fdp had planned to be coalition partner with the right-wing cdu , and could not be used as " a training wheel for a red-green " coalition , he told the dpa press agency .
hahn predicted a coalition would form between the spd , greens and the left party .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel 's cdu should avoid negative campaigns , one observer said amid the speculations on a new government , political observers took the time to mull over just what went so very wrong in the campaign of incumbent koch - and what it could mean for the larger question of cdu domination in german politics .
koch faulted for polarizing strategy chemnitz-based election researcher eckhard jesse said the cdu should see the campaign as a powerful lesson . with his polarizing , xenophobic rhetoric about youth-crime , koch led the campaign as if he were an opposition candidate , not an incumbent , jesse told the thüringer allgemeine newspaper .
merkel and other cdu candidates need to draw the conclusion that " they should take the same tact as wulff , " who handily won the state election in lower saxony .
" that means that they should run a low-key , feel-good campaign .
they should n't polarize - especially not the chancellor , " he said .
and political scientist theo schiller said koch had reaped what he sowed from his controversial style .
" if koch had n't focused his campaign on youth crime and young offenders , the results might have been slightly different , " the professor at the university of marburg told dpa .
the results were " catastrophic " for the cdu , he said .
by focusing on youth crime , koch aimed to harm the spd , but instead pilloried his own party , schiller said .
" he raised the question of deficits during the years his own government had ruled , " he said .
and was not able to give any satisfactory answers , he added .
no stopping rise of the left like a number of other german political analysts , schiller saw the left party 's gains as a sign of things to come .
" we can expect the left to enter other state parliaments , " he told dpa .
but he also said he did not see the likelihood of the left entering into a ruling coalition in hesse together with the spd .
that would mean ypsilanti would have to go back on her word to too great an extent , he said . dw staff -lrb- jen -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de players -pipe- 28.01.2008 europe 's big spenders track bundesliga stars großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : this season 's hottest items : werder bremen 's diego and hamburg 's van der vaart as many of europe 's top leagues face a frantic week of dealing before the january transfer window closes , the continent 's big spenders are looking to come to germany for some last minute shopping . the bundesliga may be enjoying its most glamorous season in years thanks to the international stars who have chosen to ply their trade in germany , but question remains as to how long it can maintain its new celebrity status . while the big names and transfer coups have turned the media spotlight on german soccer in a way previously thought beyond its means , the downside of this attention is becoming obvious .
the bundesliga is in danger of turning from a glittering stage into an enticing shop window . while the german top flight has n't ever been exactly below the radar , other european teams looking for new players have given their german counterparts little more than a cursory glance before taking their checkbooks to italy or spain .
more bargain basement than armani or balenciaga , the bundesliga just did n't have the same appeal as serie a or the primera liga . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : diamonds in the rough : luca toni and franck ribery but sew a few diamonds into the cut-price cloth and anyone looking for glamour will certainly spot a sparkle or two .
with the likes of luca toni , franck ribery , rafael van der vaart , miroslav klose and diego lighting up the german league , it was only a matter of time before the big spenders would spot an untapped market . two of the league 's brightest midfield stars top the shoppers ' most-wanted lists .
with the january transfer window closing at the end of the week , werder bremen and hamburg will be bracing themselves for " money 's no object " offers for diego and van der vaart respectively . van der vaart on italian shopping list italian giants juventus are hunting the two mini maestros and while bremen are trying as hard as they can to hang onto their prized brazilian playmaker , hamburg have confirmed they have already spoken to the turin team about a price for their want-away dutchman . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : van der vaart could be turin-bound " we are in discussions with juventus , but we ca n't say more at this stage , " hamburg spokesman jörn wolf recently told german agency sid . van der vaart is under contract until 2010 , but can leave hamburg next year for a fixed transfer fee of 1.5 million euros -lrb- $ 2 million -rrb- , but the 24-year-old is reported to be worth 20 million euros in the current market and hamburg may want to capitalize on that estimation , with spanish giants barcelona also interested in the diminutive dutchman . the midfielder , who made a shock move to the bundesliga from ajax in 2005 when everyone expected him to land in spain or italy , paved the way for other big names to come to the bundesliga .
his exit may prompt a similar spate of transfers in the opposite direction . diego coveted by europe 's biggest clubs diego , meanwhile , is being fiercely protected in bremen with juventus , inter milan , real madrid and chelsea all reportedly circling the weserstadion in search of his signature on the dotted line . despite juventus coach claudio ranieri 's desire to see diego play at the stadio olimpico di torino , it will take more than covetous comments to spirit werder 's top scorer away . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : diego has let his feet do the talking at bremen " there is no inquiry from juventus , and we will not talk with any clubs about signing diego , he is a firm part of our plans , " said werder 's director of sport klaus allofs , who reminded potential suitors that the brazilian is contracted until june 2011 . the reported visit of juve 's sporting director , alessio secco , to bremen last week fuelled the rumors further but diego is expected to turn out for bremen against bochum on sunday , ending the speculation - until the summer at least . bayern pair linked to premiership switch other names linked with a move away from the bundesliga this month have been bayern munich colleagues lukas podolski and daniel van buyten . podolski has been dogged by a loss of form and a series of niggling injuries since arriving at the allianz arena from fc köln in 2006 .
with the acquisition of strike partners klose and toni last summer , podolski slipped further down the pecking order , prompting a number of audacious attempts from english premiership side manchester city to sign the striker in the last few weeks . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : poldi has been the subject of frenzied transfer speculation however , the bayern higher-ups have put their foot down and have said that prinz poldi is going nowhere . " i had a very good discussion with lukas and made it clear to him he can not leave bayern , because we need him for the future , " said karl-heinz rummenigge .
" we are convinced of his quality and we are looking forward to seeing him in action again . " van buyten has been the subject of speculation ever since the bundesliga paused for the winter break with scottish champions celtic and premiership club newcastle united keen to take the defender back to the uk .
the belgian international played under new newcastle coach kevin keegan at manchester city in 2004 and has said he would be open to working with the coach again . brazilian defenders looking for pastures new bayern could also be close to losing veteran defender lucio .
the brazilian told deutsche welle last month that it was his dream to play in either italy or spain and that he hoped that he could make that dream come true before the end of his contract in 2010 . " i dream about spain and italy , " he said .

but it 's yet to be seen which party will be able to form a governing coalition . led by merkel ally and incumbent premier roland koch , who ran a controversial campaign focused on crime and immigration , the cdu took 36.8 percent of the vote , down from 48.8 percent in 2003 . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the state election in hesse polarized germans nationwide " we did n't mobilize our own supporters enough , " koch said on public television .
" this is not easily for me personally . " the rival social democrats -lrb- spd -rrb- , who rule together with merkel 's cdu at the national level , saw their support push up to 36.7 percent . " we fought for a different political culture in this country and we won , " said koch 's spd challenger , andrea ypsilanti . it remains unclear , however , which party will take power .
the entry into hesse 's parliament of the new left party - a far-left grouping which came out of a merger of a social democratic splinter group and the successor party to the former east german communists - prevents both cdu and spd from securing a majority in the 110-seat state legislature in coalition with their preferred partners , the free-market liberal fdp and the greens respectively .

" in hesse the conservatives have suffered such losses that it is clear that koch 's election campaign has n't worked , " said richard stöss , a political scientist at berlin 's free university . the spd 's ypsilanti , on the other hand , focused in her campaign on the traditional spd themes of wages , education and the integration of minorities .
this has brought the social democrats a gain of almost 8 percent in comparison to the previous state election . the result is likely to create even more tension in the already strained relations between the cdu and spd on the national level , which some fear could result in a political stalemate in the " grand coalition " until the 2009 national elections . an important race bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : incumbent state premier roland koch has divided the nation the state elections in hesse and lower saxony were widely seen as a test of the cdu 's strength ahead of federal elections , which must be held by september 2009 . merkel remains highly popular in germany but faces risks from a slowing economy ahead of next year 's national vote .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de players -pipe- 28.01.2008 europe 's big spenders track bundesliga stars großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : this season 's hottest items : werder bremen 's diego and hamburg 's van der vaart as many of europe 's top leagues face a frantic week of dealing before the january transfer window closes , the continent 's big spenders are looking to come to germany for some last minute shopping . the bundesliga may be enjoying its most glamorous season in years thanks to the international stars who have chosen to ply their trade in germany , but question remains as to how long it can maintain its new celebrity status . while the big names and transfer coups have turned the media spotlight on german soccer in a way previously thought beyond its means , the downside of this attention is becoming obvious .
the bundesliga is in danger of turning from a glittering stage into an enticing shop window . while the german top flight has n't ever been exactly below the radar , other european teams looking for new players have given their german counterparts little more than a cursory glance before taking their checkbooks to italy or spain .
more bargain basement than armani or balenciaga , the bundesliga just did n't have the same appeal as serie a or the primera liga . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : diamonds in the rough : luca toni and franck ribery but sew a few diamonds into the cut-price cloth and anyone looking for glamour will certainly spot a sparkle or two .
with the likes of luca toni , franck ribery , rafael van der vaart , miroslav klose and diego lighting up the german league , it was only a matter of time before the big spenders would spot an untapped market . two of the league 's brightest midfield stars top the shoppers ' most-wanted lists .
with the january transfer window closing at the end of the week , werder bremen and hamburg will be bracing themselves for " money 's no object " offers for diego and van der vaart respectively . van der vaart on italian shopping list italian giants juventus are hunting the two mini maestros and while bremen are trying as hard as they can to hang onto their prized brazilian playmaker , hamburg have confirmed they have already spoken to the turin team about a price for their want-away dutchman . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : van der vaart could be turin-bound " we are in discussions with juventus , but we ca n't say more at this stage , " hamburg spokesman jörn wolf recently told german agency sid . van der vaart is under contract until 2010 , but can leave hamburg next year for a fixed transfer fee of 1.5 million euros -lrb- $ 2 million -rrb- , but the 24-year-old is reported to be worth 20 million euros in the current market and hamburg may want to capitalize on that estimation , with spanish giants barcelona also interested in the diminutive dutchman . the midfielder , who made a shock move to the bundesliga from ajax in 2005 when everyone expected him to land in spain or italy , paved the way for other big names to come to the bundesliga .
his exit may prompt a similar spate of transfers in the opposite direction . diego coveted by europe 's biggest clubs diego , meanwhile , is being fiercely protected in bremen with juventus , inter milan , real madrid and chelsea all reportedly circling the weserstadion in search of his signature on the dotted line . despite juventus coach claudio ranieri 's desire to see diego play at the stadio olimpico di torino , it will take more than covetous comments to spirit werder 's top scorer away . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : diego has let his feet do the talking at bremen " there is no inquiry from juventus , and we will not talk with any clubs about signing diego , he is a firm part of our plans , " said werder 's director of sport klaus allofs , who reminded potential suitors that the brazilian is contracted until june 2011 . the reported visit of juve 's sporting director , alessio secco , to bremen last week fuelled the rumors further but diego is expected to turn out for bremen against bochum on sunday , ending the speculation - until the summer at least . bayern pair linked to premiership switch other names linked with a move away from the bundesliga this month have been bayern munich colleagues lukas podolski and daniel van buyten . podolski has been dogged by a loss of form and a series of niggling injuries since arriving at the allianz arena from fc köln in 2006 .
with the acquisition of strike partners klose and toni last summer , podolski slipped further down the pecking order , prompting a number of audacious attempts from english premiership side manchester city to sign the striker in the last few weeks . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : poldi has been the subject of frenzied transfer speculation however , the bayern higher-ups have put their foot down and have said that prinz poldi is going nowhere . " i had a very good discussion with lukas and made it clear to him he can not leave bayern , because we need him for the future , " said karl-heinz rummenigge .
" we are convinced of his quality and we are looking forward to seeing him in action again . " van buyten has been the subject of speculation ever since the bundesliga paused for the winter break with scottish champions celtic and premiership club newcastle united keen to take the defender back to the uk .
the belgian international played under new newcastle coach kevin keegan at manchester city in 2004 and has said he would be open to working with the coach again . brazilian defenders looking for pastures new bayern could also be close to losing veteran defender lucio .
the brazilian told deutsche welle last month that it was his dream to play in either italy or spain and that he hoped that he could make that dream come true before the end of his contract in 2010 . " i dream about spain and italy , " he said .
" perhaps my dream can come true a bit earlier if i can come to an agreement with the club . " another brazilian on the verge of leaving the bundesliga appears to be hertha berlin 's gilberto .
the defender is set to sign for premier league side tottenham hotspur after flying to london for a medical on sunday . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : gilberto is expected to be a spurs player by next week berlin 's coach lucien favre confirmed the 31-year-old was in the english capital at the weekend and the 27-times capped brazilian looks set to join spurs for a reported figure of 3 million euros . english clubs raid bundesliga also-rans also apparently premiership-bound is schalke 04 's out-of-favor striker peter lovenkrands .
the danish international is expected to put pen to paper at birmingham city before the transfer window closes on thursday night . joining him in england could be wolfsburg 's bosnian prodigy edin dzeko , who is a target for arsenal , and borussia mönchengladbach 's ivory coast defender steve gohouri , who could end up at wigan athletic . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

after the votes were counted , hesse 's incumbent premier , roland koch , had a hair-thin majority , making uncertain the sort of coalition that could form a government and what role the candidate koch - who had led a controversial , openly xenophobic campaign - could have in it .
at midmorning on monday , jan .
28 , political advisers from all parties involved had holed up for strategy meetings .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ypsilanti will likely lead a coalition - but with whom ?
official results from hesse showed the conservative cdu had slumped from a majority in the state legislature to finish only nominally ahead of the center-left social democrats -lrb- spd -rrb- , with the same number of seats .
the spd candidate in hesse , andrea ypsilanti , took 36.7 percent of the vote against the cdu 's 36.8 .
search for a coalition a deputy cdu leader in another state , premier christian wulff of lower saxony , won re-election in a separate vote sunday , despite moderate losses .
the left , a combination of former social democrats and eastern ex-communists , extended its reach in western germany to enter both state parliaments .
but gains for the left party and spd in hesse mean the cdu , together with its planned coalition partner free democrats -lrb- fdp -rrb- , no longer have a large enough majority to rule in the state parliament in wiesbaden .
this gives a clear mandate to the spd to enter the state government in hesse , according to acting spd chairwoman andrea nahles .
voters saw to it that koch took " the most brutal beating possible , " nahles told rbb news radio on monday .
while the spd failed " by a nose " to gain a clear majority , it was clear that the voters in the western state increasingly stood behind the center-left party , and it should therefore be part of the government , she said .
ypsilanti is currently in talks with other party representatives to discuss coalition possibilities .
but nahles reiterated ypsilanti 's campaign promise that her party would not enter into a coalition with the upsurge , far-left left party , saying " the program and the people that they represent in hesse do not stand for stability in government . "
" traffic light " coalition possible ?
meanwhile , spd secretary general hubertus heil called for a " traffic light " coalition to rule hesse , which would be made up of the spd -lrb- red -rrb- , free democrats -lrb- yellow -rrb- and green party , under the leadership of ypsilanti .
" there is a koch-must-go mood -lsb- among voters -rsb- that we have to take into account when making up the government , " heil told zdf television talk show morgenmagazin on monday .
" we will present the premier , i am fairly sure of that , " he said .
yet a parliamentary leader of the fdp from hesse , jörg-uwe hahn , said there is no way that his party would enter into a " traffic light " coalition .
the fdp had planned to be coalition partner with the right-wing cdu , and could not be used as " a training wheel for a red-green " coalition , he told the dpa press agency .
hahn predicted a coalition would form between the spd , greens and the left party .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel 's cdu should avoid negative campaigns , one observer said amid the speculations on a new government , political observers took the time to mull over just what went so very wrong in the campaign of incumbent koch - and what it could mean for the larger question of cdu domination in german politics .
koch faulted for polarizing strategy chemnitz-based election researcher eckhard jesse said the cdu should see the campaign as a powerful lesson . with his polarizing , xenophobic rhetoric about youth-crime , koch led the campaign as if he were an opposition candidate , not an incumbent , jesse told the thüringer allgemeine newspaper .
merkel and other cdu candidates need to draw the conclusion that " they should take the same tact as wulff , " who handily won the state election in lower saxony .
" that means that they should run a low-key , feel-good campaign .
they should n't polarize - especially not the chancellor , " he said .
and political scientist theo schiller said koch had reaped what he sowed from his controversial style .
" if koch had n't focused his campaign on youth crime and young offenders , the results might have been slightly different , " the professor at the university of marburg told dpa .
the results were " catastrophic " for the cdu , he said .
by focusing on youth crime , koch aimed to harm the spd , but instead pilloried his own party , schiller said .
" he raised the question of deficits during the years his own government had ruled , " he said .
and was not able to give any satisfactory answers , he added .
no stopping rise of the left like a number of other german political analysts , schiller saw the left party 's gains as a sign of things to come .
" we can expect the left to enter other state parliaments , " he told dpa .
but he also said he did not see the likelihood of the left entering into a ruling coalition in hesse together with the spd .
that would mean ypsilanti would have to go back on her word to too great an extent , he said . dw staff -lrb- jen -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

after the votes were counted , hesse 's incumbent premier , roland koch , had a hair-thin majority , making uncertain the sort of coalition that could form a government and what role the candidate koch - who had led a controversial , openly xenophobic campaign - could have in it .
at midmorning on monday , jan .
28 , political advisers from all parties involved had holed up for strategy meetings .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ypsilanti will likely lead a coalition - but with whom ?
official results from hesse showed the conservative cdu had slumped from a majority in the state legislature to finish only nominally ahead of the center-left social democrats -lrb- spd -rrb- , with the same number of seats .
the spd candidate in hesse , andrea ypsilanti , took 36.7 percent of the vote against the cdu 's 36.8 .
search for a coalition a deputy cdu leader in another state , premier christian wulff of lower saxony , won re-election in a separate vote sunday , despite moderate losses .
the left , a combination of former social democrats and eastern ex-communists , extended its reach in western germany to enter both state parliaments .
but gains for the left party and spd in hesse mean the cdu , together with its planned coalition partner free democrats -lrb- fdp -rrb- , no longer have a large enough majority to rule in the state parliament in wiesbaden .
this gives a clear mandate to the spd to enter the state government in hesse , according to acting spd chairwoman andrea nahles .
voters saw to it that koch took " the most brutal beating possible , " nahles told rbb news radio on monday .
while the spd failed " by a nose " to gain a clear majority , it was clear that the voters in the western state increasingly stood behind the center-left party , and it should therefore be part of the government , she said .
ypsilanti is currently in talks with other party representatives to discuss coalition possibilities .
but nahles reiterated ypsilanti 's campaign promise that her party would not enter into a coalition with the upsurge , far-left left party , saying " the program and the people that they represent in hesse do not stand for stability in government . "
" traffic light " coalition possible ?
meanwhile , spd secretary general hubertus heil called for a " traffic light " coalition to rule hesse , which would be made up of the spd -lrb- red -rrb- , free democrats -lrb- yellow -rrb- and green party , under the leadership of ypsilanti .
" there is a koch-must-go mood -lsb- among voters -rsb- that we have to take into account when making up the government , " heil told zdf television talk show morgenmagazin on monday .
" we will present the premier , i am fairly sure of that , " he said .
yet a parliamentary leader of the fdp from hesse , jörg-uwe hahn , said there is no way that his party would enter into a " traffic light " coalition .
the fdp had planned to be coalition partner with the right-wing cdu , and could not be used as " a training wheel for a red-green " coalition , he told the dpa press agency .
hahn predicted a coalition would form between the spd , greens and the left party .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel 's cdu should avoid negative campaigns , one observer said amid the speculations on a new government , political observers took the time to mull over just what went so very wrong in the campaign of incumbent koch - and what it could mean for the larger question of cdu domination in german politics .
koch faulted for polarizing strategy chemnitz-based election researcher eckhard jesse said the cdu should see the campaign as a powerful lesson . with his polarizing , xenophobic rhetoric about youth-crime , koch led the campaign as if he were an opposition candidate , not an incumbent , jesse told the thüringer allgemeine newspaper .
merkel and other cdu candidates need to draw the conclusion that " they should take the same tact as wulff , " who handily won the state election in lower saxony .
" that means that they should run a low-key , feel-good campaign .
they should n't polarize - especially not the chancellor , " he said .
and political scientist theo schiller said koch had reaped what he sowed from his controversial style .
" if koch had n't focused his campaign on youth crime and young offenders , the results might have been slightly different , " the professor at the university of marburg told dpa .
the results were " catastrophic " for the cdu , he said .
by focusing on youth crime , koch aimed to harm the spd , but instead pilloried his own party , schiller said .
" he raised the question of deficits during the years his own government had ruled , " he said .
and was not able to give any satisfactory answers , he added .
no stopping rise of the left like a number of other german political analysts , schiller saw the left party 's gains as a sign of things to come .
" we can expect the left to enter other state parliaments , " he told dpa .
but he also said he did not see the likelihood of the left entering into a ruling coalition in hesse together with the spd .
that would mean ypsilanti would have to go back on her word to too great an extent , he said . dw staff -lrb- jen -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ypsilanti will likely lead a coalition - but with whom ?
official results from hesse showed the conservative cdu had slumped from a majority in the state legislature to finish only nominally ahead of the center-left social democrats -lrb- spd -rrb- , with the same number of seats .
the spd candidate in hesse , andrea ypsilanti , took 36.7 percent of the vote against the cdu 's 36.8 .
search for a coalition a deputy cdu leader in another state , premier christian wulff of lower saxony , won re-election in a separate vote sunday , despite moderate losses .
the left , a combination of former social democrats and eastern ex-communists , extended its reach in western germany to enter both state parliaments .
but gains for the left party and spd in hesse mean the cdu , together with its planned coalition partner free democrats -lrb- fdp -rrb- , no longer have a large enough majority to rule in the state parliament in wiesbaden .
this gives a clear mandate to the spd to enter the state government in hesse , according to acting spd chairwoman andrea nahles .
voters saw to it that koch took " the most brutal beating possible , " nahles told rbb news radio on monday .
while the spd failed " by a nose " to gain a clear majority , it was clear that the voters in the western state increasingly stood behind the center-left party , and it should therefore be part of the government , she said .
ypsilanti is currently in talks with other party representatives to discuss coalition possibilities .
but nahles reiterated ypsilanti 's campaign promise that her party would not enter into a coalition with the upsurge , far-left left party , saying " the program and the people that they represent in hesse do not stand for stability in government . "
" traffic light " coalition possible ?
meanwhile , spd secretary general hubertus heil called for a " traffic light " coalition to rule hesse , which would be made up of the spd -lrb- red -rrb- , free democrats -lrb- yellow -rrb- and green party , under the leadership of ypsilanti .
" there is a koch-must-go mood -lsb- among voters -rsb- that we have to take into account when making up the government , " heil told zdf television talk show morgenmagazin on monday .
" we will present the premier , i am fairly sure of that , " he said .
yet a parliamentary leader of the fdp from hesse , jörg-uwe hahn , said there is no way that his party would enter into a " traffic light " coalition .
the fdp had planned to be coalition partner with the right-wing cdu , and could not be used as " a training wheel for a red-green " coalition , he told the dpa press agency .
hahn predicted a coalition would form between the spd , greens and the left party .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel 's cdu should avoid negative campaigns , one observer said amid the speculations on a new government , political observers took the time to mull over just what went so very wrong in the campaign of incumbent koch - and what it could mean for the larger question of cdu domination in german politics .
koch faulted for polarizing strategy chemnitz-based election researcher eckhard jesse said the cdu should see the campaign as a powerful lesson . with his polarizing , xenophobic rhetoric about youth-crime , koch led the campaign as if he were an opposition candidate , not an incumbent , jesse told the thüringer allgemeine newspaper .
merkel and other cdu candidates need to draw the conclusion that " they should take the same tact as wulff , " who handily won the state election in lower saxony .
" that means that they should run a low-key , feel-good campaign .
they should n't polarize - especially not the chancellor , " he said .
and political scientist theo schiller said koch had reaped what he sowed from his controversial style .
" if koch had n't focused his campaign on youth crime and young offenders , the results might have been slightly different , " the professor at the university of marburg told dpa .
the results were " catastrophic " for the cdu , he said .
by focusing on youth crime , koch aimed to harm the spd , but instead pilloried his own party , schiller said .
" he raised the question of deficits during the years his own government had ruled , " he said .
and was not able to give any satisfactory answers , he added .
no stopping rise of the left like a number of other german political analysts , schiller saw the left party 's gains as a sign of things to come .
" we can expect the left to enter other state parliaments , " he told dpa .
but he also said he did not see the likelihood of the left entering into a ruling coalition in hesse together with the spd .

but it 's yet to be seen which party will be able to form a governing coalition . led by merkel ally and incumbent premier roland koch , who ran a controversial campaign focused on crime and immigration , the cdu took 36.8 percent of the vote , down from 48.8 percent in 2003 . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the state election in hesse polarized germans nationwide " we did n't mobilize our own supporters enough , " koch said on public television .
" this is not easily for me personally . " the rival social democrats -lrb- spd -rrb- , who rule together with merkel 's cdu at the national level , saw their support push up to 36.7 percent . " we fought for a different political culture in this country and we won , " said koch 's spd challenger , andrea ypsilanti . it remains unclear , however , which party will take power .
the entry into hesse 's parliament of the new left party - a far-left grouping which came out of a merger of a social democratic splinter group and the successor party to the former east german communists - prevents both cdu and spd from securing a majority in the 110-seat state legislature in coalition with their preferred partners , the free-market liberal fdp and the greens respectively .
the left party took home 5.1 percent , the fdp received 9.4 percent and the greens got 7.5 percent . a different case bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : despite nearly 6-point drop in votes , christian wulff will stay in power in lower saxony in another state election , in lower saxony , incumbent cdu premier christian wulff saw his support fall to 42.5 percent from 48.3 percent in 2003 .
unlike in hesse , however , his result is good enough for him to hold on to power in a coalition with the fdp . here the spd scored its worst result in recent years , declining to around 30.3 percent from 33.4 percent in 2003 . in all , some 10.5 million people were eligible to vote in the two western states , in both of which angela merkel 's christian democrats -lrb- cdu -rrb- have put up the premiers for the past five years . a blow for merkel bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel 's support for koch was not enough to help him win the election the setback which the conservatives were dealt in hesse will also be seen as a blow to the chancellor , who stood firmly behind roland koch during the election campaign and repeatedly defended koch 's proposals for tougher measures against young criminals of foreign origin . " in hesse the conservatives have suffered such losses that it is clear that koch 's election campaign has n't worked , " said richard stöss , a political scientist at berlin 's free university . the spd 's ypsilanti , on the other hand , focused in her campaign on the traditional spd themes of wages , education and the integration of minorities .
this has brought the social democrats a gain of almost 8 percent in comparison to the previous state election . the result is likely to create even more tension in the already strained relations between the cdu and spd on the national level , which some fear could result in a political stalemate in the " grand coalition " until the 2009 national elections . an important race bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : incumbent state premier roland koch has divided the nation the state elections in hesse and lower saxony were widely seen as a test of the cdu 's strength ahead of federal elections , which must be held by september 2009 . merkel remains highly popular in germany but faces risks from a slowing economy ahead of next year 's national vote . " a loss in hesse would be bad for morale for the cdu nationally and for merkel , " political scientist jürgen falter told the bild am sonntag newspaper . ypsilanti 's victory in hesse could potentially give spd chief kurt beck a boost in his bid to dismantle labor market reforms introduced by merkel 's predecessor gerhard schröder , which are credited with helping to fuel a recovery of europe 's biggest economy . social democrats would also be likely to push harder to create a national minimum wage - a popular proposal that many economists have branded a job killer . the left gaining ground bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : left party candidate in hesse , willi van ooyen the fact that both state elections showed a clear shift to the left - after years in which merkel 's conservatives outperformed the social democrats - is , nonetheless , not all good news for the spd . the left party passed the 5-percent threshold to enter the parliament in both states . it is the first time that the party , led by former finance minister oskar lafontaine , will enter parliament in a large western state . spd officials have so far ruled out any possibility of entering into coalition agreements with the left . dw staff -lrb- tt -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de europe -pipe- 28.01.2008 belgium 's german minority mostly unmoved by autonomy debate großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the belgian unity question centers on flanders and wallonia and neglects other regions the belgian interim government may have silenced separatist rhetoric for now but the divisive problems have not gone away .
the country 's german-speaking minority is maintaining a low profile in the debate . the debate concerning the political crisis in belgium and the unlikely , yet much discussed , possibility of the country splitting , has focused firmly on the disagreements between the two main linguistic areas , french-speaking wallonia and flemish-speaking flanders .
though these two areas are the largest in terms of size , and also importance when it comes to deciding policies which affect the whole country , belgium has in fact been divided into four linguistic regions since the early 1960s .
besides wallonia in the south and flanders in the north , there is the bilingual brussels capital region and the tiny german-speaking area in the east cantons .
while brussels is sometimes left out of the debate over belgium 's future - due mainly to its bilingualism , its self-sufficiency and its status as an international city - the east cantons seem to be ignored altogether when it comes to discussing the linguistic and cultural divide .
a region of 854 square kilometers -lrb- 530 square miles -rrb- with a population of over 73,000 , of which almost 100 percent are german speaking , the east cantons can quite easily be overlooked in belgium 's controversial situation .
the juicy arguments and stubborn nationalist positions of the more powerful flemings and walloons make for far better headlines than a quirky little germanic outpost on the far eastern border .
similar challenges and yet , the german-speaking community of the east cantons , as a linguistic minority within the federal state of belgium , faces similar challenges to those causing strife between " the big two . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the seat of german-speaking power is based in eupen granted internal rule in 1973 , the region has its own parliament in the capital of eupen and control over linguistic and cultural matters .
the parliament organizes elections , supervises the regional government , and adopts decrees for the german-speaking community .
the east cantons also have committees charged with governing areas such as education , social policy , health and employment .
despite this illusion of self-rule , however , the region still remains part of french-speaking wallonia , located as it is in the province of liege , and is therefore kept under the watchful eye of the wallon parliament .
it is not surprising that there are some in the east cantons who have themselves expressed a desire for the kind of autonomy favored by the more extreme elements on either side of the main linguistic divide .
a small but growing number have been voicing their support for an independent mini-state .
as is the case in the rest of the country , this is not a view shared by the whole population of the east cantons .
to get an idea how the german-speaking region and its people view their role in the wider belgian community , dw-world.de talked to jean-claude franken , the secretary of the german-speaking community 's christian social party -lrb- csp -rrb- , a cooperation partner of the francophone humanist democratic center -lrb- cdh -rrb- in the belgian parliament .
dw-world.de : is belgium 's german-speaking minority well integrated ?
jean-claude franken : the german-speaking minority is integrated in the belgian federal state very well .
there are special laws within the belgian constitution that protect the german-speaking community here .
how much power does the german-speaking minority have in belgium ?
the german-speaking community is an equal partner in the belgian federal state .
that is because there is no favoritism towards any of the linguistic minorities in the country in terms of the divulgence of power .
in the federal government , of course , the larger regions have the biggest political parties and therefore more seats in parliament , but our cooperation with the cdh allows us to have our say as part of wallonia .
in regional terms , the parties within the east canton - the csp , the socialist party , the party for freedom and progress and the party for german-speaking belgians - ensure that the autonomy we enjoy is used to make the community as self-reliant and efficient as possible .
does the german-speaking minority in belgium consider itself german or belgian ?
in former times , the region was part of prussia and therefore a small part of germany .
during world war ii , it was annexed again by germany after being part of belgium since the end of the great war .
when the east canton was returned to belgium once more in 1945 , some who lived there regretted this and wanted to stay german ; these were the same people who welcomed the occupying nazi forces .
however , as belgium has grown as a nation of diversity and understanding , the german-speaking community has become very integrated in the country and contact with out neighboring regions has increased over the years .
as a result , the german speakers consider themselves to be fully-fledged belgians and are accepted as such by their flemish and walloon compatriots .
could the german-speaking area support itself if belgium separated ?
if not , would it consider joining another region or hope to become part of germany again ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : lambertz has spoken of his support for regional autonomy the question of splitting belgium is a moot point .
it wo n't happen .
but for the sake of argument , despite its current state of stable and competent government , the german-speaking community would struggle to support itself in this hypothetical scenario and would have to join either wallonia or another state area .
there are some who push for this in the german-speaking community .
the current premier karl-heinz lambertz of the socialist party is one of the most prominent proponents of this idea .
these people say , as do the flemish , that wallonia is too much of a burden with its financial and social problems .
lambertz and others want a full transfer of powers from wallonia to the german-speaking parliament resulting in full regional autonomy .
is the cultural identity of the german-speaking minority strong ?
how is it protected ?
the cultural identity of the german speakers is deeply rooted .
our culture expresses itself in the german language spoken by the region 's people , the traditions that remain strong there and the creative and artistic expression in the region .
the position of the german-speaking community in the belgian federal state and its culture is protected by law in the constitution .
there are no worries within the community that the cultural identity of the german-speaking minority is under threat in belgium or by any policy of enlargement or expansion from the european union .
is the german-speaking minority in belgium influenced by the decisions of the european union ?
of course .
the eu has an influence on all countries which are member states , and that of course means that those people and minorities in those member states are influenced by eu policy .
the difference is that , unlike some minorities across europe , the german-speaking community does not fear these policies but welcomes them . nick amies send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

after the votes were counted , hesse 's incumbent premier , roland koch , had a hair-thin majority , making uncertain the sort of coalition that could form a government and what role the candidate koch - who had led a controversial , openly xenophobic campaign - could have in it .
at midmorning on monday , jan .
28 , political advisers from all parties involved had holed up for strategy meetings .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ypsilanti will likely lead a coalition - but with whom ?
official results from hesse showed the conservative cdu had slumped from a majority in the state legislature to finish only nominally ahead of the center-left social democrats -lrb- spd -rrb- , with the same number of seats .
the spd candidate in hesse , andrea ypsilanti , took 36.7 percent of the vote against the cdu 's 36.8 .
search for a coalition a deputy cdu leader in another state , premier christian wulff of lower saxony , won re-election in a separate vote sunday , despite moderate losses .
the left , a combination of former social democrats and eastern ex-communists , extended its reach in western germany to enter both state parliaments .
but gains for the left party and spd in hesse mean the cdu , together with its planned coalition partner free democrats -lrb- fdp -rrb- , no longer have a large enough majority to rule in the state parliament in wiesbaden .
this gives a clear mandate to the spd to enter the state government in hesse , according to acting spd chairwoman andrea nahles .
voters saw to it that koch took " the most brutal beating possible , " nahles told rbb news radio on monday .
while the spd failed " by a nose " to gain a clear majority , it was clear that the voters in the western state increasingly stood behind the center-left party , and it should therefore be part of the government , she said .
ypsilanti is currently in talks with other party representatives to discuss coalition possibilities .
but nahles reiterated ypsilanti 's campaign promise that her party would not enter into a coalition with the upsurge , far-left left party , saying " the program and the people that they represent in hesse do not stand for stability in government . "
" traffic light " coalition possible ?
meanwhile , spd secretary general hubertus heil called for a " traffic light " coalition to rule hesse , which would be made up of the spd -lrb- red -rrb- , free democrats -lrb- yellow -rrb- and green party , under the leadership of ypsilanti .
" there is a koch-must-go mood -lsb- among voters -rsb- that we have to take into account when making up the government , " heil told zdf television talk show morgenmagazin on monday .
" we will present the premier , i am fairly sure of that , " he said .
yet a parliamentary leader of the fdp from hesse , jörg-uwe hahn , said there is no way that his party would enter into a " traffic light " coalition .
the fdp had planned to be coalition partner with the right-wing cdu , and could not be used as " a training wheel for a red-green " coalition , he told the dpa press agency .
hahn predicted a coalition would form between the spd , greens and the left party .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel 's cdu should avoid negative campaigns , one observer said amid the speculations on a new government , political observers took the time to mull over just what went so very wrong in the campaign of incumbent koch - and what it could mean for the larger question of cdu domination in german politics .
koch faulted for polarizing strategy chemnitz-based election researcher eckhard jesse said the cdu should see the campaign as a powerful lesson . with his polarizing , xenophobic rhetoric about youth-crime , koch led the campaign as if he were an opposition candidate , not an incumbent , jesse told the thüringer allgemeine newspaper .
merkel and other cdu candidates need to draw the conclusion that " they should take the same tact as wulff , " who handily won the state election in lower saxony .
" that means that they should run a low-key , feel-good campaign .
they should n't polarize - especially not the chancellor , " he said .
and political scientist theo schiller said koch had reaped what he sowed from his controversial style .
" if koch had n't focused his campaign on youth crime and young offenders , the results might have been slightly different , " the professor at the university of marburg told dpa .
the results were " catastrophic " for the cdu , he said .
by focusing on youth crime , koch aimed to harm the spd , but instead pilloried his own party , schiller said .
" he raised the question of deficits during the years his own government had ruled , " he said .
and was not able to give any satisfactory answers , he added .
no stopping rise of the left like a number of other german political analysts , schiller saw the left party 's gains as a sign of things to come .
" we can expect the left to enter other state parliaments , " he told dpa .
but he also said he did not see the likelihood of the left entering into a ruling coalition in hesse together with the spd .
that would mean ypsilanti would have to go back on her word to too great an extent , he said . dw staff -lrb- jen -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" we will present the premier , i am fairly sure of that , " he said .
yet a parliamentary leader of the fdp from hesse , jörg-uwe hahn , said there is no way that his party would enter into a " traffic light " coalition .
the fdp had planned to be coalition partner with the right-wing cdu , and could not be used as " a training wheel for a red-green " coalition , he told the dpa press agency .
hahn predicted a coalition would form between the spd , greens and the left party .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel 's cdu should avoid negative campaigns , one observer said amid the speculations on a new government , political observers took the time to mull over just what went so very wrong in the campaign of incumbent koch - and what it could mean for the larger question of cdu domination in german politics .
koch faulted for polarizing strategy chemnitz-based election researcher eckhard jesse said the cdu should see the campaign as a powerful lesson . with his polarizing , xenophobic rhetoric about youth-crime , koch led the campaign as if he were an opposition candidate , not an incumbent , jesse told the thüringer allgemeine newspaper .
merkel and other cdu candidates need to draw the conclusion that " they should take the same tact as wulff , " who handily won the state election in lower saxony .
" that means that they should run a low-key , feel-good campaign .
they should n't polarize - especially not the chancellor , " he said .
and political scientist theo schiller said koch had reaped what he sowed from his controversial style .
" if koch had n't focused his campaign on youth crime and young offenders , the results might have been slightly different , " the professor at the university of marburg told dpa .
the results were " catastrophic " for the cdu , he said .
by focusing on youth crime , koch aimed to harm the spd , but instead pilloried his own party , schiller said .
" he raised the question of deficits during the years his own government had ruled , " he said .
and was not able to give any satisfactory answers , he added .
no stopping rise of the left like a number of other german political analysts , schiller saw the left party 's gains as a sign of things to come .
" we can expect the left to enter other state parliaments , " he told dpa .
but he also said he did not see the likelihood of the left entering into a ruling coalition in hesse together with the spd .
that would mean ypsilanti would have to go back on her word to too great an extent , he said . dw staff -lrb- jen -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

but it 's yet to be seen which party will be able to form a governing coalition . led by merkel ally and incumbent premier roland koch , who ran a controversial campaign focused on crime and immigration , the cdu took 36.8 percent of the vote , down from 48.8 percent in 2003 . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the state election in hesse polarized germans nationwide " we did n't mobilize our own supporters enough , " koch said on public television .
" this is not easily for me personally . " the rival social democrats -lrb- spd -rrb- , who rule together with merkel 's cdu at the national level , saw their support push up to 36.7 percent . " we fought for a different political culture in this country and we won , " said koch 's spd challenger , andrea ypsilanti . it remains unclear , however , which party will take power .
the entry into hesse 's parliament of the new left party - a far-left grouping which came out of a merger of a social democratic splinter group and the successor party to the former east german communists - prevents both cdu and spd from securing a majority in the 110-seat state legislature in coalition with their preferred partners , the free-market liberal fdp and the greens respectively .
the left party took home 5.1 percent , the fdp received 9.4 percent and the greens got 7.5 percent . a different case bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : despite nearly 6-point drop in votes , christian wulff will stay in power in lower saxony in another state election , in lower saxony , incumbent cdu premier christian wulff saw his support fall to 42.5 percent from 48.3 percent in 2003 .
unlike in hesse , however , his result is good enough for him to hold on to power in a coalition with the fdp . here the spd scored its worst result in recent years , declining to around 30.3 percent from 33.4 percent in 2003 . in all , some 10.5 million people were eligible to vote in the two western states , in both of which angela merkel 's christian democrats -lrb- cdu -rrb- have put up the premiers for the past five years . a blow for merkel bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel 's support for koch was not enough to help him win the election the setback which the conservatives were dealt in hesse will also be seen as a blow to the chancellor , who stood firmly behind roland koch during the election campaign and repeatedly defended koch 's proposals for tougher measures against young criminals of foreign origin . " in hesse the conservatives have suffered such losses that it is clear that koch 's election campaign has n't worked , " said richard stöss , a political scientist at berlin 's free university . the spd 's ypsilanti , on the other hand , focused in her campaign on the traditional spd themes of wages , education and the integration of minorities .
this has brought the social democrats a gain of almost 8 percent in comparison to the previous state election . the result is likely to create even more tension in the already strained relations between the cdu and spd on the national level , which some fear could result in a political stalemate in the " grand coalition " until the 2009 national elections . an important race bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : incumbent state premier roland koch has divided the nation the state elections in hesse and lower saxony were widely seen as a test of the cdu 's strength ahead of federal elections , which must be held by september 2009 . merkel remains highly popular in germany but faces risks from a slowing economy ahead of next year 's national vote . " a loss in hesse would be bad for morale for the cdu nationally and for merkel , " political scientist jürgen falter told the bild am sonntag newspaper . ypsilanti 's victory in hesse could potentially give spd chief kurt beck a boost in his bid to dismantle labor market reforms introduced by merkel 's predecessor gerhard schröder , which are credited with helping to fuel a recovery of europe 's biggest economy . social democrats would also be likely to push harder to create a national minimum wage - a popular proposal that many economists have branded a job killer . the left gaining ground bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : left party candidate in hesse , willi van ooyen the fact that both state elections showed a clear shift to the left - after years in which merkel 's conservatives outperformed the social democrats - is , nonetheless , not all good news for the spd . the left party passed the 5-percent threshold to enter the parliament in both states . it is the first time that the party , led by former finance minister oskar lafontaine , will enter parliament in a large western state . spd officials have so far ruled out any possibility of entering into coalition agreements with the left . dw staff -lrb- tt -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

27 , many in the german press commented on the difference in conservative campaigns and what the results meant for the future of angela merkel 's party . the frankfurter rundschau wrote that incumbent premier roland koch has no one to blame but himself for the result in hesse .
" koch chose the wrong topic to champion and led the wrong election campaign , " it stated .
" he set himself up by making strong announcements which contradicted his own actions .
the public noticed that calls for swift justice from the state with the slowest judicial system in the country were implausible , and they have punished koch for this . "
the paper continued by saying that koch 's losses were also angela merkel 's losses .
" the chancellor supported this tough election campaign , " it wrote , " and now the conservatives must ask whether her governance endangers the future of the -lsb- christian democratic -rsb- union . " the bremer nachrichten pondered the consequences of the state elections for the chancellor and the cdu 's coming parliamentary election campaign .
" which way now for angela merkel ? " the paper asked .
" not only is it that social democrats -lsb- spd -rsb- must find their direction but also the conservatives .
should she take the careful approach or come out fighting like roland koch ?
reading the results from lower saxony and hesse , the decision should be clear . " " rambo koch loses , cuddly wulff wins , " stated the westdeutsche allgemeine zeitung .
" koch 's campaign failed because it focused on his weaknesses not his strengths .
there was no policy substance to his rhetoric and such a thing costs credibility , especially when policy is so important and at a time when the voters look for strong policies not just words . " the thüringer allgemeine zeitung also focused on koch 's performance .
" koch has abandoned his instincts and abandoned the voters , " it wrote .
" that the electorate reacted against this is a good thing .
it would be an ominous sign for the political culture in germany if the people had allowed themselves to have been manipulated by such a campaign .
the majority of people in hesse recognized that sloganeering is not the right approach to the multi-layered subject of juvenile delinquency .
this is why christian wulff , with his low-key election campaign , ran to a clear victory . " the stuttgarter zeitung also picked up on the differences in the conservative candidates ' approaches and results .
" the one winner in the state elections this sunday is christian wulff , which is not so surprising given the weakness of his social democratic spd opponent wolfgang jüttner , " the paper wrote .
the paper acknowledged , however , that despite the spd 's ineptitude , wulff led a winning campaign without the need to resort to the strong-arm tactics and verbal failures of his hessian colleague roland koch .
the paper suggested that wulff should be considered the heir apparent to chancellor merkel and that his victory should signal a rise in his profile within the cdu . the spd 's inability to force home a clear advantage in the state elections was also picked up on by the rhein-neckar zeitung .
" the state elections were less about regional politics and more about the performances of the candidates , " it wrote .
" the most significant signal was the fact that spd leader kurt beck could not lead a socialist election campaign which was better than that fought by the left party . "

but it 's yet to be seen which party will be able to form a governing coalition . led by merkel ally and incumbent premier roland koch , who ran a controversial campaign focused on crime and immigration , the cdu took 36.8 percent of the vote , down from 48.8 percent in 2003 . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the state election in hesse polarized germans nationwide " we did n't mobilize our own supporters enough , " koch said on public television .
" this is not easily for me personally . " the rival social democrats -lrb- spd -rrb- , who rule together with merkel 's cdu at the national level , saw their support push up to 36.7 percent . " we fought for a different political culture in this country and we won , " said koch 's spd challenger , andrea ypsilanti . it remains unclear , however , which party will take power .
the entry into hesse 's parliament of the new left party - a far-left grouping which came out of a merger of a social democratic splinter group and the successor party to the former east german communists - prevents both cdu and spd from securing a majority in the 110-seat state legislature in coalition with their preferred partners , the free-market liberal fdp and the greens respectively .
the left party took home 5.1 percent , the fdp received 9.4 percent and the greens got 7.5 percent . a different case bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : despite nearly 6-point drop in votes , christian wulff will stay in power in lower saxony in another state election , in lower saxony , incumbent cdu premier christian wulff saw his support fall to 42.5 percent from 48.3 percent in 2003 .
unlike in hesse , however , his result is good enough for him to hold on to power in a coalition with the fdp . here the spd scored its worst result in recent years , declining to around 30.3 percent from 33.4 percent in 2003 . in all , some 10.5 million people were eligible to vote in the two western states , in both of which angela merkel 's christian democrats -lrb- cdu -rrb- have put up the premiers for the past five years . a blow for merkel bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel 's support for koch was not enough to help him win the election the setback which the conservatives were dealt in hesse will also be seen as a blow to the chancellor , who stood firmly behind roland koch during the election campaign and repeatedly defended koch 's proposals for tougher measures against young criminals of foreign origin . " in hesse the conservatives have suffered such losses that it is clear that koch 's election campaign has n't worked , " said richard stöss , a political scientist at berlin 's free university . the spd 's ypsilanti , on the other hand , focused in her campaign on the traditional spd themes of wages , education and the integration of minorities .
this has brought the social democrats a gain of almost 8 percent in comparison to the previous state election . the result is likely to create even more tension in the already strained relations between the cdu and spd on the national level , which some fear could result in a political stalemate in the " grand coalition " until the 2009 national elections . an important race bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : incumbent state premier roland koch has divided the nation the state elections in hesse and lower saxony were widely seen as a test of the cdu 's strength ahead of federal elections , which must be held by september 2009 . merkel remains highly popular in germany but faces risks from a slowing economy ahead of next year 's national vote . " a loss in hesse would be bad for morale for the cdu nationally and for merkel , " political scientist jürgen falter told the bild am sonntag newspaper . ypsilanti 's victory in hesse could potentially give spd chief kurt beck a boost in his bid to dismantle labor market reforms introduced by merkel 's predecessor gerhard schröder , which are credited with helping to fuel a recovery of europe 's biggest economy . social democrats would also be likely to push harder to create a national minimum wage - a popular proposal that many economists have branded a job killer . the left gaining ground bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : left party candidate in hesse , willi van ooyen the fact that both state elections showed a clear shift to the left - after years in which merkel 's conservatives outperformed the social democrats - is , nonetheless , not all good news for the spd . the left party passed the 5-percent threshold to enter the parliament in both states . it is the first time that the party , led by former finance minister oskar lafontaine , will enter parliament in a large western state . spd officials have so far ruled out any possibility of entering into coalition agreements with the left . dw staff -lrb- tt -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

27 , many in the german press commented on the difference in conservative campaigns and what the results meant for the future of angela merkel 's party . the frankfurter rundschau wrote that incumbent premier roland koch has no one to blame but himself for the result in hesse .
" koch chose the wrong topic to champion and led the wrong election campaign , " it stated .
" he set himself up by making strong announcements which contradicted his own actions .
the public noticed that calls for swift justice from the state with the slowest judicial system in the country were implausible , and they have punished koch for this . "
the paper continued by saying that koch 's losses were also angela merkel 's losses .
" the chancellor supported this tough election campaign , " it wrote , " and now the conservatives must ask whether her governance endangers the future of the -lsb- christian democratic -rsb- union . " the bremer nachrichten pondered the consequences of the state elections for the chancellor and the cdu 's coming parliamentary election campaign .
" which way now for angela merkel ? " the paper asked .
" not only is it that social democrats -lsb- spd -rsb- must find their direction but also the conservatives .
should she take the careful approach or come out fighting like roland koch ?
reading the results from lower saxony and hesse , the decision should be clear . " " rambo koch loses , cuddly wulff wins , " stated the westdeutsche allgemeine zeitung .
" koch 's campaign failed because it focused on his weaknesses not his strengths .
there was no policy substance to his rhetoric and such a thing costs credibility , especially when policy is so important and at a time when the voters look for strong policies not just words . " the thüringer allgemeine zeitung also focused on koch 's performance .
" koch has abandoned his instincts and abandoned the voters , " it wrote .
" that the electorate reacted against this is a good thing .
it would be an ominous sign for the political culture in germany if the people had allowed themselves to have been manipulated by such a campaign .
the majority of people in hesse recognized that sloganeering is not the right approach to the multi-layered subject of juvenile delinquency .
this is why christian wulff , with his low-key election campaign , ran to a clear victory . " the stuttgarter zeitung also picked up on the differences in the conservative candidates ' approaches and results .
" the one winner in the state elections this sunday is christian wulff , which is not so surprising given the weakness of his social democratic spd opponent wolfgang jüttner , " the paper wrote .
the paper acknowledged , however , that despite the spd 's ineptitude , wulff led a winning campaign without the need to resort to the strong-arm tactics and verbal failures of his hessian colleague roland koch .
the paper suggested that wulff should be considered the heir apparent to chancellor merkel and that his victory should signal a rise in his profile within the cdu . the spd 's inability to force home a clear advantage in the state elections was also picked up on by the rhein-neckar zeitung .
" the state elections were less about regional politics and more about the performances of the candidates , " it wrote .
" the most significant signal was the fact that spd leader kurt beck could not lead a socialist election campaign which was better than that fought by the left party . "
the paper also wrote that roland koch 's performance and the chancellor 's support of his campaign should be a wake-up call to merkel , who the paper suggested should follow christian wulff 's approach , and not koch 's , in the future . the frankfurter allgemeine zeitung also lamented the state of german politics highlighted by the inability of the social democrats to capitalize on weakened and disliked conservative candidates .

the bundesliga is in danger of turning from a glittering stage into an enticing shop window . while the german top flight has n't ever been exactly below the radar , other european teams looking for new players have given their german counterparts little more than a cursory glance before taking their checkbooks to italy or spain .
more bargain basement than armani or balenciaga , the bundesliga just did n't have the same appeal as serie a or the primera liga . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : diamonds in the rough : luca toni and franck ribery but sew a few diamonds into the cut-price cloth and anyone looking for glamour will certainly spot a sparkle or two .
with the likes of luca toni , franck ribery , rafael van der vaart , miroslav klose and diego lighting up the german league , it was only a matter of time before the big spenders would spot an untapped market . two of the league 's brightest midfield stars top the shoppers ' most-wanted lists .
with the january transfer window closing at the end of the week , werder bremen and hamburg will be bracing themselves for " money 's no object " offers for diego and van der vaart respectively . van der vaart on italian shopping list italian giants juventus are hunting the two mini maestros and while bremen are trying as hard as they can to hang onto their prized brazilian playmaker , hamburg have confirmed they have already spoken to the turin team about a price for their want-away dutchman . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : van der vaart could be turin-bound " we are in discussions with juventus , but we ca n't say more at this stage , " hamburg spokesman jörn wolf recently told german agency sid . van der vaart is under contract until 2010 , but can leave hamburg next year for a fixed transfer fee of 1.5 million euros -lrb- $ 2 million -rrb- , but the 24-year-old is reported to be worth 20 million euros in the current market and hamburg may want to capitalize on that estimation , with spanish giants barcelona also interested in the diminutive dutchman . the midfielder , who made a shock move to the bundesliga from ajax in 2005 when everyone expected him to land in spain or italy , paved the way for other big names to come to the bundesliga .
his exit may prompt a similar spate of transfers in the opposite direction . diego coveted by europe 's biggest clubs diego , meanwhile , is being fiercely protected in bremen with juventus , inter milan , real madrid and chelsea all reportedly circling the weserstadion in search of his signature on the dotted line . despite juventus coach claudio ranieri 's desire to see diego play at the stadio olimpico di torino , it will take more than covetous comments to spirit werder 's top scorer away . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : diego has let his feet do the talking at bremen " there is no inquiry from juventus , and we will not talk with any clubs about signing diego , he is a firm part of our plans , " said werder 's director of sport klaus allofs , who reminded potential suitors that the brazilian is contracted until june 2011 . the reported visit of juve 's sporting director , alessio secco , to bremen last week fuelled the rumors further but diego is expected to turn out for bremen against bochum on sunday , ending the speculation - until the summer at least . bayern pair linked to premiership switch other names linked with a move away from the bundesliga this month have been bayern munich colleagues lukas podolski and daniel van buyten . podolski has been dogged by a loss of form and a series of niggling injuries since arriving at the allianz arena from fc köln in 2006 .
with the acquisition of strike partners klose and toni last summer , podolski slipped further down the pecking order , prompting a number of audacious attempts from english premiership side manchester city to sign the striker in the last few weeks . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : poldi has been the subject of frenzied transfer speculation however , the bayern higher-ups have put their foot down and have said that prinz poldi is going nowhere . " i had a very good discussion with lukas and made it clear to him he can not leave bayern , because we need him for the future , " said karl-heinz rummenigge .
" we are convinced of his quality and we are looking forward to seeing him in action again . " van buyten has been the subject of speculation ever since the bundesliga paused for the winter break with scottish champions celtic and premiership club newcastle united keen to take the defender back to the uk .
the belgian international played under new newcastle coach kevin keegan at manchester city in 2004 and has said he would be open to working with the coach again . brazilian defenders looking for pastures new bayern could also be close to losing veteran defender lucio .
the brazilian told deutsche welle last month that it was his dream to play in either italy or spain and that he hoped that he could make that dream come true before the end of his contract in 2010 . " i dream about spain and italy , " he said .
" perhaps my dream can come true a bit earlier if i can come to an agreement with the club . " another brazilian on the verge of leaving the bundesliga appears to be hertha berlin 's gilberto .
the defender is set to sign for premier league side tottenham hotspur after flying to london for a medical on sunday . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : gilberto is expected to be a spurs player by next week berlin 's coach lucien favre confirmed the 31-year-old was in the english capital at the weekend and the 27-times capped brazilian looks set to join spurs for a reported figure of 3 million euros . english clubs raid bundesliga also-rans also apparently premiership-bound is schalke 04 's out-of-favor striker peter lovenkrands .
the danish international is expected to put pen to paper at birmingham city before the transfer window closes on thursday night . joining him in england could be wolfsburg 's bosnian prodigy edin dzeko , who is a target for arsenal , and borussia mönchengladbach 's ivory coast defender steve gohouri , who could end up at wigan athletic . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

28 , authorized the force 's commander , lt. gen. patrick nash , to order the deployment of his troops . " in conducting this operation the eu is stepping up its long-standing action in support of efforts to tackle the crisis in darfur and to address its regional ramifications , " the foreign ministers said in a statement . the force , which is to provide security for locals and un aid teams in eastern chad and the north-eastern central african republic along the border with the war-torn sudanese province of darfur , was proposed by france and approved in concept by eu leaders on oct .
15 . however , arguments then broke out over the resources which each member state should commit to the operation , with the eu 's 27 nations initially unable to scrape together the helicopters and transport planes needed to support the 3,700-man mission . bildunterschrift : hundreds of thousand have been uprooted by violence in the region that obstacle was finally overcome in early january , when russia and ukraine - neither of which is an eu member - offered to provide the missing hardware . the backbone of the " bridging operation , " which is mandated to run for a year , will be made up of an estimated 2,000 french troops .
however , the appointment of nash - an irishman - guarantees the multinational nature of the force , diplomats said . ireland and poland are set to send some 400 troops each .
the deployment is expected to begin in march , with the mission coming up to full strength by may 1 . the mission is expected to cost 119 million euros -lrb- $ 175 million -rrb- . nash is set to control the operation from the mont valerien military base in france .

but it 's yet to be seen which party will be able to form a governing coalition . led by merkel ally and incumbent premier roland koch , who ran a controversial campaign focused on crime and immigration , the cdu took 36.8 percent of the vote , down from 48.8 percent in 2003 . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the state election in hesse polarized germans nationwide " we did n't mobilize our own supporters enough , " koch said on public television .
" this is not easily for me personally . " the rival social democrats -lrb- spd -rrb- , who rule together with merkel 's cdu at the national level , saw their support push up to 36.7 percent . " we fought for a different political culture in this country and we won , " said koch 's spd challenger , andrea ypsilanti . it remains unclear , however , which party will take power .
the entry into hesse 's parliament of the new left party - a far-left grouping which came out of a merger of a social democratic splinter group and the successor party to the former east german communists - prevents both cdu and spd from securing a majority in the 110-seat state legislature in coalition with their preferred partners , the free-market liberal fdp and the greens respectively .
the left party took home 5.1 percent , the fdp received 9.4 percent and the greens got 7.5 percent . a different case bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : despite nearly 6-point drop in votes , christian wulff will stay in power in lower saxony in another state election , in lower saxony , incumbent cdu premier christian wulff saw his support fall to 42.5 percent from 48.3 percent in 2003 .
unlike in hesse , however , his result is good enough for him to hold on to power in a coalition with the fdp . here the spd scored its worst result in recent years , declining to around 30.3 percent from 33.4 percent in 2003 . in all , some 10.5 million people were eligible to vote in the two western states , in both of which angela merkel 's christian democrats -lrb- cdu -rrb- have put up the premiers for the past five years . a blow for merkel bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel 's support for koch was not enough to help him win the election the setback which the conservatives were dealt in hesse will also be seen as a blow to the chancellor , who stood firmly behind roland koch during the election campaign and repeatedly defended koch 's proposals for tougher measures against young criminals of foreign origin . " in hesse the conservatives have suffered such losses that it is clear that koch 's election campaign has n't worked , " said richard stöss , a political scientist at berlin 's free university . the spd 's ypsilanti , on the other hand , focused in her campaign on the traditional spd themes of wages , education and the integration of minorities .
this has brought the social democrats a gain of almost 8 percent in comparison to the previous state election . the result is likely to create even more tension in the already strained relations between the cdu and spd on the national level , which some fear could result in a political stalemate in the " grand coalition " until the 2009 national elections . an important race bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : incumbent state premier roland koch has divided the nation the state elections in hesse and lower saxony were widely seen as a test of the cdu 's strength ahead of federal elections , which must be held by september 2009 . merkel remains highly popular in germany but faces risks from a slowing economy ahead of next year 's national vote . " a loss in hesse would be bad for morale for the cdu nationally and for merkel , " political scientist jürgen falter told the bild am sonntag newspaper . ypsilanti 's victory in hesse could potentially give spd chief kurt beck a boost in his bid to dismantle labor market reforms introduced by merkel 's predecessor gerhard schröder , which are credited with helping to fuel a recovery of europe 's biggest economy . social democrats would also be likely to push harder to create a national minimum wage - a popular proposal that many economists have branded a job killer . the left gaining ground bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : left party candidate in hesse , willi van ooyen the fact that both state elections showed a clear shift to the left - after years in which merkel 's conservatives outperformed the social democrats - is , nonetheless , not all good news for the spd . the left party passed the 5-percent threshold to enter the parliament in both states . it is the first time that the party , led by former finance minister oskar lafontaine , will enter parliament in a large western state . spd officials have so far ruled out any possibility of entering into coalition agreements with the left . dw staff -lrb- tt -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de press review -pipe- 28.01.2008 german press review : rambo koch loses out to cuddly wulff großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : chancellor merkel is now taking heat for her support of koch 's failed campaign after the state elections in lower saxony and hesse on sunday , jan .
27 , many in the german press commented on the difference in conservative campaigns and what the results meant for the future of angela merkel 's party . the frankfurter rundschau wrote that incumbent premier roland koch has no one to blame but himself for the result in hesse .
" koch chose the wrong topic to champion and led the wrong election campaign , " it stated .
" he set himself up by making strong announcements which contradicted his own actions .
the public noticed that calls for swift justice from the state with the slowest judicial system in the country were implausible , and they have punished koch for this . "
the paper continued by saying that koch 's losses were also angela merkel 's losses .
" the chancellor supported this tough election campaign , " it wrote , " and now the conservatives must ask whether her governance endangers the future of the -lsb- christian democratic -rsb- union . " the bremer nachrichten pondered the consequences of the state elections for the chancellor and the cdu 's coming parliamentary election campaign .
" which way now for angela merkel ? " the paper asked .
" not only is it that social democrats -lsb- spd -rsb- must find their direction but also the conservatives .
should she take the careful approach or come out fighting like roland koch ?
reading the results from lower saxony and hesse , the decision should be clear . " " rambo koch loses , cuddly wulff wins , " stated the westdeutsche allgemeine zeitung .
" koch 's campaign failed because it focused on his weaknesses not his strengths .
there was no policy substance to his rhetoric and such a thing costs credibility , especially when policy is so important and at a time when the voters look for strong policies not just words . " the thüringer allgemeine zeitung also focused on koch 's performance .
" koch has abandoned his instincts and abandoned the voters , " it wrote .
" that the electorate reacted against this is a good thing .
it would be an ominous sign for the political culture in germany if the people had allowed themselves to have been manipulated by such a campaign .
the majority of people in hesse recognized that sloganeering is not the right approach to the multi-layered subject of juvenile delinquency .
this is why christian wulff , with his low-key election campaign , ran to a clear victory . " the stuttgarter zeitung also picked up on the differences in the conservative candidates ' approaches and results .
" the one winner in the state elections this sunday is christian wulff , which is not so surprising given the weakness of his social democratic spd opponent wolfgang jüttner , " the paper wrote .
the paper acknowledged , however , that despite the spd 's ineptitude , wulff led a winning campaign without the need to resort to the strong-arm tactics and verbal failures of his hessian colleague roland koch .
the paper suggested that wulff should be considered the heir apparent to chancellor merkel and that his victory should signal a rise in his profile within the cdu . the spd 's inability to force home a clear advantage in the state elections was also picked up on by the rhein-neckar zeitung .
" the state elections were less about regional politics and more about the performances of the candidates , " it wrote .
" the most significant signal was the fact that spd leader kurt beck could not lead a socialist election campaign which was better than that fought by the left party . "
the paper also wrote that roland koch 's performance and the chancellor 's support of his campaign should be a wake-up call to merkel , who the paper suggested should follow christian wulff 's approach , and not koch 's , in the future . the frankfurter allgemeine zeitung also lamented the state of german politics highlighted by the inability of the social democrats to capitalize on weakened and disliked conservative candidates .
the paper complained that a weak and directionless spd made the conservatives look good , despite their own poor showing .
" we now know the weaknesses of the spd , " it wrote , " poor in candidates and poor in profile … one wonders how the cdu would have responded to a stronger opponent .

" the stabilization and association agreement wo n't be signed in the coming days but this does n't mean that our policy has changed , " he told journalists .
" we want to send a signal that our hand is stretched out to serbia . " the interim agreement could assist tadic in his campaign against nikolic but eu officials admitted that they had received mixed signals from belgrade as to whether a signing ceremony would hurt or help the pro-europe candidate 's prospects . tadic currently trails nikolic who took a five-point lead in the first round this weekend . eu boost to pro-europe candidate ahead of kosovo move eu leaders are keen to see tadic win to bolster pro-european forces ahead of an expected declaration of independence by politicians in the serbian province of kosovo . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the eu plans to boost its forces in kosovo the leaders of kosovo 's ethnic albanian majority , who make up 90 percent of the province 's 2 million people , say they are within weeks of declaring independence from serbia . the eu plans to send a 1,800-persn strong mission to kosovo to help ease its transition to local rule , but is still waiting for a signal from un secretary-general ban ki-moon to do so .

but there is much skepticism in serbia of the eu 's motives and the latest stalling on the saa is unlikely to help . a failure to put an agreement in place soon would " fuel a widely present perception of permanent exclusion and unparalleled conditioning , " srdjan gligorijevic , chief analyst for the belgrade-based international and security affairs centre think-tank , told reuters news agency .

however , the appointment of nash - an irishman - guarantees the multinational nature of the force , diplomats said . ireland and poland are set to send some 400 troops each .
the deployment is expected to begin in march , with the mission coming up to full strength by may 1 . the mission is expected to cost 119 million euros -lrb- $ 175 million -rrb- . nash is set to control the operation from the mont valerien military base in france .

after the votes were counted , hesse 's incumbent premier , roland koch , had a hair-thin majority , making uncertain the sort of coalition that could form a government and what role the candidate koch - who had led a controversial , openly xenophobic campaign - could have in it .
at midmorning on monday , jan .
28 , political advisers from all parties involved had holed up for strategy meetings .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ypsilanti will likely lead a coalition - but with whom ?
official results from hesse showed the conservative cdu had slumped from a majority in the state legislature to finish only nominally ahead of the center-left social democrats -lrb- spd -rrb- , with the same number of seats .
the spd candidate in hesse , andrea ypsilanti , took 36.7 percent of the vote against the cdu 's 36.8 .
search for a coalition a deputy cdu leader in another state , premier christian wulff of lower saxony , won re-election in a separate vote sunday , despite moderate losses .
the left , a combination of former social democrats and eastern ex-communists , extended its reach in western germany to enter both state parliaments .
but gains for the left party and spd in hesse mean the cdu , together with its planned coalition partner free democrats -lrb- fdp -rrb- , no longer have a large enough majority to rule in the state parliament in wiesbaden .
this gives a clear mandate to the spd to enter the state government in hesse , according to acting spd chairwoman andrea nahles .
voters saw to it that koch took " the most brutal beating possible , " nahles told rbb news radio on monday .
while the spd failed " by a nose " to gain a clear majority , it was clear that the voters in the western state increasingly stood behind the center-left party , and it should therefore be part of the government , she said .
ypsilanti is currently in talks with other party representatives to discuss coalition possibilities .
but nahles reiterated ypsilanti 's campaign promise that her party would not enter into a coalition with the upsurge , far-left left party , saying " the program and the people that they represent in hesse do not stand for stability in government . "
" traffic light " coalition possible ?
meanwhile , spd secretary general hubertus heil called for a " traffic light " coalition to rule hesse , which would be made up of the spd -lrb- red -rrb- , free democrats -lrb- yellow -rrb- and green party , under the leadership of ypsilanti .
" there is a koch-must-go mood -lsb- among voters -rsb- that we have to take into account when making up the government , " heil told zdf television talk show morgenmagazin on monday .
" we will present the premier , i am fairly sure of that , " he said .
yet a parliamentary leader of the fdp from hesse , jörg-uwe hahn , said there is no way that his party would enter into a " traffic light " coalition .
the fdp had planned to be coalition partner with the right-wing cdu , and could not be used as " a training wheel for a red-green " coalition , he told the dpa press agency .
hahn predicted a coalition would form between the spd , greens and the left party .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel 's cdu should avoid negative campaigns , one observer said amid the speculations on a new government , political observers took the time to mull over just what went so very wrong in the campaign of incumbent koch - and what it could mean for the larger question of cdu domination in german politics .
koch faulted for polarizing strategy chemnitz-based election researcher eckhard jesse said the cdu should see the campaign as a powerful lesson . with his polarizing , xenophobic rhetoric about youth-crime , koch led the campaign as if he were an opposition candidate , not an incumbent , jesse told the thüringer allgemeine newspaper .
merkel and other cdu candidates need to draw the conclusion that " they should take the same tact as wulff , " who handily won the state election in lower saxony .
" that means that they should run a low-key , feel-good campaign .
they should n't polarize - especially not the chancellor , " he said .
and political scientist theo schiller said koch had reaped what he sowed from his controversial style .
" if koch had n't focused his campaign on youth crime and young offenders , the results might have been slightly different , " the professor at the university of marburg told dpa .
the results were " catastrophic " for the cdu , he said .
by focusing on youth crime , koch aimed to harm the spd , but instead pilloried his own party , schiller said .
" he raised the question of deficits during the years his own government had ruled , " he said .
and was not able to give any satisfactory answers , he added .
no stopping rise of the left like a number of other german political analysts , schiller saw the left party 's gains as a sign of things to come .
" we can expect the left to enter other state parliaments , " he told dpa .
but he also said he did not see the likelihood of the left entering into a ruling coalition in hesse together with the spd .
that would mean ypsilanti would have to go back on her word to too great an extent , he said . dw staff -lrb- jen -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the country 's german-speaking minority is maintaining a low profile in the debate . the debate concerning the political crisis in belgium and the unlikely , yet much discussed , possibility of the country splitting , has focused firmly on the disagreements between the two main linguistic areas , french-speaking wallonia and flemish-speaking flanders .
though these two areas are the largest in terms of size , and also importance when it comes to deciding policies which affect the whole country , belgium has in fact been divided into four linguistic regions since the early 1960s .
besides wallonia in the south and flanders in the north , there is the bilingual brussels capital region and the tiny german-speaking area in the east cantons .
while brussels is sometimes left out of the debate over belgium 's future - due mainly to its bilingualism , its self-sufficiency and its status as an international city - the east cantons seem to be ignored altogether when it comes to discussing the linguistic and cultural divide .
a region of 854 square kilometers -lrb- 530 square miles -rrb- with a population of over 73,000 , of which almost 100 percent are german speaking , the east cantons can quite easily be overlooked in belgium 's controversial situation .
the juicy arguments and stubborn nationalist positions of the more powerful flemings and walloons make for far better headlines than a quirky little germanic outpost on the far eastern border .
similar challenges and yet , the german-speaking community of the east cantons , as a linguistic minority within the federal state of belgium , faces similar challenges to those causing strife between " the big two . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the seat of german-speaking power is based in eupen granted internal rule in 1973 , the region has its own parliament in the capital of eupen and control over linguistic and cultural matters .
the parliament organizes elections , supervises the regional government , and adopts decrees for the german-speaking community .
the east cantons also have committees charged with governing areas such as education , social policy , health and employment .
despite this illusion of self-rule , however , the region still remains part of french-speaking wallonia , located as it is in the province of liege , and is therefore kept under the watchful eye of the wallon parliament .
it is not surprising that there are some in the east cantons who have themselves expressed a desire for the kind of autonomy favored by the more extreme elements on either side of the main linguistic divide .
a small but growing number have been voicing their support for an independent mini-state .
as is the case in the rest of the country , this is not a view shared by the whole population of the east cantons .
to get an idea how the german-speaking region and its people view their role in the wider belgian community , dw-world.de talked to jean-claude franken , the secretary of the german-speaking community 's christian social party -lrb- csp -rrb- , a cooperation partner of the francophone humanist democratic center -lrb- cdh -rrb- in the belgian parliament .
dw-world.de : is belgium 's german-speaking minority well integrated ?
jean-claude franken : the german-speaking minority is integrated in the belgian federal state very well .
there are special laws within the belgian constitution that protect the german-speaking community here .
how much power does the german-speaking minority have in belgium ?
the german-speaking community is an equal partner in the belgian federal state .
that is because there is no favoritism towards any of the linguistic minorities in the country in terms of the divulgence of power .
in the federal government , of course , the larger regions have the biggest political parties and therefore more seats in parliament , but our cooperation with the cdh allows us to have our say as part of wallonia .
in regional terms , the parties within the east canton - the csp , the socialist party , the party for freedom and progress and the party for german-speaking belgians - ensure that the autonomy we enjoy is used to make the community as self-reliant and efficient as possible .
does the german-speaking minority in belgium consider itself german or belgian ?
in former times , the region was part of prussia and therefore a small part of germany .
during world war ii , it was annexed again by germany after being part of belgium since the end of the great war .
when the east canton was returned to belgium once more in 1945 , some who lived there regretted this and wanted to stay german ; these were the same people who welcomed the occupying nazi forces .
however , as belgium has grown as a nation of diversity and understanding , the german-speaking community has become very integrated in the country and contact with out neighboring regions has increased over the years .
as a result , the german speakers consider themselves to be fully-fledged belgians and are accepted as such by their flemish and walloon compatriots .
could the german-speaking area support itself if belgium separated ?
if not , would it consider joining another region or hope to become part of germany again ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : lambertz has spoken of his support for regional autonomy the question of splitting belgium is a moot point .
it wo n't happen .
but for the sake of argument , despite its current state of stable and competent government , the german-speaking community would struggle to support itself in this hypothetical scenario and would have to join either wallonia or another state area .
there are some who push for this in the german-speaking community .
the current premier karl-heinz lambertz of the socialist party is one of the most prominent proponents of this idea .
these people say , as do the flemish , that wallonia is too much of a burden with its financial and social problems .
lambertz and others want a full transfer of powers from wallonia to the german-speaking parliament resulting in full regional autonomy .
is the cultural identity of the german-speaking minority strong ?
how is it protected ?
the cultural identity of the german speakers is deeply rooted .
our culture expresses itself in the german language spoken by the region 's people , the traditions that remain strong there and the creative and artistic expression in the region .
the position of the german-speaking community in the belgian federal state and its culture is protected by law in the constitution .
there are no worries within the community that the cultural identity of the german-speaking minority is under threat in belgium or by any policy of enlargement or expansion from the european union .
is the german-speaking minority in belgium influenced by the decisions of the european union ?
of course .
the eu has an influence on all countries which are member states , and that of course means that those people and minorities in those member states are influenced by eu policy .
the difference is that , unlike some minorities across europe , the german-speaking community does not fear these policies but welcomes them . nick amies send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

to get an idea how the german-speaking region and its people view their role in the wider belgian community , dw-world.de talked to jean-claude franken , the secretary of the german-speaking community 's christian social party -lrb- csp -rrb- , a cooperation partner of the francophone humanist democratic center -lrb- cdh -rrb- in the belgian parliament .
dw-world.de : is belgium 's german-speaking minority well integrated ?
jean-claude franken : the german-speaking minority is integrated in the belgian federal state very well .
there are special laws within the belgian constitution that protect the german-speaking community here .
how much power does the german-speaking minority have in belgium ?
the german-speaking community is an equal partner in the belgian federal state .
that is because there is no favoritism towards any of the linguistic minorities in the country in terms of the divulgence of power .
in the federal government , of course , the larger regions have the biggest political parties and therefore more seats in parliament , but our cooperation with the cdh allows us to have our say as part of wallonia .
in regional terms , the parties within the east canton - the csp , the socialist party , the party for freedom and progress and the party for german-speaking belgians - ensure that the autonomy we enjoy is used to make the community as self-reliant and efficient as possible .
does the german-speaking minority in belgium consider itself german or belgian ?
in former times , the region was part of prussia and therefore a small part of germany .
during world war ii , it was annexed again by germany after being part of belgium since the end of the great war .
when the east canton was returned to belgium once more in 1945 , some who lived there regretted this and wanted to stay german ; these were the same people who welcomed the occupying nazi forces .
however , as belgium has grown as a nation of diversity and understanding , the german-speaking community has become very integrated in the country and contact with out neighboring regions has increased over the years .
as a result , the german speakers consider themselves to be fully-fledged belgians and are accepted as such by their flemish and walloon compatriots .
could the german-speaking area support itself if belgium separated ?
if not , would it consider joining another region or hope to become part of germany again ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : lambertz has spoken of his support for regional autonomy the question of splitting belgium is a moot point .
it wo n't happen .
but for the sake of argument , despite its current state of stable and competent government , the german-speaking community would struggle to support itself in this hypothetical scenario and would have to join either wallonia or another state area .
there are some who push for this in the german-speaking community .
the current premier karl-heinz lambertz of the socialist party is one of the most prominent proponents of this idea .
these people say , as do the flemish , that wallonia is too much of a burden with its financial and social problems .
lambertz and others want a full transfer of powers from wallonia to the german-speaking parliament resulting in full regional autonomy .
is the cultural identity of the german-speaking minority strong ?
how is it protected ?
the cultural identity of the german speakers is deeply rooted .
our culture expresses itself in the german language spoken by the region 's people , the traditions that remain strong there and the creative and artistic expression in the region .
the position of the german-speaking community in the belgian federal state and its culture is protected by law in the constitution .
there are no worries within the community that the cultural identity of the german-speaking minority is under threat in belgium or by any policy of enlargement or expansion from the european union .
is the german-speaking minority in belgium influenced by the decisions of the european union ?
of course .
the eu has an influence on all countries which are member states , and that of course means that those people and minorities in those member states are influenced by eu policy .
the difference is that , unlike some minorities across europe , the german-speaking community does not fear these policies but welcomes them . nick amies send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

france is slated to contribute the most troops . at their regular monthly meeting , the union 's 27 foreign ministers on monday , jan .
28 , authorized the force 's commander , lt. gen. patrick nash , to order the deployment of his troops . " in conducting this operation the eu is stepping up its long-standing action in support of efforts to tackle the crisis in darfur and to address its regional ramifications , " the foreign ministers said in a statement . the force , which is to provide security for locals and un aid teams in eastern chad and the north-eastern central african republic along the border with the war-torn sudanese province of darfur , was proposed by france and approved in concept by eu leaders on oct .
15 . however , arguments then broke out over the resources which each member state should commit to the operation , with the eu 's 27 nations initially unable to scrape together the helicopters and transport planes needed to support the 3,700-man mission . bildunterschrift : hundreds of thousand have been uprooted by violence in the region that obstacle was finally overcome in early january , when russia and ukraine - neither of which is an eu member - offered to provide the missing hardware . the backbone of the " bridging operation , " which is mandated to run for a year , will be made up of an estimated 2,000 french troops .
however , the appointment of nash - an irishman - guarantees the multinational nature of the force , diplomats said . ireland and poland are set to send some 400 troops each .
the deployment is expected to begin in march , with the mission coming up to full strength by may 1 . the mission is expected to cost 119 million euros -lrb- $ 175 million -rrb- . nash is set to control the operation from the mont valerien military base in france .

" we want to send a signal that our hand is stretched out to serbia . " the interim agreement could assist tadic in his campaign against nikolic but eu officials admitted that they had received mixed signals from belgrade as to whether a signing ceremony would hurt or help the pro-europe candidate 's prospects . tadic currently trails nikolic who took a five-point lead in the first round this weekend . eu boost to pro-europe candidate ahead of kosovo move eu leaders are keen to see tadic win to bolster pro-european forces ahead of an expected declaration of independence by politicians in the serbian province of kosovo . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the eu plans to boost its forces in kosovo the leaders of kosovo 's ethnic albanian majority , who make up 90 percent of the province 's 2 million people , say they are within weeks of declaring independence from serbia . the eu plans to send a 1,800-persn strong mission to kosovo to help ease its transition to local rule , but is still waiting for a signal from un secretary-general ban ki-moon to do so .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de europe -pipe- 28.01.2008 belgium 's german minority mostly unmoved by autonomy debate großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the belgian unity question centers on flanders and wallonia and neglects other regions the belgian interim government may have silenced separatist rhetoric for now but the divisive problems have not gone away .
the country 's german-speaking minority is maintaining a low profile in the debate . the debate concerning the political crisis in belgium and the unlikely , yet much discussed , possibility of the country splitting , has focused firmly on the disagreements between the two main linguistic areas , french-speaking wallonia and flemish-speaking flanders .
though these two areas are the largest in terms of size , and also importance when it comes to deciding policies which affect the whole country , belgium has in fact been divided into four linguistic regions since the early 1960s .
besides wallonia in the south and flanders in the north , there is the bilingual brussels capital region and the tiny german-speaking area in the east cantons .
while brussels is sometimes left out of the debate over belgium 's future - due mainly to its bilingualism , its self-sufficiency and its status as an international city - the east cantons seem to be ignored altogether when it comes to discussing the linguistic and cultural divide .
a region of 854 square kilometers -lrb- 530 square miles -rrb- with a population of over 73,000 , of which almost 100 percent are german speaking , the east cantons can quite easily be overlooked in belgium 's controversial situation .
the juicy arguments and stubborn nationalist positions of the more powerful flemings and walloons make for far better headlines than a quirky little germanic outpost on the far eastern border .
similar challenges and yet , the german-speaking community of the east cantons , as a linguistic minority within the federal state of belgium , faces similar challenges to those causing strife between " the big two . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the seat of german-speaking power is based in eupen granted internal rule in 1973 , the region has its own parliament in the capital of eupen and control over linguistic and cultural matters .
the parliament organizes elections , supervises the regional government , and adopts decrees for the german-speaking community .
the east cantons also have committees charged with governing areas such as education , social policy , health and employment .
despite this illusion of self-rule , however , the region still remains part of french-speaking wallonia , located as it is in the province of liege , and is therefore kept under the watchful eye of the wallon parliament .
it is not surprising that there are some in the east cantons who have themselves expressed a desire for the kind of autonomy favored by the more extreme elements on either side of the main linguistic divide .
a small but growing number have been voicing their support for an independent mini-state .
as is the case in the rest of the country , this is not a view shared by the whole population of the east cantons .
to get an idea how the german-speaking region and its people view their role in the wider belgian community , dw-world.de talked to jean-claude franken , the secretary of the german-speaking community 's christian social party -lrb- csp -rrb- , a cooperation partner of the francophone humanist democratic center -lrb- cdh -rrb- in the belgian parliament .
dw-world.de : is belgium 's german-speaking minority well integrated ?
jean-claude franken : the german-speaking minority is integrated in the belgian federal state very well .
there are special laws within the belgian constitution that protect the german-speaking community here .
how much power does the german-speaking minority have in belgium ?
the german-speaking community is an equal partner in the belgian federal state .
that is because there is no favoritism towards any of the linguistic minorities in the country in terms of the divulgence of power .
in the federal government , of course , the larger regions have the biggest political parties and therefore more seats in parliament , but our cooperation with the cdh allows us to have our say as part of wallonia .
in regional terms , the parties within the east canton - the csp , the socialist party , the party for freedom and progress and the party for german-speaking belgians - ensure that the autonomy we enjoy is used to make the community as self-reliant and efficient as possible .
does the german-speaking minority in belgium consider itself german or belgian ?
in former times , the region was part of prussia and therefore a small part of germany .
during world war ii , it was annexed again by germany after being part of belgium since the end of the great war .
when the east canton was returned to belgium once more in 1945 , some who lived there regretted this and wanted to stay german ; these were the same people who welcomed the occupying nazi forces .
however , as belgium has grown as a nation of diversity and understanding , the german-speaking community has become very integrated in the country and contact with out neighboring regions has increased over the years .
as a result , the german speakers consider themselves to be fully-fledged belgians and are accepted as such by their flemish and walloon compatriots .
could the german-speaking area support itself if belgium separated ?
if not , would it consider joining another region or hope to become part of germany again ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : lambertz has spoken of his support for regional autonomy the question of splitting belgium is a moot point .
it wo n't happen .
but for the sake of argument , despite its current state of stable and competent government , the german-speaking community would struggle to support itself in this hypothetical scenario and would have to join either wallonia or another state area .
there are some who push for this in the german-speaking community .
the current premier karl-heinz lambertz of the socialist party is one of the most prominent proponents of this idea .
these people say , as do the flemish , that wallonia is too much of a burden with its financial and social problems .
lambertz and others want a full transfer of powers from wallonia to the german-speaking parliament resulting in full regional autonomy .
is the cultural identity of the german-speaking minority strong ?
how is it protected ?
the cultural identity of the german speakers is deeply rooted .
our culture expresses itself in the german language spoken by the region 's people , the traditions that remain strong there and the creative and artistic expression in the region .
the position of the german-speaking community in the belgian federal state and its culture is protected by law in the constitution .
there are no worries within the community that the cultural identity of the german-speaking minority is under threat in belgium or by any policy of enlargement or expansion from the european union .
is the german-speaking minority in belgium influenced by the decisions of the european union ?
of course .
the eu has an influence on all countries which are member states , and that of course means that those people and minorities in those member states are influenced by eu policy .
the difference is that , unlike some minorities across europe , the german-speaking community does not fear these policies but welcomes them . nick amies send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

after stints in lima , leverkusen , germany , and barcelona , he became board chairman of bayer ag in 2002 .
under his leadership in 2006 , bayer bought schering ag for some 17 billion euros -lrb- $ 25 billion -rrb- .
wenning is married and has two adult daughters . deutsche welle : mr. wenning , what did you think of this year 's world economic forum ? werner wenning : very positive .
of course , this year 's topics were very interesting .
financial and stock market crises , the topic of government securities , climate change - but i could also focus on topics that are n't on my daily agenda .
i met a lot of very interesting people in a very short period of time .
for instance , i was among a small group of people who met with israeli president shimon peres .
for me , davos was very successful . a big topic in davos was the influence of so-called government security funds .
since these funds are now valued at more than $ 2.5 trillion , the usa , france and germany all want to increase control over foreign investment .
is this necessary ? no .
in germany we live from exports , from free trade .
we also live from the fact that capital markets are free and not regimented .
so , i think the discussion goes overboard .
companies like ours do not need regimentation . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bayer merged with schering in 2006 the government 's main argument in favor of stronger controls over foreign investment is that it provides a nation with security .
but when is national security in danger ?
and how should we judge when that is , or is not , the case ? of course , we should always ask ourselves which strategic sectors are important in terms of a country 's security .
the arms industry is a good example .
and there is a question of a country 's sovereignty , seen in a global context .
in this case , every country must define criteria by which it can negotiate , in relation to its industrial culture . i think we should have as little legal interference as possible .
we know what is going on when we deal as openly as possible with the financial markets .
i advocate international agreements and the greatest possible transparency .
we welcome every long-term investor who is interested in increased share value . what is on the agenda for bayer in 2008 ?
are more acquisitions planned ? well , the world keeps on turning .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de europe -pipe- 28.01.2008 belgium 's german minority mostly unmoved by autonomy debate großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the belgian unity question centers on flanders and wallonia and neglects other regions the belgian interim government may have silenced separatist rhetoric for now but the divisive problems have not gone away .
the country 's german-speaking minority is maintaining a low profile in the debate . the debate concerning the political crisis in belgium and the unlikely , yet much discussed , possibility of the country splitting , has focused firmly on the disagreements between the two main linguistic areas , french-speaking wallonia and flemish-speaking flanders .
though these two areas are the largest in terms of size , and also importance when it comes to deciding policies which affect the whole country , belgium has in fact been divided into four linguistic regions since the early 1960s .
besides wallonia in the south and flanders in the north , there is the bilingual brussels capital region and the tiny german-speaking area in the east cantons .
while brussels is sometimes left out of the debate over belgium 's future - due mainly to its bilingualism , its self-sufficiency and its status as an international city - the east cantons seem to be ignored altogether when it comes to discussing the linguistic and cultural divide .
a region of 854 square kilometers -lrb- 530 square miles -rrb- with a population of over 73,000 , of which almost 100 percent are german speaking , the east cantons can quite easily be overlooked in belgium 's controversial situation .
the juicy arguments and stubborn nationalist positions of the more powerful flemings and walloons make for far better headlines than a quirky little germanic outpost on the far eastern border .
similar challenges and yet , the german-speaking community of the east cantons , as a linguistic minority within the federal state of belgium , faces similar challenges to those causing strife between " the big two . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the seat of german-speaking power is based in eupen granted internal rule in 1973 , the region has its own parliament in the capital of eupen and control over linguistic and cultural matters .
the parliament organizes elections , supervises the regional government , and adopts decrees for the german-speaking community .
the east cantons also have committees charged with governing areas such as education , social policy , health and employment .
despite this illusion of self-rule , however , the region still remains part of french-speaking wallonia , located as it is in the province of liege , and is therefore kept under the watchful eye of the wallon parliament .
it is not surprising that there are some in the east cantons who have themselves expressed a desire for the kind of autonomy favored by the more extreme elements on either side of the main linguistic divide .
a small but growing number have been voicing their support for an independent mini-state .
as is the case in the rest of the country , this is not a view shared by the whole population of the east cantons .
to get an idea how the german-speaking region and its people view their role in the wider belgian community , dw-world.de talked to jean-claude franken , the secretary of the german-speaking community 's christian social party -lrb- csp -rrb- , a cooperation partner of the francophone humanist democratic center -lrb- cdh -rrb- in the belgian parliament .
dw-world.de : is belgium 's german-speaking minority well integrated ?
jean-claude franken : the german-speaking minority is integrated in the belgian federal state very well .
there are special laws within the belgian constitution that protect the german-speaking community here .
how much power does the german-speaking minority have in belgium ?
the german-speaking community is an equal partner in the belgian federal state .
that is because there is no favoritism towards any of the linguistic minorities in the country in terms of the divulgence of power .
in the federal government , of course , the larger regions have the biggest political parties and therefore more seats in parliament , but our cooperation with the cdh allows us to have our say as part of wallonia .
in regional terms , the parties within the east canton - the csp , the socialist party , the party for freedom and progress and the party for german-speaking belgians - ensure that the autonomy we enjoy is used to make the community as self-reliant and efficient as possible .
does the german-speaking minority in belgium consider itself german or belgian ?
in former times , the region was part of prussia and therefore a small part of germany .
during world war ii , it was annexed again by germany after being part of belgium since the end of the great war .
when the east canton was returned to belgium once more in 1945 , some who lived there regretted this and wanted to stay german ; these were the same people who welcomed the occupying nazi forces .
however , as belgium has grown as a nation of diversity and understanding , the german-speaking community has become very integrated in the country and contact with out neighboring regions has increased over the years .
as a result , the german speakers consider themselves to be fully-fledged belgians and are accepted as such by their flemish and walloon compatriots .
could the german-speaking area support itself if belgium separated ?
if not , would it consider joining another region or hope to become part of germany again ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : lambertz has spoken of his support for regional autonomy the question of splitting belgium is a moot point .
it wo n't happen .
but for the sake of argument , despite its current state of stable and competent government , the german-speaking community would struggle to support itself in this hypothetical scenario and would have to join either wallonia or another state area .
there are some who push for this in the german-speaking community .
the current premier karl-heinz lambertz of the socialist party is one of the most prominent proponents of this idea .
these people say , as do the flemish , that wallonia is too much of a burden with its financial and social problems .
lambertz and others want a full transfer of powers from wallonia to the german-speaking parliament resulting in full regional autonomy .
is the cultural identity of the german-speaking minority strong ?
how is it protected ?
the cultural identity of the german speakers is deeply rooted .
our culture expresses itself in the german language spoken by the region 's people , the traditions that remain strong there and the creative and artistic expression in the region .
the position of the german-speaking community in the belgian federal state and its culture is protected by law in the constitution .
there are no worries within the community that the cultural identity of the german-speaking minority is under threat in belgium or by any policy of enlargement or expansion from the european union .
is the german-speaking minority in belgium influenced by the decisions of the european union ?
of course .
the eu has an influence on all countries which are member states , and that of course means that those people and minorities in those member states are influenced by eu policy .
the difference is that , unlike some minorities across europe , the german-speaking community does not fear these policies but welcomes them . nick amies send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?
dw-world.de belgian woes mirror europe 's expansion challenges it can appear at times that the eu has forgotten the little things in pursuit of the bigger picture .
working for european unity is all well and good but how can it succeed when member states themselves are divided ? -lrb- 08.01.2008 -rrb- belgian parliament backs new interim government half a year after parliamentary elections , belgium finally has a new government .
acting prime minister guy verhofstadt won a vote of confidence in parliament to lead the divided country - until easter .

in belgium 's parliamentary elections sunday , one issue bound to feature is the power struggle between the french-speaking walloons and the dutch-speaking flemish .

the bundesliga is in danger of turning from a glittering stage into an enticing shop window . while the german top flight has n't ever been exactly below the radar , other european teams looking for new players have given their german counterparts little more than a cursory glance before taking their checkbooks to italy or spain .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de press review -pipe- 28.01.2008 german press review : rambo koch loses out to cuddly wulff großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : chancellor merkel is now taking heat for her support of koch 's failed campaign after the state elections in lower saxony and hesse on sunday , jan .
27 , many in the german press commented on the difference in conservative campaigns and what the results meant for the future of angela merkel 's party . the frankfurter rundschau wrote that incumbent premier roland koch has no one to blame but himself for the result in hesse .
" koch chose the wrong topic to champion and led the wrong election campaign , " it stated .
" he set himself up by making strong announcements which contradicted his own actions .
the public noticed that calls for swift justice from the state with the slowest judicial system in the country were implausible , and they have punished koch for this . "
the paper continued by saying that koch 's losses were also angela merkel 's losses .
" the chancellor supported this tough election campaign , " it wrote , " and now the conservatives must ask whether her governance endangers the future of the -lsb- christian democratic -rsb- union . " the bremer nachrichten pondered the consequences of the state elections for the chancellor and the cdu 's coming parliamentary election campaign .
" which way now for angela merkel ? " the paper asked .
" not only is it that social democrats -lsb- spd -rsb- must find their direction but also the conservatives .
should she take the careful approach or come out fighting like roland koch ?
reading the results from lower saxony and hesse , the decision should be clear . " " rambo koch loses , cuddly wulff wins , " stated the westdeutsche allgemeine zeitung .
" koch 's campaign failed because it focused on his weaknesses not his strengths .
there was no policy substance to his rhetoric and such a thing costs credibility , especially when policy is so important and at a time when the voters look for strong policies not just words . " the thüringer allgemeine zeitung also focused on koch 's performance .
" koch has abandoned his instincts and abandoned the voters , " it wrote .
" that the electorate reacted against this is a good thing .
it would be an ominous sign for the political culture in germany if the people had allowed themselves to have been manipulated by such a campaign .
the majority of people in hesse recognized that sloganeering is not the right approach to the multi-layered subject of juvenile delinquency .
this is why christian wulff , with his low-key election campaign , ran to a clear victory . " the stuttgarter zeitung also picked up on the differences in the conservative candidates ' approaches and results .
" the one winner in the state elections this sunday is christian wulff , which is not so surprising given the weakness of his social democratic spd opponent wolfgang jüttner , " the paper wrote .
the paper acknowledged , however , that despite the spd 's ineptitude , wulff led a winning campaign without the need to resort to the strong-arm tactics and verbal failures of his hessian colleague roland koch .
the paper suggested that wulff should be considered the heir apparent to chancellor merkel and that his victory should signal a rise in his profile within the cdu . the spd 's inability to force home a clear advantage in the state elections was also picked up on by the rhein-neckar zeitung .
" the state elections were less about regional politics and more about the performances of the candidates , " it wrote .
" the most significant signal was the fact that spd leader kurt beck could not lead a socialist election campaign which was better than that fought by the left party . "
the paper also wrote that roland koch 's performance and the chancellor 's support of his campaign should be a wake-up call to merkel , who the paper suggested should follow christian wulff 's approach , and not koch 's , in the future . the frankfurter allgemeine zeitung also lamented the state of german politics highlighted by the inability of the social democrats to capitalize on weakened and disliked conservative candidates .
the paper complained that a weak and directionless spd made the conservatives look good , despite their own poor showing .
" we now know the weaknesses of the spd , " it wrote , " poor in candidates and poor in profile … one wonders how the cdu would have responded to a stronger opponent .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de europe -pipe- 28.01.2008 belgium 's german minority mostly unmoved by autonomy debate großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the belgian unity question centers on flanders and wallonia and neglects other regions the belgian interim government may have silenced separatist rhetoric for now but the divisive problems have not gone away .
the country 's german-speaking minority is maintaining a low profile in the debate . the debate concerning the political crisis in belgium and the unlikely , yet much discussed , possibility of the country splitting , has focused firmly on the disagreements between the two main linguistic areas , french-speaking wallonia and flemish-speaking flanders .
though these two areas are the largest in terms of size , and also importance when it comes to deciding policies which affect the whole country , belgium has in fact been divided into four linguistic regions since the early 1960s .
besides wallonia in the south and flanders in the north , there is the bilingual brussels capital region and the tiny german-speaking area in the east cantons .
while brussels is sometimes left out of the debate over belgium 's future - due mainly to its bilingualism , its self-sufficiency and its status as an international city - the east cantons seem to be ignored altogether when it comes to discussing the linguistic and cultural divide .
a region of 854 square kilometers -lrb- 530 square miles -rrb- with a population of over 73,000 , of which almost 100 percent are german speaking , the east cantons can quite easily be overlooked in belgium 's controversial situation .
the juicy arguments and stubborn nationalist positions of the more powerful flemings and walloons make for far better headlines than a quirky little germanic outpost on the far eastern border .
similar challenges and yet , the german-speaking community of the east cantons , as a linguistic minority within the federal state of belgium , faces similar challenges to those causing strife between " the big two . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the seat of german-speaking power is based in eupen granted internal rule in 1973 , the region has its own parliament in the capital of eupen and control over linguistic and cultural matters .
the parliament organizes elections , supervises the regional government , and adopts decrees for the german-speaking community .
the east cantons also have committees charged with governing areas such as education , social policy , health and employment .
despite this illusion of self-rule , however , the region still remains part of french-speaking wallonia , located as it is in the province of liege , and is therefore kept under the watchful eye of the wallon parliament .
it is not surprising that there are some in the east cantons who have themselves expressed a desire for the kind of autonomy favored by the more extreme elements on either side of the main linguistic divide .
a small but growing number have been voicing their support for an independent mini-state .
as is the case in the rest of the country , this is not a view shared by the whole population of the east cantons .
to get an idea how the german-speaking region and its people view their role in the wider belgian community , dw-world.de talked to jean-claude franken , the secretary of the german-speaking community 's christian social party -lrb- csp -rrb- , a cooperation partner of the francophone humanist democratic center -lrb- cdh -rrb- in the belgian parliament .
dw-world.de : is belgium 's german-speaking minority well integrated ?
jean-claude franken : the german-speaking minority is integrated in the belgian federal state very well .
there are special laws within the belgian constitution that protect the german-speaking community here .
how much power does the german-speaking minority have in belgium ?
the german-speaking community is an equal partner in the belgian federal state .
that is because there is no favoritism towards any of the linguistic minorities in the country in terms of the divulgence of power .
in the federal government , of course , the larger regions have the biggest political parties and therefore more seats in parliament , but our cooperation with the cdh allows us to have our say as part of wallonia .
in regional terms , the parties within the east canton - the csp , the socialist party , the party for freedom and progress and the party for german-speaking belgians - ensure that the autonomy we enjoy is used to make the community as self-reliant and efficient as possible .
does the german-speaking minority in belgium consider itself german or belgian ?
in former times , the region was part of prussia and therefore a small part of germany .
during world war ii , it was annexed again by germany after being part of belgium since the end of the great war .
when the east canton was returned to belgium once more in 1945 , some who lived there regretted this and wanted to stay german ; these were the same people who welcomed the occupying nazi forces .
however , as belgium has grown as a nation of diversity and understanding , the german-speaking community has become very integrated in the country and contact with out neighboring regions has increased over the years .
as a result , the german speakers consider themselves to be fully-fledged belgians and are accepted as such by their flemish and walloon compatriots .
could the german-speaking area support itself if belgium separated ?
if not , would it consider joining another region or hope to become part of germany again ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : lambertz has spoken of his support for regional autonomy the question of splitting belgium is a moot point .
it wo n't happen .
but for the sake of argument , despite its current state of stable and competent government , the german-speaking community would struggle to support itself in this hypothetical scenario and would have to join either wallonia or another state area .
there are some who push for this in the german-speaking community .
the current premier karl-heinz lambertz of the socialist party is one of the most prominent proponents of this idea .
these people say , as do the flemish , that wallonia is too much of a burden with its financial and social problems .
lambertz and others want a full transfer of powers from wallonia to the german-speaking parliament resulting in full regional autonomy .
is the cultural identity of the german-speaking minority strong ?
how is it protected ?
the cultural identity of the german speakers is deeply rooted .
our culture expresses itself in the german language spoken by the region 's people , the traditions that remain strong there and the creative and artistic expression in the region .
the position of the german-speaking community in the belgian federal state and its culture is protected by law in the constitution .
there are no worries within the community that the cultural identity of the german-speaking minority is under threat in belgium or by any policy of enlargement or expansion from the european union .
is the german-speaking minority in belgium influenced by the decisions of the european union ?
of course .
the eu has an influence on all countries which are member states , and that of course means that those people and minorities in those member states are influenced by eu policy .
the difference is that , unlike some minorities across europe , the german-speaking community does not fear these policies but welcomes them . nick amies send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

in the federal government , of course , the larger regions have the biggest political parties and therefore more seats in parliament , but our cooperation with the cdh allows us to have our say as part of wallonia .
in regional terms , the parties within the east canton - the csp , the socialist party , the party for freedom and progress and the party for german-speaking belgians - ensure that the autonomy we enjoy is used to make the community as self-reliant and efficient as possible .
does the german-speaking minority in belgium consider itself german or belgian ?
in former times , the region was part of prussia and therefore a small part of germany .
during world war ii , it was annexed again by germany after being part of belgium since the end of the great war .
when the east canton was returned to belgium once more in 1945 , some who lived there regretted this and wanted to stay german ; these were the same people who welcomed the occupying nazi forces .
however , as belgium has grown as a nation of diversity and understanding , the german-speaking community has become very integrated in the country and contact with out neighboring regions has increased over the years .
as a result , the german speakers consider themselves to be fully-fledged belgians and are accepted as such by their flemish and walloon compatriots .
could the german-speaking area support itself if belgium separated ?
if not , would it consider joining another region or hope to become part of germany again ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : lambertz has spoken of his support for regional autonomy the question of splitting belgium is a moot point .
it wo n't happen .
but for the sake of argument , despite its current state of stable and competent government , the german-speaking community would struggle to support itself in this hypothetical scenario and would have to join either wallonia or another state area .
there are some who push for this in the german-speaking community .
the current premier karl-heinz lambertz of the socialist party is one of the most prominent proponents of this idea .
these people say , as do the flemish , that wallonia is too much of a burden with its financial and social problems .
lambertz and others want a full transfer of powers from wallonia to the german-speaking parliament resulting in full regional autonomy .
is the cultural identity of the german-speaking minority strong ?
how is it protected ?
the cultural identity of the german speakers is deeply rooted .
our culture expresses itself in the german language spoken by the region 's people , the traditions that remain strong there and the creative and artistic expression in the region .
the position of the german-speaking community in the belgian federal state and its culture is protected by law in the constitution .
there are no worries within the community that the cultural identity of the german-speaking minority is under threat in belgium or by any policy of enlargement or expansion from the european union .
is the german-speaking minority in belgium influenced by the decisions of the european union ?
of course .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de europe -pipe- 28.01.2008 belgium 's german minority mostly unmoved by autonomy debate großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the belgian unity question centers on flanders and wallonia and neglects other regions the belgian interim government may have silenced separatist rhetoric for now but the divisive problems have not gone away .
the country 's german-speaking minority is maintaining a low profile in the debate . the debate concerning the political crisis in belgium and the unlikely , yet much discussed , possibility of the country splitting , has focused firmly on the disagreements between the two main linguistic areas , french-speaking wallonia and flemish-speaking flanders .
though these two areas are the largest in terms of size , and also importance when it comes to deciding policies which affect the whole country , belgium has in fact been divided into four linguistic regions since the early 1960s .
besides wallonia in the south and flanders in the north , there is the bilingual brussels capital region and the tiny german-speaking area in the east cantons .
while brussels is sometimes left out of the debate over belgium 's future - due mainly to its bilingualism , its self-sufficiency and its status as an international city - the east cantons seem to be ignored altogether when it comes to discussing the linguistic and cultural divide .
a region of 854 square kilometers -lrb- 530 square miles -rrb- with a population of over 73,000 , of which almost 100 percent are german speaking , the east cantons can quite easily be overlooked in belgium 's controversial situation .
the juicy arguments and stubborn nationalist positions of the more powerful flemings and walloons make for far better headlines than a quirky little germanic outpost on the far eastern border .
similar challenges and yet , the german-speaking community of the east cantons , as a linguistic minority within the federal state of belgium , faces similar challenges to those causing strife between " the big two . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the seat of german-speaking power is based in eupen granted internal rule in 1973 , the region has its own parliament in the capital of eupen and control over linguistic and cultural matters .
the parliament organizes elections , supervises the regional government , and adopts decrees for the german-speaking community .
the east cantons also have committees charged with governing areas such as education , social policy , health and employment .
despite this illusion of self-rule , however , the region still remains part of french-speaking wallonia , located as it is in the province of liege , and is therefore kept under the watchful eye of the wallon parliament .
it is not surprising that there are some in the east cantons who have themselves expressed a desire for the kind of autonomy favored by the more extreme elements on either side of the main linguistic divide .
a small but growing number have been voicing their support for an independent mini-state .
as is the case in the rest of the country , this is not a view shared by the whole population of the east cantons .
to get an idea how the german-speaking region and its people view their role in the wider belgian community , dw-world.de talked to jean-claude franken , the secretary of the german-speaking community 's christian social party -lrb- csp -rrb- , a cooperation partner of the francophone humanist democratic center -lrb- cdh -rrb- in the belgian parliament .
dw-world.de : is belgium 's german-speaking minority well integrated ?
jean-claude franken : the german-speaking minority is integrated in the belgian federal state very well .
there are special laws within the belgian constitution that protect the german-speaking community here .
how much power does the german-speaking minority have in belgium ?
the german-speaking community is an equal partner in the belgian federal state .
that is because there is no favoritism towards any of the linguistic minorities in the country in terms of the divulgence of power .
in the federal government , of course , the larger regions have the biggest political parties and therefore more seats in parliament , but our cooperation with the cdh allows us to have our say as part of wallonia .
in regional terms , the parties within the east canton - the csp , the socialist party , the party for freedom and progress and the party for german-speaking belgians - ensure that the autonomy we enjoy is used to make the community as self-reliant and efficient as possible .

but it 's yet to be seen which party will be able to form a governing coalition . led by merkel ally and incumbent premier roland koch , who ran a controversial campaign focused on crime and immigration , the cdu took 36.8 percent of the vote , down from 48.8 percent in 2003 . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the state election in hesse polarized germans nationwide " we did n't mobilize our own supporters enough , " koch said on public television .
" this is not easily for me personally . " the rival social democrats -lrb- spd -rrb- , who rule together with merkel 's cdu at the national level , saw their support push up to 36.7 percent . " we fought for a different political culture in this country and we won , " said koch 's spd challenger , andrea ypsilanti . it remains unclear , however , which party will take power .
the entry into hesse 's parliament of the new left party - a far-left grouping which came out of a merger of a social democratic splinter group and the successor party to the former east german communists - prevents both cdu and spd from securing a majority in the 110-seat state legislature in coalition with their preferred partners , the free-market liberal fdp and the greens respectively .
the left party took home 5.1 percent , the fdp received 9.4 percent and the greens got 7.5 percent . a different case bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : despite nearly 6-point drop in votes , christian wulff will stay in power in lower saxony in another state election , in lower saxony , incumbent cdu premier christian wulff saw his support fall to 42.5 percent from 48.3 percent in 2003 .
unlike in hesse , however , his result is good enough for him to hold on to power in a coalition with the fdp . here the spd scored its worst result in recent years , declining to around 30.3 percent from 33.4 percent in 2003 . in all , some 10.5 million people were eligible to vote in the two western states , in both of which angela merkel 's christian democrats -lrb- cdu -rrb- have put up the premiers for the past five years . a blow for merkel bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel 's support for koch was not enough to help him win the election the setback which the conservatives were dealt in hesse will also be seen as a blow to the chancellor , who stood firmly behind roland koch during the election campaign and repeatedly defended koch 's proposals for tougher measures against young criminals of foreign origin . " in hesse the conservatives have suffered such losses that it is clear that koch 's election campaign has n't worked , " said richard stöss , a political scientist at berlin 's free university . the spd 's ypsilanti , on the other hand , focused in her campaign on the traditional spd themes of wages , education and the integration of minorities .
this has brought the social democrats a gain of almost 8 percent in comparison to the previous state election . the result is likely to create even more tension in the already strained relations between the cdu and spd on the national level , which some fear could result in a political stalemate in the " grand coalition " until the 2009 national elections . an important race bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : incumbent state premier roland koch has divided the nation the state elections in hesse and lower saxony were widely seen as a test of the cdu 's strength ahead of federal elections , which must be held by september 2009 . merkel remains highly popular in germany but faces risks from a slowing economy ahead of next year 's national vote .

after the votes were counted , hesse 's incumbent premier , roland koch , had a hair-thin majority , making uncertain the sort of coalition that could form a government and what role the candidate koch - who had led a controversial , openly xenophobic campaign - could have in it .

bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ypsilanti will likely lead a coalition - but with whom ?
official results from hesse showed the conservative cdu had slumped from a majority in the state legislature to finish only nominally ahead of the center-left social democrats -lrb- spd -rrb- , with the same number of seats .
the spd candidate in hesse , andrea ypsilanti , took 36.7 percent of the vote against the cdu 's 36.8 .
search for a coalition a deputy cdu leader in another state , premier christian wulff of lower saxony , won re-election in a separate vote sunday , despite moderate losses .
the left , a combination of former social democrats and eastern ex-communists , extended its reach in western germany to enter both state parliaments .
but gains for the left party and spd in hesse mean the cdu , together with its planned coalition partner free democrats -lrb- fdp -rrb- , no longer have a large enough majority to rule in the state parliament in wiesbaden .
this gives a clear mandate to the spd to enter the state government in hesse , according to acting spd chairwoman andrea nahles .
voters saw to it that koch took " the most brutal beating possible , " nahles told rbb news radio on monday .
while the spd failed " by a nose " to gain a clear majority , it was clear that the voters in the western state increasingly stood behind the center-left party , and it should therefore be part of the government , she said .
ypsilanti is currently in talks with other party representatives to discuss coalition possibilities .
but nahles reiterated ypsilanti 's campaign promise that her party would not enter into a coalition with the upsurge , far-left left party , saying " the program and the people that they represent in hesse do not stand for stability in government . "
" traffic light " coalition possible ?
meanwhile , spd secretary general hubertus heil called for a " traffic light " coalition to rule hesse , which would be made up of the spd -lrb- red -rrb- , free democrats -lrb- yellow -rrb- and green party , under the leadership of ypsilanti .
" there is a koch-must-go mood -lsb- among voters -rsb- that we have to take into account when making up the government , " heil told zdf television talk show morgenmagazin on monday .
" we will present the premier , i am fairly sure of that , " he said .
yet a parliamentary leader of the fdp from hesse , jörg-uwe hahn , said there is no way that his party would enter into a " traffic light " coalition .
the fdp had planned to be coalition partner with the right-wing cdu , and could not be used as " a training wheel for a red-green " coalition , he told the dpa press agency .
hahn predicted a coalition would form between the spd , greens and the left party .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel 's cdu should avoid negative campaigns , one observer said amid the speculations on a new government , political observers took the time to mull over just what went so very wrong in the campaign of incumbent koch - and what it could mean for the larger question of cdu domination in german politics .
koch faulted for polarizing strategy chemnitz-based election researcher eckhard jesse said the cdu should see the campaign as a powerful lesson . with his polarizing , xenophobic rhetoric about youth-crime , koch led the campaign as if he were an opposition candidate , not an incumbent , jesse told the thüringer allgemeine newspaper .
merkel and other cdu candidates need to draw the conclusion that " they should take the same tact as wulff , " who handily won the state election in lower saxony .
" that means that they should run a low-key , feel-good campaign .
they should n't polarize - especially not the chancellor , " he said .
and political scientist theo schiller said koch had reaped what he sowed from his controversial style .
" if koch had n't focused his campaign on youth crime and young offenders , the results might have been slightly different , " the professor at the university of marburg told dpa .
the results were " catastrophic " for the cdu , he said .
by focusing on youth crime , koch aimed to harm the spd , but instead pilloried his own party , schiller said .
" he raised the question of deficits during the years his own government had ruled , " he said .
and was not able to give any satisfactory answers , he added .
no stopping rise of the left like a number of other german political analysts , schiller saw the left party 's gains as a sign of things to come .
" we can expect the left to enter other state parliaments , " he told dpa .
but he also said he did not see the likelihood of the left entering into a ruling coalition in hesse together with the spd .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de elections -pipe- 28.01.2008 german conservatives suffer losses in key state election großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : andrea ypsilanti brought significant gains to the spd in hesse chancellor merkel 's christian democrats -lrb- cdu -rrb- suffered major losses in a key vote in the state of hesse .
but it 's yet to be seen which party will be able to form a governing coalition . led by merkel ally and incumbent premier roland koch , who ran a controversial campaign focused on crime and immigration , the cdu took 36.8 percent of the vote , down from 48.8 percent in 2003 . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the state election in hesse polarized germans nationwide " we did n't mobilize our own supporters enough , " koch said on public television .
" this is not easily for me personally . " the rival social democrats -lrb- spd -rrb- , who rule together with merkel 's cdu at the national level , saw their support push up to 36.7 percent . " we fought for a different political culture in this country and we won , " said koch 's spd challenger , andrea ypsilanti . it remains unclear , however , which party will take power .
the entry into hesse 's parliament of the new left party - a far-left grouping which came out of a merger of a social democratic splinter group and the successor party to the former east german communists - prevents both cdu and spd from securing a majority in the 110-seat state legislature in coalition with their preferred partners , the free-market liberal fdp and the greens respectively .
the left party took home 5.1 percent , the fdp received 9.4 percent and the greens got 7.5 percent . a different case bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : despite nearly 6-point drop in votes , christian wulff will stay in power in lower saxony in another state election , in lower saxony , incumbent cdu premier christian wulff saw his support fall to 42.5 percent from 48.3 percent in 2003 .
unlike in hesse , however , his result is good enough for him to hold on to power in a coalition with the fdp . here the spd scored its worst result in recent years , declining to around 30.3 percent from 33.4 percent in 2003 . in all , some 10.5 million people were eligible to vote in the two western states , in both of which angela merkel 's christian democrats -lrb- cdu -rrb- have put up the premiers for the past five years . a blow for merkel bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel 's support for koch was not enough to help him win the election the setback which the conservatives were dealt in hesse will also be seen as a blow to the chancellor , who stood firmly behind roland koch during the election campaign and repeatedly defended koch 's proposals for tougher measures against young criminals of foreign origin .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de elections -pipe- 28.01.2008 german conservatives suffer losses in key state election großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : andrea ypsilanti brought significant gains to the spd in hesse chancellor merkel 's christian democrats -lrb- cdu -rrb- suffered major losses in a key vote in the state of hesse .
but it 's yet to be seen which party will be able to form a governing coalition . led by merkel ally and incumbent premier roland koch , who ran a controversial campaign focused on crime and immigration , the cdu took 36.8 percent of the vote , down from 48.8 percent in 2003 . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the state election in hesse polarized germans nationwide " we did n't mobilize our own supporters enough , " koch said on public television .
" this is not easily for me personally . " the rival social democrats -lrb- spd -rrb- , who rule together with merkel 's cdu at the national level , saw their support push up to 36.7 percent . " we fought for a different political culture in this country and we won , " said koch 's spd challenger , andrea ypsilanti . it remains unclear , however , which party will take power .
the entry into hesse 's parliament of the new left party - a far-left grouping which came out of a merger of a social democratic splinter group and the successor party to the former east german communists - prevents both cdu and spd from securing a majority in the 110-seat state legislature in coalition with their preferred partners , the free-market liberal fdp and the greens respectively .
the left party took home 5.1 percent , the fdp received 9.4 percent and the greens got 7.5 percent . a different case bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : despite nearly 6-point drop in votes , christian wulff will stay in power in lower saxony in another state election , in lower saxony , incumbent cdu premier christian wulff saw his support fall to 42.5 percent from 48.3 percent in 2003 .
unlike in hesse , however , his result is good enough for him to hold on to power in a coalition with the fdp . here the spd scored its worst result in recent years , declining to around 30.3 percent from 33.4 percent in 2003 . in all , some 10.5 million people were eligible to vote in the two western states , in both of which angela merkel 's christian democrats -lrb- cdu -rrb- have put up the premiers for the past five years . a blow for merkel bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel 's support for koch was not enough to help him win the election the setback which the conservatives were dealt in hesse will also be seen as a blow to the chancellor , who stood firmly behind roland koch during the election campaign and repeatedly defended koch 's proposals for tougher measures against young criminals of foreign origin . " in hesse the conservatives have suffered such losses that it is clear that koch 's election campaign has n't worked , " said richard stöss , a political scientist at berlin 's free university . the spd 's ypsilanti , on the other hand , focused in her campaign on the traditional spd themes of wages , education and the integration of minorities .
this has brought the social democrats a gain of almost 8 percent in comparison to the previous state election . the result is likely to create even more tension in the already strained relations between the cdu and spd on the national level , which some fear could result in a political stalemate in the " grand coalition " until the 2009 national elections . an important race bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : incumbent state premier roland koch has divided the nation the state elections in hesse and lower saxony were widely seen as a test of the cdu 's strength ahead of federal elections , which must be held by september 2009 . merkel remains highly popular in germany but faces risks from a slowing economy ahead of next year 's national vote . " a loss in hesse would be bad for morale for the cdu nationally and for merkel , " political scientist jürgen falter told the bild am sonntag newspaper . ypsilanti 's victory in hesse could potentially give spd chief kurt beck a boost in his bid to dismantle labor market reforms introduced by merkel 's predecessor gerhard schröder , which are credited with helping to fuel a recovery of europe 's biggest economy . social democrats would also be likely to push harder to create a national minimum wage - a popular proposal that many economists have branded a job killer . the left gaining ground bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : left party candidate in hesse , willi van ooyen the fact that both state elections showed a clear shift to the left - after years in which merkel 's conservatives outperformed the social democrats - is , nonetheless , not all good news for the spd . the left party passed the 5-percent threshold to enter the parliament in both states . it is the first time that the party , led by former finance minister oskar lafontaine , will enter parliament in a large western state . spd officials have so far ruled out any possibility of entering into coalition agreements with the left . dw staff -lrb- tt -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the bundesliga is in danger of turning from a glittering stage into an enticing shop window . while the german top flight has n't ever been exactly below the radar , other european teams looking for new players have given their german counterparts little more than a cursory glance before taking their checkbooks to italy or spain .
more bargain basement than armani or balenciaga , the bundesliga just did n't have the same appeal as serie a or the primera liga . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : diamonds in the rough : luca toni and franck ribery but sew a few diamonds into the cut-price cloth and anyone looking for glamour will certainly spot a sparkle or two .
with the likes of luca toni , franck ribery , rafael van der vaart , miroslav klose and diego lighting up the german league , it was only a matter of time before the big spenders would spot an untapped market . two of the league 's brightest midfield stars top the shoppers ' most-wanted lists .
with the january transfer window closing at the end of the week , werder bremen and hamburg will be bracing themselves for " money 's no object " offers for diego and van der vaart respectively . van der vaart on italian shopping list italian giants juventus are hunting the two mini maestros and while bremen are trying as hard as they can to hang onto their prized brazilian playmaker , hamburg have confirmed they have already spoken to the turin team about a price for their want-away dutchman . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : van der vaart could be turin-bound " we are in discussions with juventus , but we ca n't say more at this stage , " hamburg spokesman jörn wolf recently told german agency sid . van der vaart is under contract until 2010 , but can leave hamburg next year for a fixed transfer fee of 1.5 million euros -lrb- $ 2 million -rrb- , but the 24-year-old is reported to be worth 20 million euros in the current market and hamburg may want to capitalize on that estimation , with spanish giants barcelona also interested in the diminutive dutchman . the midfielder , who made a shock move to the bundesliga from ajax in 2005 when everyone expected him to land in spain or italy , paved the way for other big names to come to the bundesliga .
his exit may prompt a similar spate of transfers in the opposite direction . diego coveted by europe 's biggest clubs diego , meanwhile , is being fiercely protected in bremen with juventus , inter milan , real madrid and chelsea all reportedly circling the weserstadion in search of his signature on the dotted line . despite juventus coach claudio ranieri 's desire to see diego play at the stadio olimpico di torino , it will take more than covetous comments to spirit werder 's top scorer away . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : diego has let his feet do the talking at bremen " there is no inquiry from juventus , and we will not talk with any clubs about signing diego , he is a firm part of our plans , " said werder 's director of sport klaus allofs , who reminded potential suitors that the brazilian is contracted until june 2011 . the reported visit of juve 's sporting director , alessio secco , to bremen last week fuelled the rumors further but diego is expected to turn out for bremen against bochum on sunday , ending the speculation - until the summer at least . bayern pair linked to premiership switch other names linked with a move away from the bundesliga this month have been bayern munich colleagues lukas podolski and daniel van buyten . podolski has been dogged by a loss of form and a series of niggling injuries since arriving at the allianz arena from fc köln in 2006 .
with the acquisition of strike partners klose and toni last summer , podolski slipped further down the pecking order , prompting a number of audacious attempts from english premiership side manchester city to sign the striker in the last few weeks . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : poldi has been the subject of frenzied transfer speculation however , the bayern higher-ups have put their foot down and have said that prinz poldi is going nowhere . " i had a very good discussion with lukas and made it clear to him he can not leave bayern , because we need him for the future , " said karl-heinz rummenigge .
" we are convinced of his quality and we are looking forward to seeing him in action again . " van buyten has been the subject of speculation ever since the bundesliga paused for the winter break with scottish champions celtic and premiership club newcastle united keen to take the defender back to the uk .
the belgian international played under new newcastle coach kevin keegan at manchester city in 2004 and has said he would be open to working with the coach again . brazilian defenders looking for pastures new bayern could also be close to losing veteran defender lucio .
the brazilian told deutsche welle last month that it was his dream to play in either italy or spain and that he hoped that he could make that dream come true before the end of his contract in 2010 . " i dream about spain and italy , " he said .
" perhaps my dream can come true a bit earlier if i can come to an agreement with the club . " another brazilian on the verge of leaving the bundesliga appears to be hertha berlin 's gilberto .

27 , many in the german press commented on the difference in conservative campaigns and what the results meant for the future of angela merkel 's party . the frankfurter rundschau wrote that incumbent premier roland koch has no one to blame but himself for the result in hesse .
" koch chose the wrong topic to champion and led the wrong election campaign , " it stated .
" he set himself up by making strong announcements which contradicted his own actions .
the public noticed that calls for swift justice from the state with the slowest judicial system in the country were implausible , and they have punished koch for this . "
the paper continued by saying that koch 's losses were also angela merkel 's losses .
" the chancellor supported this tough election campaign , " it wrote , " and now the conservatives must ask whether her governance endangers the future of the -lsb- christian democratic -rsb- union . " the bremer nachrichten pondered the consequences of the state elections for the chancellor and the cdu 's coming parliamentary election campaign .
" which way now for angela merkel ? " the paper asked .
" not only is it that social democrats -lsb- spd -rsb- must find their direction but also the conservatives .
should she take the careful approach or come out fighting like roland koch ?
reading the results from lower saxony and hesse , the decision should be clear . " " rambo koch loses , cuddly wulff wins , " stated the westdeutsche allgemeine zeitung .
" koch 's campaign failed because it focused on his weaknesses not his strengths .
there was no policy substance to his rhetoric and such a thing costs credibility , especially when policy is so important and at a time when the voters look for strong policies not just words . " the thüringer allgemeine zeitung also focused on koch 's performance .
" koch has abandoned his instincts and abandoned the voters , " it wrote .
" that the electorate reacted against this is a good thing .
it would be an ominous sign for the political culture in germany if the people had allowed themselves to have been manipulated by such a campaign .
the majority of people in hesse recognized that sloganeering is not the right approach to the multi-layered subject of juvenile delinquency .
this is why christian wulff , with his low-key election campaign , ran to a clear victory . " the stuttgarter zeitung also picked up on the differences in the conservative candidates ' approaches and results .
" the one winner in the state elections this sunday is christian wulff , which is not so surprising given the weakness of his social democratic spd opponent wolfgang jüttner , " the paper wrote .
the paper acknowledged , however , that despite the spd 's ineptitude , wulff led a winning campaign without the need to resort to the strong-arm tactics and verbal failures of his hessian colleague roland koch .
the paper suggested that wulff should be considered the heir apparent to chancellor merkel and that his victory should signal a rise in his profile within the cdu . the spd 's inability to force home a clear advantage in the state elections was also picked up on by the rhein-neckar zeitung .
" the state elections were less about regional politics and more about the performances of the candidates , " it wrote .
" the most significant signal was the fact that spd leader kurt beck could not lead a socialist election campaign which was better than that fought by the left party . "
the paper also wrote that roland koch 's performance and the chancellor 's support of his campaign should be a wake-up call to merkel , who the paper suggested should follow christian wulff 's approach , and not koch 's , in the future . the frankfurter allgemeine zeitung also lamented the state of german politics highlighted by the inability of the social democrats to capitalize on weakened and disliked conservative candidates .
the paper complained that a weak and directionless spd made the conservatives look good , despite their own poor showing .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de elections -pipe- 28.01.2008 german conservatives suffer losses in key state election großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : andrea ypsilanti brought significant gains to the spd in hesse chancellor merkel 's christian democrats -lrb- cdu -rrb- suffered major losses in a key vote in the state of hesse .
but it 's yet to be seen which party will be able to form a governing coalition . led by merkel ally and incumbent premier roland koch , who ran a controversial campaign focused on crime and immigration , the cdu took 36.8 percent of the vote , down from 48.8 percent in 2003 . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the state election in hesse polarized germans nationwide " we did n't mobilize our own supporters enough , " koch said on public television .
" this is not easily for me personally . " the rival social democrats -lrb- spd -rrb- , who rule together with merkel 's cdu at the national level , saw their support push up to 36.7 percent . " we fought for a different political culture in this country and we won , " said koch 's spd challenger , andrea ypsilanti . it remains unclear , however , which party will take power .
the entry into hesse 's parliament of the new left party - a far-left grouping which came out of a merger of a social democratic splinter group and the successor party to the former east german communists - prevents both cdu and spd from securing a majority in the 110-seat state legislature in coalition with their preferred partners , the free-market liberal fdp and the greens respectively .
the left party took home 5.1 percent , the fdp received 9.4 percent and the greens got 7.5 percent . a different case bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : despite nearly 6-point drop in votes , christian wulff will stay in power in lower saxony in another state election , in lower saxony , incumbent cdu premier christian wulff saw his support fall to 42.5 percent from 48.3 percent in 2003 .
unlike in hesse , however , his result is good enough for him to hold on to power in a coalition with the fdp . here the spd scored its worst result in recent years , declining to around 30.3 percent from 33.4 percent in 2003 . in all , some 10.5 million people were eligible to vote in the two western states , in both of which angela merkel 's christian democrats -lrb- cdu -rrb- have put up the premiers for the past five years . a blow for merkel bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel 's support for koch was not enough to help him win the election the setback which the conservatives were dealt in hesse will also be seen as a blow to the chancellor , who stood firmly behind roland koch during the election campaign and repeatedly defended koch 's proposals for tougher measures against young criminals of foreign origin . " in hesse the conservatives have suffered such losses that it is clear that koch 's election campaign has n't worked , " said richard stöss , a political scientist at berlin 's free university . the spd 's ypsilanti , on the other hand , focused in her campaign on the traditional spd themes of wages , education and the integration of minorities .
this has brought the social democrats a gain of almost 8 percent in comparison to the previous state election . the result is likely to create even more tension in the already strained relations between the cdu and spd on the national level , which some fear could result in a political stalemate in the " grand coalition " until the 2009 national elections . an important race bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : incumbent state premier roland koch has divided the nation the state elections in hesse and lower saxony were widely seen as a test of the cdu 's strength ahead of federal elections , which must be held by september 2009 . merkel remains highly popular in germany but faces risks from a slowing economy ahead of next year 's national vote . " a loss in hesse would be bad for morale for the cdu nationally and for merkel , " political scientist jürgen falter told the bild am sonntag newspaper . ypsilanti 's victory in hesse could potentially give spd chief kurt beck a boost in his bid to dismantle labor market reforms introduced by merkel 's predecessor gerhard schröder , which are credited with helping to fuel a recovery of europe 's biggest economy . social democrats would also be likely to push harder to create a national minimum wage - a popular proposal that many economists have branded a job killer . the left gaining ground bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : left party candidate in hesse , willi van ooyen the fact that both state elections showed a clear shift to the left - after years in which merkel 's conservatives outperformed the social democrats - is , nonetheless , not all good news for the spd . the left party passed the 5-percent threshold to enter the parliament in both states . it is the first time that the party , led by former finance minister oskar lafontaine , will enter parliament in a large western state . spd officials have so far ruled out any possibility of entering into coalition agreements with the left . dw staff -lrb- tt -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" the bremer nachrichten pondered the consequences of the state elections for the chancellor and the cdu 's coming parliamentary election campaign .
" which way now for angela merkel ? " the paper asked .
" not only is it that social democrats -lsb- spd -rsb- must find their direction but also the conservatives .
should she take the careful approach or come out fighting like roland koch ?
reading the results from lower saxony and hesse , the decision should be clear . " " rambo koch loses , cuddly wulff wins , " stated the westdeutsche allgemeine zeitung .
" koch 's campaign failed because it focused on his weaknesses not his strengths .
there was no policy substance to his rhetoric and such a thing costs credibility , especially when policy is so important and at a time when the voters look for strong policies not just words . " the thüringer allgemeine zeitung also focused on koch 's performance .
" koch has abandoned his instincts and abandoned the voters , " it wrote .
" that the electorate reacted against this is a good thing .
it would be an ominous sign for the political culture in germany if the people had allowed themselves to have been manipulated by such a campaign .
the majority of people in hesse recognized that sloganeering is not the right approach to the multi-layered subject of juvenile delinquency .
this is why christian wulff , with his low-key election campaign , ran to a clear victory . " the stuttgarter zeitung also picked up on the differences in the conservative candidates ' approaches and results .
" the one winner in the state elections this sunday is christian wulff , which is not so surprising given the weakness of his social democratic spd opponent wolfgang jüttner , " the paper wrote .
the paper acknowledged , however , that despite the spd 's ineptitude , wulff led a winning campaign without the need to resort to the strong-arm tactics and verbal failures of his hessian colleague roland koch .
the paper suggested that wulff should be considered the heir apparent to chancellor merkel and that his victory should signal a rise in his profile within the cdu . the spd 's inability to force home a clear advantage in the state elections was also picked up on by the rhein-neckar zeitung .
" the state elections were less about regional politics and more about the performances of the candidates , " it wrote .
" the most significant signal was the fact that spd leader kurt beck could not lead a socialist election campaign which was better than that fought by the left party . "
the paper also wrote that roland koch 's performance and the chancellor 's support of his campaign should be a wake-up call to merkel , who the paper suggested should follow christian wulff 's approach , and not koch 's , in the future . the frankfurter allgemeine zeitung also lamented the state of german politics highlighted by the inability of the social democrats to capitalize on weakened and disliked conservative candidates .
the paper complained that a weak and directionless spd made the conservatives look good , despite their own poor showing .
" we now know the weaknesses of the spd , " it wrote , " poor in candidates and poor in profile … one wonders how the cdu would have responded to a stronger opponent .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de europe -pipe- 28.01.2008 belgium 's german minority mostly unmoved by autonomy debate großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the belgian unity question centers on flanders and wallonia and neglects other regions the belgian interim government may have silenced separatist rhetoric for now but the divisive problems have not gone away .
the country 's german-speaking minority is maintaining a low profile in the debate . the debate concerning the political crisis in belgium and the unlikely , yet much discussed , possibility of the country splitting , has focused firmly on the disagreements between the two main linguistic areas , french-speaking wallonia and flemish-speaking flanders .
though these two areas are the largest in terms of size , and also importance when it comes to deciding policies which affect the whole country , belgium has in fact been divided into four linguistic regions since the early 1960s .
besides wallonia in the south and flanders in the north , there is the bilingual brussels capital region and the tiny german-speaking area in the east cantons .
while brussels is sometimes left out of the debate over belgium 's future - due mainly to its bilingualism , its self-sufficiency and its status as an international city - the east cantons seem to be ignored altogether when it comes to discussing the linguistic and cultural divide .
a region of 854 square kilometers -lrb- 530 square miles -rrb- with a population of over 73,000 , of which almost 100 percent are german speaking , the east cantons can quite easily be overlooked in belgium 's controversial situation .
the juicy arguments and stubborn nationalist positions of the more powerful flemings and walloons make for far better headlines than a quirky little germanic outpost on the far eastern border .
similar challenges and yet , the german-speaking community of the east cantons , as a linguistic minority within the federal state of belgium , faces similar challenges to those causing strife between " the big two . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the seat of german-speaking power is based in eupen granted internal rule in 1973 , the region has its own parliament in the capital of eupen and control over linguistic and cultural matters .
the parliament organizes elections , supervises the regional government , and adopts decrees for the german-speaking community .
the east cantons also have committees charged with governing areas such as education , social policy , health and employment .
despite this illusion of self-rule , however , the region still remains part of french-speaking wallonia , located as it is in the province of liege , and is therefore kept under the watchful eye of the wallon parliament .
it is not surprising that there are some in the east cantons who have themselves expressed a desire for the kind of autonomy favored by the more extreme elements on either side of the main linguistic divide .
a small but growing number have been voicing their support for an independent mini-state .
as is the case in the rest of the country , this is not a view shared by the whole population of the east cantons .
to get an idea how the german-speaking region and its people view their role in the wider belgian community , dw-world.de talked to jean-claude franken , the secretary of the german-speaking community 's christian social party -lrb- csp -rrb- , a cooperation partner of the francophone humanist democratic center -lrb- cdh -rrb- in the belgian parliament .
dw-world.de : is belgium 's german-speaking minority well integrated ?
jean-claude franken : the german-speaking minority is integrated in the belgian federal state very well .
there are special laws within the belgian constitution that protect the german-speaking community here .
how much power does the german-speaking minority have in belgium ?
the german-speaking community is an equal partner in the belgian federal state .
that is because there is no favoritism towards any of the linguistic minorities in the country in terms of the divulgence of power .
in the federal government , of course , the larger regions have the biggest political parties and therefore more seats in parliament , but our cooperation with the cdh allows us to have our say as part of wallonia .
in regional terms , the parties within the east canton - the csp , the socialist party , the party for freedom and progress and the party for german-speaking belgians - ensure that the autonomy we enjoy is used to make the community as self-reliant and efficient as possible .
does the german-speaking minority in belgium consider itself german or belgian ?
in former times , the region was part of prussia and therefore a small part of germany .
during world war ii , it was annexed again by germany after being part of belgium since the end of the great war .
when the east canton was returned to belgium once more in 1945 , some who lived there regretted this and wanted to stay german ; these were the same people who welcomed the occupying nazi forces .
however , as belgium has grown as a nation of diversity and understanding , the german-speaking community has become very integrated in the country and contact with out neighboring regions has increased over the years .
as a result , the german speakers consider themselves to be fully-fledged belgians and are accepted as such by their flemish and walloon compatriots .
could the german-speaking area support itself if belgium separated ?
if not , would it consider joining another region or hope to become part of germany again ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : lambertz has spoken of his support for regional autonomy the question of splitting belgium is a moot point .
it wo n't happen .
but for the sake of argument , despite its current state of stable and competent government , the german-speaking community would struggle to support itself in this hypothetical scenario and would have to join either wallonia or another state area .
there are some who push for this in the german-speaking community .
the current premier karl-heinz lambertz of the socialist party is one of the most prominent proponents of this idea .
these people say , as do the flemish , that wallonia is too much of a burden with its financial and social problems .
lambertz and others want a full transfer of powers from wallonia to the german-speaking parliament resulting in full regional autonomy .
is the cultural identity of the german-speaking minority strong ?
how is it protected ?
the cultural identity of the german speakers is deeply rooted .
our culture expresses itself in the german language spoken by the region 's people , the traditions that remain strong there and the creative and artistic expression in the region .
the position of the german-speaking community in the belgian federal state and its culture is protected by law in the constitution .
there are no worries within the community that the cultural identity of the german-speaking minority is under threat in belgium or by any policy of enlargement or expansion from the european union .
is the german-speaking minority in belgium influenced by the decisions of the european union ?
of course .
the eu has an influence on all countries which are member states , and that of course means that those people and minorities in those member states are influenced by eu policy .
the difference is that , unlike some minorities across europe , the german-speaking community does not fear these policies but welcomes them . nick amies send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de players -pipe- 28.01.2008 europe 's big spenders track bundesliga stars großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : this season 's hottest items : werder bremen 's diego and hamburg 's van der vaart as many of europe 's top leagues face a frantic week of dealing before the january transfer window closes , the continent 's big spenders are looking to come to germany for some last minute shopping . the bundesliga may be enjoying its most glamorous season in years thanks to the international stars who have chosen to ply their trade in germany , but question remains as to how long it can maintain its new celebrity status . while the big names and transfer coups have turned the media spotlight on german soccer in a way previously thought beyond its means , the downside of this attention is becoming obvious .
the bundesliga is in danger of turning from a glittering stage into an enticing shop window . while the german top flight has n't ever been exactly below the radar , other european teams looking for new players have given their german counterparts little more than a cursory glance before taking their checkbooks to italy or spain .
more bargain basement than armani or balenciaga , the bundesliga just did n't have the same appeal as serie a or the primera liga . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : diamonds in the rough : luca toni and franck ribery but sew a few diamonds into the cut-price cloth and anyone looking for glamour will certainly spot a sparkle or two .
with the likes of luca toni , franck ribery , rafael van der vaart , miroslav klose and diego lighting up the german league , it was only a matter of time before the big spenders would spot an untapped market . two of the league 's brightest midfield stars top the shoppers ' most-wanted lists .
with the january transfer window closing at the end of the week , werder bremen and hamburg will be bracing themselves for " money 's no object " offers for diego and van der vaart respectively . van der vaart on italian shopping list italian giants juventus are hunting the two mini maestros and while bremen are trying as hard as they can to hang onto their prized brazilian playmaker , hamburg have confirmed they have already spoken to the turin team about a price for their want-away dutchman . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : van der vaart could be turin-bound " we are in discussions with juventus , but we ca n't say more at this stage , " hamburg spokesman jörn wolf recently told german agency sid . van der vaart is under contract until 2010 , but can leave hamburg next year for a fixed transfer fee of 1.5 million euros -lrb- $ 2 million -rrb- , but the 24-year-old is reported to be worth 20 million euros in the current market and hamburg may want to capitalize on that estimation , with spanish giants barcelona also interested in the diminutive dutchman . the midfielder , who made a shock move to the bundesliga from ajax in 2005 when everyone expected him to land in spain or italy , paved the way for other big names to come to the bundesliga .
his exit may prompt a similar spate of transfers in the opposite direction . diego coveted by europe 's biggest clubs diego , meanwhile , is being fiercely protected in bremen with juventus , inter milan , real madrid and chelsea all reportedly circling the weserstadion in search of his signature on the dotted line . despite juventus coach claudio ranieri 's desire to see diego play at the stadio olimpico di torino , it will take more than covetous comments to spirit werder 's top scorer away . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : diego has let his feet do the talking at bremen " there is no inquiry from juventus , and we will not talk with any clubs about signing diego , he is a firm part of our plans , " said werder 's director of sport klaus allofs , who reminded potential suitors that the brazilian is contracted until june 2011 . the reported visit of juve 's sporting director , alessio secco , to bremen last week fuelled the rumors further but diego is expected to turn out for bremen against bochum on sunday , ending the speculation - until the summer at least . bayern pair linked to premiership switch other names linked with a move away from the bundesliga this month have been bayern munich colleagues lukas podolski and daniel van buyten . podolski has been dogged by a loss of form and a series of niggling injuries since arriving at the allianz arena from fc köln in 2006 .
with the acquisition of strike partners klose and toni last summer , podolski slipped further down the pecking order , prompting a number of audacious attempts from english premiership side manchester city to sign the striker in the last few weeks . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : poldi has been the subject of frenzied transfer speculation however , the bayern higher-ups have put their foot down and have said that prinz poldi is going nowhere . " i had a very good discussion with lukas and made it clear to him he can not leave bayern , because we need him for the future , " said karl-heinz rummenigge .
" we are convinced of his quality and we are looking forward to seeing him in action again . " van buyten has been the subject of speculation ever since the bundesliga paused for the winter break with scottish champions celtic and premiership club newcastle united keen to take the defender back to the uk .
the belgian international played under new newcastle coach kevin keegan at manchester city in 2004 and has said he would be open to working with the coach again . brazilian defenders looking for pastures new bayern could also be close to losing veteran defender lucio .
the brazilian told deutsche welle last month that it was his dream to play in either italy or spain and that he hoped that he could make that dream come true before the end of his contract in 2010 . " i dream about spain and italy , " he said .

but it 's yet to be seen which party will be able to form a governing coalition . led by merkel ally and incumbent premier roland koch , who ran a controversial campaign focused on crime and immigration , the cdu took 36.8 percent of the vote , down from 48.8 percent in 2003 . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the state election in hesse polarized germans nationwide " we did n't mobilize our own supporters enough , " koch said on public television .
" this is not easily for me personally . " the rival social democrats -lrb- spd -rrb- , who rule together with merkel 's cdu at the national level , saw their support push up to 36.7 percent . " we fought for a different political culture in this country and we won , " said koch 's spd challenger , andrea ypsilanti . it remains unclear , however , which party will take power .
the entry into hesse 's parliament of the new left party - a far-left grouping which came out of a merger of a social democratic splinter group and the successor party to the former east german communists - prevents both cdu and spd from securing a majority in the 110-seat state legislature in coalition with their preferred partners , the free-market liberal fdp and the greens respectively .
the left party took home 5.1 percent , the fdp received 9.4 percent and the greens got 7.5 percent . a different case bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : despite nearly 6-point drop in votes , christian wulff will stay in power in lower saxony in another state election , in lower saxony , incumbent cdu premier christian wulff saw his support fall to 42.5 percent from 48.3 percent in 2003 .
unlike in hesse , however , his result is good enough for him to hold on to power in a coalition with the fdp . here the spd scored its worst result in recent years , declining to around 30.3 percent from 33.4 percent in 2003 . in all , some 10.5 million people were eligible to vote in the two western states , in both of which angela merkel 's christian democrats -lrb- cdu -rrb- have put up the premiers for the past five years . a blow for merkel bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel 's support for koch was not enough to help him win the election the setback which the conservatives were dealt in hesse will also be seen as a blow to the chancellor , who stood firmly behind roland koch during the election campaign and repeatedly defended koch 's proposals for tougher measures against young criminals of foreign origin . " in hesse the conservatives have suffered such losses that it is clear that koch 's election campaign has n't worked , " said richard stöss , a political scientist at berlin 's free university . the spd 's ypsilanti , on the other hand , focused in her campaign on the traditional spd themes of wages , education and the integration of minorities .
this has brought the social democrats a gain of almost 8 percent in comparison to the previous state election . the result is likely to create even more tension in the already strained relations between the cdu and spd on the national level , which some fear could result in a political stalemate in the " grand coalition " until the 2009 national elections . an important race bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : incumbent state premier roland koch has divided the nation the state elections in hesse and lower saxony were widely seen as a test of the cdu 's strength ahead of federal elections , which must be held by september 2009 . merkel remains highly popular in germany but faces risks from a slowing economy ahead of next year 's national vote . " a loss in hesse would be bad for morale for the cdu nationally and for merkel , " political scientist jürgen falter told the bild am sonntag newspaper . ypsilanti 's victory in hesse could potentially give spd chief kurt beck a boost in his bid to dismantle labor market reforms introduced by merkel 's predecessor gerhard schröder , which are credited with helping to fuel a recovery of europe 's biggest economy . social democrats would also be likely to push harder to create a national minimum wage - a popular proposal that many economists have branded a job killer . the left gaining ground bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : left party candidate in hesse , willi van ooyen the fact that both state elections showed a clear shift to the left - after years in which merkel 's conservatives outperformed the social democrats - is , nonetheless , not all good news for the spd . the left party passed the 5-percent threshold to enter the parliament in both states . it is the first time that the party , led by former finance minister oskar lafontaine , will enter parliament in a large western state . spd officials have so far ruled out any possibility of entering into coalition agreements with the left . dw staff -lrb- tt -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de europe -pipe- 28.01.2008 belgium 's german minority mostly unmoved by autonomy debate großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the belgian unity question centers on flanders and wallonia and neglects other regions the belgian interim government may have silenced separatist rhetoric for now but the divisive problems have not gone away .
the country 's german-speaking minority is maintaining a low profile in the debate . the debate concerning the political crisis in belgium and the unlikely , yet much discussed , possibility of the country splitting , has focused firmly on the disagreements between the two main linguistic areas , french-speaking wallonia and flemish-speaking flanders .
though these two areas are the largest in terms of size , and also importance when it comes to deciding policies which affect the whole country , belgium has in fact been divided into four linguistic regions since the early 1960s .
besides wallonia in the south and flanders in the north , there is the bilingual brussels capital region and the tiny german-speaking area in the east cantons .
while brussels is sometimes left out of the debate over belgium 's future - due mainly to its bilingualism , its self-sufficiency and its status as an international city - the east cantons seem to be ignored altogether when it comes to discussing the linguistic and cultural divide .
a region of 854 square kilometers -lrb- 530 square miles -rrb- with a population of over 73,000 , of which almost 100 percent are german speaking , the east cantons can quite easily be overlooked in belgium 's controversial situation .
the juicy arguments and stubborn nationalist positions of the more powerful flemings and walloons make for far better headlines than a quirky little germanic outpost on the far eastern border .
similar challenges and yet , the german-speaking community of the east cantons , as a linguistic minority within the federal state of belgium , faces similar challenges to those causing strife between " the big two . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the seat of german-speaking power is based in eupen granted internal rule in 1973 , the region has its own parliament in the capital of eupen and control over linguistic and cultural matters .
the parliament organizes elections , supervises the regional government , and adopts decrees for the german-speaking community .
the east cantons also have committees charged with governing areas such as education , social policy , health and employment .
despite this illusion of self-rule , however , the region still remains part of french-speaking wallonia , located as it is in the province of liege , and is therefore kept under the watchful eye of the wallon parliament .
it is not surprising that there are some in the east cantons who have themselves expressed a desire for the kind of autonomy favored by the more extreme elements on either side of the main linguistic divide .
a small but growing number have been voicing their support for an independent mini-state .
as is the case in the rest of the country , this is not a view shared by the whole population of the east cantons .
to get an idea how the german-speaking region and its people view their role in the wider belgian community , dw-world.de talked to jean-claude franken , the secretary of the german-speaking community 's christian social party -lrb- csp -rrb- , a cooperation partner of the francophone humanist democratic center -lrb- cdh -rrb- in the belgian parliament .
dw-world.de : is belgium 's german-speaking minority well integrated ?
jean-claude franken : the german-speaking minority is integrated in the belgian federal state very well .
there are special laws within the belgian constitution that protect the german-speaking community here .
how much power does the german-speaking minority have in belgium ?
the german-speaking community is an equal partner in the belgian federal state .
that is because there is no favoritism towards any of the linguistic minorities in the country in terms of the divulgence of power .
in the federal government , of course , the larger regions have the biggest political parties and therefore more seats in parliament , but our cooperation with the cdh allows us to have our say as part of wallonia .
in regional terms , the parties within the east canton - the csp , the socialist party , the party for freedom and progress and the party for german-speaking belgians - ensure that the autonomy we enjoy is used to make the community as self-reliant and efficient as possible .
does the german-speaking minority in belgium consider itself german or belgian ?
in former times , the region was part of prussia and therefore a small part of germany .
during world war ii , it was annexed again by germany after being part of belgium since the end of the great war .
when the east canton was returned to belgium once more in 1945 , some who lived there regretted this and wanted to stay german ; these were the same people who welcomed the occupying nazi forces .
however , as belgium has grown as a nation of diversity and understanding , the german-speaking community has become very integrated in the country and contact with out neighboring regions has increased over the years .
as a result , the german speakers consider themselves to be fully-fledged belgians and are accepted as such by their flemish and walloon compatriots .
could the german-speaking area support itself if belgium separated ?
if not , would it consider joining another region or hope to become part of germany again ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : lambertz has spoken of his support for regional autonomy the question of splitting belgium is a moot point .
it wo n't happen .
but for the sake of argument , despite its current state of stable and competent government , the german-speaking community would struggle to support itself in this hypothetical scenario and would have to join either wallonia or another state area .
there are some who push for this in the german-speaking community .
the current premier karl-heinz lambertz of the socialist party is one of the most prominent proponents of this idea .
these people say , as do the flemish , that wallonia is too much of a burden with its financial and social problems .
lambertz and others want a full transfer of powers from wallonia to the german-speaking parliament resulting in full regional autonomy .
is the cultural identity of the german-speaking minority strong ?
how is it protected ?
the cultural identity of the german speakers is deeply rooted .
our culture expresses itself in the german language spoken by the region 's people , the traditions that remain strong there and the creative and artistic expression in the region .

the country 's german-speaking minority is maintaining a low profile in the debate . the debate concerning the political crisis in belgium and the unlikely , yet much discussed , possibility of the country splitting , has focused firmly on the disagreements between the two main linguistic areas , french-speaking wallonia and flemish-speaking flanders .
though these two areas are the largest in terms of size , and also importance when it comes to deciding policies which affect the whole country , belgium has in fact been divided into four linguistic regions since the early 1960s .
besides wallonia in the south and flanders in the north , there is the bilingual brussels capital region and the tiny german-speaking area in the east cantons .
while brussels is sometimes left out of the debate over belgium 's future - due mainly to its bilingualism , its self-sufficiency and its status as an international city - the east cantons seem to be ignored altogether when it comes to discussing the linguistic and cultural divide .
a region of 854 square kilometers -lrb- 530 square miles -rrb- with a population of over 73,000 , of which almost 100 percent are german speaking , the east cantons can quite easily be overlooked in belgium 's controversial situation .
the juicy arguments and stubborn nationalist positions of the more powerful flemings and walloons make for far better headlines than a quirky little germanic outpost on the far eastern border .
similar challenges and yet , the german-speaking community of the east cantons , as a linguistic minority within the federal state of belgium , faces similar challenges to those causing strife between " the big two . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the seat of german-speaking power is based in eupen granted internal rule in 1973 , the region has its own parliament in the capital of eupen and control over linguistic and cultural matters .
the parliament organizes elections , supervises the regional government , and adopts decrees for the german-speaking community .
the east cantons also have committees charged with governing areas such as education , social policy , health and employment .
despite this illusion of self-rule , however , the region still remains part of french-speaking wallonia , located as it is in the province of liege , and is therefore kept under the watchful eye of the wallon parliament .
it is not surprising that there are some in the east cantons who have themselves expressed a desire for the kind of autonomy favored by the more extreme elements on either side of the main linguistic divide .
a small but growing number have been voicing their support for an independent mini-state .
as is the case in the rest of the country , this is not a view shared by the whole population of the east cantons .
to get an idea how the german-speaking region and its people view their role in the wider belgian community , dw-world.de talked to jean-claude franken , the secretary of the german-speaking community 's christian social party -lrb- csp -rrb- , a cooperation partner of the francophone humanist democratic center -lrb- cdh -rrb- in the belgian parliament .
dw-world.de : is belgium 's german-speaking minority well integrated ?
jean-claude franken : the german-speaking minority is integrated in the belgian federal state very well .
there are special laws within the belgian constitution that protect the german-speaking community here .
how much power does the german-speaking minority have in belgium ?
the german-speaking community is an equal partner in the belgian federal state .
that is because there is no favoritism towards any of the linguistic minorities in the country in terms of the divulgence of power .
in the federal government , of course , the larger regions have the biggest political parties and therefore more seats in parliament , but our cooperation with the cdh allows us to have our say as part of wallonia .
in regional terms , the parties within the east canton - the csp , the socialist party , the party for freedom and progress and the party for german-speaking belgians - ensure that the autonomy we enjoy is used to make the community as self-reliant and efficient as possible .
does the german-speaking minority in belgium consider itself german or belgian ?
in former times , the region was part of prussia and therefore a small part of germany .
during world war ii , it was annexed again by germany after being part of belgium since the end of the great war .
when the east canton was returned to belgium once more in 1945 , some who lived there regretted this and wanted to stay german ; these were the same people who welcomed the occupying nazi forces .
however , as belgium has grown as a nation of diversity and understanding , the german-speaking community has become very integrated in the country and contact with out neighboring regions has increased over the years .
as a result , the german speakers consider themselves to be fully-fledged belgians and are accepted as such by their flemish and walloon compatriots .
could the german-speaking area support itself if belgium separated ?
if not , would it consider joining another region or hope to become part of germany again ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : lambertz has spoken of his support for regional autonomy the question of splitting belgium is a moot point .
it wo n't happen .
but for the sake of argument , despite its current state of stable and competent government , the german-speaking community would struggle to support itself in this hypothetical scenario and would have to join either wallonia or another state area .
there are some who push for this in the german-speaking community .
the current premier karl-heinz lambertz of the socialist party is one of the most prominent proponents of this idea .
these people say , as do the flemish , that wallonia is too much of a burden with its financial and social problems .
lambertz and others want a full transfer of powers from wallonia to the german-speaking parliament resulting in full regional autonomy .
is the cultural identity of the german-speaking minority strong ?
how is it protected ?
the cultural identity of the german speakers is deeply rooted .
our culture expresses itself in the german language spoken by the region 's people , the traditions that remain strong there and the creative and artistic expression in the region .
the position of the german-speaking community in the belgian federal state and its culture is protected by law in the constitution .
there are no worries within the community that the cultural identity of the german-speaking minority is under threat in belgium or by any policy of enlargement or expansion from the european union .

the country 's german-speaking minority is maintaining a low profile in the debate . the debate concerning the political crisis in belgium and the unlikely , yet much discussed , possibility of the country splitting , has focused firmly on the disagreements between the two main linguistic areas , french-speaking wallonia and flemish-speaking flanders .
though these two areas are the largest in terms of size , and also importance when it comes to deciding policies which affect the whole country , belgium has in fact been divided into four linguistic regions since the early 1960s .
besides wallonia in the south and flanders in the north , there is the bilingual brussels capital region and the tiny german-speaking area in the east cantons .
while brussels is sometimes left out of the debate over belgium 's future - due mainly to its bilingualism , its self-sufficiency and its status as an international city - the east cantons seem to be ignored altogether when it comes to discussing the linguistic and cultural divide .
a region of 854 square kilometers -lrb- 530 square miles -rrb- with a population of over 73,000 , of which almost 100 percent are german speaking , the east cantons can quite easily be overlooked in belgium 's controversial situation .
the juicy arguments and stubborn nationalist positions of the more powerful flemings and walloons make for far better headlines than a quirky little germanic outpost on the far eastern border .
similar challenges and yet , the german-speaking community of the east cantons , as a linguistic minority within the federal state of belgium , faces similar challenges to those causing strife between " the big two . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the seat of german-speaking power is based in eupen granted internal rule in 1973 , the region has its own parliament in the capital of eupen and control over linguistic and cultural matters .
the parliament organizes elections , supervises the regional government , and adopts decrees for the german-speaking community .
the east cantons also have committees charged with governing areas such as education , social policy , health and employment .
despite this illusion of self-rule , however , the region still remains part of french-speaking wallonia , located as it is in the province of liege , and is therefore kept under the watchful eye of the wallon parliament .
it is not surprising that there are some in the east cantons who have themselves expressed a desire for the kind of autonomy favored by the more extreme elements on either side of the main linguistic divide .
a small but growing number have been voicing their support for an independent mini-state .
as is the case in the rest of the country , this is not a view shared by the whole population of the east cantons .
to get an idea how the german-speaking region and its people view their role in the wider belgian community , dw-world.de talked to jean-claude franken , the secretary of the german-speaking community 's christian social party -lrb- csp -rrb- , a cooperation partner of the francophone humanist democratic center -lrb- cdh -rrb- in the belgian parliament .
dw-world.de : is belgium 's german-speaking minority well integrated ?
jean-claude franken : the german-speaking minority is integrated in the belgian federal state very well .
there are special laws within the belgian constitution that protect the german-speaking community here .
how much power does the german-speaking minority have in belgium ?
the german-speaking community is an equal partner in the belgian federal state .
that is because there is no favoritism towards any of the linguistic minorities in the country in terms of the divulgence of power .
in the federal government , of course , the larger regions have the biggest political parties and therefore more seats in parliament , but our cooperation with the cdh allows us to have our say as part of wallonia .
in regional terms , the parties within the east canton - the csp , the socialist party , the party for freedom and progress and the party for german-speaking belgians - ensure that the autonomy we enjoy is used to make the community as self-reliant and efficient as possible .
does the german-speaking minority in belgium consider itself german or belgian ?
in former times , the region was part of prussia and therefore a small part of germany .
during world war ii , it was annexed again by germany after being part of belgium since the end of the great war .
when the east canton was returned to belgium once more in 1945 , some who lived there regretted this and wanted to stay german ; these were the same people who welcomed the occupying nazi forces .
however , as belgium has grown as a nation of diversity and understanding , the german-speaking community has become very integrated in the country and contact with out neighboring regions has increased over the years .
as a result , the german speakers consider themselves to be fully-fledged belgians and are accepted as such by their flemish and walloon compatriots .
could the german-speaking area support itself if belgium separated ?
if not , would it consider joining another region or hope to become part of germany again ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : lambertz has spoken of his support for regional autonomy the question of splitting belgium is a moot point .
it wo n't happen .
but for the sake of argument , despite its current state of stable and competent government , the german-speaking community would struggle to support itself in this hypothetical scenario and would have to join either wallonia or another state area .
there are some who push for this in the german-speaking community .
the current premier karl-heinz lambertz of the socialist party is one of the most prominent proponents of this idea .
these people say , as do the flemish , that wallonia is too much of a burden with its financial and social problems .
lambertz and others want a full transfer of powers from wallonia to the german-speaking parliament resulting in full regional autonomy .
is the cultural identity of the german-speaking minority strong ?
how is it protected ?
the cultural identity of the german speakers is deeply rooted .
our culture expresses itself in the german language spoken by the region 's people , the traditions that remain strong there and the creative and artistic expression in the region .
the position of the german-speaking community in the belgian federal state and its culture is protected by law in the constitution .
there are no worries within the community that the cultural identity of the german-speaking minority is under threat in belgium or by any policy of enlargement or expansion from the european union .
is the german-speaking minority in belgium influenced by the decisions of the european union ?
of course .
the eu has an influence on all countries which are member states , and that of course means that those people and minorities in those member states are influenced by eu policy .
the difference is that , unlike some minorities across europe , the german-speaking community does not fear these policies but welcomes them . nick amies send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the bundesliga is in danger of turning from a glittering stage into an enticing shop window . while the german top flight has n't ever been exactly below the radar , other european teams looking for new players have given their german counterparts little more than a cursory glance before taking their checkbooks to italy or spain .
more bargain basement than armani or balenciaga , the bundesliga just did n't have the same appeal as serie a or the primera liga . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : diamonds in the rough : luca toni and franck ribery but sew a few diamonds into the cut-price cloth and anyone looking for glamour will certainly spot a sparkle or two .
with the likes of luca toni , franck ribery , rafael van der vaart , miroslav klose and diego lighting up the german league , it was only a matter of time before the big spenders would spot an untapped market . two of the league 's brightest midfield stars top the shoppers ' most-wanted lists .
with the january transfer window closing at the end of the week , werder bremen and hamburg will be bracing themselves for " money 's no object " offers for diego and van der vaart respectively . van der vaart on italian shopping list italian giants juventus are hunting the two mini maestros and while bremen are trying as hard as they can to hang onto their prized brazilian playmaker , hamburg have confirmed they have already spoken to the turin team about a price for their want-away dutchman . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : van der vaart could be turin-bound " we are in discussions with juventus , but we ca n't say more at this stage , " hamburg spokesman jörn wolf recently told german agency sid . van der vaart is under contract until 2010 , but can leave hamburg next year for a fixed transfer fee of 1.5 million euros -lrb- $ 2 million -rrb- , but the 24-year-old is reported to be worth 20 million euros in the current market and hamburg may want to capitalize on that estimation , with spanish giants barcelona also interested in the diminutive dutchman . the midfielder , who made a shock move to the bundesliga from ajax in 2005 when everyone expected him to land in spain or italy , paved the way for other big names to come to the bundesliga .
his exit may prompt a similar spate of transfers in the opposite direction . diego coveted by europe 's biggest clubs diego , meanwhile , is being fiercely protected in bremen with juventus , inter milan , real madrid and chelsea all reportedly circling the weserstadion in search of his signature on the dotted line . despite juventus coach claudio ranieri 's desire to see diego play at the stadio olimpico di torino , it will take more than covetous comments to spirit werder 's top scorer away . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : diego has let his feet do the talking at bremen " there is no inquiry from juventus , and we will not talk with any clubs about signing diego , he is a firm part of our plans , " said werder 's director of sport klaus allofs , who reminded potential suitors that the brazilian is contracted until june 2011 . the reported visit of juve 's sporting director , alessio secco , to bremen last week fuelled the rumors further but diego is expected to turn out for bremen against bochum on sunday , ending the speculation - until the summer at least . bayern pair linked to premiership switch other names linked with a move away from the bundesliga this month have been bayern munich colleagues lukas podolski and daniel van buyten . podolski has been dogged by a loss of form and a series of niggling injuries since arriving at the allianz arena from fc köln in 2006 .
with the acquisition of strike partners klose and toni last summer , podolski slipped further down the pecking order , prompting a number of audacious attempts from english premiership side manchester city to sign the striker in the last few weeks . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : poldi has been the subject of frenzied transfer speculation however , the bayern higher-ups have put their foot down and have said that prinz poldi is going nowhere . " i had a very good discussion with lukas and made it clear to him he can not leave bayern , because we need him for the future , " said karl-heinz rummenigge .
" we are convinced of his quality and we are looking forward to seeing him in action again . " van buyten has been the subject of speculation ever since the bundesliga paused for the winter break with scottish champions celtic and premiership club newcastle united keen to take the defender back to the uk .
the belgian international played under new newcastle coach kevin keegan at manchester city in 2004 and has said he would be open to working with the coach again . brazilian defenders looking for pastures new bayern could also be close to losing veteran defender lucio .
the brazilian told deutsche welle last month that it was his dream to play in either italy or spain and that he hoped that he could make that dream come true before the end of his contract in 2010 . " i dream about spain and italy , " he said .
" perhaps my dream can come true a bit earlier if i can come to an agreement with the club . " another brazilian on the verge of leaving the bundesliga appears to be hertha berlin 's gilberto .
the defender is set to sign for premier league side tottenham hotspur after flying to london for a medical on sunday . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : gilberto is expected to be a spurs player by next week berlin 's coach lucien favre confirmed the 31-year-old was in the english capital at the weekend and the 27-times capped brazilian looks set to join spurs for a reported figure of 3 million euros . english clubs raid bundesliga also-rans also apparently premiership-bound is schalke 04 's out-of-favor striker peter lovenkrands .
the danish international is expected to put pen to paper at birmingham city before the transfer window closes on thursday night . joining him in england could be wolfsburg 's bosnian prodigy edin dzeko , who is a target for arsenal , and borussia mönchengladbach 's ivory coast defender steve gohouri , who could end up at wigan athletic . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

27 , many in the german press commented on the difference in conservative campaigns and what the results meant for the future of angela merkel 's party . the frankfurter rundschau wrote that incumbent premier roland koch has no one to blame but himself for the result in hesse .
" koch chose the wrong topic to champion and led the wrong election campaign , " it stated .
" he set himself up by making strong announcements which contradicted his own actions .
the public noticed that calls for swift justice from the state with the slowest judicial system in the country were implausible , and they have punished koch for this . "
the paper continued by saying that koch 's losses were also angela merkel 's losses .
" the chancellor supported this tough election campaign , " it wrote , " and now the conservatives must ask whether her governance endangers the future of the -lsb- christian democratic -rsb- union . " the bremer nachrichten pondered the consequences of the state elections for the chancellor and the cdu 's coming parliamentary election campaign .
" which way now for angela merkel ? " the paper asked .
" not only is it that social democrats -lsb- spd -rsb- must find their direction but also the conservatives .
should she take the careful approach or come out fighting like roland koch ?
reading the results from lower saxony and hesse , the decision should be clear . " " rambo koch loses , cuddly wulff wins , " stated the westdeutsche allgemeine zeitung .
" koch 's campaign failed because it focused on his weaknesses not his strengths .
there was no policy substance to his rhetoric and such a thing costs credibility , especially when policy is so important and at a time when the voters look for strong policies not just words . " the thüringer allgemeine zeitung also focused on koch 's performance .
" koch has abandoned his instincts and abandoned the voters , " it wrote .
" that the electorate reacted against this is a good thing .
it would be an ominous sign for the political culture in germany if the people had allowed themselves to have been manipulated by such a campaign .
the majority of people in hesse recognized that sloganeering is not the right approach to the multi-layered subject of juvenile delinquency .
this is why christian wulff , with his low-key election campaign , ran to a clear victory . " the stuttgarter zeitung also picked up on the differences in the conservative candidates ' approaches and results .
" the one winner in the state elections this sunday is christian wulff , which is not so surprising given the weakness of his social democratic spd opponent wolfgang jüttner , " the paper wrote .
the paper acknowledged , however , that despite the spd 's ineptitude , wulff led a winning campaign without the need to resort to the strong-arm tactics and verbal failures of his hessian colleague roland koch .
the paper suggested that wulff should be considered the heir apparent to chancellor merkel and that his victory should signal a rise in his profile within the cdu . the spd 's inability to force home a clear advantage in the state elections was also picked up on by the rhein-neckar zeitung .
" the state elections were less about regional politics and more about the performances of the candidates , " it wrote .
" the most significant signal was the fact that spd leader kurt beck could not lead a socialist election campaign which was better than that fought by the left party . "
the paper also wrote that roland koch 's performance and the chancellor 's support of his campaign should be a wake-up call to merkel , who the paper suggested should follow christian wulff 's approach , and not koch 's , in the future . the frankfurter allgemeine zeitung also lamented the state of german politics highlighted by the inability of the social democrats to capitalize on weakened and disliked conservative candidates .
the paper complained that a weak and directionless spd made the conservatives look good , despite their own poor showing .

after the votes were counted , hesse 's incumbent premier , roland koch , had a hair-thin majority , making uncertain the sort of coalition that could form a government and what role the candidate koch - who had led a controversial , openly xenophobic campaign - could have in it .
at midmorning on monday , jan .
28 , political advisers from all parties involved had holed up for strategy meetings .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ypsilanti will likely lead a coalition - but with whom ?
official results from hesse showed the conservative cdu had slumped from a majority in the state legislature to finish only nominally ahead of the center-left social democrats -lrb- spd -rrb- , with the same number of seats .
the spd candidate in hesse , andrea ypsilanti , took 36.7 percent of the vote against the cdu 's 36.8 .
search for a coalition a deputy cdu leader in another state , premier christian wulff of lower saxony , won re-election in a separate vote sunday , despite moderate losses .
the left , a combination of former social democrats and eastern ex-communists , extended its reach in western germany to enter both state parliaments .
but gains for the left party and spd in hesse mean the cdu , together with its planned coalition partner free democrats -lrb- fdp -rrb- , no longer have a large enough majority to rule in the state parliament in wiesbaden .
this gives a clear mandate to the spd to enter the state government in hesse , according to acting spd chairwoman andrea nahles .
voters saw to it that koch took " the most brutal beating possible , " nahles told rbb news radio on monday .
while the spd failed " by a nose " to gain a clear majority , it was clear that the voters in the western state increasingly stood behind the center-left party , and it should therefore be part of the government , she said .
ypsilanti is currently in talks with other party representatives to discuss coalition possibilities .
but nahles reiterated ypsilanti 's campaign promise that her party would not enter into a coalition with the upsurge , far-left left party , saying " the program and the people that they represent in hesse do not stand for stability in government . "
" traffic light " coalition possible ?
meanwhile , spd secretary general hubertus heil called for a " traffic light " coalition to rule hesse , which would be made up of the spd -lrb- red -rrb- , free democrats -lrb- yellow -rrb- and green party , under the leadership of ypsilanti .
" there is a koch-must-go mood -lsb- among voters -rsb- that we have to take into account when making up the government , " heil told zdf television talk show morgenmagazin on monday .
" we will present the premier , i am fairly sure of that , " he said .
yet a parliamentary leader of the fdp from hesse , jörg-uwe hahn , said there is no way that his party would enter into a " traffic light " coalition .
the fdp had planned to be coalition partner with the right-wing cdu , and could not be used as " a training wheel for a red-green " coalition , he told the dpa press agency .
hahn predicted a coalition would form between the spd , greens and the left party .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel 's cdu should avoid negative campaigns , one observer said amid the speculations on a new government , political observers took the time to mull over just what went so very wrong in the campaign of incumbent koch - and what it could mean for the larger question of cdu domination in german politics .
koch faulted for polarizing strategy chemnitz-based election researcher eckhard jesse said the cdu should see the campaign as a powerful lesson . with his polarizing , xenophobic rhetoric about youth-crime , koch led the campaign as if he were an opposition candidate , not an incumbent , jesse told the thüringer allgemeine newspaper .
merkel and other cdu candidates need to draw the conclusion that " they should take the same tact as wulff , " who handily won the state election in lower saxony .
" that means that they should run a low-key , feel-good campaign .
they should n't polarize - especially not the chancellor , " he said .
and political scientist theo schiller said koch had reaped what he sowed from his controversial style .
" if koch had n't focused his campaign on youth crime and young offenders , the results might have been slightly different , " the professor at the university of marburg told dpa .
the results were " catastrophic " for the cdu , he said .
by focusing on youth crime , koch aimed to harm the spd , but instead pilloried his own party , schiller said .
" he raised the question of deficits during the years his own government had ruled , " he said .
and was not able to give any satisfactory answers , he added .
no stopping rise of the left like a number of other german political analysts , schiller saw the left party 's gains as a sign of things to come .
" we can expect the left to enter other state parliaments , " he told dpa .
but he also said he did not see the likelihood of the left entering into a ruling coalition in hesse together with the spd .
that would mean ypsilanti would have to go back on her word to too great an extent , he said . dw staff -lrb- jen -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

while the spd failed " by a nose " to gain a clear majority , it was clear that the voters in the western state increasingly stood behind the center-left party , and it should therefore be part of the government , she said .
ypsilanti is currently in talks with other party representatives to discuss coalition possibilities .
but nahles reiterated ypsilanti 's campaign promise that her party would not enter into a coalition with the upsurge , far-left left party , saying " the program and the people that they represent in hesse do not stand for stability in government . "
" traffic light " coalition possible ?
meanwhile , spd secretary general hubertus heil called for a " traffic light " coalition to rule hesse , which would be made up of the spd -lrb- red -rrb- , free democrats -lrb- yellow -rrb- and green party , under the leadership of ypsilanti .
" there is a koch-must-go mood -lsb- among voters -rsb- that we have to take into account when making up the government , " heil told zdf television talk show morgenmagazin on monday .
" we will present the premier , i am fairly sure of that , " he said .
yet a parliamentary leader of the fdp from hesse , jörg-uwe hahn , said there is no way that his party would enter into a " traffic light " coalition .
the fdp had planned to be coalition partner with the right-wing cdu , and could not be used as " a training wheel for a red-green " coalition , he told the dpa press agency .
hahn predicted a coalition would form between the spd , greens and the left party .

koch faulted for polarizing strategy chemnitz-based election researcher eckhard jesse said the cdu should see the campaign as a powerful lesson . with his polarizing , xenophobic rhetoric about youth-crime , koch led the campaign as if he were an opposition candidate , not an incumbent , jesse told the thüringer allgemeine newspaper .
merkel and other cdu candidates need to draw the conclusion that " they should take the same tact as wulff , " who handily won the state election in lower saxony .
" that means that they should run a low-key , feel-good campaign .
they should n't polarize - especially not the chancellor , " he said .
and political scientist theo schiller said koch had reaped what he sowed from his controversial style .
" if koch had n't focused his campaign on youth crime and young offenders , the results might have been slightly different , " the professor at the university of marburg told dpa .

the bundesliga is in danger of turning from a glittering stage into an enticing shop window . while the german top flight has n't ever been exactly below the radar , other european teams looking for new players have given their german counterparts little more than a cursory glance before taking their checkbooks to italy or spain .

with the acquisition of strike partners klose and toni last summer , podolski slipped further down the pecking order , prompting a number of audacious attempts from english premiership side manchester city to sign the striker in the last few weeks . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : poldi has been the subject of frenzied transfer speculation however , the bayern higher-ups have put their foot down and have said that prinz poldi is going nowhere . " i had a very good discussion with lukas and made it clear to him he can not leave bayern , because we need him for the future , " said karl-heinz rummenigge .
" we are convinced of his quality and we are looking forward to seeing him in action again . " van buyten has been the subject of speculation ever since the bundesliga paused for the winter break with scottish champions celtic and premiership club newcastle united keen to take the defender back to the uk .
the belgian international played under new newcastle coach kevin keegan at manchester city in 2004 and has said he would be open to working with the coach again . brazilian defenders looking for pastures new bayern could also be close to losing veteran defender lucio .
the brazilian told deutsche welle last month that it was his dream to play in either italy or spain and that he hoped that he could make that dream come true before the end of his contract in 2010 . " i dream about spain and italy , " he said .
" perhaps my dream can come true a bit earlier if i can come to an agreement with the club . " another brazilian on the verge of leaving the bundesliga appears to be hertha berlin 's gilberto .
the defender is set to sign for premier league side tottenham hotspur after flying to london for a medical on sunday . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : gilberto is expected to be a spurs player by next week berlin 's coach lucien favre confirmed the 31-year-old was in the english capital at the weekend and the 27-times capped brazilian looks set to join spurs for a reported figure of 3 million euros . english clubs raid bundesliga also-rans also apparently premiership-bound is schalke 04 's out-of-favor striker peter lovenkrands .
the danish international is expected to put pen to paper at birmingham city before the transfer window closes on thursday night . joining him in england could be wolfsburg 's bosnian prodigy edin dzeko , who is a target for arsenal , and borussia mönchengladbach 's ivory coast defender steve gohouri , who could end up at wigan athletic . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de players -pipe- 28.01.2008 europe 's big spenders track bundesliga stars großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : this season 's hottest items : werder bremen 's diego and hamburg 's van der vaart as many of europe 's top leagues face a frantic week of dealing before the january transfer window closes , the continent 's big spenders are looking to come to germany for some last minute shopping . the bundesliga may be enjoying its most glamorous season in years thanks to the international stars who have chosen to ply their trade in germany , but question remains as to how long it can maintain its new celebrity status . while the big names and transfer coups have turned the media spotlight on german soccer in a way previously thought beyond its means , the downside of this attention is becoming obvious .
the bundesliga is in danger of turning from a glittering stage into an enticing shop window . while the german top flight has n't ever been exactly below the radar , other european teams looking for new players have given their german counterparts little more than a cursory glance before taking their checkbooks to italy or spain .
more bargain basement than armani or balenciaga , the bundesliga just did n't have the same appeal as serie a or the primera liga . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : diamonds in the rough : luca toni and franck ribery but sew a few diamonds into the cut-price cloth and anyone looking for glamour will certainly spot a sparkle or two .
with the likes of luca toni , franck ribery , rafael van der vaart , miroslav klose and diego lighting up the german league , it was only a matter of time before the big spenders would spot an untapped market . two of the league 's brightest midfield stars top the shoppers ' most-wanted lists .
with the january transfer window closing at the end of the week , werder bremen and hamburg will be bracing themselves for " money 's no object " offers for diego and van der vaart respectively . van der vaart on italian shopping list italian giants juventus are hunting the two mini maestros and while bremen are trying as hard as they can to hang onto their prized brazilian playmaker , hamburg have confirmed they have already spoken to the turin team about a price for their want-away dutchman . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : van der vaart could be turin-bound " we are in discussions with juventus , but we ca n't say more at this stage , " hamburg spokesman jörn wolf recently told german agency sid . van der vaart is under contract until 2010 , but can leave hamburg next year for a fixed transfer fee of 1.5 million euros -lrb- $ 2 million -rrb- , but the 24-year-old is reported to be worth 20 million euros in the current market and hamburg may want to capitalize on that estimation , with spanish giants barcelona also interested in the diminutive dutchman . the midfielder , who made a shock move to the bundesliga from ajax in 2005 when everyone expected him to land in spain or italy , paved the way for other big names to come to the bundesliga .
his exit may prompt a similar spate of transfers in the opposite direction . diego coveted by europe 's biggest clubs diego , meanwhile , is being fiercely protected in bremen with juventus , inter milan , real madrid and chelsea all reportedly circling the weserstadion in search of his signature on the dotted line . despite juventus coach claudio ranieri 's desire to see diego play at the stadio olimpico di torino , it will take more than covetous comments to spirit werder 's top scorer away . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : diego has let his feet do the talking at bremen " there is no inquiry from juventus , and we will not talk with any clubs about signing diego , he is a firm part of our plans , " said werder 's director of sport klaus allofs , who reminded potential suitors that the brazilian is contracted until june 2011 . the reported visit of juve 's sporting director , alessio secco , to bremen last week fuelled the rumors further but diego is expected to turn out for bremen against bochum on sunday , ending the speculation - until the summer at least . bayern pair linked to premiership switch other names linked with a move away from the bundesliga this month have been bayern munich colleagues lukas podolski and daniel van buyten . podolski has been dogged by a loss of form and a series of niggling injuries since arriving at the allianz arena from fc köln in 2006 .
with the acquisition of strike partners klose and toni last summer , podolski slipped further down the pecking order , prompting a number of audacious attempts from english premiership side manchester city to sign the striker in the last few weeks . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : poldi has been the subject of frenzied transfer speculation however , the bayern higher-ups have put their foot down and have said that prinz poldi is going nowhere . " i had a very good discussion with lukas and made it clear to him he can not leave bayern , because we need him for the future , " said karl-heinz rummenigge .
" we are convinced of his quality and we are looking forward to seeing him in action again . " van buyten has been the subject of speculation ever since the bundesliga paused for the winter break with scottish champions celtic and premiership club newcastle united keen to take the defender back to the uk .
the belgian international played under new newcastle coach kevin keegan at manchester city in 2004 and has said he would be open to working with the coach again . brazilian defenders looking for pastures new bayern could also be close to losing veteran defender lucio .
the brazilian told deutsche welle last month that it was his dream to play in either italy or spain and that he hoped that he could make that dream come true before the end of his contract in 2010 . " i dream about spain and italy , " he said .
" perhaps my dream can come true a bit earlier if i can come to an agreement with the club . " another brazilian on the verge of leaving the bundesliga appears to be hertha berlin 's gilberto .
the defender is set to sign for premier league side tottenham hotspur after flying to london for a medical on sunday . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : gilberto is expected to be a spurs player by next week berlin 's coach lucien favre confirmed the 31-year-old was in the english capital at the weekend and the 27-times capped brazilian looks set to join spurs for a reported figure of 3 million euros . english clubs raid bundesliga also-rans also apparently premiership-bound is schalke 04 's out-of-favor striker peter lovenkrands .
the danish international is expected to put pen to paper at birmingham city before the transfer window closes on thursday night . joining him in england could be wolfsburg 's bosnian prodigy edin dzeko , who is a target for arsenal , and borussia mönchengladbach 's ivory coast defender steve gohouri , who could end up at wigan athletic . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" the stabilization and association agreement wo n't be signed in the coming days but this does n't mean that our policy has changed , " he told journalists .
" we want to send a signal that our hand is stretched out to serbia . " the interim agreement could assist tadic in his campaign against nikolic but eu officials admitted that they had received mixed signals from belgrade as to whether a signing ceremony would hurt or help the pro-europe candidate 's prospects . tadic currently trails nikolic who took a five-point lead in the first round this weekend . eu boost to pro-europe candidate ahead of kosovo move eu leaders are keen to see tadic win to bolster pro-european forces ahead of an expected declaration of independence by politicians in the serbian province of kosovo . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the eu plans to boost its forces in kosovo the leaders of kosovo 's ethnic albanian majority , who make up 90 percent of the province 's 2 million people , say they are within weeks of declaring independence from serbia . the eu plans to send a 1,800-persn strong mission to kosovo to help ease its transition to local rule , but is still waiting for a signal from un secretary-general ban ki-moon to do so .

" we want to send a signal that our hand is stretched out to serbia . " the interim agreement could assist tadic in his campaign against nikolic but eu officials admitted that they had received mixed signals from belgrade as to whether a signing ceremony would hurt or help the pro-europe candidate 's prospects . tadic currently trails nikolic who took a five-point lead in the first round this weekend . eu boost to pro-europe candidate ahead of kosovo move eu leaders are keen to see tadic win to bolster pro-european forces ahead of an expected declaration of independence by politicians in the serbian province of kosovo . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the eu plans to boost its forces in kosovo the leaders of kosovo 's ethnic albanian majority , who make up 90 percent of the province 's 2 million people , say they are within weeks of declaring independence from serbia . the eu plans to send a 1,800-persn strong mission to kosovo to help ease its transition to local rule , but is still waiting for a signal from un secretary-general ban ki-moon to do so .
the united nations has run kosovo since 1999 , when a nato bombing campaign drove out belgrade 's forces waging a crackdown on independence-seeking ethnic albanians . failure to deliver may increase serbian distrust in eu bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : serbia " wo n't give away kosovo " to help ease serbia 's pain in losing a province belgrade considers to be an integral part of its territory and culture , the eu has made several moves in recent months to bring serbia into the fold .
but there is much skepticism in serbia of the eu 's motives and the latest stalling on the saa is unlikely to help . a failure to put an agreement in place soon would " fuel a widely present perception of permanent exclusion and unparalleled conditioning , " srdjan gligorijevic , chief analyst for the belgrade-based international and security affairs centre think-tank , told reuters news agency .

the bundesliga is in danger of turning from a glittering stage into an enticing shop window . while the german top flight has n't ever been exactly below the radar , other european teams looking for new players have given their german counterparts little more than a cursory glance before taking their checkbooks to italy or spain .
more bargain basement than armani or balenciaga , the bundesliga just did n't have the same appeal as serie a or the primera liga . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : diamonds in the rough : luca toni and franck ribery but sew a few diamonds into the cut-price cloth and anyone looking for glamour will certainly spot a sparkle or two .
with the likes of luca toni , franck ribery , rafael van der vaart , miroslav klose and diego lighting up the german league , it was only a matter of time before the big spenders would spot an untapped market . two of the league 's brightest midfield stars top the shoppers ' most-wanted lists .
with the january transfer window closing at the end of the week , werder bremen and hamburg will be bracing themselves for " money 's no object " offers for diego and van der vaart respectively . van der vaart on italian shopping list italian giants juventus are hunting the two mini maestros and while bremen are trying as hard as they can to hang onto their prized brazilian playmaker , hamburg have confirmed they have already spoken to the turin team about a price for their want-away dutchman . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : van der vaart could be turin-bound " we are in discussions with juventus , but we ca n't say more at this stage , " hamburg spokesman jörn wolf recently told german agency sid . van der vaart is under contract until 2010 , but can leave hamburg next year for a fixed transfer fee of 1.5 million euros -lrb- $ 2 million -rrb- , but the 24-year-old is reported to be worth 20 million euros in the current market and hamburg may want to capitalize on that estimation , with spanish giants barcelona also interested in the diminutive dutchman . the midfielder , who made a shock move to the bundesliga from ajax in 2005 when everyone expected him to land in spain or italy , paved the way for other big names to come to the bundesliga .
his exit may prompt a similar spate of transfers in the opposite direction . diego coveted by europe 's biggest clubs diego , meanwhile , is being fiercely protected in bremen with juventus , inter milan , real madrid and chelsea all reportedly circling the weserstadion in search of his signature on the dotted line . despite juventus coach claudio ranieri 's desire to see diego play at the stadio olimpico di torino , it will take more than covetous comments to spirit werder 's top scorer away . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : diego has let his feet do the talking at bremen " there is no inquiry from juventus , and we will not talk with any clubs about signing diego , he is a firm part of our plans , " said werder 's director of sport klaus allofs , who reminded potential suitors that the brazilian is contracted until june 2011 . the reported visit of juve 's sporting director , alessio secco , to bremen last week fuelled the rumors further but diego is expected to turn out for bremen against bochum on sunday , ending the speculation - until the summer at least . bayern pair linked to premiership switch other names linked with a move away from the bundesliga this month have been bayern munich colleagues lukas podolski and daniel van buyten . podolski has been dogged by a loss of form and a series of niggling injuries since arriving at the allianz arena from fc köln in 2006 .
with the acquisition of strike partners klose and toni last summer , podolski slipped further down the pecking order , prompting a number of audacious attempts from english premiership side manchester city to sign the striker in the last few weeks . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : poldi has been the subject of frenzied transfer speculation however , the bayern higher-ups have put their foot down and have said that prinz poldi is going nowhere . " i had a very good discussion with lukas and made it clear to him he can not leave bayern , because we need him for the future , " said karl-heinz rummenigge .
" we are convinced of his quality and we are looking forward to seeing him in action again . " van buyten has been the subject of speculation ever since the bundesliga paused for the winter break with scottish champions celtic and premiership club newcastle united keen to take the defender back to the uk .
the belgian international played under new newcastle coach kevin keegan at manchester city in 2004 and has said he would be open to working with the coach again . brazilian defenders looking for pastures new bayern could also be close to losing veteran defender lucio .
the brazilian told deutsche welle last month that it was his dream to play in either italy or spain and that he hoped that he could make that dream come true before the end of his contract in 2010 . " i dream about spain and italy , " he said .
" perhaps my dream can come true a bit earlier if i can come to an agreement with the club . " another brazilian on the verge of leaving the bundesliga appears to be hertha berlin 's gilberto .
the defender is set to sign for premier league side tottenham hotspur after flying to london for a medical on sunday . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : gilberto is expected to be a spurs player by next week berlin 's coach lucien favre confirmed the 31-year-old was in the english capital at the weekend and the 27-times capped brazilian looks set to join spurs for a reported figure of 3 million euros . english clubs raid bundesliga also-rans also apparently premiership-bound is schalke 04 's out-of-favor striker peter lovenkrands .
the danish international is expected to put pen to paper at birmingham city before the transfer window closes on thursday night . joining him in england could be wolfsburg 's bosnian prodigy edin dzeko , who is a target for arsenal , and borussia mönchengladbach 's ivory coast defender steve gohouri , who could end up at wigan athletic . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de elections -pipe- 28.01.2008 german conservatives suffer losses in key state election großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : andrea ypsilanti brought significant gains to the spd in hesse chancellor merkel 's christian democrats -lrb- cdu -rrb- suffered major losses in a key vote in the state of hesse .
but it 's yet to be seen which party will be able to form a governing coalition . led by merkel ally and incumbent premier roland koch , who ran a controversial campaign focused on crime and immigration , the cdu took 36.8 percent of the vote , down from 48.8 percent in 2003 . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the state election in hesse polarized germans nationwide " we did n't mobilize our own supporters enough , " koch said on public television .
" this is not easily for me personally . " the rival social democrats -lrb- spd -rrb- , who rule together with merkel 's cdu at the national level , saw their support push up to 36.7 percent . " we fought for a different political culture in this country and we won , " said koch 's spd challenger , andrea ypsilanti . it remains unclear , however , which party will take power .
the entry into hesse 's parliament of the new left party - a far-left grouping which came out of a merger of a social democratic splinter group and the successor party to the former east german communists - prevents both cdu and spd from securing a majority in the 110-seat state legislature in coalition with their preferred partners , the free-market liberal fdp and the greens respectively .
the left party took home 5.1 percent , the fdp received 9.4 percent and the greens got 7.5 percent . a different case bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : despite nearly 6-point drop in votes , christian wulff will stay in power in lower saxony in another state election , in lower saxony , incumbent cdu premier christian wulff saw his support fall to 42.5 percent from 48.3 percent in 2003 .
unlike in hesse , however , his result is good enough for him to hold on to power in a coalition with the fdp . here the spd scored its worst result in recent years , declining to around 30.3 percent from 33.4 percent in 2003 . in all , some 10.5 million people were eligible to vote in the two western states , in both of which angela merkel 's christian democrats -lrb- cdu -rrb- have put up the premiers for the past five years . a blow for merkel bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel 's support for koch was not enough to help him win the election the setback which the conservatives were dealt in hesse will also be seen as a blow to the chancellor , who stood firmly behind roland koch during the election campaign and repeatedly defended koch 's proposals for tougher measures against young criminals of foreign origin . " in hesse the conservatives have suffered such losses that it is clear that koch 's election campaign has n't worked , " said richard stöss , a political scientist at berlin 's free university . the spd 's ypsilanti , on the other hand , focused in her campaign on the traditional spd themes of wages , education and the integration of minorities .
this has brought the social democrats a gain of almost 8 percent in comparison to the previous state election . the result is likely to create even more tension in the already strained relations between the cdu and spd on the national level , which some fear could result in a political stalemate in the " grand coalition " until the 2009 national elections . an important race bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : incumbent state premier roland koch has divided the nation the state elections in hesse and lower saxony were widely seen as a test of the cdu 's strength ahead of federal elections , which must be held by september 2009 . merkel remains highly popular in germany but faces risks from a slowing economy ahead of next year 's national vote . " a loss in hesse would be bad for morale for the cdu nationally and for merkel , " political scientist jürgen falter told the bild am sonntag newspaper . ypsilanti 's victory in hesse could potentially give spd chief kurt beck a boost in his bid to dismantle labor market reforms introduced by merkel 's predecessor gerhard schröder , which are credited with helping to fuel a recovery of europe 's biggest economy . social democrats would also be likely to push harder to create a national minimum wage - a popular proposal that many economists have branded a job killer . the left gaining ground bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : left party candidate in hesse , willi van ooyen the fact that both state elections showed a clear shift to the left - after years in which merkel 's conservatives outperformed the social democrats - is , nonetheless , not all good news for the spd . the left party passed the 5-percent threshold to enter the parliament in both states . it is the first time that the party , led by former finance minister oskar lafontaine , will enter parliament in a large western state . spd officials have so far ruled out any possibility of entering into coalition agreements with the left . dw staff -lrb- tt -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

but it 's yet to be seen which party will be able to form a governing coalition . led by merkel ally and incumbent premier roland koch , who ran a controversial campaign focused on crime and immigration , the cdu took 36.8 percent of the vote , down from 48.8 percent in 2003 . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the state election in hesse polarized germans nationwide " we did n't mobilize our own supporters enough , " koch said on public television .
" this is not easily for me personally . " the rival social democrats -lrb- spd -rrb- , who rule together with merkel 's cdu at the national level , saw their support push up to 36.7 percent . " we fought for a different political culture in this country and we won , " said koch 's spd challenger , andrea ypsilanti . it remains unclear , however , which party will take power .
the entry into hesse 's parliament of the new left party - a far-left grouping which came out of a merger of a social democratic splinter group and the successor party to the former east german communists - prevents both cdu and spd from securing a majority in the 110-seat state legislature in coalition with their preferred partners , the free-market liberal fdp and the greens respectively .
the left party took home 5.1 percent , the fdp received 9.4 percent and the greens got 7.5 percent . a different case bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : despite nearly 6-point drop in votes , christian wulff will stay in power in lower saxony in another state election , in lower saxony , incumbent cdu premier christian wulff saw his support fall to 42.5 percent from 48.3 percent in 2003 .
unlike in hesse , however , his result is good enough for him to hold on to power in a coalition with the fdp . here the spd scored its worst result in recent years , declining to around 30.3 percent from 33.4 percent in 2003 . in all , some 10.5 million people were eligible to vote in the two western states , in both of which angela merkel 's christian democrats -lrb- cdu -rrb- have put up the premiers for the past five years . a blow for merkel bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel 's support for koch was not enough to help him win the election the setback which the conservatives were dealt in hesse will also be seen as a blow to the chancellor , who stood firmly behind roland koch during the election campaign and repeatedly defended koch 's proposals for tougher measures against young criminals of foreign origin . " in hesse the conservatives have suffered such losses that it is clear that koch 's election campaign has n't worked , " said richard stöss , a political scientist at berlin 's free university . the spd 's ypsilanti , on the other hand , focused in her campaign on the traditional spd themes of wages , education and the integration of minorities .
this has brought the social democrats a gain of almost 8 percent in comparison to the previous state election . the result is likely to create even more tension in the already strained relations between the cdu and spd on the national level , which some fear could result in a political stalemate in the " grand coalition " until the 2009 national elections . an important race bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : incumbent state premier roland koch has divided the nation the state elections in hesse and lower saxony were widely seen as a test of the cdu 's strength ahead of federal elections , which must be held by september 2009 . merkel remains highly popular in germany but faces risks from a slowing economy ahead of next year 's national vote . " a loss in hesse would be bad for morale for the cdu nationally and for merkel , " political scientist jürgen falter told the bild am sonntag newspaper . ypsilanti 's victory in hesse could potentially give spd chief kurt beck a boost in his bid to dismantle labor market reforms introduced by merkel 's predecessor gerhard schröder , which are credited with helping to fuel a recovery of europe 's biggest economy . social democrats would also be likely to push harder to create a national minimum wage - a popular proposal that many economists have branded a job killer . the left gaining ground bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : left party candidate in hesse , willi van ooyen the fact that both state elections showed a clear shift to the left - after years in which merkel 's conservatives outperformed the social democrats - is , nonetheless , not all good news for the spd . the left party passed the 5-percent threshold to enter the parliament in both states . it is the first time that the party , led by former finance minister oskar lafontaine , will enter parliament in a large western state . spd officials have so far ruled out any possibility of entering into coalition agreements with the left . dw staff -lrb- tt -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the catch ?
before take-off , you have to strip off . " ladies and gentleman , in preparation for take-off , please ensure your seatback is upright , your hand luggage is safely stowed , and that you 've removed all your clothing . " that 's what the on-board announcement en route to the isle of usedom might sound like if internet travel agency ossiurlaub.de succeeds with plans to launch the first nudist charter flight to the popular baltic sea destination in july .
the flight personnel making the announcements will be fully dressed , however - for security reasons . ossiurlaub.de thinks its innovative nudist flight is the perfect way to target eastern germany 's large population of " fkk " devotees .
fkk , the abbreviation of the german term for " free body culture , " is essentially naturism , and was an authorized and extremely popular tradition under communist rule . grin and bare it many eastern germans , nicknamed " ossis , " are nostalgic for that tradition , especially now that they feel frowned upon by their more prudish western german neighbors . " in the former east germany , naturist holidays were a much-loved way of spending the best weeks of the year , " said the founder of ossiurlaub.de , enrico hess .
" we want to make that freedom possible above the clouds , too . " the first nude flight will be a day-trip on july 5 between erfurt and usedom , with its many fkk beaches . " all the passengers will fly naked , but they will only be allowed to undress once they are in the plane , " hess said .
" but then they will be able to enjoy the hour-long flight in the way god intended . " tickets cost 499 euros -lrb- $ 735 -rrb- and there are just 50 seats available on the jet - there was no word on whether the seat cushions would be dry cleaned between flights . if the virgin flight is a success , regular flights to usedom or other destinations will be planned , hess said . dw staff -lrb- dc -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de europe -pipe- 28.01.2008 belgium 's german minority mostly unmoved by autonomy debate großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the belgian unity question centers on flanders and wallonia and neglects other regions the belgian interim government may have silenced separatist rhetoric for now but the divisive problems have not gone away .
the country 's german-speaking minority is maintaining a low profile in the debate . the debate concerning the political crisis in belgium and the unlikely , yet much discussed , possibility of the country splitting , has focused firmly on the disagreements between the two main linguistic areas , french-speaking wallonia and flemish-speaking flanders .
though these two areas are the largest in terms of size , and also importance when it comes to deciding policies which affect the whole country , belgium has in fact been divided into four linguistic regions since the early 1960s .
besides wallonia in the south and flanders in the north , there is the bilingual brussels capital region and the tiny german-speaking area in the east cantons .
while brussels is sometimes left out of the debate over belgium 's future - due mainly to its bilingualism , its self-sufficiency and its status as an international city - the east cantons seem to be ignored altogether when it comes to discussing the linguistic and cultural divide .
a region of 854 square kilometers -lrb- 530 square miles -rrb- with a population of over 73,000 , of which almost 100 percent are german speaking , the east cantons can quite easily be overlooked in belgium 's controversial situation .
the juicy arguments and stubborn nationalist positions of the more powerful flemings and walloons make for far better headlines than a quirky little germanic outpost on the far eastern border .
similar challenges and yet , the german-speaking community of the east cantons , as a linguistic minority within the federal state of belgium , faces similar challenges to those causing strife between " the big two . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the seat of german-speaking power is based in eupen granted internal rule in 1973 , the region has its own parliament in the capital of eupen and control over linguistic and cultural matters .
the parliament organizes elections , supervises the regional government , and adopts decrees for the german-speaking community .
the east cantons also have committees charged with governing areas such as education , social policy , health and employment .
despite this illusion of self-rule , however , the region still remains part of french-speaking wallonia , located as it is in the province of liege , and is therefore kept under the watchful eye of the wallon parliament .
it is not surprising that there are some in the east cantons who have themselves expressed a desire for the kind of autonomy favored by the more extreme elements on either side of the main linguistic divide .
a small but growing number have been voicing their support for an independent mini-state .
as is the case in the rest of the country , this is not a view shared by the whole population of the east cantons .
to get an idea how the german-speaking region and its people view their role in the wider belgian community , dw-world.de talked to jean-claude franken , the secretary of the german-speaking community 's christian social party -lrb- csp -rrb- , a cooperation partner of the francophone humanist democratic center -lrb- cdh -rrb- in the belgian parliament .
dw-world.de : is belgium 's german-speaking minority well integrated ?
jean-claude franken : the german-speaking minority is integrated in the belgian federal state very well .
there are special laws within the belgian constitution that protect the german-speaking community here .
how much power does the german-speaking minority have in belgium ?
the german-speaking community is an equal partner in the belgian federal state .
that is because there is no favoritism towards any of the linguistic minorities in the country in terms of the divulgence of power .
in the federal government , of course , the larger regions have the biggest political parties and therefore more seats in parliament , but our cooperation with the cdh allows us to have our say as part of wallonia .
in regional terms , the parties within the east canton - the csp , the socialist party , the party for freedom and progress and the party for german-speaking belgians - ensure that the autonomy we enjoy is used to make the community as self-reliant and efficient as possible .
does the german-speaking minority in belgium consider itself german or belgian ?
in former times , the region was part of prussia and therefore a small part of germany .
during world war ii , it was annexed again by germany after being part of belgium since the end of the great war .
when the east canton was returned to belgium once more in 1945 , some who lived there regretted this and wanted to stay german ; these were the same people who welcomed the occupying nazi forces .
however , as belgium has grown as a nation of diversity and understanding , the german-speaking community has become very integrated in the country and contact with out neighboring regions has increased over the years .
as a result , the german speakers consider themselves to be fully-fledged belgians and are accepted as such by their flemish and walloon compatriots .
could the german-speaking area support itself if belgium separated ?
if not , would it consider joining another region or hope to become part of germany again ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : lambertz has spoken of his support for regional autonomy the question of splitting belgium is a moot point .
it wo n't happen .
but for the sake of argument , despite its current state of stable and competent government , the german-speaking community would struggle to support itself in this hypothetical scenario and would have to join either wallonia or another state area .
there are some who push for this in the german-speaking community .
the current premier karl-heinz lambertz of the socialist party is one of the most prominent proponents of this idea .
these people say , as do the flemish , that wallonia is too much of a burden with its financial and social problems .
lambertz and others want a full transfer of powers from wallonia to the german-speaking parliament resulting in full regional autonomy .
is the cultural identity of the german-speaking minority strong ?
how is it protected ?
the cultural identity of the german speakers is deeply rooted .
our culture expresses itself in the german language spoken by the region 's people , the traditions that remain strong there and the creative and artistic expression in the region .
the position of the german-speaking community in the belgian federal state and its culture is protected by law in the constitution .
there are no worries within the community that the cultural identity of the german-speaking minority is under threat in belgium or by any policy of enlargement or expansion from the european union .
is the german-speaking minority in belgium influenced by the decisions of the european union ?
of course .
the eu has an influence on all countries which are member states , and that of course means that those people and minorities in those member states are influenced by eu policy .
the difference is that , unlike some minorities across europe , the german-speaking community does not fear these policies but welcomes them . nick amies send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the country 's german-speaking minority is maintaining a low profile in the debate . the debate concerning the political crisis in belgium and the unlikely , yet much discussed , possibility of the country splitting , has focused firmly on the disagreements between the two main linguistic areas , french-speaking wallonia and flemish-speaking flanders .
though these two areas are the largest in terms of size , and also importance when it comes to deciding policies which affect the whole country , belgium has in fact been divided into four linguistic regions since the early 1960s .
besides wallonia in the south and flanders in the north , there is the bilingual brussels capital region and the tiny german-speaking area in the east cantons .
while brussels is sometimes left out of the debate over belgium 's future - due mainly to its bilingualism , its self-sufficiency and its status as an international city - the east cantons seem to be ignored altogether when it comes to discussing the linguistic and cultural divide .
a region of 854 square kilometers -lrb- 530 square miles -rrb- with a population of over 73,000 , of which almost 100 percent are german speaking , the east cantons can quite easily be overlooked in belgium 's controversial situation .
the juicy arguments and stubborn nationalist positions of the more powerful flemings and walloons make for far better headlines than a quirky little germanic outpost on the far eastern border .
similar challenges and yet , the german-speaking community of the east cantons , as a linguistic minority within the federal state of belgium , faces similar challenges to those causing strife between " the big two . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the seat of german-speaking power is based in eupen granted internal rule in 1973 , the region has its own parliament in the capital of eupen and control over linguistic and cultural matters .
the parliament organizes elections , supervises the regional government , and adopts decrees for the german-speaking community .
the east cantons also have committees charged with governing areas such as education , social policy , health and employment .
despite this illusion of self-rule , however , the region still remains part of french-speaking wallonia , located as it is in the province of liege , and is therefore kept under the watchful eye of the wallon parliament .
it is not surprising that there are some in the east cantons who have themselves expressed a desire for the kind of autonomy favored by the more extreme elements on either side of the main linguistic divide .
a small but growing number have been voicing their support for an independent mini-state .
as is the case in the rest of the country , this is not a view shared by the whole population of the east cantons .
to get an idea how the german-speaking region and its people view their role in the wider belgian community , dw-world.de talked to jean-claude franken , the secretary of the german-speaking community 's christian social party -lrb- csp -rrb- , a cooperation partner of the francophone humanist democratic center -lrb- cdh -rrb- in the belgian parliament .
dw-world.de : is belgium 's german-speaking minority well integrated ?
jean-claude franken : the german-speaking minority is integrated in the belgian federal state very well .
there are special laws within the belgian constitution that protect the german-speaking community here .
how much power does the german-speaking minority have in belgium ?
the german-speaking community is an equal partner in the belgian federal state .
that is because there is no favoritism towards any of the linguistic minorities in the country in terms of the divulgence of power .
in the federal government , of course , the larger regions have the biggest political parties and therefore more seats in parliament , but our cooperation with the cdh allows us to have our say as part of wallonia .
in regional terms , the parties within the east canton - the csp , the socialist party , the party for freedom and progress and the party for german-speaking belgians - ensure that the autonomy we enjoy is used to make the community as self-reliant and efficient as possible .
does the german-speaking minority in belgium consider itself german or belgian ?
in former times , the region was part of prussia and therefore a small part of germany .
during world war ii , it was annexed again by germany after being part of belgium since the end of the great war .
when the east canton was returned to belgium once more in 1945 , some who lived there regretted this and wanted to stay german ; these were the same people who welcomed the occupying nazi forces .
however , as belgium has grown as a nation of diversity and understanding , the german-speaking community has become very integrated in the country and contact with out neighboring regions has increased over the years .
as a result , the german speakers consider themselves to be fully-fledged belgians and are accepted as such by their flemish and walloon compatriots .
could the german-speaking area support itself if belgium separated ?
if not , would it consider joining another region or hope to become part of germany again ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : lambertz has spoken of his support for regional autonomy the question of splitting belgium is a moot point .
it wo n't happen .
but for the sake of argument , despite its current state of stable and competent government , the german-speaking community would struggle to support itself in this hypothetical scenario and would have to join either wallonia or another state area .
there are some who push for this in the german-speaking community .
the current premier karl-heinz lambertz of the socialist party is one of the most prominent proponents of this idea .
these people say , as do the flemish , that wallonia is too much of a burden with its financial and social problems .
lambertz and others want a full transfer of powers from wallonia to the german-speaking parliament resulting in full regional autonomy .
is the cultural identity of the german-speaking minority strong ?
how is it protected ?
the cultural identity of the german speakers is deeply rooted .
our culture expresses itself in the german language spoken by the region 's people , the traditions that remain strong there and the creative and artistic expression in the region .
the position of the german-speaking community in the belgian federal state and its culture is protected by law in the constitution .
there are no worries within the community that the cultural identity of the german-speaking minority is under threat in belgium or by any policy of enlargement or expansion from the european union .
is the german-speaking minority in belgium influenced by the decisions of the european union ?
of course .
the eu has an influence on all countries which are member states , and that of course means that those people and minorities in those member states are influenced by eu policy .
the difference is that , unlike some minorities across europe , the german-speaking community does not fear these policies but welcomes them . nick amies send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the country 's german-speaking minority is maintaining a low profile in the debate . the debate concerning the political crisis in belgium and the unlikely , yet much discussed , possibility of the country splitting , has focused firmly on the disagreements between the two main linguistic areas , french-speaking wallonia and flemish-speaking flanders .
though these two areas are the largest in terms of size , and also importance when it comes to deciding policies which affect the whole country , belgium has in fact been divided into four linguistic regions since the early 1960s .
besides wallonia in the south and flanders in the north , there is the bilingual brussels capital region and the tiny german-speaking area in the east cantons .
while brussels is sometimes left out of the debate over belgium 's future - due mainly to its bilingualism , its self-sufficiency and its status as an international city - the east cantons seem to be ignored altogether when it comes to discussing the linguistic and cultural divide .
a region of 854 square kilometers -lrb- 530 square miles -rrb- with a population of over 73,000 , of which almost 100 percent are german speaking , the east cantons can quite easily be overlooked in belgium 's controversial situation .
the juicy arguments and stubborn nationalist positions of the more powerful flemings and walloons make for far better headlines than a quirky little germanic outpost on the far eastern border .
similar challenges and yet , the german-speaking community of the east cantons , as a linguistic minority within the federal state of belgium , faces similar challenges to those causing strife between " the big two . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the seat of german-speaking power is based in eupen granted internal rule in 1973 , the region has its own parliament in the capital of eupen and control over linguistic and cultural matters .
the parliament organizes elections , supervises the regional government , and adopts decrees for the german-speaking community .
the east cantons also have committees charged with governing areas such as education , social policy , health and employment .
despite this illusion of self-rule , however , the region still remains part of french-speaking wallonia , located as it is in the province of liege , and is therefore kept under the watchful eye of the wallon parliament .
it is not surprising that there are some in the east cantons who have themselves expressed a desire for the kind of autonomy favored by the more extreme elements on either side of the main linguistic divide .
a small but growing number have been voicing their support for an independent mini-state .
as is the case in the rest of the country , this is not a view shared by the whole population of the east cantons .
to get an idea how the german-speaking region and its people view their role in the wider belgian community , dw-world.de talked to jean-claude franken , the secretary of the german-speaking community 's christian social party -lrb- csp -rrb- , a cooperation partner of the francophone humanist democratic center -lrb- cdh -rrb- in the belgian parliament .
dw-world.de : is belgium 's german-speaking minority well integrated ?
jean-claude franken : the german-speaking minority is integrated in the belgian federal state very well .
there are special laws within the belgian constitution that protect the german-speaking community here .
how much power does the german-speaking minority have in belgium ?
the german-speaking community is an equal partner in the belgian federal state .
that is because there is no favoritism towards any of the linguistic minorities in the country in terms of the divulgence of power .
in the federal government , of course , the larger regions have the biggest political parties and therefore more seats in parliament , but our cooperation with the cdh allows us to have our say as part of wallonia .
in regional terms , the parties within the east canton - the csp , the socialist party , the party for freedom and progress and the party for german-speaking belgians - ensure that the autonomy we enjoy is used to make the community as self-reliant and efficient as possible .
does the german-speaking minority in belgium consider itself german or belgian ?
in former times , the region was part of prussia and therefore a small part of germany .
during world war ii , it was annexed again by germany after being part of belgium since the end of the great war .
when the east canton was returned to belgium once more in 1945 , some who lived there regretted this and wanted to stay german ; these were the same people who welcomed the occupying nazi forces .
however , as belgium has grown as a nation of diversity and understanding , the german-speaking community has become very integrated in the country and contact with out neighboring regions has increased over the years .
as a result , the german speakers consider themselves to be fully-fledged belgians and are accepted as such by their flemish and walloon compatriots .
could the german-speaking area support itself if belgium separated ?
if not , would it consider joining another region or hope to become part of germany again ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : lambertz has spoken of his support for regional autonomy the question of splitting belgium is a moot point .
it wo n't happen .
but for the sake of argument , despite its current state of stable and competent government , the german-speaking community would struggle to support itself in this hypothetical scenario and would have to join either wallonia or another state area .
there are some who push for this in the german-speaking community .
the current premier karl-heinz lambertz of the socialist party is one of the most prominent proponents of this idea .
these people say , as do the flemish , that wallonia is too much of a burden with its financial and social problems .
lambertz and others want a full transfer of powers from wallonia to the german-speaking parliament resulting in full regional autonomy .
is the cultural identity of the german-speaking minority strong ?
how is it protected ?
the cultural identity of the german speakers is deeply rooted .
our culture expresses itself in the german language spoken by the region 's people , the traditions that remain strong there and the creative and artistic expression in the region .
the position of the german-speaking community in the belgian federal state and its culture is protected by law in the constitution .
there are no worries within the community that the cultural identity of the german-speaking minority is under threat in belgium or by any policy of enlargement or expansion from the european union .
is the german-speaking minority in belgium influenced by the decisions of the european union ?
of course .
the eu has an influence on all countries which are member states , and that of course means that those people and minorities in those member states are influenced by eu policy .
the difference is that , unlike some minorities across europe , the german-speaking community does not fear these policies but welcomes them . nick amies send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?
dw-world.de belgian woes mirror europe 's expansion challenges it can appear at times that the eu has forgotten the little things in pursuit of the bigger picture .

but it 's yet to be seen which party will be able to form a governing coalition . led by merkel ally and incumbent premier roland koch , who ran a controversial campaign focused on crime and immigration , the cdu took 36.8 percent of the vote , down from 48.8 percent in 2003 . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the state election in hesse polarized germans nationwide " we did n't mobilize our own supporters enough , " koch said on public television .
" this is not easily for me personally . " the rival social democrats -lrb- spd -rrb- , who rule together with merkel 's cdu at the national level , saw their support push up to 36.7 percent . " we fought for a different political culture in this country and we won , " said koch 's spd challenger , andrea ypsilanti . it remains unclear , however , which party will take power .
the entry into hesse 's parliament of the new left party - a far-left grouping which came out of a merger of a social democratic splinter group and the successor party to the former east german communists - prevents both cdu and spd from securing a majority in the 110-seat state legislature in coalition with their preferred partners , the free-market liberal fdp and the greens respectively .
the left party took home 5.1 percent , the fdp received 9.4 percent and the greens got 7.5 percent . a different case bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : despite nearly 6-point drop in votes , christian wulff will stay in power in lower saxony in another state election , in lower saxony , incumbent cdu premier christian wulff saw his support fall to 42.5 percent from 48.3 percent in 2003 .
unlike in hesse , however , his result is good enough for him to hold on to power in a coalition with the fdp . here the spd scored its worst result in recent years , declining to around 30.3 percent from 33.4 percent in 2003 . in all , some 10.5 million people were eligible to vote in the two western states , in both of which angela merkel 's christian democrats -lrb- cdu -rrb- have put up the premiers for the past five years . a blow for merkel bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel 's support for koch was not enough to help him win the election the setback which the conservatives were dealt in hesse will also be seen as a blow to the chancellor , who stood firmly behind roland koch during the election campaign and repeatedly defended koch 's proposals for tougher measures against young criminals of foreign origin . " in hesse the conservatives have suffered such losses that it is clear that koch 's election campaign has n't worked , " said richard stöss , a political scientist at berlin 's free university . the spd 's ypsilanti , on the other hand , focused in her campaign on the traditional spd themes of wages , education and the integration of minorities .
this has brought the social democrats a gain of almost 8 percent in comparison to the previous state election . the result is likely to create even more tension in the already strained relations between the cdu and spd on the national level , which some fear could result in a political stalemate in the " grand coalition " until the 2009 national elections . an important race bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : incumbent state premier roland koch has divided the nation the state elections in hesse and lower saxony were widely seen as a test of the cdu 's strength ahead of federal elections , which must be held by september 2009 . merkel remains highly popular in germany but faces risks from a slowing economy ahead of next year 's national vote . " a loss in hesse would be bad for morale for the cdu nationally and for merkel , " political scientist jürgen falter told the bild am sonntag newspaper . ypsilanti 's victory in hesse could potentially give spd chief kurt beck a boost in his bid to dismantle labor market reforms introduced by merkel 's predecessor gerhard schröder , which are credited with helping to fuel a recovery of europe 's biggest economy . social democrats would also be likely to push harder to create a national minimum wage - a popular proposal that many economists have branded a job killer . the left gaining ground bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : left party candidate in hesse , willi van ooyen the fact that both state elections showed a clear shift to the left - after years in which merkel 's conservatives outperformed the social democrats - is , nonetheless , not all good news for the spd . the left party passed the 5-percent threshold to enter the parliament in both states . it is the first time that the party , led by former finance minister oskar lafontaine , will enter parliament in a large western state . spd officials have so far ruled out any possibility of entering into coalition agreements with the left . dw staff -lrb- tt -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

after the votes were counted , hesse 's incumbent premier , roland koch , had a hair-thin majority , making uncertain the sort of coalition that could form a government and what role the candidate koch - who had led a controversial , openly xenophobic campaign - could have in it .
at midmorning on monday , jan .
28 , political advisers from all parties involved had holed up for strategy meetings .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ypsilanti will likely lead a coalition - but with whom ?
official results from hesse showed the conservative cdu had slumped from a majority in the state legislature to finish only nominally ahead of the center-left social democrats -lrb- spd -rrb- , with the same number of seats .
the spd candidate in hesse , andrea ypsilanti , took 36.7 percent of the vote against the cdu 's 36.8 .
search for a coalition a deputy cdu leader in another state , premier christian wulff of lower saxony , won re-election in a separate vote sunday , despite moderate losses .
the left , a combination of former social democrats and eastern ex-communists , extended its reach in western germany to enter both state parliaments .
but gains for the left party and spd in hesse mean the cdu , together with its planned coalition partner free democrats -lrb- fdp -rrb- , no longer have a large enough majority to rule in the state parliament in wiesbaden .
this gives a clear mandate to the spd to enter the state government in hesse , according to acting spd chairwoman andrea nahles .
voters saw to it that koch took " the most brutal beating possible , " nahles told rbb news radio on monday .
while the spd failed " by a nose " to gain a clear majority , it was clear that the voters in the western state increasingly stood behind the center-left party , and it should therefore be part of the government , she said .
ypsilanti is currently in talks with other party representatives to discuss coalition possibilities .
but nahles reiterated ypsilanti 's campaign promise that her party would not enter into a coalition with the upsurge , far-left left party , saying " the program and the people that they represent in hesse do not stand for stability in government . "
" traffic light " coalition possible ?
meanwhile , spd secretary general hubertus heil called for a " traffic light " coalition to rule hesse , which would be made up of the spd -lrb- red -rrb- , free democrats -lrb- yellow -rrb- and green party , under the leadership of ypsilanti .
" there is a koch-must-go mood -lsb- among voters -rsb- that we have to take into account when making up the government , " heil told zdf television talk show morgenmagazin on monday .
" we will present the premier , i am fairly sure of that , " he said .
yet a parliamentary leader of the fdp from hesse , jörg-uwe hahn , said there is no way that his party would enter into a " traffic light " coalition .
the fdp had planned to be coalition partner with the right-wing cdu , and could not be used as " a training wheel for a red-green " coalition , he told the dpa press agency .
hahn predicted a coalition would form between the spd , greens and the left party .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel 's cdu should avoid negative campaigns , one observer said amid the speculations on a new government , political observers took the time to mull over just what went so very wrong in the campaign of incumbent koch - and what it could mean for the larger question of cdu domination in german politics .
koch faulted for polarizing strategy chemnitz-based election researcher eckhard jesse said the cdu should see the campaign as a powerful lesson . with his polarizing , xenophobic rhetoric about youth-crime , koch led the campaign as if he were an opposition candidate , not an incumbent , jesse told the thüringer allgemeine newspaper .
merkel and other cdu candidates need to draw the conclusion that " they should take the same tact as wulff , " who handily won the state election in lower saxony .
" that means that they should run a low-key , feel-good campaign .
they should n't polarize - especially not the chancellor , " he said .
and political scientist theo schiller said koch had reaped what he sowed from his controversial style .
" if koch had n't focused his campaign on youth crime and young offenders , the results might have been slightly different , " the professor at the university of marburg told dpa .
the results were " catastrophic " for the cdu , he said .
by focusing on youth crime , koch aimed to harm the spd , but instead pilloried his own party , schiller said .
" he raised the question of deficits during the years his own government had ruled , " he said .
and was not able to give any satisfactory answers , he added .
no stopping rise of the left like a number of other german political analysts , schiller saw the left party 's gains as a sign of things to come .
" we can expect the left to enter other state parliaments , " he told dpa .
but he also said he did not see the likelihood of the left entering into a ruling coalition in hesse together with the spd .
that would mean ypsilanti would have to go back on her word to too great an extent , he said . dw staff -lrb- jen -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

while the spd failed " by a nose " to gain a clear majority , it was clear that the voters in the western state increasingly stood behind the center-left party , and it should therefore be part of the government , she said .
ypsilanti is currently in talks with other party representatives to discuss coalition possibilities .
but nahles reiterated ypsilanti 's campaign promise that her party would not enter into a coalition with the upsurge , far-left left party , saying " the program and the people that they represent in hesse do not stand for stability in government . "
" traffic light " coalition possible ?
meanwhile , spd secretary general hubertus heil called for a " traffic light " coalition to rule hesse , which would be made up of the spd -lrb- red -rrb- , free democrats -lrb- yellow -rrb- and green party , under the leadership of ypsilanti .
" there is a koch-must-go mood -lsb- among voters -rsb- that we have to take into account when making up the government , " heil told zdf television talk show morgenmagazin on monday .
" we will present the premier , i am fairly sure of that , " he said .
yet a parliamentary leader of the fdp from hesse , jörg-uwe hahn , said there is no way that his party would enter into a " traffic light " coalition .
the fdp had planned to be coalition partner with the right-wing cdu , and could not be used as " a training wheel for a red-green " coalition , he told the dpa press agency .
hahn predicted a coalition would form between the spd , greens and the left party .

koch faulted for polarizing strategy chemnitz-based election researcher eckhard jesse said the cdu should see the campaign as a powerful lesson . with his polarizing , xenophobic rhetoric about youth-crime , koch led the campaign as if he were an opposition candidate , not an incumbent , jesse told the thüringer allgemeine newspaper .
merkel and other cdu candidates need to draw the conclusion that " they should take the same tact as wulff , " who handily won the state election in lower saxony .
" that means that they should run a low-key , feel-good campaign .
they should n't polarize - especially not the chancellor , " he said .
and political scientist theo schiller said koch had reaped what he sowed from his controversial style .
" if koch had n't focused his campaign on youth crime and young offenders , the results might have been slightly different , " the professor at the university of marburg told dpa .

27 , many in the german press commented on the difference in conservative campaigns and what the results meant for the future of angela merkel 's party . the frankfurter rundschau wrote that incumbent premier roland koch has no one to blame but himself for the result in hesse .
" koch chose the wrong topic to champion and led the wrong election campaign , " it stated .
" he set himself up by making strong announcements which contradicted his own actions .
the public noticed that calls for swift justice from the state with the slowest judicial system in the country were implausible , and they have punished koch for this . "
the paper continued by saying that koch 's losses were also angela merkel 's losses .
" the chancellor supported this tough election campaign , " it wrote , " and now the conservatives must ask whether her governance endangers the future of the -lsb- christian democratic -rsb- union . " the bremer nachrichten pondered the consequences of the state elections for the chancellor and the cdu 's coming parliamentary election campaign .
" which way now for angela merkel ? " the paper asked .
" not only is it that social democrats -lsb- spd -rsb- must find their direction but also the conservatives .
should she take the careful approach or come out fighting like roland koch ?
reading the results from lower saxony and hesse , the decision should be clear . " " rambo koch loses , cuddly wulff wins , " stated the westdeutsche allgemeine zeitung .
" koch 's campaign failed because it focused on his weaknesses not his strengths .
there was no policy substance to his rhetoric and such a thing costs credibility , especially when policy is so important and at a time when the voters look for strong policies not just words . " the thüringer allgemeine zeitung also focused on koch 's performance .
" koch has abandoned his instincts and abandoned the voters , " it wrote .
" that the electorate reacted against this is a good thing .
it would be an ominous sign for the political culture in germany if the people had allowed themselves to have been manipulated by such a campaign .
the majority of people in hesse recognized that sloganeering is not the right approach to the multi-layered subject of juvenile delinquency .
this is why christian wulff , with his low-key election campaign , ran to a clear victory . " the stuttgarter zeitung also picked up on the differences in the conservative candidates ' approaches and results .
" the one winner in the state elections this sunday is christian wulff , which is not so surprising given the weakness of his social democratic spd opponent wolfgang jüttner , " the paper wrote .
the paper acknowledged , however , that despite the spd 's ineptitude , wulff led a winning campaign without the need to resort to the strong-arm tactics and verbal failures of his hessian colleague roland koch .
the paper suggested that wulff should be considered the heir apparent to chancellor merkel and that his victory should signal a rise in his profile within the cdu . the spd 's inability to force home a clear advantage in the state elections was also picked up on by the rhein-neckar zeitung .
" the state elections were less about regional politics and more about the performances of the candidates , " it wrote .
" the most significant signal was the fact that spd leader kurt beck could not lead a socialist election campaign which was better than that fought by the left party . "
the paper also wrote that roland koch 's performance and the chancellor 's support of his campaign should be a wake-up call to merkel , who the paper suggested should follow christian wulff 's approach , and not koch 's , in the future . the frankfurter allgemeine zeitung also lamented the state of german politics highlighted by the inability of the social democrats to capitalize on weakened and disliked conservative candidates .
the paper complained that a weak and directionless spd made the conservatives look good , despite their own poor showing .
" we now know the weaknesses of the spd , " it wrote , " poor in candidates and poor in profile … one wonders how the cdu would have responded to a stronger opponent .

27 , many in the german press commented on the difference in conservative campaigns and what the results meant for the future of angela merkel 's party . the frankfurter rundschau wrote that incumbent premier roland koch has no one to blame but himself for the result in hesse .
" koch chose the wrong topic to champion and led the wrong election campaign , " it stated .
" he set himself up by making strong announcements which contradicted his own actions .
the public noticed that calls for swift justice from the state with the slowest judicial system in the country were implausible , and they have punished koch for this . "
the paper continued by saying that koch 's losses were also angela merkel 's losses .
" the chancellor supported this tough election campaign , " it wrote , " and now the conservatives must ask whether her governance endangers the future of the -lsb- christian democratic -rsb- union . " the bremer nachrichten pondered the consequences of the state elections for the chancellor and the cdu 's coming parliamentary election campaign .
" which way now for angela merkel ? " the paper asked .
" not only is it that social democrats -lsb- spd -rsb- must find their direction but also the conservatives .
should she take the careful approach or come out fighting like roland koch ?
reading the results from lower saxony and hesse , the decision should be clear . " " rambo koch loses , cuddly wulff wins , " stated the westdeutsche allgemeine zeitung .
" koch 's campaign failed because it focused on his weaknesses not his strengths .
there was no policy substance to his rhetoric and such a thing costs credibility , especially when policy is so important and at a time when the voters look for strong policies not just words . " the thüringer allgemeine zeitung also focused on koch 's performance .
" koch has abandoned his instincts and abandoned the voters , " it wrote .

the bundesliga is in danger of turning from a glittering stage into an enticing shop window . while the german top flight has n't ever been exactly below the radar , other european teams looking for new players have given their german counterparts little more than a cursory glance before taking their checkbooks to italy or spain .
more bargain basement than armani or balenciaga , the bundesliga just did n't have the same appeal as serie a or the primera liga . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : diamonds in the rough : luca toni and franck ribery but sew a few diamonds into the cut-price cloth and anyone looking for glamour will certainly spot a sparkle or two .
with the likes of luca toni , franck ribery , rafael van der vaart , miroslav klose and diego lighting up the german league , it was only a matter of time before the big spenders would spot an untapped market . two of the league 's brightest midfield stars top the shoppers ' most-wanted lists .
with the january transfer window closing at the end of the week , werder bremen and hamburg will be bracing themselves for " money 's no object " offers for diego and van der vaart respectively . van der vaart on italian shopping list italian giants juventus are hunting the two mini maestros and while bremen are trying as hard as they can to hang onto their prized brazilian playmaker , hamburg have confirmed they have already spoken to the turin team about a price for their want-away dutchman . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : van der vaart could be turin-bound " we are in discussions with juventus , but we ca n't say more at this stage , " hamburg spokesman jörn wolf recently told german agency sid . van der vaart is under contract until 2010 , but can leave hamburg next year for a fixed transfer fee of 1.5 million euros -lrb- $ 2 million -rrb- , but the 24-year-old is reported to be worth 20 million euros in the current market and hamburg may want to capitalize on that estimation , with spanish giants barcelona also interested in the diminutive dutchman . the midfielder , who made a shock move to the bundesliga from ajax in 2005 when everyone expected him to land in spain or italy , paved the way for other big names to come to the bundesliga .
his exit may prompt a similar spate of transfers in the opposite direction . diego coveted by europe 's biggest clubs diego , meanwhile , is being fiercely protected in bremen with juventus , inter milan , real madrid and chelsea all reportedly circling the weserstadion in search of his signature on the dotted line . despite juventus coach claudio ranieri 's desire to see diego play at the stadio olimpico di torino , it will take more than covetous comments to spirit werder 's top scorer away . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : diego has let his feet do the talking at bremen " there is no inquiry from juventus , and we will not talk with any clubs about signing diego , he is a firm part of our plans , " said werder 's director of sport klaus allofs , who reminded potential suitors that the brazilian is contracted until june 2011 . the reported visit of juve 's sporting director , alessio secco , to bremen last week fuelled the rumors further but diego is expected to turn out for bremen against bochum on sunday , ending the speculation - until the summer at least . bayern pair linked to premiership switch other names linked with a move away from the bundesliga this month have been bayern munich colleagues lukas podolski and daniel van buyten . podolski has been dogged by a loss of form and a series of niggling injuries since arriving at the allianz arena from fc köln in 2006 .
with the acquisition of strike partners klose and toni last summer , podolski slipped further down the pecking order , prompting a number of audacious attempts from english premiership side manchester city to sign the striker in the last few weeks . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : poldi has been the subject of frenzied transfer speculation however , the bayern higher-ups have put their foot down and have said that prinz poldi is going nowhere . " i had a very good discussion with lukas and made it clear to him he can not leave bayern , because we need him for the future , " said karl-heinz rummenigge .
" we are convinced of his quality and we are looking forward to seeing him in action again . " van buyten has been the subject of speculation ever since the bundesliga paused for the winter break with scottish champions celtic and premiership club newcastle united keen to take the defender back to the uk .
the belgian international played under new newcastle coach kevin keegan at manchester city in 2004 and has said he would be open to working with the coach again . brazilian defenders looking for pastures new bayern could also be close to losing veteran defender lucio .
the brazilian told deutsche welle last month that it was his dream to play in either italy or spain and that he hoped that he could make that dream come true before the end of his contract in 2010 . " i dream about spain and italy , " he said .
" perhaps my dream can come true a bit earlier if i can come to an agreement with the club . " another brazilian on the verge of leaving the bundesliga appears to be hertha berlin 's gilberto .

the bundesliga is in danger of turning from a glittering stage into an enticing shop window . while the german top flight has n't ever been exactly below the radar , other european teams looking for new players have given their german counterparts little more than a cursory glance before taking their checkbooks to italy or spain .

the catch ?
before take-off , you have to strip off . " ladies and gentleman , in preparation for take-off , please ensure your seatback is upright , your hand luggage is safely stowed , and that you 've removed all your clothing . " that 's what the on-board announcement en route to the isle of usedom might sound like if internet travel agency ossiurlaub.de succeeds with plans to launch the first nudist charter flight to the popular baltic sea destination in july .
the flight personnel making the announcements will be fully dressed , however - for security reasons . ossiurlaub.de thinks its innovative nudist flight is the perfect way to target eastern germany 's large population of " fkk " devotees .
fkk , the abbreviation of the german term for " free body culture , " is essentially naturism , and was an authorized and extremely popular tradition under communist rule . grin and bare it many eastern germans , nicknamed " ossis , " are nostalgic for that tradition , especially now that they feel frowned upon by their more prudish western german neighbors . " in the former east germany , naturist holidays were a much-loved way of spending the best weeks of the year , " said the founder of ossiurlaub.de , enrico hess .
" we want to make that freedom possible above the clouds , too . " the first nude flight will be a day-trip on july 5 between erfurt and usedom , with its many fkk beaches . " all the passengers will fly naked , but they will only be allowed to undress once they are in the plane , " hess said .
" but then they will be able to enjoy the hour-long flight in the way god intended . " tickets cost 499 euros -lrb- $ 735 -rrb- and there are just 50 seats available on the jet - there was no word on whether the seat cushions would be dry cleaned between flights . if the virgin flight is a success , regular flights to usedom or other destinations will be planned , hess said . dw staff -lrb- dc -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" the stabilization and association agreement wo n't be signed in the coming days but this does n't mean that our policy has changed , " he told journalists .
" we want to send a signal that our hand is stretched out to serbia . " the interim agreement could assist tadic in his campaign against nikolic but eu officials admitted that they had received mixed signals from belgrade as to whether a signing ceremony would hurt or help the pro-europe candidate 's prospects . tadic currently trails nikolic who took a five-point lead in the first round this weekend . eu boost to pro-europe candidate ahead of kosovo move eu leaders are keen to see tadic win to bolster pro-european forces ahead of an expected declaration of independence by politicians in the serbian province of kosovo . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the eu plans to boost its forces in kosovo the leaders of kosovo 's ethnic albanian majority , who make up 90 percent of the province 's 2 million people , say they are within weeks of declaring independence from serbia . the eu plans to send a 1,800-persn strong mission to kosovo to help ease its transition to local rule , but is still waiting for a signal from un secretary-general ban ki-moon to do so .

but there is much skepticism in serbia of the eu 's motives and the latest stalling on the saa is unlikely to help . a failure to put an agreement in place soon would " fuel a widely present perception of permanent exclusion and unparalleled conditioning , " srdjan gligorijevic , chief analyst for the belgrade-based international and security affairs centre think-tank , told reuters news agency .

the catch ?
before take-off , you have to strip off . " ladies and gentleman , in preparation for take-off , please ensure your seatback is upright , your hand luggage is safely stowed , and that you 've removed all your clothing .

the flight personnel making the announcements will be fully dressed , however - for security reasons . ossiurlaub.de thinks its innovative nudist flight is the perfect way to target eastern germany 's large population of " fkk " devotees .
fkk , the abbreviation of the german term for " free body culture , " is essentially naturism , and was an authorized and extremely popular tradition under communist rule . grin and bare it many eastern germans , nicknamed " ossis , " are nostalgic for that tradition , especially now that they feel frowned upon by their more prudish western german neighbors . " in the former east germany , naturist holidays were a much-loved way of spending the best weeks of the year , " said the founder of ossiurlaub.de , enrico hess .
" we want to make that freedom possible above the clouds , too . " the first nude flight will be a day-trip on july 5 between erfurt and usedom , with its many fkk beaches . " all the passengers will fly naked , but they will only be allowed to undress once they are in the plane , " hess said .
" but then they will be able to enjoy the hour-long flight in the way god intended . " tickets cost 499 euros -lrb- $ 735 -rrb- and there are just 50 seats available on the jet - there was no word on whether the seat cushions would be dry cleaned between flights . if the virgin flight is a success , regular flights to usedom or other destinations will be planned , hess said . dw staff -lrb- dc -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

france is slated to contribute the most troops . at their regular monthly meeting , the union 's 27 foreign ministers on monday , jan .
28 , authorized the force 's commander , lt. gen. patrick nash , to order the deployment of his troops . " in conducting this operation the eu is stepping up its long-standing action in support of efforts to tackle the crisis in darfur and to address its regional ramifications , " the foreign ministers said in a statement . the force , which is to provide security for locals and un aid teams in eastern chad and the north-eastern central african republic along the border with the war-torn sudanese province of darfur , was proposed by france and approved in concept by eu leaders on oct .
15 . however , arguments then broke out over the resources which each member state should commit to the operation , with the eu 's 27 nations initially unable to scrape together the helicopters and transport planes needed to support the 3,700-man mission . bildunterschrift : hundreds of thousand have been uprooted by violence in the region that obstacle was finally overcome in early january , when russia and ukraine - neither of which is an eu member - offered to provide the missing hardware . the backbone of the " bridging operation , " which is mandated to run for a year , will be made up of an estimated 2,000 french troops .
however , the appointment of nash - an irishman - guarantees the multinational nature of the force , diplomats said . ireland and poland are set to send some 400 troops each .
the deployment is expected to begin in march , with the mission coming up to full strength by may 1 . the mission is expected to cost 119 million euros -lrb- $ 175 million -rrb- . nash is set to control the operation from the mont valerien military base in france .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de press review -pipe- 28.01.2008 german press review : rambo koch loses out to cuddly wulff großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : chancellor merkel is now taking heat for her support of koch 's failed campaign after the state elections in lower saxony and hesse on sunday , jan .
27 , many in the german press commented on the difference in conservative campaigns and what the results meant for the future of angela merkel 's party . the frankfurter rundschau wrote that incumbent premier roland koch has no one to blame but himself for the result in hesse .
" koch chose the wrong topic to champion and led the wrong election campaign , " it stated .
" he set himself up by making strong announcements which contradicted his own actions .
the public noticed that calls for swift justice from the state with the slowest judicial system in the country were implausible , and they have punished koch for this . "
the paper continued by saying that koch 's losses were also angela merkel 's losses .
" the chancellor supported this tough election campaign , " it wrote , " and now the conservatives must ask whether her governance endangers the future of the -lsb- christian democratic -rsb- union . " the bremer nachrichten pondered the consequences of the state elections for the chancellor and the cdu 's coming parliamentary election campaign .
" which way now for angela merkel ? " the paper asked .
" not only is it that social democrats -lsb- spd -rsb- must find their direction but also the conservatives .
should she take the careful approach or come out fighting like roland koch ?
reading the results from lower saxony and hesse , the decision should be clear . " " rambo koch loses , cuddly wulff wins , " stated the westdeutsche allgemeine zeitung .
" koch 's campaign failed because it focused on his weaknesses not his strengths .
there was no policy substance to his rhetoric and such a thing costs credibility , especially when policy is so important and at a time when the voters look for strong policies not just words . " the thüringer allgemeine zeitung also focused on koch 's performance .
" koch has abandoned his instincts and abandoned the voters , " it wrote .
" that the electorate reacted against this is a good thing .
it would be an ominous sign for the political culture in germany if the people had allowed themselves to have been manipulated by such a campaign .
the majority of people in hesse recognized that sloganeering is not the right approach to the multi-layered subject of juvenile delinquency .
this is why christian wulff , with his low-key election campaign , ran to a clear victory . " the stuttgarter zeitung also picked up on the differences in the conservative candidates ' approaches and results .
" the one winner in the state elections this sunday is christian wulff , which is not so surprising given the weakness of his social democratic spd opponent wolfgang jüttner , " the paper wrote .
the paper acknowledged , however , that despite the spd 's ineptitude , wulff led a winning campaign without the need to resort to the strong-arm tactics and verbal failures of his hessian colleague roland koch .
the paper suggested that wulff should be considered the heir apparent to chancellor merkel and that his victory should signal a rise in his profile within the cdu . the spd 's inability to force home a clear advantage in the state elections was also picked up on by the rhein-neckar zeitung .
" the state elections were less about regional politics and more about the performances of the candidates , " it wrote .
" the most significant signal was the fact that spd leader kurt beck could not lead a socialist election campaign which was better than that fought by the left party . "
the paper also wrote that roland koch 's performance and the chancellor 's support of his campaign should be a wake-up call to merkel , who the paper suggested should follow christian wulff 's approach , and not koch 's , in the future . the frankfurter allgemeine zeitung also lamented the state of german politics highlighted by the inability of the social democrats to capitalize on weakened and disliked conservative candidates .
the paper complained that a weak and directionless spd made the conservatives look good , despite their own poor showing .
" we now know the weaknesses of the spd , " it wrote , " poor in candidates and poor in profile … one wonders how the cdu would have responded to a stronger opponent .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de players -pipe- 28.01.2008 europe 's big spenders track bundesliga stars großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : this season 's hottest items : werder bremen 's diego and hamburg 's van der vaart as many of europe 's top leagues face a frantic week of dealing before the january transfer window closes , the continent 's big spenders are looking to come to germany for some last minute shopping . the bundesliga may be enjoying its most glamorous season in years thanks to the international stars who have chosen to ply their trade in germany , but question remains as to how long it can maintain its new celebrity status . while the big names and transfer coups have turned the media spotlight on german soccer in a way previously thought beyond its means , the downside of this attention is becoming obvious .
the bundesliga is in danger of turning from a glittering stage into an enticing shop window . while the german top flight has n't ever been exactly below the radar , other european teams looking for new players have given their german counterparts little more than a cursory glance before taking their checkbooks to italy or spain .
more bargain basement than armani or balenciaga , the bundesliga just did n't have the same appeal as serie a or the primera liga . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : diamonds in the rough : luca toni and franck ribery but sew a few diamonds into the cut-price cloth and anyone looking for glamour will certainly spot a sparkle or two .
with the likes of luca toni , franck ribery , rafael van der vaart , miroslav klose and diego lighting up the german league , it was only a matter of time before the big spenders would spot an untapped market . two of the league 's brightest midfield stars top the shoppers ' most-wanted lists .
with the january transfer window closing at the end of the week , werder bremen and hamburg will be bracing themselves for " money 's no object " offers for diego and van der vaart respectively . van der vaart on italian shopping list italian giants juventus are hunting the two mini maestros and while bremen are trying as hard as they can to hang onto their prized brazilian playmaker , hamburg have confirmed they have already spoken to the turin team about a price for their want-away dutchman . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : van der vaart could be turin-bound " we are in discussions with juventus , but we ca n't say more at this stage , " hamburg spokesman jörn wolf recently told german agency sid . van der vaart is under contract until 2010 , but can leave hamburg next year for a fixed transfer fee of 1.5 million euros -lrb- $ 2 million -rrb- , but the 24-year-old is reported to be worth 20 million euros in the current market and hamburg may want to capitalize on that estimation , with spanish giants barcelona also interested in the diminutive dutchman . the midfielder , who made a shock move to the bundesliga from ajax in 2005 when everyone expected him to land in spain or italy , paved the way for other big names to come to the bundesliga .
his exit may prompt a similar spate of transfers in the opposite direction . diego coveted by europe 's biggest clubs diego , meanwhile , is being fiercely protected in bremen with juventus , inter milan , real madrid and chelsea all reportedly circling the weserstadion in search of his signature on the dotted line . despite juventus coach claudio ranieri 's desire to see diego play at the stadio olimpico di torino , it will take more than covetous comments to spirit werder 's top scorer away . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : diego has let his feet do the talking at bremen " there is no inquiry from juventus , and we will not talk with any clubs about signing diego , he is a firm part of our plans , " said werder 's director of sport klaus allofs , who reminded potential suitors that the brazilian is contracted until june 2011 . the reported visit of juve 's sporting director , alessio secco , to bremen last week fuelled the rumors further but diego is expected to turn out for bremen against bochum on sunday , ending the speculation - until the summer at least . bayern pair linked to premiership switch other names linked with a move away from the bundesliga this month have been bayern munich colleagues lukas podolski and daniel van buyten . podolski has been dogged by a loss of form and a series of niggling injuries since arriving at the allianz arena from fc köln in 2006 .
with the acquisition of strike partners klose and toni last summer , podolski slipped further down the pecking order , prompting a number of audacious attempts from english premiership side manchester city to sign the striker in the last few weeks . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : poldi has been the subject of frenzied transfer speculation however , the bayern higher-ups have put their foot down and have said that prinz poldi is going nowhere . " i had a very good discussion with lukas and made it clear to him he can not leave bayern , because we need him for the future , " said karl-heinz rummenigge .
" we are convinced of his quality and we are looking forward to seeing him in action again . " van buyten has been the subject of speculation ever since the bundesliga paused for the winter break with scottish champions celtic and premiership club newcastle united keen to take the defender back to the uk .
the belgian international played under new newcastle coach kevin keegan at manchester city in 2004 and has said he would be open to working with the coach again . brazilian defenders looking for pastures new bayern could also be close to losing veteran defender lucio .
the brazilian told deutsche welle last month that it was his dream to play in either italy or spain and that he hoped that he could make that dream come true before the end of his contract in 2010 . " i dream about spain and italy , " he said .
" perhaps my dream can come true a bit earlier if i can come to an agreement with the club . " another brazilian on the verge of leaving the bundesliga appears to be hertha berlin 's gilberto .
the defender is set to sign for premier league side tottenham hotspur after flying to london for a medical on sunday . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : gilberto is expected to be a spurs player by next week berlin 's coach lucien favre confirmed the 31-year-old was in the english capital at the weekend and the 27-times capped brazilian looks set to join spurs for a reported figure of 3 million euros . english clubs raid bundesliga also-rans also apparently premiership-bound is schalke 04 's out-of-favor striker peter lovenkrands .
the danish international is expected to put pen to paper at birmingham city before the transfer window closes on thursday night . joining him in england could be wolfsburg 's bosnian prodigy edin dzeko , who is a target for arsenal , and borussia mönchengladbach 's ivory coast defender steve gohouri , who could end up at wigan athletic . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" dutch european affairs minister frans timmermans said his country , which has led opposition to a lenient line on belgrade , would continue to oppose the signing of the full saa . " we will not sign till we have full cooperation with the icty , " he told reporters . timmermans insisted that his country is " prepared to sign an saa with serbia at the moment serbia hands over the people indicted by the yugoslavia tribunal , " and not before . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : nikolic is russia 's preferred candidate for the post of president the tribunal is seeking the arrest and transfer of former bosnian serb military commander ratko mladic on genocide charges over the 1995 srebrenica massacre of 7,000 bosnian muslims . the european union has made full cooperation with the tribunal a condition for signing the saa , which is a first formal step on the path to eu membership . no change in eu policy german foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier said the signing of an interim deal did not mean the eu was shying away from serbia . " the stabilization and association agreement wo n't be signed in the coming days but this does n't mean that our policy has changed , " he told journalists .
" we want to send a signal that our hand is stretched out to serbia . " the interim agreement could assist tadic in his campaign against nikolic but eu officials admitted that they had received mixed signals from belgrade as to whether a signing ceremony would hurt or help the pro-europe candidate 's prospects . tadic currently trails nikolic who took a five-point lead in the first round this weekend . eu boost to pro-europe candidate ahead of kosovo move eu leaders are keen to see tadic win to bolster pro-european forces ahead of an expected declaration of independence by politicians in the serbian province of kosovo . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the eu plans to boost its forces in kosovo the leaders of kosovo 's ethnic albanian majority , who make up 90 percent of the province 's 2 million people , say they are within weeks of declaring independence from serbia . the eu plans to send a 1,800-persn strong mission to kosovo to help ease its transition to local rule , but is still waiting for a signal from un secretary-general ban ki-moon to do so .

but there is much skepticism in serbia of the eu 's motives and the latest stalling on the saa is unlikely to help . a failure to put an agreement in place soon would " fuel a widely present perception of permanent exclusion and unparalleled conditioning , " srdjan gligorijevic , chief analyst for the belgrade-based international and security affairs centre think-tank , told reuters news agency .

the bundesliga is in danger of turning from a glittering stage into an enticing shop window . while the german top flight has n't ever been exactly below the radar , other european teams looking for new players have given their german counterparts little more than a cursory glance before taking their checkbooks to italy or spain .
more bargain basement than armani or balenciaga , the bundesliga just did n't have the same appeal as serie a or the primera liga . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : diamonds in the rough : luca toni and franck ribery but sew a few diamonds into the cut-price cloth and anyone looking for glamour will certainly spot a sparkle or two .
with the likes of luca toni , franck ribery , rafael van der vaart , miroslav klose and diego lighting up the german league , it was only a matter of time before the big spenders would spot an untapped market . two of the league 's brightest midfield stars top the shoppers ' most-wanted lists .
with the january transfer window closing at the end of the week , werder bremen and hamburg will be bracing themselves for " money 's no object " offers for diego and van der vaart respectively . van der vaart on italian shopping list italian giants juventus are hunting the two mini maestros and while bremen are trying as hard as they can to hang onto their prized brazilian playmaker , hamburg have confirmed they have already spoken to the turin team about a price for their want-away dutchman . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : van der vaart could be turin-bound " we are in discussions with juventus , but we ca n't say more at this stage , " hamburg spokesman jörn wolf recently told german agency sid . van der vaart is under contract until 2010 , but can leave hamburg next year for a fixed transfer fee of 1.5 million euros -lrb- $ 2 million -rrb- , but the 24-year-old is reported to be worth 20 million euros in the current market and hamburg may want to capitalize on that estimation , with spanish giants barcelona also interested in the diminutive dutchman . the midfielder , who made a shock move to the bundesliga from ajax in 2005 when everyone expected him to land in spain or italy , paved the way for other big names to come to the bundesliga .
his exit may prompt a similar spate of transfers in the opposite direction . diego coveted by europe 's biggest clubs diego , meanwhile , is being fiercely protected in bremen with juventus , inter milan , real madrid and chelsea all reportedly circling the weserstadion in search of his signature on the dotted line . despite juventus coach claudio ranieri 's desire to see diego play at the stadio olimpico di torino , it will take more than covetous comments to spirit werder 's top scorer away . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : diego has let his feet do the talking at bremen " there is no inquiry from juventus , and we will not talk with any clubs about signing diego , he is a firm part of our plans , " said werder 's director of sport klaus allofs , who reminded potential suitors that the brazilian is contracted until june 2011 . the reported visit of juve 's sporting director , alessio secco , to bremen last week fuelled the rumors further but diego is expected to turn out for bremen against bochum on sunday , ending the speculation - until the summer at least . bayern pair linked to premiership switch other names linked with a move away from the bundesliga this month have been bayern munich colleagues lukas podolski and daniel van buyten . podolski has been dogged by a loss of form and a series of niggling injuries since arriving at the allianz arena from fc köln in 2006 .
with the acquisition of strike partners klose and toni last summer , podolski slipped further down the pecking order , prompting a number of audacious attempts from english premiership side manchester city to sign the striker in the last few weeks . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : poldi has been the subject of frenzied transfer speculation however , the bayern higher-ups have put their foot down and have said that prinz poldi is going nowhere . " i had a very good discussion with lukas and made it clear to him he can not leave bayern , because we need him for the future , " said karl-heinz rummenigge .
" we are convinced of his quality and we are looking forward to seeing him in action again . " van buyten has been the subject of speculation ever since the bundesliga paused for the winter break with scottish champions celtic and premiership club newcastle united keen to take the defender back to the uk .
the belgian international played under new newcastle coach kevin keegan at manchester city in 2004 and has said he would be open to working with the coach again . brazilian defenders looking for pastures new bayern could also be close to losing veteran defender lucio .
the brazilian told deutsche welle last month that it was his dream to play in either italy or spain and that he hoped that he could make that dream come true before the end of his contract in 2010 . " i dream about spain and italy , " he said .
" perhaps my dream can come true a bit earlier if i can come to an agreement with the club . " another brazilian on the verge of leaving the bundesliga appears to be hertha berlin 's gilberto .
the defender is set to sign for premier league side tottenham hotspur after flying to london for a medical on sunday . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : gilberto is expected to be a spurs player by next week berlin 's coach lucien favre confirmed the 31-year-old was in the english capital at the weekend and the 27-times capped brazilian looks set to join spurs for a reported figure of 3 million euros . english clubs raid bundesliga also-rans also apparently premiership-bound is schalke 04 's out-of-favor striker peter lovenkrands .
the danish international is expected to put pen to paper at birmingham city before the transfer window closes on thursday night . joining him in england could be wolfsburg 's bosnian prodigy edin dzeko , who is a target for arsenal , and borussia mönchengladbach 's ivory coast defender steve gohouri , who could end up at wigan athletic . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

while bayern may profit , the others may rue the day he announced his return in germany .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de elections -pipe- 28.01.2008 german conservatives suffer losses in key state election großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : andrea ypsilanti brought significant gains to the spd in hesse chancellor merkel 's christian democrats -lrb- cdu -rrb- suffered major losses in a key vote in the state of hesse .
but it 's yet to be seen which party will be able to form a governing coalition . led by merkel ally and incumbent premier roland koch , who ran a controversial campaign focused on crime and immigration , the cdu took 36.8 percent of the vote , down from 48.8 percent in 2003 . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the state election in hesse polarized germans nationwide " we did n't mobilize our own supporters enough , " koch said on public television .
" this is not easily for me personally . " the rival social democrats -lrb- spd -rrb- , who rule together with merkel 's cdu at the national level , saw their support push up to 36.7 percent . " we fought for a different political culture in this country and we won , " said koch 's spd challenger , andrea ypsilanti . it remains unclear , however , which party will take power .
the entry into hesse 's parliament of the new left party - a far-left grouping which came out of a merger of a social democratic splinter group and the successor party to the former east german communists - prevents both cdu and spd from securing a majority in the 110-seat state legislature in coalition with their preferred partners , the free-market liberal fdp and the greens respectively .
the left party took home 5.1 percent , the fdp received 9.4 percent and the greens got 7.5 percent . a different case bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : despite nearly 6-point drop in votes , christian wulff will stay in power in lower saxony in another state election , in lower saxony , incumbent cdu premier christian wulff saw his support fall to 42.5 percent from 48.3 percent in 2003 .
unlike in hesse , however , his result is good enough for him to hold on to power in a coalition with the fdp . here the spd scored its worst result in recent years , declining to around 30.3 percent from 33.4 percent in 2003 . in all , some 10.5 million people were eligible to vote in the two western states , in both of which angela merkel 's christian democrats -lrb- cdu -rrb- have put up the premiers for the past five years . a blow for merkel bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel 's support for koch was not enough to help him win the election the setback which the conservatives were dealt in hesse will also be seen as a blow to the chancellor , who stood firmly behind roland koch during the election campaign and repeatedly defended koch 's proposals for tougher measures against young criminals of foreign origin . " in hesse the conservatives have suffered such losses that it is clear that koch 's election campaign has n't worked , " said richard stöss , a political scientist at berlin 's free university . the spd 's ypsilanti , on the other hand , focused in her campaign on the traditional spd themes of wages , education and the integration of minorities .
this has brought the social democrats a gain of almost 8 percent in comparison to the previous state election . the result is likely to create even more tension in the already strained relations between the cdu and spd on the national level , which some fear could result in a political stalemate in the " grand coalition " until the 2009 national elections . an important race bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : incumbent state premier roland koch has divided the nation the state elections in hesse and lower saxony were widely seen as a test of the cdu 's strength ahead of federal elections , which must be held by september 2009 . merkel remains highly popular in germany but faces risks from a slowing economy ahead of next year 's national vote . " a loss in hesse would be bad for morale for the cdu nationally and for merkel , " political scientist jürgen falter told the bild am sonntag newspaper . ypsilanti 's victory in hesse could potentially give spd chief kurt beck a boost in his bid to dismantle labor market reforms introduced by merkel 's predecessor gerhard schröder , which are credited with helping to fuel a recovery of europe 's biggest economy . social democrats would also be likely to push harder to create a national minimum wage - a popular proposal that many economists have branded a job killer . the left gaining ground bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : left party candidate in hesse , willi van ooyen the fact that both state elections showed a clear shift to the left - after years in which merkel 's conservatives outperformed the social democrats - is , nonetheless , not all good news for the spd . the left party passed the 5-percent threshold to enter the parliament in both states . it is the first time that the party , led by former finance minister oskar lafontaine , will enter parliament in a large western state . spd officials have so far ruled out any possibility of entering into coalition agreements with the left . dw staff -lrb- tt -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

but it 's yet to be seen which party will be able to form a governing coalition . led by merkel ally and incumbent premier roland koch , who ran a controversial campaign focused on crime and immigration , the cdu took 36.8 percent of the vote , down from 48.8 percent in 2003 . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the state election in hesse polarized germans nationwide " we did n't mobilize our own supporters enough , " koch said on public television .
" this is not easily for me personally . " the rival social democrats -lrb- spd -rrb- , who rule together with merkel 's cdu at the national level , saw their support push up to 36.7 percent . " we fought for a different political culture in this country and we won , " said koch 's spd challenger , andrea ypsilanti . it remains unclear , however , which party will take power .
the entry into hesse 's parliament of the new left party - a far-left grouping which came out of a merger of a social democratic splinter group and the successor party to the former east german communists - prevents both cdu and spd from securing a majority in the 110-seat state legislature in coalition with their preferred partners , the free-market liberal fdp and the greens respectively .
the left party took home 5.1 percent , the fdp received 9.4 percent and the greens got 7.5 percent . a different case bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : despite nearly 6-point drop in votes , christian wulff will stay in power in lower saxony in another state election , in lower saxony , incumbent cdu premier christian wulff saw his support fall to 42.5 percent from 48.3 percent in 2003 .
unlike in hesse , however , his result is good enough for him to hold on to power in a coalition with the fdp . here the spd scored its worst result in recent years , declining to around 30.3 percent from 33.4 percent in 2003 . in all , some 10.5 million people were eligible to vote in the two western states , in both of which angela merkel 's christian democrats -lrb- cdu -rrb- have put up the premiers for the past five years . a blow for merkel bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel 's support for koch was not enough to help him win the election the setback which the conservatives were dealt in hesse will also be seen as a blow to the chancellor , who stood firmly behind roland koch during the election campaign and repeatedly defended koch 's proposals for tougher measures against young criminals of foreign origin . " in hesse the conservatives have suffered such losses that it is clear that koch 's election campaign has n't worked , " said richard stöss , a political scientist at berlin 's free university . the spd 's ypsilanti , on the other hand , focused in her campaign on the traditional spd themes of wages , education and the integration of minorities .
this has brought the social democrats a gain of almost 8 percent in comparison to the previous state election . the result is likely to create even more tension in the already strained relations between the cdu and spd on the national level , which some fear could result in a political stalemate in the " grand coalition " until the 2009 national elections . an important race bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : incumbent state premier roland koch has divided the nation the state elections in hesse and lower saxony were widely seen as a test of the cdu 's strength ahead of federal elections , which must be held by september 2009 . merkel remains highly popular in germany but faces risks from a slowing economy ahead of next year 's national vote .

27 , many in the german press commented on the difference in conservative campaigns and what the results meant for the future of angela merkel 's party . the frankfurter rundschau wrote that incumbent premier roland koch has no one to blame but himself for the result in hesse .
" koch chose the wrong topic to champion and led the wrong election campaign , " it stated .
" he set himself up by making strong announcements which contradicted his own actions .
the public noticed that calls for swift justice from the state with the slowest judicial system in the country were implausible , and they have punished koch for this . "
the paper continued by saying that koch 's losses were also angela merkel 's losses .
" the chancellor supported this tough election campaign , " it wrote , " and now the conservatives must ask whether her governance endangers the future of the -lsb- christian democratic -rsb- union . " the bremer nachrichten pondered the consequences of the state elections for the chancellor and the cdu 's coming parliamentary election campaign .
" which way now for angela merkel ? " the paper asked .
" not only is it that social democrats -lsb- spd -rsb- must find their direction but also the conservatives .
should she take the careful approach or come out fighting like roland koch ?
reading the results from lower saxony and hesse , the decision should be clear . " " rambo koch loses , cuddly wulff wins , " stated the westdeutsche allgemeine zeitung .
" koch 's campaign failed because it focused on his weaknesses not his strengths .
there was no policy substance to his rhetoric and such a thing costs credibility , especially when policy is so important and at a time when the voters look for strong policies not just words . " the thüringer allgemeine zeitung also focused on koch 's performance .
" koch has abandoned his instincts and abandoned the voters , " it wrote .
" that the electorate reacted against this is a good thing .
it would be an ominous sign for the political culture in germany if the people had allowed themselves to have been manipulated by such a campaign .
the majority of people in hesse recognized that sloganeering is not the right approach to the multi-layered subject of juvenile delinquency .
this is why christian wulff , with his low-key election campaign , ran to a clear victory . " the stuttgarter zeitung also picked up on the differences in the conservative candidates ' approaches and results .
" the one winner in the state elections this sunday is christian wulff , which is not so surprising given the weakness of his social democratic spd opponent wolfgang jüttner , " the paper wrote .
the paper acknowledged , however , that despite the spd 's ineptitude , wulff led a winning campaign without the need to resort to the strong-arm tactics and verbal failures of his hessian colleague roland koch .
the paper suggested that wulff should be considered the heir apparent to chancellor merkel and that his victory should signal a rise in his profile within the cdu . the spd 's inability to force home a clear advantage in the state elections was also picked up on by the rhein-neckar zeitung .
" the state elections were less about regional politics and more about the performances of the candidates , " it wrote .
" the most significant signal was the fact that spd leader kurt beck could not lead a socialist election campaign which was better than that fought by the left party . "
the paper also wrote that roland koch 's performance and the chancellor 's support of his campaign should be a wake-up call to merkel , who the paper suggested should follow christian wulff 's approach , and not koch 's , in the future . the frankfurter allgemeine zeitung also lamented the state of german politics highlighted by the inability of the social democrats to capitalize on weakened and disliked conservative candidates .
the paper complained that a weak and directionless spd made the conservatives look good , despite their own poor showing .
" we now know the weaknesses of the spd , " it wrote , " poor in candidates and poor in profile … one wonders how the cdu would have responded to a stronger opponent .

but foreign ministers agreed to offer belgrade an interim agreement after the vote . the european union 's attempt to sign a full stabilization and association agreement with serbia before the presidential election on feb .
7 was hampered by the netherlands , which demanded full serbian cooperation with the un war crimes tribunal on former yugoslavia -lrb- icty -rrb- before any deal was signed . the pact , which would have secured closer ties ahead of the election run-off between serbia 's pro-european president boris tadic and nationalist challenger tomislav nikolic , a pro-russian hardliner , was intended to boost tadic 's campaign and help ease serbia 's accession to the eu . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the eu wants to boost boris tadic 's campaign instead eu ministers agreed to sign an interim agreement on cooperation covering trade and visas . " this is a text that will open up doors for serbia to the eu , " slovenian foreign minister dimitrij rupel told reporters . serbian foreign minister vuk jeremic welcomed the eu 's invitation to sign an interim political accord after the run-off election . " today is a great day , " he said .
" i hope the citizens of serbia will give us a mandate on feb .
3 to sign this agreement . " dutch european affairs minister frans timmermans said his country , which has led opposition to a lenient line on belgrade , would continue to oppose the signing of the full saa . " we will not sign till we have full cooperation with the icty , " he told reporters . timmermans insisted that his country is " prepared to sign an saa with serbia at the moment serbia hands over the people indicted by the yugoslavia tribunal , " and not before . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : nikolic is russia 's preferred candidate for the post of president the tribunal is seeking the arrest and transfer of former bosnian serb military commander ratko mladic on genocide charges over the 1995 srebrenica massacre of 7,000 bosnian muslims . the european union has made full cooperation with the tribunal a condition for signing the saa , which is a first formal step on the path to eu membership . no change in eu policy german foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier said the signing of an interim deal did not mean the eu was shying away from serbia . " the stabilization and association agreement wo n't be signed in the coming days but this does n't mean that our policy has changed , " he told journalists .
" we want to send a signal that our hand is stretched out to serbia . " the interim agreement could assist tadic in his campaign against nikolic but eu officials admitted that they had received mixed signals from belgrade as to whether a signing ceremony would hurt or help the pro-europe candidate 's prospects . tadic currently trails nikolic who took a five-point lead in the first round this weekend . eu boost to pro-europe candidate ahead of kosovo move eu leaders are keen to see tadic win to bolster pro-european forces ahead of an expected declaration of independence by politicians in the serbian province of kosovo . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the eu plans to boost its forces in kosovo the leaders of kosovo 's ethnic albanian majority , who make up 90 percent of the province 's 2 million people , say they are within weeks of declaring independence from serbia . the eu plans to send a 1,800-persn strong mission to kosovo to help ease its transition to local rule , but is still waiting for a signal from un secretary-general ban ki-moon to do so .
the united nations has run kosovo since 1999 , when a nato bombing campaign drove out belgrade 's forces waging a crackdown on independence-seeking ethnic albanians . failure to deliver may increase serbian distrust in eu bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : serbia " wo n't give away kosovo " to help ease serbia 's pain in losing a province belgrade considers to be an integral part of its territory and culture , the eu has made several moves in recent months to bring serbia into the fold .
but there is much skepticism in serbia of the eu 's motives and the latest stalling on the saa is unlikely to help . a failure to put an agreement in place soon would " fuel a widely present perception of permanent exclusion and unparalleled conditioning , " srdjan gligorijevic , chief analyst for the belgrade-based international and security affairs centre think-tank , told reuters news agency .

before take-off , you have to strip off . " ladies and gentleman , in preparation for take-off , please ensure your seatback is upright , your hand luggage is safely stowed , and that you 've removed all your clothing . " that 's what the on-board announcement en route to the isle of usedom might sound like if internet travel agency ossiurlaub.de succeeds with plans to launch the first nudist charter flight to the popular baltic sea destination in july .
the flight personnel making the announcements will be fully dressed , however - for security reasons . ossiurlaub.de thinks its innovative nudist flight is the perfect way to target eastern germany 's large population of " fkk " devotees .
fkk , the abbreviation of the german term for " free body culture , " is essentially naturism , and was an authorized and extremely popular tradition under communist rule . grin and bare it many eastern germans , nicknamed " ossis , " are nostalgic for that tradition , especially now that they feel frowned upon by their more prudish western german neighbors . " in the former east germany , naturist holidays were a much-loved way of spending the best weeks of the year , " said the founder of ossiurlaub.de , enrico hess .
" we want to make that freedom possible above the clouds , too . " the first nude flight will be a day-trip on july 5 between erfurt and usedom , with its many fkk beaches . " all the passengers will fly naked , but they will only be allowed to undress once they are in the plane , " hess said .
" but then they will be able to enjoy the hour-long flight in the way god intended . " tickets cost 499 euros -lrb- $ 735 -rrb- and there are just 50 seats available on the jet - there was no word on whether the seat cushions would be dry cleaned between flights . if the virgin flight is a success , regular flights to usedom or other destinations will be planned , hess said . dw staff -lrb- dc -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the bundesliga is in danger of turning from a glittering stage into an enticing shop window . while the german top flight has n't ever been exactly below the radar , other european teams looking for new players have given their german counterparts little more than a cursory glance before taking their checkbooks to italy or spain .

with the likes of luca toni , franck ribery , rafael van der vaart , miroslav klose and diego lighting up the german league , it was only a matter of time before the big spenders would spot an untapped market . two of the league 's brightest midfield stars top the shoppers ' most-wanted lists .
with the january transfer window closing at the end of the week , werder bremen and hamburg will be bracing themselves for " money 's no object " offers for diego and van der vaart respectively . van der vaart on italian shopping list italian giants juventus are hunting the two mini maestros and while bremen are trying as hard as they can to hang onto their prized brazilian playmaker , hamburg have confirmed they have already spoken to the turin team about a price for their want-away dutchman . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : van der vaart could be turin-bound " we are in discussions with juventus , but we ca n't say more at this stage , " hamburg spokesman jörn wolf recently told german agency sid . van der vaart is under contract until 2010 , but can leave hamburg next year for a fixed transfer fee of 1.5 million euros -lrb- $ 2 million -rrb- , but the 24-year-old is reported to be worth 20 million euros in the current market and hamburg may want to capitalize on that estimation , with spanish giants barcelona also interested in the diminutive dutchman . the midfielder , who made a shock move to the bundesliga from ajax in 2005 when everyone expected him to land in spain or italy , paved the way for other big names to come to the bundesliga .

the belgian international played under new newcastle coach kevin keegan at manchester city in 2004 and has said he would be open to working with the coach again . brazilian defenders looking for pastures new bayern could also be close to losing veteran defender lucio .
the brazilian told deutsche welle last month that it was his dream to play in either italy or spain and that he hoped that he could make that dream come true before the end of his contract in 2010 . " i dream about spain and italy , " he said .
" perhaps my dream can come true a bit earlier if i can come to an agreement with the club . " another brazilian on the verge of leaving the bundesliga appears to be hertha berlin 's gilberto .

the bundesliga is in danger of turning from a glittering stage into an enticing shop window . while the german top flight has n't ever been exactly below the radar , other european teams looking for new players have given their german counterparts little more than a cursory glance before taking their checkbooks to italy or spain .
more bargain basement than armani or balenciaga , the bundesliga just did n't have the same appeal as serie a or the primera liga . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : diamonds in the rough : luca toni and franck ribery but sew a few diamonds into the cut-price cloth and anyone looking for glamour will certainly spot a sparkle or two .
with the likes of luca toni , franck ribery , rafael van der vaart , miroslav klose and diego lighting up the german league , it was only a matter of time before the big spenders would spot an untapped market . two of the league 's brightest midfield stars top the shoppers ' most-wanted lists .
with the january transfer window closing at the end of the week , werder bremen and hamburg will be bracing themselves for " money 's no object " offers for diego and van der vaart respectively . van der vaart on italian shopping list italian giants juventus are hunting the two mini maestros and while bremen are trying as hard as they can to hang onto their prized brazilian playmaker , hamburg have confirmed they have already spoken to the turin team about a price for their want-away dutchman . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : van der vaart could be turin-bound " we are in discussions with juventus , but we ca n't say more at this stage , " hamburg spokesman jörn wolf recently told german agency sid . van der vaart is under contract until 2010 , but can leave hamburg next year for a fixed transfer fee of 1.5 million euros -lrb- $ 2 million -rrb- , but the 24-year-old is reported to be worth 20 million euros in the current market and hamburg may want to capitalize on that estimation , with spanish giants barcelona also interested in the diminutive dutchman . the midfielder , who made a shock move to the bundesliga from ajax in 2005 when everyone expected him to land in spain or italy , paved the way for other big names to come to the bundesliga .
his exit may prompt a similar spate of transfers in the opposite direction . diego coveted by europe 's biggest clubs diego , meanwhile , is being fiercely protected in bremen with juventus , inter milan , real madrid and chelsea all reportedly circling the weserstadion in search of his signature on the dotted line . despite juventus coach claudio ranieri 's desire to see diego play at the stadio olimpico di torino , it will take more than covetous comments to spirit werder 's top scorer away . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : diego has let his feet do the talking at bremen " there is no inquiry from juventus , and we will not talk with any clubs about signing diego , he is a firm part of our plans , " said werder 's director of sport klaus allofs , who reminded potential suitors that the brazilian is contracted until june 2011 . the reported visit of juve 's sporting director , alessio secco , to bremen last week fuelled the rumors further but diego is expected to turn out for bremen against bochum on sunday , ending the speculation - until the summer at least . bayern pair linked to premiership switch other names linked with a move away from the bundesliga this month have been bayern munich colleagues lukas podolski and daniel van buyten . podolski has been dogged by a loss of form and a series of niggling injuries since arriving at the allianz arena from fc köln in 2006 .
with the acquisition of strike partners klose and toni last summer , podolski slipped further down the pecking order , prompting a number of audacious attempts from english premiership side manchester city to sign the striker in the last few weeks . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : poldi has been the subject of frenzied transfer speculation however , the bayern higher-ups have put their foot down and have said that prinz poldi is going nowhere .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de politics -pipe- 28.01.2008 lessons learned , hesse leaders scramble to form government großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hit by losses after a negative campaign , koch will likely lose his leadership role the morning after elections in the state of hesse , losses for the conservatives and a strong showing by a new left-wing party had observers speculating on a new government - and castigating the incumbent . the shape of a new government coalition in the state of hesse was unclear after stunning losses robbed angela merkel 's conservatives of their clear majority and the far left saw surprise gains .
after the votes were counted , hesse 's incumbent premier , roland koch , had a hair-thin majority , making uncertain the sort of coalition that could form a government and what role the candidate koch - who had led a controversial , openly xenophobic campaign - could have in it .
at midmorning on monday , jan .
28 , political advisers from all parties involved had holed up for strategy meetings .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ypsilanti will likely lead a coalition - but with whom ?
official results from hesse showed the conservative cdu had slumped from a majority in the state legislature to finish only nominally ahead of the center-left social democrats -lrb- spd -rrb- , with the same number of seats .
the spd candidate in hesse , andrea ypsilanti , took 36.7 percent of the vote against the cdu 's 36.8 .
search for a coalition a deputy cdu leader in another state , premier christian wulff of lower saxony , won re-election in a separate vote sunday , despite moderate losses .
the left , a combination of former social democrats and eastern ex-communists , extended its reach in western germany to enter both state parliaments .
but gains for the left party and spd in hesse mean the cdu , together with its planned coalition partner free democrats -lrb- fdp -rrb- , no longer have a large enough majority to rule in the state parliament in wiesbaden .
this gives a clear mandate to the spd to enter the state government in hesse , according to acting spd chairwoman andrea nahles .
voters saw to it that koch took " the most brutal beating possible , " nahles told rbb news radio on monday .
while the spd failed " by a nose " to gain a clear majority , it was clear that the voters in the western state increasingly stood behind the center-left party , and it should therefore be part of the government , she said .
ypsilanti is currently in talks with other party representatives to discuss coalition possibilities .
but nahles reiterated ypsilanti 's campaign promise that her party would not enter into a coalition with the upsurge , far-left left party , saying " the program and the people that they represent in hesse do not stand for stability in government . "
" traffic light " coalition possible ?
meanwhile , spd secretary general hubertus heil called for a " traffic light " coalition to rule hesse , which would be made up of the spd -lrb- red -rrb- , free democrats -lrb- yellow -rrb- and green party , under the leadership of ypsilanti .
" there is a koch-must-go mood -lsb- among voters -rsb- that we have to take into account when making up the government , " heil told zdf television talk show morgenmagazin on monday .
" we will present the premier , i am fairly sure of that , " he said .
yet a parliamentary leader of the fdp from hesse , jörg-uwe hahn , said there is no way that his party would enter into a " traffic light " coalition .
the fdp had planned to be coalition partner with the right-wing cdu , and could not be used as " a training wheel for a red-green " coalition , he told the dpa press agency .
hahn predicted a coalition would form between the spd , greens and the left party .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel 's cdu should avoid negative campaigns , one observer said amid the speculations on a new government , political observers took the time to mull over just what went so very wrong in the campaign of incumbent koch - and what it could mean for the larger question of cdu domination in german politics .
koch faulted for polarizing strategy chemnitz-based election researcher eckhard jesse said the cdu should see the campaign as a powerful lesson . with his polarizing , xenophobic rhetoric about youth-crime , koch led the campaign as if he were an opposition candidate , not an incumbent , jesse told the thüringer allgemeine newspaper .
merkel and other cdu candidates need to draw the conclusion that " they should take the same tact as wulff , " who handily won the state election in lower saxony .
" that means that they should run a low-key , feel-good campaign .
they should n't polarize - especially not the chancellor , " he said .
and political scientist theo schiller said koch had reaped what he sowed from his controversial style .
" if koch had n't focused his campaign on youth crime and young offenders , the results might have been slightly different , " the professor at the university of marburg told dpa .
the results were " catastrophic " for the cdu , he said .
by focusing on youth crime , koch aimed to harm the spd , but instead pilloried his own party , schiller said .
" he raised the question of deficits during the years his own government had ruled , " he said .
and was not able to give any satisfactory answers , he added .
no stopping rise of the left like a number of other german political analysts , schiller saw the left party 's gains as a sign of things to come .
" we can expect the left to enter other state parliaments , " he told dpa .
but he also said he did not see the likelihood of the left entering into a ruling coalition in hesse together with the spd .
that would mean ypsilanti would have to go back on her word to too great an extent , he said . dw staff -lrb- jen -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

27 , many in the german press commented on the difference in conservative campaigns and what the results meant for the future of angela merkel 's party . the frankfurter rundschau wrote that incumbent premier roland koch has no one to blame but himself for the result in hesse .
" koch chose the wrong topic to champion and led the wrong election campaign , " it stated .
" he set himself up by making strong announcements which contradicted his own actions .
the public noticed that calls for swift justice from the state with the slowest judicial system in the country were implausible , and they have punished koch for this . "
the paper continued by saying that koch 's losses were also angela merkel 's losses .
" the chancellor supported this tough election campaign , " it wrote , " and now the conservatives must ask whether her governance endangers the future of the -lsb- christian democratic -rsb- union . " the bremer nachrichten pondered the consequences of the state elections for the chancellor and the cdu 's coming parliamentary election campaign .
" which way now for angela merkel ? " the paper asked .
" not only is it that social democrats -lsb- spd -rsb- must find their direction but also the conservatives .
should she take the careful approach or come out fighting like roland koch ?
reading the results from lower saxony and hesse , the decision should be clear . " " rambo koch loses , cuddly wulff wins , " stated the westdeutsche allgemeine zeitung .
" koch 's campaign failed because it focused on his weaknesses not his strengths .
there was no policy substance to his rhetoric and such a thing costs credibility , especially when policy is so important and at a time when the voters look for strong policies not just words . " the thüringer allgemeine zeitung also focused on koch 's performance .
" koch has abandoned his instincts and abandoned the voters , " it wrote .
" that the electorate reacted against this is a good thing .
it would be an ominous sign for the political culture in germany if the people had allowed themselves to have been manipulated by such a campaign .
the majority of people in hesse recognized that sloganeering is not the right approach to the multi-layered subject of juvenile delinquency .
this is why christian wulff , with his low-key election campaign , ran to a clear victory . " the stuttgarter zeitung also picked up on the differences in the conservative candidates ' approaches and results .
" the one winner in the state elections this sunday is christian wulff , which is not so surprising given the weakness of his social democratic spd opponent wolfgang jüttner , " the paper wrote .
the paper acknowledged , however , that despite the spd 's ineptitude , wulff led a winning campaign without the need to resort to the strong-arm tactics and verbal failures of his hessian colleague roland koch .
the paper suggested that wulff should be considered the heir apparent to chancellor merkel and that his victory should signal a rise in his profile within the cdu . the spd 's inability to force home a clear advantage in the state elections was also picked up on by the rhein-neckar zeitung .
" the state elections were less about regional politics and more about the performances of the candidates , " it wrote .
" the most significant signal was the fact that spd leader kurt beck could not lead a socialist election campaign which was better than that fought by the left party . "
the paper also wrote that roland koch 's performance and the chancellor 's support of his campaign should be a wake-up call to merkel , who the paper suggested should follow christian wulff 's approach , and not koch 's , in the future . the frankfurter allgemeine zeitung also lamented the state of german politics highlighted by the inability of the social democrats to capitalize on weakened and disliked conservative candidates .
the paper complained that a weak and directionless spd made the conservatives look good , despite their own poor showing .
" we now know the weaknesses of the spd , " it wrote , " poor in candidates and poor in profile … one wonders how the cdu would have responded to a stronger opponent .

27 , many in the german press commented on the difference in conservative campaigns and what the results meant for the future of angela merkel 's party . the frankfurter rundschau wrote that incumbent premier roland koch has no one to blame but himself for the result in hesse .
" koch chose the wrong topic to champion and led the wrong election campaign , " it stated .
" he set himself up by making strong announcements which contradicted his own actions .
the public noticed that calls for swift justice from the state with the slowest judicial system in the country were implausible , and they have punished koch for this . "
the paper continued by saying that koch 's losses were also angela merkel 's losses .
" the chancellor supported this tough election campaign , " it wrote , " and now the conservatives must ask whether her governance endangers the future of the -lsb- christian democratic -rsb- union . " the bremer nachrichten pondered the consequences of the state elections for the chancellor and the cdu 's coming parliamentary election campaign .
" which way now for angela merkel ? " the paper asked .
" not only is it that social democrats -lsb- spd -rsb- must find their direction but also the conservatives .
should she take the careful approach or come out fighting like roland koch ?
reading the results from lower saxony and hesse , the decision should be clear . " " rambo koch loses , cuddly wulff wins , " stated the westdeutsche allgemeine zeitung .
" koch 's campaign failed because it focused on his weaknesses not his strengths .
there was no policy substance to his rhetoric and such a thing costs credibility , especially when policy is so important and at a time when the voters look for strong policies not just words . " the thüringer allgemeine zeitung also focused on koch 's performance .
" koch has abandoned his instincts and abandoned the voters , " it wrote .
" that the electorate reacted against this is a good thing .
it would be an ominous sign for the political culture in germany if the people had allowed themselves to have been manipulated by such a campaign .
the majority of people in hesse recognized that sloganeering is not the right approach to the multi-layered subject of juvenile delinquency .
this is why christian wulff , with his low-key election campaign , ran to a clear victory . " the stuttgarter zeitung also picked up on the differences in the conservative candidates ' approaches and results .
" the one winner in the state elections this sunday is christian wulff , which is not so surprising given the weakness of his social democratic spd opponent wolfgang jüttner , " the paper wrote .
the paper acknowledged , however , that despite the spd 's ineptitude , wulff led a winning campaign without the need to resort to the strong-arm tactics and verbal failures of his hessian colleague roland koch .
the paper suggested that wulff should be considered the heir apparent to chancellor merkel and that his victory should signal a rise in his profile within the cdu . the spd 's inability to force home a clear advantage in the state elections was also picked up on by the rhein-neckar zeitung .
" the state elections were less about regional politics and more about the performances of the candidates , " it wrote .
" the most significant signal was the fact that spd leader kurt beck could not lead a socialist election campaign which was better than that fought by the left party . "
the paper also wrote that roland koch 's performance and the chancellor 's support of his campaign should be a wake-up call to merkel , who the paper suggested should follow christian wulff 's approach , and not koch 's , in the future . the frankfurter allgemeine zeitung also lamented the state of german politics highlighted by the inability of the social democrats to capitalize on weakened and disliked conservative candidates .
the paper complained that a weak and directionless spd made the conservatives look good , despite their own poor showing .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de players -pipe- 28.01.2008 europe 's big spenders track bundesliga stars großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : this season 's hottest items : werder bremen 's diego and hamburg 's van der vaart as many of europe 's top leagues face a frantic week of dealing before the january transfer window closes , the continent 's big spenders are looking to come to germany for some last minute shopping . the bundesliga may be enjoying its most glamorous season in years thanks to the international stars who have chosen to ply their trade in germany , but question remains as to how long it can maintain its new celebrity status . while the big names and transfer coups have turned the media spotlight on german soccer in a way previously thought beyond its means , the downside of this attention is becoming obvious .
the bundesliga is in danger of turning from a glittering stage into an enticing shop window . while the german top flight has n't ever been exactly below the radar , other european teams looking for new players have given their german counterparts little more than a cursory glance before taking their checkbooks to italy or spain .
more bargain basement than armani or balenciaga , the bundesliga just did n't have the same appeal as serie a or the primera liga . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : diamonds in the rough : luca toni and franck ribery but sew a few diamonds into the cut-price cloth and anyone looking for glamour will certainly spot a sparkle or two .
with the likes of luca toni , franck ribery , rafael van der vaart , miroslav klose and diego lighting up the german league , it was only a matter of time before the big spenders would spot an untapped market . two of the league 's brightest midfield stars top the shoppers ' most-wanted lists .
with the january transfer window closing at the end of the week , werder bremen and hamburg will be bracing themselves for " money 's no object " offers for diego and van der vaart respectively . van der vaart on italian shopping list italian giants juventus are hunting the two mini maestros and while bremen are trying as hard as they can to hang onto their prized brazilian playmaker , hamburg have confirmed they have already spoken to the turin team about a price for their want-away dutchman . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : van der vaart could be turin-bound " we are in discussions with juventus , but we ca n't say more at this stage , " hamburg spokesman jörn wolf recently told german agency sid . van der vaart is under contract until 2010 , but can leave hamburg next year for a fixed transfer fee of 1.5 million euros -lrb- $ 2 million -rrb- , but the 24-year-old is reported to be worth 20 million euros in the current market and hamburg may want to capitalize on that estimation , with spanish giants barcelona also interested in the diminutive dutchman . the midfielder , who made a shock move to the bundesliga from ajax in 2005 when everyone expected him to land in spain or italy , paved the way for other big names to come to the bundesliga .
his exit may prompt a similar spate of transfers in the opposite direction . diego coveted by europe 's biggest clubs diego , meanwhile , is being fiercely protected in bremen with juventus , inter milan , real madrid and chelsea all reportedly circling the weserstadion in search of his signature on the dotted line . despite juventus coach claudio ranieri 's desire to see diego play at the stadio olimpico di torino , it will take more than covetous comments to spirit werder 's top scorer away . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : diego has let his feet do the talking at bremen " there is no inquiry from juventus , and we will not talk with any clubs about signing diego , he is a firm part of our plans , " said werder 's director of sport klaus allofs , who reminded potential suitors that the brazilian is contracted until june 2011 . the reported visit of juve 's sporting director , alessio secco , to bremen last week fuelled the rumors further but diego is expected to turn out for bremen against bochum on sunday , ending the speculation - until the summer at least . bayern pair linked to premiership switch other names linked with a move away from the bundesliga this month have been bayern munich colleagues lukas podolski and daniel van buyten . podolski has been dogged by a loss of form and a series of niggling injuries since arriving at the allianz arena from fc köln in 2006 .
with the acquisition of strike partners klose and toni last summer , podolski slipped further down the pecking order , prompting a number of audacious attempts from english premiership side manchester city to sign the striker in the last few weeks . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : poldi has been the subject of frenzied transfer speculation however , the bayern higher-ups have put their foot down and have said that prinz poldi is going nowhere . " i had a very good discussion with lukas and made it clear to him he can not leave bayern , because we need him for the future , " said karl-heinz rummenigge .
" we are convinced of his quality and we are looking forward to seeing him in action again . " van buyten has been the subject of speculation ever since the bundesliga paused for the winter break with scottish champions celtic and premiership club newcastle united keen to take the defender back to the uk .
the belgian international played under new newcastle coach kevin keegan at manchester city in 2004 and has said he would be open to working with the coach again . brazilian defenders looking for pastures new bayern could also be close to losing veteran defender lucio .
the brazilian told deutsche welle last month that it was his dream to play in either italy or spain and that he hoped that he could make that dream come true before the end of his contract in 2010 . " i dream about spain and italy , " he said .
" perhaps my dream can come true a bit earlier if i can come to an agreement with the club . " another brazilian on the verge of leaving the bundesliga appears to be hertha berlin 's gilberto .
the defender is set to sign for premier league side tottenham hotspur after flying to london for a medical on sunday . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : gilberto is expected to be a spurs player by next week berlin 's coach lucien favre confirmed the 31-year-old was in the english capital at the weekend and the 27-times capped brazilian looks set to join spurs for a reported figure of 3 million euros . english clubs raid bundesliga also-rans also apparently premiership-bound is schalke 04 's out-of-favor striker peter lovenkrands .
the danish international is expected to put pen to paper at birmingham city before the transfer window closes on thursday night . joining him in england could be wolfsburg 's bosnian prodigy edin dzeko , who is a target for arsenal , and borussia mönchengladbach 's ivory coast defender steve gohouri , who could end up at wigan athletic . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

france is slated to contribute the most troops . at their regular monthly meeting , the union 's 27 foreign ministers on monday , jan .
28 , authorized the force 's commander , lt. gen. patrick nash , to order the deployment of his troops . " in conducting this operation the eu is stepping up its long-standing action in support of efforts to tackle the crisis in darfur and to address its regional ramifications , " the foreign ministers said in a statement . the force , which is to provide security for locals and un aid teams in eastern chad and the north-eastern central african republic along the border with the war-torn sudanese province of darfur , was proposed by france and approved in concept by eu leaders on oct .
15 . however , arguments then broke out over the resources which each member state should commit to the operation , with the eu 's 27 nations initially unable to scrape together the helicopters and transport planes needed to support the 3,700-man mission . bildunterschrift : hundreds of thousand have been uprooted by violence in the region that obstacle was finally overcome in early january , when russia and ukraine - neither of which is an eu member - offered to provide the missing hardware . the backbone of the " bridging operation , " which is mandated to run for a year , will be made up of an estimated 2,000 french troops .
however , the appointment of nash - an irishman - guarantees the multinational nature of the force , diplomats said . ireland and poland are set to send some 400 troops each .
the deployment is expected to begin in march , with the mission coming up to full strength by may 1 . the mission is expected to cost 119 million euros -lrb- $ 175 million -rrb- . nash is set to control the operation from the mont valerien military base in france .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de europe -pipe- 28.01.2008 belgium 's german minority mostly unmoved by autonomy debate großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the belgian unity question centers on flanders and wallonia and neglects other regions the belgian interim government may have silenced separatist rhetoric for now but the divisive problems have not gone away .
the country 's german-speaking minority is maintaining a low profile in the debate . the debate concerning the political crisis in belgium and the unlikely , yet much discussed , possibility of the country splitting , has focused firmly on the disagreements between the two main linguistic areas , french-speaking wallonia and flemish-speaking flanders .
though these two areas are the largest in terms of size , and also importance when it comes to deciding policies which affect the whole country , belgium has in fact been divided into four linguistic regions since the early 1960s .
besides wallonia in the south and flanders in the north , there is the bilingual brussels capital region and the tiny german-speaking area in the east cantons .
while brussels is sometimes left out of the debate over belgium 's future - due mainly to its bilingualism , its self-sufficiency and its status as an international city - the east cantons seem to be ignored altogether when it comes to discussing the linguistic and cultural divide .
a region of 854 square kilometers -lrb- 530 square miles -rrb- with a population of over 73,000 , of which almost 100 percent are german speaking , the east cantons can quite easily be overlooked in belgium 's controversial situation .
the juicy arguments and stubborn nationalist positions of the more powerful flemings and walloons make for far better headlines than a quirky little germanic outpost on the far eastern border .
similar challenges and yet , the german-speaking community of the east cantons , as a linguistic minority within the federal state of belgium , faces similar challenges to those causing strife between " the big two . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the seat of german-speaking power is based in eupen granted internal rule in 1973 , the region has its own parliament in the capital of eupen and control over linguistic and cultural matters .
the parliament organizes elections , supervises the regional government , and adopts decrees for the german-speaking community .
the east cantons also have committees charged with governing areas such as education , social policy , health and employment .
despite this illusion of self-rule , however , the region still remains part of french-speaking wallonia , located as it is in the province of liege , and is therefore kept under the watchful eye of the wallon parliament .
it is not surprising that there are some in the east cantons who have themselves expressed a desire for the kind of autonomy favored by the more extreme elements on either side of the main linguistic divide .
a small but growing number have been voicing their support for an independent mini-state .
as is the case in the rest of the country , this is not a view shared by the whole population of the east cantons .
to get an idea how the german-speaking region and its people view their role in the wider belgian community , dw-world.de talked to jean-claude franken , the secretary of the german-speaking community 's christian social party -lrb- csp -rrb- , a cooperation partner of the francophone humanist democratic center -lrb- cdh -rrb- in the belgian parliament .
dw-world.de : is belgium 's german-speaking minority well integrated ?
jean-claude franken : the german-speaking minority is integrated in the belgian federal state very well .
there are special laws within the belgian constitution that protect the german-speaking community here .
how much power does the german-speaking minority have in belgium ?
the german-speaking community is an equal partner in the belgian federal state .
that is because there is no favoritism towards any of the linguistic minorities in the country in terms of the divulgence of power .
in the federal government , of course , the larger regions have the biggest political parties and therefore more seats in parliament , but our cooperation with the cdh allows us to have our say as part of wallonia .
in regional terms , the parties within the east canton - the csp , the socialist party , the party for freedom and progress and the party for german-speaking belgians - ensure that the autonomy we enjoy is used to make the community as self-reliant and efficient as possible .
does the german-speaking minority in belgium consider itself german or belgian ?
in former times , the region was part of prussia and therefore a small part of germany .
during world war ii , it was annexed again by germany after being part of belgium since the end of the great war .
when the east canton was returned to belgium once more in 1945 , some who lived there regretted this and wanted to stay german ; these were the same people who welcomed the occupying nazi forces .
however , as belgium has grown as a nation of diversity and understanding , the german-speaking community has become very integrated in the country and contact with out neighboring regions has increased over the years .
as a result , the german speakers consider themselves to be fully-fledged belgians and are accepted as such by their flemish and walloon compatriots .
could the german-speaking area support itself if belgium separated ?
if not , would it consider joining another region or hope to become part of germany again ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : lambertz has spoken of his support for regional autonomy the question of splitting belgium is a moot point .
it wo n't happen .
but for the sake of argument , despite its current state of stable and competent government , the german-speaking community would struggle to support itself in this hypothetical scenario and would have to join either wallonia or another state area .
there are some who push for this in the german-speaking community .
the current premier karl-heinz lambertz of the socialist party is one of the most prominent proponents of this idea .
these people say , as do the flemish , that wallonia is too much of a burden with its financial and social problems .
lambertz and others want a full transfer of powers from wallonia to the german-speaking parliament resulting in full regional autonomy .
is the cultural identity of the german-speaking minority strong ?
how is it protected ?
the cultural identity of the german speakers is deeply rooted .
our culture expresses itself in the german language spoken by the region 's people , the traditions that remain strong there and the creative and artistic expression in the region .
the position of the german-speaking community in the belgian federal state and its culture is protected by law in the constitution .
there are no worries within the community that the cultural identity of the german-speaking minority is under threat in belgium or by any policy of enlargement or expansion from the european union .
is the german-speaking minority in belgium influenced by the decisions of the european union ?
of course .
the eu has an influence on all countries which are member states , and that of course means that those people and minorities in those member states are influenced by eu policy .
the difference is that , unlike some minorities across europe , the german-speaking community does not fear these policies but welcomes them . nick amies send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the country 's german-speaking minority is maintaining a low profile in the debate . the debate concerning the political crisis in belgium and the unlikely , yet much discussed , possibility of the country splitting , has focused firmly on the disagreements between the two main linguistic areas , french-speaking wallonia and flemish-speaking flanders .
though these two areas are the largest in terms of size , and also importance when it comes to deciding policies which affect the whole country , belgium has in fact been divided into four linguistic regions since the early 1960s .
besides wallonia in the south and flanders in the north , there is the bilingual brussels capital region and the tiny german-speaking area in the east cantons .
while brussels is sometimes left out of the debate over belgium 's future - due mainly to its bilingualism , its self-sufficiency and its status as an international city - the east cantons seem to be ignored altogether when it comes to discussing the linguistic and cultural divide .
a region of 854 square kilometers -lrb- 530 square miles -rrb- with a population of over 73,000 , of which almost 100 percent are german speaking , the east cantons can quite easily be overlooked in belgium 's controversial situation .
the juicy arguments and stubborn nationalist positions of the more powerful flemings and walloons make for far better headlines than a quirky little germanic outpost on the far eastern border .
similar challenges and yet , the german-speaking community of the east cantons , as a linguistic minority within the federal state of belgium , faces similar challenges to those causing strife between " the big two . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the seat of german-speaking power is based in eupen granted internal rule in 1973 , the region has its own parliament in the capital of eupen and control over linguistic and cultural matters .
the parliament organizes elections , supervises the regional government , and adopts decrees for the german-speaking community .
the east cantons also have committees charged with governing areas such as education , social policy , health and employment .

but for the sake of argument , despite its current state of stable and competent government , the german-speaking community would struggle to support itself in this hypothetical scenario and would have to join either wallonia or another state area .
there are some who push for this in the german-speaking community .
the current premier karl-heinz lambertz of the socialist party is one of the most prominent proponents of this idea .
these people say , as do the flemish , that wallonia is too much of a burden with its financial and social problems .

the cultural identity of the german speakers is deeply rooted .

the country 's german-speaking minority is maintaining a low profile in the debate . the debate concerning the political crisis in belgium and the unlikely , yet much discussed , possibility of the country splitting , has focused firmly on the disagreements between the two main linguistic areas , french-speaking wallonia and flemish-speaking flanders .
though these two areas are the largest in terms of size , and also importance when it comes to deciding policies which affect the whole country , belgium has in fact been divided into four linguistic regions since the early 1960s .
besides wallonia in the south and flanders in the north , there is the bilingual brussels capital region and the tiny german-speaking area in the east cantons .
while brussels is sometimes left out of the debate over belgium 's future - due mainly to its bilingualism , its self-sufficiency and its status as an international city - the east cantons seem to be ignored altogether when it comes to discussing the linguistic and cultural divide .
a region of 854 square kilometers -lrb- 530 square miles -rrb- with a population of over 73,000 , of which almost 100 percent are german speaking , the east cantons can quite easily be overlooked in belgium 's controversial situation .
the juicy arguments and stubborn nationalist positions of the more powerful flemings and walloons make for far better headlines than a quirky little germanic outpost on the far eastern border .
similar challenges and yet , the german-speaking community of the east cantons , as a linguistic minority within the federal state of belgium , faces similar challenges to those causing strife between " the big two . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the seat of german-speaking power is based in eupen granted internal rule in 1973 , the region has its own parliament in the capital of eupen and control over linguistic and cultural matters .
the parliament organizes elections , supervises the regional government , and adopts decrees for the german-speaking community .
the east cantons also have committees charged with governing areas such as education , social policy , health and employment .
despite this illusion of self-rule , however , the region still remains part of french-speaking wallonia , located as it is in the province of liege , and is therefore kept under the watchful eye of the wallon parliament .
it is not surprising that there are some in the east cantons who have themselves expressed a desire for the kind of autonomy favored by the more extreme elements on either side of the main linguistic divide .
a small but growing number have been voicing their support for an independent mini-state .
as is the case in the rest of the country , this is not a view shared by the whole population of the east cantons .
to get an idea how the german-speaking region and its people view their role in the wider belgian community , dw-world.de talked to jean-claude franken , the secretary of the german-speaking community 's christian social party -lrb- csp -rrb- , a cooperation partner of the francophone humanist democratic center -lrb- cdh -rrb- in the belgian parliament .
dw-world.de : is belgium 's german-speaking minority well integrated ?
jean-claude franken : the german-speaking minority is integrated in the belgian federal state very well .
there are special laws within the belgian constitution that protect the german-speaking community here .
how much power does the german-speaking minority have in belgium ?
the german-speaking community is an equal partner in the belgian federal state .
that is because there is no favoritism towards any of the linguistic minorities in the country in terms of the divulgence of power .
in the federal government , of course , the larger regions have the biggest political parties and therefore more seats in parliament , but our cooperation with the cdh allows us to have our say as part of wallonia .
in regional terms , the parties within the east canton - the csp , the socialist party , the party for freedom and progress and the party for german-speaking belgians - ensure that the autonomy we enjoy is used to make the community as self-reliant and efficient as possible .
does the german-speaking minority in belgium consider itself german or belgian ?
in former times , the region was part of prussia and therefore a small part of germany .
during world war ii , it was annexed again by germany after being part of belgium since the end of the great war .
when the east canton was returned to belgium once more in 1945 , some who lived there regretted this and wanted to stay german ; these were the same people who welcomed the occupying nazi forces .
however , as belgium has grown as a nation of diversity and understanding , the german-speaking community has become very integrated in the country and contact with out neighboring regions has increased over the years .
as a result , the german speakers consider themselves to be fully-fledged belgians and are accepted as such by their flemish and walloon compatriots .
could the german-speaking area support itself if belgium separated ?
if not , would it consider joining another region or hope to become part of germany again ?

27 , many in the german press commented on the difference in conservative campaigns and what the results meant for the future of angela merkel 's party . the frankfurter rundschau wrote that incumbent premier roland koch has no one to blame but himself for the result in hesse .
" koch chose the wrong topic to champion and led the wrong election campaign , " it stated .
" he set himself up by making strong announcements which contradicted his own actions .
the public noticed that calls for swift justice from the state with the slowest judicial system in the country were implausible , and they have punished koch for this . "
the paper continued by saying that koch 's losses were also angela merkel 's losses .
" the chancellor supported this tough election campaign , " it wrote , " and now the conservatives must ask whether her governance endangers the future of the -lsb- christian democratic -rsb- union . " the bremer nachrichten pondered the consequences of the state elections for the chancellor and the cdu 's coming parliamentary election campaign .
" which way now for angela merkel ? " the paper asked .
" not only is it that social democrats -lsb- spd -rsb- must find their direction but also the conservatives .
should she take the careful approach or come out fighting like roland koch ?
reading the results from lower saxony and hesse , the decision should be clear . " " rambo koch loses , cuddly wulff wins , " stated the westdeutsche allgemeine zeitung .
" koch 's campaign failed because it focused on his weaknesses not his strengths .
there was no policy substance to his rhetoric and such a thing costs credibility , especially when policy is so important and at a time when the voters look for strong policies not just words . " the thüringer allgemeine zeitung also focused on koch 's performance .
" koch has abandoned his instincts and abandoned the voters , " it wrote .
" that the electorate reacted against this is a good thing .
it would be an ominous sign for the political culture in germany if the people had allowed themselves to have been manipulated by such a campaign .
the majority of people in hesse recognized that sloganeering is not the right approach to the multi-layered subject of juvenile delinquency .
this is why christian wulff , with his low-key election campaign , ran to a clear victory . " the stuttgarter zeitung also picked up on the differences in the conservative candidates ' approaches and results .
" the one winner in the state elections this sunday is christian wulff , which is not so surprising given the weakness of his social democratic spd opponent wolfgang jüttner , " the paper wrote .
the paper acknowledged , however , that despite the spd 's ineptitude , wulff led a winning campaign without the need to resort to the strong-arm tactics and verbal failures of his hessian colleague roland koch .
the paper suggested that wulff should be considered the heir apparent to chancellor merkel and that his victory should signal a rise in his profile within the cdu . the spd 's inability to force home a clear advantage in the state elections was also picked up on by the rhein-neckar zeitung .
" the state elections were less about regional politics and more about the performances of the candidates , " it wrote .
" the most significant signal was the fact that spd leader kurt beck could not lead a socialist election campaign which was better than that fought by the left party . "
the paper also wrote that roland koch 's performance and the chancellor 's support of his campaign should be a wake-up call to merkel , who the paper suggested should follow christian wulff 's approach , and not koch 's , in the future . the frankfurter allgemeine zeitung also lamented the state of german politics highlighted by the inability of the social democrats to capitalize on weakened and disliked conservative candidates .
the paper complained that a weak and directionless spd made the conservatives look good , despite their own poor showing .

but it 's yet to be seen which party will be able to form a governing coalition . led by merkel ally and incumbent premier roland koch , who ran a controversial campaign focused on crime and immigration , the cdu took 36.8 percent of the vote , down from 48.8 percent in 2003 . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the state election in hesse polarized germans nationwide " we did n't mobilize our own supporters enough , " koch said on public television .
" this is not easily for me personally . " the rival social democrats -lrb- spd -rrb- , who rule together with merkel 's cdu at the national level , saw their support push up to 36.7 percent . " we fought for a different political culture in this country and we won , " said koch 's spd challenger , andrea ypsilanti . it remains unclear , however , which party will take power .
the entry into hesse 's parliament of the new left party - a far-left grouping which came out of a merger of a social democratic splinter group and the successor party to the former east german communists - prevents both cdu and spd from securing a majority in the 110-seat state legislature in coalition with their preferred partners , the free-market liberal fdp and the greens respectively .

unlike in hesse , however , his result is good enough for him to hold on to power in a coalition with the fdp . here the spd scored its worst result in recent years , declining to around 30.3 percent from 33.4 percent in 2003 . in all , some 10.5 million people were eligible to vote in the two western states , in both of which angela merkel 's christian democrats -lrb- cdu -rrb- have put up the premiers for the past five years . a blow for merkel bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel 's support for koch was not enough to help him win the election the setback which the conservatives were dealt in hesse will also be seen as a blow to the chancellor , who stood firmly behind roland koch during the election campaign and repeatedly defended koch 's proposals for tougher measures against young criminals of foreign origin . " in hesse the conservatives have suffered such losses that it is clear that koch 's election campaign has n't worked , " said richard stöss , a political scientist at berlin 's free university . the spd 's ypsilanti , on the other hand , focused in her campaign on the traditional spd themes of wages , education and the integration of minorities .
this has brought the social democrats a gain of almost 8 percent in comparison to the previous state election . the result is likely to create even more tension in the already strained relations between the cdu and spd on the national level , which some fear could result in a political stalemate in the " grand coalition " until the 2009 national elections . an important race bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : incumbent state premier roland koch has divided the nation the state elections in hesse and lower saxony were widely seen as a test of the cdu 's strength ahead of federal elections , which must be held by september 2009 . merkel remains highly popular in germany but faces risks from a slowing economy ahead of next year 's national vote . " a loss in hesse would be bad for morale for the cdu nationally and for merkel , " political scientist jürgen falter told the bild am sonntag newspaper . ypsilanti 's victory in hesse could potentially give spd chief kurt beck a boost in his bid to dismantle labor market reforms introduced by merkel 's predecessor gerhard schröder , which are credited with helping to fuel a recovery of europe 's biggest economy . social democrats would also be likely to push harder to create a national minimum wage - a popular proposal that many economists have branded a job killer . the left gaining ground bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : left party candidate in hesse , willi van ooyen the fact that both state elections showed a clear shift to the left - after years in which merkel 's conservatives outperformed the social democrats - is , nonetheless , not all good news for the spd . the left party passed the 5-percent threshold to enter the parliament in both states . it is the first time that the party , led by former finance minister oskar lafontaine , will enter parliament in a large western state . spd officials have so far ruled out any possibility of entering into coalition agreements with the left . dw staff -lrb- tt -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

15 . however , arguments then broke out over the resources which each member state should commit to the operation , with the eu 's 27 nations initially unable to scrape together the helicopters and transport planes needed to support the 3,700-man mission . bildunterschrift : hundreds of thousand have been uprooted by violence in the region that obstacle was finally overcome in early january , when russia and ukraine - neither of which is an eu member - offered to provide the missing hardware . the backbone of the " bridging operation , " which is mandated to run for a year , will be made up of an estimated 2,000 french troops .
however , the appointment of nash - an irishman - guarantees the multinational nature of the force , diplomats said . ireland and poland are set to send some 400 troops each .
the deployment is expected to begin in march , with the mission coming up to full strength by may 1 . the mission is expected to cost 119 million euros -lrb- $ 175 million -rrb- . nash is set to control the operation from the mont valerien military base in france .

bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ypsilanti will likely lead a coalition - but with whom ?
official results from hesse showed the conservative cdu had slumped from a majority in the state legislature to finish only nominally ahead of the center-left social democrats -lrb- spd -rrb- , with the same number of seats .
the spd candidate in hesse , andrea ypsilanti , took 36.7 percent of the vote against the cdu 's 36.8 .
search for a coalition a deputy cdu leader in another state , premier christian wulff of lower saxony , won re-election in a separate vote sunday , despite moderate losses .
the left , a combination of former social democrats and eastern ex-communists , extended its reach in western germany to enter both state parliaments .
but gains for the left party and spd in hesse mean the cdu , together with its planned coalition partner free democrats -lrb- fdp -rrb- , no longer have a large enough majority to rule in the state parliament in wiesbaden .
this gives a clear mandate to the spd to enter the state government in hesse , according to acting spd chairwoman andrea nahles .
voters saw to it that koch took " the most brutal beating possible , " nahles told rbb news radio on monday .
while the spd failed " by a nose " to gain a clear majority , it was clear that the voters in the western state increasingly stood behind the center-left party , and it should therefore be part of the government , she said .
ypsilanti is currently in talks with other party representatives to discuss coalition possibilities .
but nahles reiterated ypsilanti 's campaign promise that her party would not enter into a coalition with the upsurge , far-left left party , saying " the program and the people that they represent in hesse do not stand for stability in government . "
" traffic light " coalition possible ?
meanwhile , spd secretary general hubertus heil called for a " traffic light " coalition to rule hesse , which would be made up of the spd -lrb- red -rrb- , free democrats -lrb- yellow -rrb- and green party , under the leadership of ypsilanti .
" there is a koch-must-go mood -lsb- among voters -rsb- that we have to take into account when making up the government , " heil told zdf television talk show morgenmagazin on monday .
" we will present the premier , i am fairly sure of that , " he said .
yet a parliamentary leader of the fdp from hesse , jörg-uwe hahn , said there is no way that his party would enter into a " traffic light " coalition .
the fdp had planned to be coalition partner with the right-wing cdu , and could not be used as " a training wheel for a red-green " coalition , he told the dpa press agency .
hahn predicted a coalition would form between the spd , greens and the left party .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel 's cdu should avoid negative campaigns , one observer said amid the speculations on a new government , political observers took the time to mull over just what went so very wrong in the campaign of incumbent koch - and what it could mean for the larger question of cdu domination in german politics .
koch faulted for polarizing strategy chemnitz-based election researcher eckhard jesse said the cdu should see the campaign as a powerful lesson . with his polarizing , xenophobic rhetoric about youth-crime , koch led the campaign as if he were an opposition candidate , not an incumbent , jesse told the thüringer allgemeine newspaper .
merkel and other cdu candidates need to draw the conclusion that " they should take the same tact as wulff , " who handily won the state election in lower saxony .
" that means that they should run a low-key , feel-good campaign .
they should n't polarize - especially not the chancellor , " he said .
and political scientist theo schiller said koch had reaped what he sowed from his controversial style .
" if koch had n't focused his campaign on youth crime and young offenders , the results might have been slightly different , " the professor at the university of marburg told dpa .
the results were " catastrophic " for the cdu , he said .
by focusing on youth crime , koch aimed to harm the spd , but instead pilloried his own party , schiller said .
" he raised the question of deficits during the years his own government had ruled , " he said .
and was not able to give any satisfactory answers , he added .
no stopping rise of the left like a number of other german political analysts , schiller saw the left party 's gains as a sign of things to come .
" we can expect the left to enter other state parliaments , " he told dpa .
but he also said he did not see the likelihood of the left entering into a ruling coalition in hesse together with the spd .
that would mean ypsilanti would have to go back on her word to too great an extent , he said . dw staff -lrb- jen -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

after the votes were counted , hesse 's incumbent premier , roland koch , had a hair-thin majority , making uncertain the sort of coalition that could form a government and what role the candidate koch - who had led a controversial , openly xenophobic campaign - could have in it .

after the votes were counted , hesse 's incumbent premier , roland koch , had a hair-thin majority , making uncertain the sort of coalition that could form a government and what role the candidate koch - who had led a controversial , openly xenophobic campaign - could have in it .

bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ypsilanti will likely lead a coalition - but with whom ?
official results from hesse showed the conservative cdu had slumped from a majority in the state legislature to finish only nominally ahead of the center-left social democrats -lrb- spd -rrb- , with the same number of seats .
the spd candidate in hesse , andrea ypsilanti , took 36.7 percent of the vote against the cdu 's 36.8 .
search for a coalition a deputy cdu leader in another state , premier christian wulff of lower saxony , won re-election in a separate vote sunday , despite moderate losses .
the left , a combination of former social democrats and eastern ex-communists , extended its reach in western germany to enter both state parliaments .
but gains for the left party and spd in hesse mean the cdu , together with its planned coalition partner free democrats -lrb- fdp -rrb- , no longer have a large enough majority to rule in the state parliament in wiesbaden .
this gives a clear mandate to the spd to enter the state government in hesse , according to acting spd chairwoman andrea nahles .
voters saw to it that koch took " the most brutal beating possible , " nahles told rbb news radio on monday .
while the spd failed " by a nose " to gain a clear majority , it was clear that the voters in the western state increasingly stood behind the center-left party , and it should therefore be part of the government , she said .
ypsilanti is currently in talks with other party representatives to discuss coalition possibilities .
but nahles reiterated ypsilanti 's campaign promise that her party would not enter into a coalition with the upsurge , far-left left party , saying " the program and the people that they represent in hesse do not stand for stability in government . "
" traffic light " coalition possible ?
meanwhile , spd secretary general hubertus heil called for a " traffic light " coalition to rule hesse , which would be made up of the spd -lrb- red -rrb- , free democrats -lrb- yellow -rrb- and green party , under the leadership of ypsilanti .
" there is a koch-must-go mood -lsb- among voters -rsb- that we have to take into account when making up the government , " heil told zdf television talk show morgenmagazin on monday .
" we will present the premier , i am fairly sure of that , " he said .
yet a parliamentary leader of the fdp from hesse , jörg-uwe hahn , said there is no way that his party would enter into a " traffic light " coalition .
the fdp had planned to be coalition partner with the right-wing cdu , and could not be used as " a training wheel for a red-green " coalition , he told the dpa press agency .
hahn predicted a coalition would form between the spd , greens and the left party .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel 's cdu should avoid negative campaigns , one observer said amid the speculations on a new government , political observers took the time to mull over just what went so very wrong in the campaign of incumbent koch - and what it could mean for the larger question of cdu domination in german politics .
koch faulted for polarizing strategy chemnitz-based election researcher eckhard jesse said the cdu should see the campaign as a powerful lesson . with his polarizing , xenophobic rhetoric about youth-crime , koch led the campaign as if he were an opposition candidate , not an incumbent , jesse told the thüringer allgemeine newspaper .
merkel and other cdu candidates need to draw the conclusion that " they should take the same tact as wulff , " who handily won the state election in lower saxony .
" that means that they should run a low-key , feel-good campaign .
they should n't polarize - especially not the chancellor , " he said .
and political scientist theo schiller said koch had reaped what he sowed from his controversial style .
" if koch had n't focused his campaign on youth crime and young offenders , the results might have been slightly different , " the professor at the university of marburg told dpa .
the results were " catastrophic " for the cdu , he said .
by focusing on youth crime , koch aimed to harm the spd , but instead pilloried his own party , schiller said .
" he raised the question of deficits during the years his own government had ruled , " he said .
and was not able to give any satisfactory answers , he added .
no stopping rise of the left like a number of other german political analysts , schiller saw the left party 's gains as a sign of things to come .
" we can expect the left to enter other state parliaments , " he told dpa .

" the stabilization and association agreement wo n't be signed in the coming days but this does n't mean that our policy has changed , " he told journalists .
" we want to send a signal that our hand is stretched out to serbia . " the interim agreement could assist tadic in his campaign against nikolic but eu officials admitted that they had received mixed signals from belgrade as to whether a signing ceremony would hurt or help the pro-europe candidate 's prospects . tadic currently trails nikolic who took a five-point lead in the first round this weekend . eu boost to pro-europe candidate ahead of kosovo move eu leaders are keen to see tadic win to bolster pro-european forces ahead of an expected declaration of independence by politicians in the serbian province of kosovo . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the eu plans to boost its forces in kosovo the leaders of kosovo 's ethnic albanian majority , who make up 90 percent of the province 's 2 million people , say they are within weeks of declaring independence from serbia . the eu plans to send a 1,800-persn strong mission to kosovo to help ease its transition to local rule , but is still waiting for a signal from un secretary-general ban ki-moon to do so .

but there is much skepticism in serbia of the eu 's motives and the latest stalling on the saa is unlikely to help . a failure to put an agreement in place soon would " fuel a widely present perception of permanent exclusion and unparalleled conditioning , " srdjan gligorijevic , chief analyst for the belgrade-based international and security affairs centre think-tank , told reuters news agency .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de elections -pipe- 28.01.2008 german conservatives suffer losses in key state election großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : andrea ypsilanti brought significant gains to the spd in hesse chancellor merkel 's christian democrats -lrb- cdu -rrb- suffered major losses in a key vote in the state of hesse .
but it 's yet to be seen which party will be able to form a governing coalition . led by merkel ally and incumbent premier roland koch , who ran a controversial campaign focused on crime and immigration , the cdu took 36.8 percent of the vote , down from 48.8 percent in 2003 . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the state election in hesse polarized germans nationwide " we did n't mobilize our own supporters enough , " koch said on public television .
" this is not easily for me personally . " the rival social democrats -lrb- spd -rrb- , who rule together with merkel 's cdu at the national level , saw their support push up to 36.7 percent . " we fought for a different political culture in this country and we won , " said koch 's spd challenger , andrea ypsilanti . it remains unclear , however , which party will take power .
the entry into hesse 's parliament of the new left party - a far-left grouping which came out of a merger of a social democratic splinter group and the successor party to the former east german communists - prevents both cdu and spd from securing a majority in the 110-seat state legislature in coalition with their preferred partners , the free-market liberal fdp and the greens respectively .
the left party took home 5.1 percent , the fdp received 9.4 percent and the greens got 7.5 percent . a different case bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : despite nearly 6-point drop in votes , christian wulff will stay in power in lower saxony in another state election , in lower saxony , incumbent cdu premier christian wulff saw his support fall to 42.5 percent from 48.3 percent in 2003 .
unlike in hesse , however , his result is good enough for him to hold on to power in a coalition with the fdp . here the spd scored its worst result in recent years , declining to around 30.3 percent from 33.4 percent in 2003 . in all , some 10.5 million people were eligible to vote in the two western states , in both of which angela merkel 's christian democrats -lrb- cdu -rrb- have put up the premiers for the past five years . a blow for merkel bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel 's support for koch was not enough to help him win the election the setback which the conservatives were dealt in hesse will also be seen as a blow to the chancellor , who stood firmly behind roland koch during the election campaign and repeatedly defended koch 's proposals for tougher measures against young criminals of foreign origin . " in hesse the conservatives have suffered such losses that it is clear that koch 's election campaign has n't worked , " said richard stöss , a political scientist at berlin 's free university . the spd 's ypsilanti , on the other hand , focused in her campaign on the traditional spd themes of wages , education and the integration of minorities .
this has brought the social democrats a gain of almost 8 percent in comparison to the previous state election . the result is likely to create even more tension in the already strained relations between the cdu and spd on the national level , which some fear could result in a political stalemate in the " grand coalition " until the 2009 national elections . an important race bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : incumbent state premier roland koch has divided the nation the state elections in hesse and lower saxony were widely seen as a test of the cdu 's strength ahead of federal elections , which must be held by september 2009 . merkel remains highly popular in germany but faces risks from a slowing economy ahead of next year 's national vote . " a loss in hesse would be bad for morale for the cdu nationally and for merkel , " political scientist jürgen falter told the bild am sonntag newspaper . ypsilanti 's victory in hesse could potentially give spd chief kurt beck a boost in his bid to dismantle labor market reforms introduced by merkel 's predecessor gerhard schröder , which are credited with helping to fuel a recovery of europe 's biggest economy . social democrats would also be likely to push harder to create a national minimum wage - a popular proposal that many economists have branded a job killer . the left gaining ground bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : left party candidate in hesse , willi van ooyen the fact that both state elections showed a clear shift to the left - after years in which merkel 's conservatives outperformed the social democrats - is , nonetheless , not all good news for the spd . the left party passed the 5-percent threshold to enter the parliament in both states . it is the first time that the party , led by former finance minister oskar lafontaine , will enter parliament in a large western state . spd officials have so far ruled out any possibility of entering into coalition agreements with the left . dw staff -lrb- tt -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the catch ?
before take-off , you have to strip off . " ladies and gentleman , in preparation for take-off , please ensure your seatback is upright , your hand luggage is safely stowed , and that you 've removed all your clothing . " that 's what the on-board announcement en route to the isle of usedom might sound like if internet travel agency ossiurlaub.de succeeds with plans to launch the first nudist charter flight to the popular baltic sea destination in july .
the flight personnel making the announcements will be fully dressed , however - for security reasons . ossiurlaub.de thinks its innovative nudist flight is the perfect way to target eastern germany 's large population of " fkk " devotees .
fkk , the abbreviation of the german term for " free body culture , " is essentially naturism , and was an authorized and extremely popular tradition under communist rule . grin and bare it many eastern germans , nicknamed " ossis , " are nostalgic for that tradition , especially now that they feel frowned upon by their more prudish western german neighbors . " in the former east germany , naturist holidays were a much-loved way of spending the best weeks of the year , " said the founder of ossiurlaub.de , enrico hess .
" we want to make that freedom possible above the clouds , too . " the first nude flight will be a day-trip on july 5 between erfurt and usedom , with its many fkk beaches . " all the passengers will fly naked , but they will only be allowed to undress once they are in the plane , " hess said .
" but then they will be able to enjoy the hour-long flight in the way god intended . " tickets cost 499 euros -lrb- $ 735 -rrb- and there are just 50 seats available on the jet - there was no word on whether the seat cushions would be dry cleaned between flights . if the virgin flight is a success , regular flights to usedom or other destinations will be planned , hess said . dw staff -lrb- dc -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the £ 30bn spending plans narrowly passed their first parliamentary hurdle , with the support of the tories and independent msp margo macdonald .
labour and the lib dems voted against the budget , while the greens abstained .
finance secretary john swinney said ministers were considering parliament demands to increase police recruitment and speed up business rate cuts .
the spending plans are currently going through the second stage of scrutiny , ahead of a final , crunch vote at holyrood .
' potentially disastrous ' mr swinney said the plans would deliver a council tax freeze , boost the voluntary sector and the economy and deliver " vital " infrastructure projects .
" council tax increases would be inevitable if the budget did not pass , " he said .
it was now incumbent on parliament , mr swinney argued , to recognise that it was essential to pass the budget bill .
" failure to do so would be to put in jeopardy public services and the scottish economy , " he said .
he said the local government budget was set to grow from £ 10.6bn in 2007-08 to £ 11.1bn in 2008-09 , an increase of £ 486m .
labour claimed ministers had put the tax freeze and business rate cuts for small firms ahead of everything else , while the liberal democrats said the budget plans had " potentially disastrous " implications for the economy .
' no bartering ' iain gray , labour 's finance spokesman , said : " the ball is in the snp 's court with their budget .
" they could accept the reasonable proposals about greater security for the vulnerable and better skills training for scotland 's young people and perhaps attract some cross-party support .
" alternatively they can continue to exclusively deal with the tories . "
he said the budget process should be about investing in scotland 's future , not about " bartering deals " to get it through the parliament .
the conservatives warned that their support at the first hurdle did not guarantee backing for the final bill .

the spending plans are currently going through the second stage of scrutiny , ahead of a final , crunch vote at holyrood .
' potentially disastrous ' mr swinney said the plans would deliver a council tax freeze , boost the voluntary sector and the economy and deliver " vital " infrastructure projects .
" council tax increases would be inevitable if the budget did not pass , " he said .
it was now incumbent on parliament , mr swinney argued , to recognise that it was essential to pass the budget bill .
" failure to do so would be to put in jeopardy public services and the scottish economy , " he said .
he said the local government budget was set to grow from £ 10.6bn in 2007-08 to £ 11.1bn in 2008-09 , an increase of £ 486m .
labour claimed ministers had put the tax freeze and business rate cuts for small firms ahead of everything else , while the liberal democrats said the budget plans had " potentially disastrous " implications for the economy .
' no bartering ' iain gray , labour 's finance spokesman , said : " the ball is in the snp 's court with their budget .
" they could accept the reasonable proposals about greater security for the vulnerable and better skills training for scotland 's young people and perhaps attract some cross-party support .
" alternatively they can continue to exclusively deal with the tories . "
he said the budget process should be about investing in scotland 's future , not about " bartering deals " to get it through the parliament .
the conservatives warned that their support at the first hurdle did not guarantee backing for the final bill .

mental health charity mind said school support would be a " huge step forward " .
police are reviewing a number of cases after 13 suicides among people under 26 in the bridgend area in a year .
suicide is the highest cause of death among young welsh men , and alan briscoe of mind cymru said each such death in bridgend raised the " sense of despair " .
on 17 january , natasha randall , 17 , of blaengarw , near bridgend , was the latest young person found hanged . "
if they know other young people who are dying by suicide it can increase the risk that they too will see suicide as a way out " alan briscoe , mind cymru several other young people who have died in the area knew each other .
they include leigh jenkins , 22 , who was found hanged two months after his best friend and neighbour alan price , 21 , died in the same way .
another was 20-year-old thomas davies from north cornelly , who hanged himself in february 2007 .
he was friends with david dilling , 19 , and dale crole , 18 , who had been found dead weeks earlier .
" young people who are troubled often find it difficult to ask for help , and if they know other young people who are dying by suicide it can increase the risk that they too will see suicide as a way out , " said mr briscoe .
" each of these deaths will have a devastating effect not just on families and friends but also on communities . "
mr briscoe said more needed to be done to recognise the signs of suicidal thoughts , particularly with vulnerable adolescents .
the applied suicide intervention skills training -lrb- asist -rrb- programme is offered by the charity throughout wales with support from the welsh assembly government .
" the aim is to train as many people as possible to be able to recognise someone who is suicidal and give them the skills and confidence to intervene , " mr briscoe added .
" this includes all who work in a helping capacity and who can act as ' gatekeepers ' to recognise those who will need help to stay safe . "
the project has trained over 400 people from more than 60 different organisations in wales during the last year .
it was developed in canada in 1983 and widely used there and the us , australia , new zealand , scotland , the irish republic and norway .
a course will be running shortly in bridgend which the charity said would make a significant contribution to the skills of local professionals who had been touched by the recent suicides in the area .
" if every school in wales trained just one teacher or school nurse in suicide awareness that would be a huge step forward , " mr briscoe said .
" only one in five young people in wales talk to their gp if they are feeling suicidal . "
" training people in first aid is taken for granted , yet the skills offered through asist can be mastered by anyone - asist is suicide first aid , focused on immediate safety , " he added .

mental health charity mind said school support would be a " huge step forward " .
police are reviewing a number of cases after 13 suicides among people under 26 in the bridgend area in a year .
suicide is the highest cause of death among young welsh men , and alan briscoe of mind cymru said each such death in bridgend raised the " sense of despair " .
on 17 january , natasha randall , 17 , of blaengarw , near bridgend , was the latest young person found hanged .
if they know other young people who are dying by suicide it can increase the risk that they too will see suicide as a way out alan briscoe , mind cymru several other young people who have died in the area knew each other .
they include leigh jenkins , 22 , who was found hanged two months after his best friend and neighbour alan price , 21 , died in the same way .
another was 20-year-old thomas davies from north cornelly , who hanged himself in february 2007 .
he was friends with david dilling , 19 , and dale crole , 18 , who had been found dead weeks earlier .
" young people who are troubled often find it difficult to ask for help , and if they know other young people who are dying by suicide it can increase the risk that they too will see suicide as a way out , " said mr briscoe .
" each of these deaths will have a devastating effect not just on families and friends but also on communities . "
mr briscoe said more needed to be done to recognise the signs of suicidal thoughts , particularly with vulnerable adolescents .
only one in five young people talks to a gp if feeling suicidal the applied suicide intervention skills training -lrb- asist -rrb- programme is offered by the charity throughout wales with support from the welsh assembly government .
" the aim is to train as many people as possible to be able to recognise someone who is suicidal and give them the skills and confidence to intervene , " mr briscoe added .
" this includes all who work in a helping capacity and who can act as ' gatekeepers ' to recognise those who will need help to stay safe . "
the project has trained over 400 people from more than 60 different organisations in wales during the last year .
it was developed in canada in 1983 and widely used there and the us , australia , new zealand , scotland , the irish republic and norway .
a course will be running shortly in bridgend which the charity said would make a significant contribution to the skills of local professionals who had been touched by the recent suicides in the area .
" if every school in wales trained just one teacher or school nurse in suicide awareness that would be a huge step forward , " mr briscoe said .
" only one in five young people in wales talk to their gp if they are feeling suicidal . "
" training people in first aid is taken for granted , yet the skills offered through asist can be mastered by anyone - asist is suicide first aid , focused on immediate safety , " he added .

chris bryant wants them made available first in the 150 areas of the uk with the highest levels of teen pregnancy .
recent figures show there were 43.4 live births per 1,000 girls in his rhondda constituency , above the welsh average of 33.7 .
in england it is 28.9 .
mr bryant also wants booklets sent to all parents on their children 's 11th birthday to help them talk about sex .
the rhondda mp said parents and children , especially in the poorest communities , can find it difficult to talk about sex and he added that sex education was also " rudimentary at best " .
have your say three people in my form have become pregnant and at least seven have had an sti .
there is no way to stop them having sex , but i think giving out free condoms will definatley help hannah , aged 15 .
he has also launched a website , teenagemums.org.uk , and wants sexual health clinics at schools and colleges .
mr bryant will host a debate in parliament 's westminster hall on wednesday amid statistics showing that the uk has the highest rate in western europe , and second in the world , behind the us .
he said although the number had been falling since 1997 , the map of teenage pregnancy was also " the map of british deprivation " .
among a series of recommendations , he wants government ministers in england and wales to target support at " the most at risk " in the areas with highest rates of teenage pregnancy .
last month the department of health found rates had been reduced by just 11.4 % since 1998 in england , against a target to cut them in half by 2010 .
chris bryant mp wants condoms to be given to teenagers that led to the department for children , schools and families - which is jointly responsible for england 's target with the department of health - promising that efforts would be " redoubled " .
wales has an even higher teenage pregnancy rate than england , with 43.6 conceptions per 1,000 girls in 2005 , compared with 41.3 .
mr bryant said that in his constituency in 2006 , almost one in 25 teenagers aged 15-19 gave birth .
the mp said free condoms should be available in " places where young people go , aimed at cutting stis -lrb- sexually transmitted infections -rrb- and pregnancies " .
he argued that clinics in schools and colleges would allow students to get hold of information , advice and contraception .
' belt and braces ' he also wants campaigns to offer more accurate contraception information , and urge the " belt and braces " approach of using both the pill and condoms .
mr bryant also advocates that schemes allowing chemists to give out free emergency contraception should be extended across the country .
teenage pregnancies 43.6 conceptions per 1,000 teenage girls in wales in 2005 41.3 conceptions per 1,000 teenage girls in england in 2005 rates peaked in 1995 - 98 , but the uk has europe 's highest half of all conceptions under 18 occur in the uk 's 20 % most deprived wards 27 % of births to teenage girls in england and wales were registered solely by the mother source : chris bryant mp he cited the difficulties young people in his constituency found in getting hold of contraception .
" when i asked a group of students at treorchy comprehensive school in the rhondda what they thought was the main reason for the high number of teenage pregnancies locally , they were all critical of the local availability of contraception .
" as one boy put it , ' maybe it 's different if you live in cardiff but it 's pretty embarrassing buying condoms in the rhondda .
" if you go into a chemist 's in treorchy , the girl behind the counter will almost certainly know your mum . "
mr bryant said he had also been told by a teacher that a girl told her she was not trying hard because she planned to get pregnant the next year and would not be returning to school .
" the teacher tells me the girl did n't care who the father was going to be .
" one of the pupils echoed this , saying , ' i 've heard girls say , ' i 'm fed up .
i 'm just going to have a baby .
it 's easier " ' .
mr bryant said all international comparisons suggest that deprivation was " intimately linked with high rates of teenage pregnancy " .

as a result , it said its 2007 profits are likely to fall to 3bn euros from the previous estimate of 4bn euros .
the bank 's statement comes after much market speculation about the extent of its sub-prime losses .
global banks may need to raise an extra $ 143bn to cover the continuing credit crisis , a report said last week .
the study by barclays capital said the banks would need the extra money if bond insurers , who insure the debt offerings at the centre of the us sub-prime crisis , have their credit ratings cut .
if the credit ratings are reduced , it is likely to lead to banks reporting bigger losses on their sub-prime debt , as the value of the outstanding debt would in turn be reduced still further .
shares in fortis fell more than 10 % on friday .
the bank said in its statement on sunday that , despite its sub-prime exposure , its overall finances remained sound .
the world 's largest banks have already admitted losing a total of more than $ 100bn from bad sub-prime debt .

by tim weber business editor , bbc news website , davos in 2007 climate change was the big topic at the world economic forum .
one year on , is big business acting green ?
environmental campaigners call it greenwash - when a company , organisation or government makes grand claims about its environmental record , but has little evidence to back them up .
is davos any different ?
the environment had largely disappeared from the forum 's agenda .
a few sessions examined , for example , whether biofuels are really beneficial , whether carbon trading works , and why nuclear energy is back in fashion .
last year 's hot topic had become a casualty of the forum 's habit of trying to push new issues on to the global agenda .
but the reality is more complex then that .
' unified earth theory ' it may not say " green " on the tin , but environmental issues popped up in many other guises .
whether developing countries can be lifted out of poverty without accelerating climate change , was discussed by poverty campaigner bono and former us vice president al gore , who recently received a nobel prize for his fight against climate change - an issue that was raised in session after session .
japan 's prime minister yasuo fukuda for his part announced in davos a $ 10bn , five-year package to help developing countries tackle climate change without risking growth .
water scarcity was another environmental topic big on the agenda , and companies like nestle and pepsico were pushing their green credentials by explaining their efforts to help cut water consumption .
michael white , chief executive of pepsico international , reeled off a long list of projects where his company was sharply cutting back its water usage .
" in india we have reduced water usage by 40 % , " he told me , and all of pepsico 's factories had been ordered to meet tough water efficiency targets and " help local communities to save water as well " .
carbon rating your holiday william mcdonough runs a firm of architects that is redesigning google 's headquarters : " when i spoke to the meeting of the chemicals and construction industry here about sustainable building methods , they were really very open to the idea . "
indeed , there is hardly any company that is not eager to show that it tries to help the world go green in its particular sector .
" when we talk about the environment , it 's not window dressing , " insists jeff clarke , chief executive of travelport , one of the world 's largest travel conglomerates .
the company runs travel reservation systems such as galileo , and consumer travel websites such as orbitz .
a year ago at davos , he says , he became convinced that his company had to contribute to fighting climate change , not least because the $ 1 trillion travel industry is " a major contributor to global warming " .
travelport is a data-driven company , updating 4.3 billion fares every day .
mr clarke 's solution : customers booking a flight should be told more than the ticket price and the type of plane used on a route .
within a year travelport hopes to give every single flight a carbon rating , taking into account the plane , the type of fuel used , and other data points .
" some planes are three-times more polluting on the same route than others , " says mr clarke .
" it is inconceivable for me that in a decade from now the carbon rating of a hotel or plane is not part of the consideration when a customers is booking a trip . "
off the hype curve environmental entrepreneur shai agassi says the lack of an official green agenda in davos is actually a good sign .
" it just shows that we are off the hype curve and into solutions . "
he points to his own company , better .
together with renault nissan he hopes to persuade israeli car drivers to switch from petrol to electric cars .
new highly-efficient batteries combined with green energy from solar and wind power are supposed to end israel 's dependence on petrol imports by 2018 at the latest .
mr agassi has the backing of the government and large companies in israel - and says that a string of other car firms and countries have also expressed an interest .
" expect three to five similar announcements this year , " he says , and predicts that " the minute we prove -lsb- our model -rsb- works , the whole market will tip " in favour of clean , electric cars .
that , however , is still very much in the future .
in davos , endless rows of four-wheel drive cars were idling outside luxury hotels , waiting to ferry executives from meeting to meeting .
for some bosses , going green starts elsewhere .

water scarcity was another environmental topic big on the agenda , and companies like nestle and pepsico were pushing their green credentials by explaining their efforts to help cut water consumption .
michael white , chief executive of pepsico international , reeled off a long list of projects where his company was sharply cutting back its water usage .

travelport is a data-driven company , updating 4.3 billion fares every day .
mr clarke 's solution : customers booking a flight should be told more than the ticket price and the type of plane used on a route .
within a year travelport hopes to give every single flight a carbon rating , taking into account the plane , the type of fuel used , and other data points .
" some planes are three-times more polluting on the same route than others , " says mr clarke .

new highly-efficient batteries combined with green energy from solar and wind power are supposed to end israel 's dependence on petrol imports by 2018 at the latest .
mr agassi has the backing of the government and large companies in israel - and says that a string of other car firms and countries have also expressed an interest .
" expect three to five similar announcements this year , " he says , and predicts that " the minute we prove -lsb- our model -rsb- works , the whole market will tip " in favour of clean , electric cars .
that , however , is still very much in the future .
in davos , endless rows of four-wheel drive cars were idling outside luxury hotels , waiting to ferry executives from meeting to meeting .
for some bosses , going green starts elsewhere .

environmental campaigners call it greenwash - when a company , organisation or government makes grand claims about its environmental record , but has little evidence to back them up .
is davos any different ?
the environment had largely disappeared from the forum 's agenda .
a few sessions examined , for example , whether biofuels are really beneficial , whether carbon trading works , and why nuclear energy is back in fashion .
last year 's hot topic had become a casualty of the forum 's habit of trying to push new issues on to the global agenda .

by tim weber business editor , bbc news website , davos climate change was last year 's big topic in davos in 2007 climate change was the big topic at the world economic forum .
one year on , is big business acting green ?
environmental campaigners call it greenwash - when a company , organisation or government makes grand claims about its environmental record , but has little evidence to back them up .
is davos any different ?
the environment had largely disappeared from the forum 's agenda .
a few sessions examined , for example , whether biofuels are really beneficial , whether carbon trading works , and why nuclear energy is back in fashion .
last year 's hot topic had become a casualty of the forum 's habit of trying to push new issues on to the global agenda .
but the reality is more complex then that .
' unified earth theory ' can we have both development and environment ?
it may not say " green " on the tin , but environmental issues popped up in many other guises .
whether developing countries can be lifted out of poverty without accelerating climate change , was discussed by poverty campaigner bono and former us vice president al gore , who recently received a nobel prize for his fight against climate change - an issue that was raised in session after session .
japan 's prime minister yasuo fukuda for his part announced in davos a $ 10bn , five-year package to help developing countries tackle climate change without risking growth .
water scarcity was another environmental topic big on the agenda , and companies like nestle and pepsico were pushing their green credentials by explaining their efforts to help cut water consumption .
michael white , chief executive of pepsico international , reeled off a long list of projects where his company was sharply cutting back its water usage .
" in india we have reduced water usage by 40 % , " he told me , and all of pepsico 's factories had been ordered to meet tough water efficiency targets and " help local communities to save water as well " .
carbon rating your holiday william mcdonough runs a firm of architects that is redesigning google 's headquarters : " when i spoke to the meeting of the chemicals and construction industry here about sustainable building methods , they were really very open to the idea . "
travel is a major contributor to climate change indeed , there is hardly any company that is not eager to show that it tries to help the world go green in its particular sector .
" when we talk about the environment , it 's not window dressing , " insists jeff clarke , chief executive of travelport , one of the world 's largest travel conglomerates .
the company runs travel reservation systems such as galileo , and consumer travel websites such as orbitz .
a year ago at davos , he says , he became convinced that his company had to contribute to fighting climate change , not least because the $ 1 trillion travel industry is " a major contributor to global warming " .
travelport is a data-driven company , updating 4.3 billion fares every day .
mr clarke 's solution : customers booking a flight should be told more than the ticket price and the type of plane used on a route .
within a year travelport hopes to give every single flight a carbon rating , taking into account the plane , the type of fuel used , and other data points .
" some planes are three-times more polluting on the same route than others , " says mr clarke .
" it is inconceivable for me that in a decade from now the carbon rating of a hotel or plane is not part of the consideration when a customers is booking a trip . "
off the hype curve are industry 's green pledges just greenwash ?
environmental entrepreneur shai agassi says the lack of an official green agenda in davos is actually a good sign .
" it just shows that we are off the hype curve and into solutions . "
he points to his own company , better .
together with renault nissan he hopes to persuade israeli car drivers to switch from petrol to electric cars .
new highly-efficient batteries combined with green energy from solar and wind power are supposed to end israel 's dependence on petrol imports by 2018 at the latest .
mr agassi has the backing of the government and large companies in israel - and says that a string of other car firms and countries have also expressed an interest .
" expect three to five similar announcements this year , " he says , and predicts that " the minute we prove -lsb- our model -rsb- works , the whole market will tip " in favour of clean , electric cars .
that , however , is still very much in the future .
in davos , endless rows of four-wheel drive cars were idling outside luxury hotels , waiting to ferry executives from meeting to meeting .
for some bosses , going green starts elsewhere .

members of the wla - also known as the land girls - and the wtc have campaigned for recognition for decades .

peter robinson , ian paisley and martin mcguinness with copies of the budget this is arguably one of the most important documents to be published by this administration .
it sets out what this executive aims to achieve , how and when .
it 's doubtful however that it will be widely read .
indeed , would many citizens even know what was in it ?
even so , it is going to be the subject of some debate in the assembly - as will tuesday 's budget .
indeed , the draft programme for government , after some consultation , and much discussion - is now ready for assembly approval .
the amended final document , however , does not differ significantly from the draft .
there have been some adjustments , in part because critics , who included parties to the executive , complained of contradictions between the budget and the draft programme for government .
for example , the ulster unionists suggested that the finance simply was not there to deliver the educated workforce required to drive an innovative high tech economy .
the draft programme for government had an aim of delivering 300 phd students .
to ensure delivery more funding was forthcoming in the final budget , as was more funding for social and affordable housing .
the overall aim is to " build a peaceful , fair and prosperous society in northern ireland with respect for the rule of law . "
alliance leader david ford has criticised the programme to achieve this , the executive promises to pursue an innovation and productive economy , to promote social inclusion , as well as personal health and well-being , and to protect and enhance the natural environment .
equality , we are told , is an important issue , and the goal is to eliminate all forms of inequality .
within these aims , the executive has laid out specific targets .
some have been toughened up from the draft programme for government , others have been watered down , according to the alliance party .
it has compiled a list of the changes .
it notes a change from the draft programme on the promise to secure inward investment commitments creating 6,500 jobs .
the new programme makes clear that 85 % of these posts will be above our private sector median wage .
that 's a change upward to include an extra 500 posts .
there 's also a whole list new of strategic road improvement schemes .
' previous administration ' another central alliance party criticism of the draft programme for government was its commitment - or lack of commitment - to a shared future .
the party has noted that the new programme for government , on page two , now contains the phrase " a shared and better future . "
but the party is unhappy that it continues to use " a better future " on the cover .
the sdlp has also been critical , complaining for example that some ideas have been recycled , not just from the previous administration but from direct rule .
it is also concerned that although the finance minister handed millions more to children and young people 's services in his final budget proposal , there is still no separate children and young people 's fund .
what is clear is that the alliance party , as a self-styled opposition , will vote against the programme for government and the budget this week .
the question is what will the uup and sdlp do ?
will they try to have their cake and eat it by having their ministers vote for these issues , while other party mlas abstain or vote against ?
uup leader sir reg empey seemed to answer the question on the bbc 's inside politics when he said that his party would now be open to backing the budget .
sir reg seemed to answer the question on the bbc 's inside politics however , he could not guarantee his party would stay in the executive until the next assembly election in three years .
water charges remain a controversial issue and many mlas will no doubt have something to say about the new report on the water review , due out on monday .
whatever happens , measuring up to the aim of delivering a dynamic economy wo n't be easy given the state of the us economy and fears of a recession there .
but at least we can measure this programme .
the lengthy and detailed 1999 programme for government in the last administration was practically impossible to measure .
just ask the alliance party .

peter robinson , ian paisley and martin mcguinness with copies of the budget this is arguably one of the most important documents to be published by this administration .
it sets out what this executive aims to achieve , how and when .
it 's doubtful however that it will be widely read .
indeed , would many citizens even know what was in it ?
even so , it is going to be the subject of some debate in the assembly - as will tuesday 's budget .
indeed , the draft programme for government , after some consultation , and much discussion - is now ready for assembly approval .
the amended final document , however , does not differ significantly from the draft .
there have been some adjustments , in part because critics , who included parties to the executive , complained of contradictions between the budget and the draft programme for government .
for example , the ulster unionists suggested that the finance simply was not there to deliver the educated workforce required to drive an innovative high tech economy .
the draft programme for government had an aim of delivering 300 phd students .
to ensure delivery more funding was forthcoming in the final budget , as was more funding for social and affordable housing .
the overall aim is to " build a peaceful , fair and prosperous society in northern ireland with respect for the rule of law . "
alliance leader david ford has criticised the programme to achieve this , the executive promises to pursue an innovation and productive economy , to promote social inclusion , as well as personal health and well-being , and to protect and enhance the natural environment .
equality , we are told , is an important issue , and the goal is to eliminate all forms of inequality .
within these aims , the executive has laid out specific targets .
some have been toughened up from the draft programme for government , others have been watered down , according to the alliance party .
it has compiled a list of the changes .
it notes a change from the draft programme on the promise to secure inward investment commitments creating 6,500 jobs .
the new programme makes clear that 85 % of these posts will be above our private sector median wage .
that 's a change upward to include an extra 500 posts .
there 's also a whole list new of strategic road improvement schemes .
' previous administration ' another central alliance party criticism of the draft programme for government was its commitment - or lack of commitment - to a shared future .
the party has noted that the new programme for government , on page two , now contains the phrase " a shared and better future . "
but the party is unhappy that it continues to use " a better future " on the cover .
the sdlp has also been critical , complaining for example that some ideas have been recycled , not just from the previous administration but from direct rule .
it is also concerned that although the finance minister handed millions more to children and young people 's services in his final budget proposal , there is still no separate children and young people 's fund .
what is clear is that the alliance party , as a self-styled opposition , will vote against the programme for government and the budget this week .
the question is what will the uup and sdlp do ?
will they try to have their cake and eat it by having their ministers vote for these issues , while other party mlas abstain or vote against ?
uup leader sir reg empey seemed to answer the question on the bbc 's inside politics when he said that his party would now be open to backing the budget .
sir reg seemed to answer the question on the bbc 's inside politics however , he could not guarantee his party would stay in the executive until the next assembly election in three years .
water charges remain a controversial issue and many mlas will no doubt have something to say about the new report on the water review , due out on monday .
whatever happens , measuring up to the aim of delivering a dynamic economy wo n't be easy given the state of the us economy and fears of a recession there .
but at least we can measure this programme .
the lengthy and detailed 1999 programme for government in the last administration was practically impossible to measure .
just ask the alliance party .
