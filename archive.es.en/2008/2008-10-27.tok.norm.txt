27 , seehofer and sabine leutheusser-schnarrenberger , the head of the free democratic party -lrb- fdp -rrb- are to ink the historic coalition agreement that ends over four decades of sole conservative rule in germany 's largest state .
the csu , the sister party to chancellor angela merkel 's christian democratic union , lost its absolute majority in state elections four weeks ago , forcing it to seek a governing partner .
the fdp won seats in the bavarian state assembly in the sept .
28 poll for the first time in 14 years and is to take over the economy and science ministries .
an fdp convention in the city of ingolstadt approved the arrangement sunday .
" it 's always hard to give something up , " said csu majority leader georg schmid , " but that 's how it is in a coalition and i think we 've reached a good consensus with each other , for example in distributing the ministries . "
the two parties plan to partly relax a strict ban on smoking in bars which was blamed by some for the csu 's loss of one third of its traditional support at the state election .
bavaria names new premier after the loss in support to just 43 per cent of ballots , the bavaria-only csu deposed both its former leader , erwin huber , and its state premier , guenther beckstein .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : rescuing bavaria 's state bank will be first on seehofer 's agenda seehofer was named csu chief at a party meeting on saturday and , on monday , is to be appointed to the position of state premier .
he relinquished his currents posts in berlin as federal minister of agriculture and minister for consumer affairs . despite receiving a 90.3 percent majority in the delegation 's vote for chairman on saturday , seehofer is not entirely without controversy within his own party .
reports of an extra-marital affair last year damaged his reputation among some of the more conservative party members who see the csu as a bastion of traditional values .
hurdles ahead for seehofer the csu has not only lost both broad support from the majority of voters and faith in its leadership , but the state 's economic situation is also in grave danger after nine-figure losses at partially state-run landesbank bayern lb as a result of the international finance crisis .
" i think the rest of the country looks at bavaria with a certain schadenfreude , " political scientist juergen falter told deutsche welle .
in addition to fighting for tax cuts and inheritance tax reform , seehofer has already promised to make the crisis at the state bank first priority .
the key to seehofer 's success , said falter , is to secure his position in bavaria so that he is unchallenged in berlin .
" he 'll raise his voice in national politics , " said falter .
" he 's good at that ; that 's his territory .
i think he 'll definitely perform well at the federal level . "

27 , seehofer and sabine leutheusser-schnarrenberger , the head of the free democratic party -lrb- fdp -rrb- are to ink the historic coalition agreement that ends over four decades of sole conservative rule in germany 's largest state .
the csu , the sister party to chancellor angela merkel 's christian democratic union , lost its absolute majority in state elections four weeks ago , forcing it to seek a governing partner .
the fdp won seats in the bavarian state assembly in the sept .
28 poll for the first time in 14 years and is to take over the economy and science ministries .
an fdp convention in the city of ingolstadt approved the arrangement sunday .
" it 's always hard to give something up , " said csu majority leader georg schmid , " but that 's how it is in a coalition and i think we 've reached a good consensus with each other , for example in distributing the ministries . "
the two parties plan to partly relax a strict ban on smoking in bars which was blamed by some for the csu 's loss of one third of its traditional support at the state election .
bavaria names new premier after the loss in support to just 43 per cent of ballots , the bavaria-only csu deposed both its former leader , erwin huber , and its state premier , guenther beckstein .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : rescuing bavaria 's state bank will be first on seehofer 's agenda seehofer was named csu chief at a party meeting on saturday and , on monday , is to be appointed to the position of state premier .
he relinquished his currents posts in berlin as federal minister of agriculture and minister for consumer affairs . despite receiving a 90.3 percent majority in the delegation 's vote for chairman on saturday , seehofer is not entirely without controversy within his own party .
reports of an extra-marital affair last year damaged his reputation among some of the more conservative party members who see the csu as a bastion of traditional values .
hurdles ahead for seehofer the csu has not only lost both broad support from the majority of voters and faith in its leadership , but the state 's economic situation is also in grave danger after nine-figure losses at partially state-run landesbank bayern lb as a result of the international finance crisis .
" i think the rest of the country looks at bavaria with a certain schadenfreude , " political scientist juergen falter told deutsche welle .
in addition to fighting for tax cuts and inheritance tax reform , seehofer has already promised to make the crisis at the state bank first priority .
the key to seehofer 's success , said falter , is to secure his position in bavaria so that he is unchallenged in berlin .
" he 'll raise his voice in national politics , " said falter .
" he 's good at that ; that 's his territory .
i think he 'll definitely perform well at the federal level . "
seehofer said in monday 's sueddeutsche zeitung , " my work place will be in munich , but my combat strength will also stretch to berlin . "
and if he 's to secure federal funds for bavaria 's troubled state bank , he 'll have to play his cards well in berlin . dw staff -lrb- kjb -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the team plays arguably the most fun football in the country with a bunch of players who were virtually unknown before the season began .

27 welcomed a ceasefire deal in somalia as nato successfully completed its first anti-piracy mission off the somali coast .
but experts questioned the current international efforts to combat piracy . eu foreign policy chief javier solana and nato secretary general jaap de hoop scheffer stressed the importance of cooperation between the two brussels-based institutions during a regular meeting of ambassadors at the alliance 's headquarters .
one area in which the two organizations are working together is in the fight against pirates operating in the gulf of aden .
while the eu 's own operations are to begin shortly , de hoop scheffer announced that nato had just completed its first anti-piracy mission by escorting a cargo ship delivering supplies to the african union mission to somalia .
an italian destroyer as well as british and greek frigates arrived in the gulf of aden last week as the front guard of nato 's anti-piracy operation allied provider .
the nato chief said nato warships would next be escorting world food program -lrb- wfp -rrb- cargos delivering food aid to the region .
" the operation is moving well , and the contacts we are having with the eu are also good , " de hoop scheffer said .
the eu has also pledged another three or four vessels by december in a bid to stem a phenomenon that is threatening world trade .
solana , for his part , welcomed a ceasefire agreement clinched over the weekend by the somali government and parts of the islamist opposition .
" this agreement is an important step forward , " solana said in a statement issued by his office in brussels .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : de hoop scheffer and solana join forces against piracy " only an inclusive political process will bring durable peace to somalia , and i call on all somalis to rally behind the transitional federal government of somalia and the alliance for the re-liberation of somalia and their endeavor to achieve this , " the statement said .
political instability has played a major role in preventing somalia from stopping gangs of pirates from seizing commercial vessels sailing off the country 's coast , prompting foreign organizations and nations to intervene .
experts doubt plausability of international efforts but despite western navies being spurred into action by the recent spate of high-profile hijackings by somali pirates , some experts argue that a handful of warships can do little to stamp out the lucrative piracy business .
but experts say a beefed up naval presence can achieve little more than escort services for food aid deliveries .
" when it comes to suppressing piracy , an extra 10 or 11 ships is still not a huge amount of naval presence for a very large area , " said roger middleton , consultant researcher for london-based think-tank chatham house in an interview with the afp news agency .
bildunterschrift : the german navy frigate emden will soon be deployed in the fight against piracy the new deployments added to the foreign ships already operating off the coast of somalia will eventually bring to between 20 and 25 the total number of warships patrolling the area 's dangerous waters by the end of the year .
according to the international maritime bureau , somali pirates have attacked more than 60 ships since the start of 2008 , hijacked almost half of them and received millions of dollars in ransom money .
the hijacking on september 25 of a ukrainian cargo loaded with battle tanks and other weaponry captured the world 's attention and may have sped up international action .
spreading piracy may overwhelm task force but pirates have expanded their activities to the eastern coast and the indian ocean and foreign warships will already have their hands full trying to secure a maritime corridor in the gulf of aden .
" if there is sufficient coordination between all these foreign actors , it can act as a deterrent but it 's definitely not the death knell of somali piracy , " middleton told afp .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : nato ships are spread thinly around the african coast western navies with modern equipment are already stretched by conflicts elsewhere in the world and experts argue the number of foreign warships tasked with patrolling somalia 's waters is unlikely to increase significantly in 2009 .
many observers argue sending ships is a band-aid approach which fails to look at the root causes of the phenomenon .
most pirate groups operate from the coast of puntland , a lawless breakaway state in northern somalia .
observers say ineffective security forces there and poverty have allowed piracy to flourish .
in the 17th century , haiti 's french governor brought hundreds of prostitutes to the famous pirate lair of tortuga in a bid to tame the island 's troublesome buccaneers .
such a move is hardly an option in modern-day somalia and france has markedly changed tactics since , being the only country so far to have used its military firepower against the pirates .
circumstances negate use of force bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the french are the only ones to engage militarily so far but that approach is reserved for those countries with strong intervention capabilities , raises awkward questions with regard to international law and is often neutralized by the risk posed to hostages .
" sending warships can only have a limited effect ... one of the best ways of combating piracy would be to stop the decline of puntland , " said stig jarle hansen , a somalia expert with the denmark-based risk intelligence group .
hansen argues that not only is there no evidence of ties between pirates and somalia 's islamist shebab organization , which has been fighting the country 's government , but the islamists were more effective than most in combating piracy .
a 2006 ethiopian invasion to oust the islamic courts union that had taken control of much of the country and support a fragile transitional government had a major impact on the surge in piracy .
" before the invasion , the shebab were probably the best pirate fighters the country has known , " said hansen , also a senior researcher with the norwegian institute for urban and regional research .
however there are signs that major foreign players could seek to address some of the root causes and are mulling a " naval peacekeeping force " that also tackles illegal fishing and waste dumping in somali waters , two issues that are often used as justifications by pirates . dpa news agency / dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

27 welcomed a ceasefire deal in somalia as nato successfully completed its first anti-piracy mission off the somali coast .
but experts questioned the current international efforts to combat piracy . eu foreign policy chief javier solana and nato secretary general jaap de hoop scheffer stressed the importance of cooperation between the two brussels-based institutions during a regular meeting of ambassadors at the alliance 's headquarters .
one area in which the two organizations are working together is in the fight against pirates operating in the gulf of aden .
while the eu 's own operations are to begin shortly , de hoop scheffer announced that nato had just completed its first anti-piracy mission by escorting a cargo ship delivering supplies to the african union mission to somalia .
an italian destroyer as well as british and greek frigates arrived in the gulf of aden last week as the front guard of nato 's anti-piracy operation allied provider .
the nato chief said nato warships would next be escorting world food program -lrb- wfp -rrb- cargos delivering food aid to the region .
" the operation is moving well , and the contacts we are having with the eu are also good , " de hoop scheffer said .
the eu has also pledged another three or four vessels by december in a bid to stem a phenomenon that is threatening world trade .
solana , for his part , welcomed a ceasefire agreement clinched over the weekend by the somali government and parts of the islamist opposition .
" this agreement is an important step forward , " solana said in a statement issued by his office in brussels .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : de hoop scheffer and solana join forces against piracy " only an inclusive political process will bring durable peace to somalia , and i call on all somalis to rally behind the transitional federal government of somalia and the alliance for the re-liberation of somalia and their endeavor to achieve this , " the statement said .
political instability has played a major role in preventing somalia from stopping gangs of pirates from seizing commercial vessels sailing off the country 's coast , prompting foreign organizations and nations to intervene .
experts doubt plausability of international efforts but despite western navies being spurred into action by the recent spate of high-profile hijackings by somali pirates , some experts argue that a handful of warships can do little to stamp out the lucrative piracy business .
but experts say a beefed up naval presence can achieve little more than escort services for food aid deliveries .
" when it comes to suppressing piracy , an extra 10 or 11 ships is still not a huge amount of naval presence for a very large area , " said roger middleton , consultant researcher for london-based think-tank chatham house in an interview with the afp news agency .
bildunterschrift : the german navy frigate emden will soon be deployed in the fight against piracy the new deployments added to the foreign ships already operating off the coast of somalia will eventually bring to between 20 and 25 the total number of warships patrolling the area 's dangerous waters by the end of the year .
according to the international maritime bureau , somali pirates have attacked more than 60 ships since the start of 2008 , hijacked almost half of them and received millions of dollars in ransom money .
the hijacking on september 25 of a ukrainian cargo loaded with battle tanks and other weaponry captured the world 's attention and may have sped up international action .
spreading piracy may overwhelm task force but pirates have expanded their activities to the eastern coast and the indian ocean and foreign warships will already have their hands full trying to secure a maritime corridor in the gulf of aden .
" if there is sufficient coordination between all these foreign actors , it can act as a deterrent but it 's definitely not the death knell of somali piracy , " middleton told afp .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : nato ships are spread thinly around the african coast western navies with modern equipment are already stretched by conflicts elsewhere in the world and experts argue the number of foreign warships tasked with patrolling somalia 's waters is unlikely to increase significantly in 2009 .
many observers argue sending ships is a band-aid approach which fails to look at the root causes of the phenomenon .
most pirate groups operate from the coast of puntland , a lawless breakaway state in northern somalia .
observers say ineffective security forces there and poverty have allowed piracy to flourish .
in the 17th century , haiti 's french governor brought hundreds of prostitutes to the famous pirate lair of tortuga in a bid to tame the island 's troublesome buccaneers .
such a move is hardly an option in modern-day somalia and france has markedly changed tactics since , being the only country so far to have used its military firepower against the pirates .
circumstances negate use of force bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the french are the only ones to engage militarily so far but that approach is reserved for those countries with strong intervention capabilities , raises awkward questions with regard to international law and is often neutralized by the risk posed to hostages .
" sending warships can only have a limited effect ... one of the best ways of combating piracy would be to stop the decline of puntland , " said stig jarle hansen , a somalia expert with the denmark-based risk intelligence group .
hansen argues that not only is there no evidence of ties between pirates and somalia 's islamist shebab organization , which has been fighting the country 's government , but the islamists were more effective than most in combating piracy .
a 2006 ethiopian invasion to oust the islamic courts union that had taken control of much of the country and support a fragile transitional government had a major impact on the surge in piracy .
" before the invasion , the shebab were probably the best pirate fighters the country has known , " said hansen , also a senior researcher with the norwegian institute for urban and regional research .
however there are signs that major foreign players could seek to address some of the root causes and are mulling a " naval peacekeeping force " that also tackles illegal fishing and waste dumping in somali waters , two issues that are often used as justifications by pirates . dpa news agency / dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

merkel is also to pay a visit to queen elizabeth ii at buckingham palace .
germany and britain have unveiled the biggest rescues of banks outside the united states , but the moves have failed to counter a slide in world stock markets which is being seen as a harbinger of a global recession .
merkel 's coalition is debating pump-priming to counter the effects of a business contraction .
her party supporters from the cdu -lrb- christian democrats -rrb- have suggested cuts in taxes on motor vehicles and a possible income tax rebate .
action expected soon in berlin , finance minister peer steinbrueck said he expected action this week or next .
steinbrueck said he and his own social democratic party -lrb- spd -rrb- opposed tax cuts because taxpayers might simply move their gains into savings instead of spending them , or might import more rather than buying home goods .
stressing the urgency of action , steinbrueck said after meeting with his party in berlin that tax cuts might also not gain traction till next year when many people receive their tax findings .
the finance minister said his party favored job creation by encouraging municipalities to speed construction of day cares and schools and by lending money to the mittelstand , germany 's web of medium-sized companies .
further options available other options include soft loans and subsidies for new home-heating and home-insulation work .
those projects are popular in germany as they also reduce oil and gas use and help cut carbon dioxide emissions .
steinbrueck , who has won praise in recent weeks as germany 's chief firefighter in the crisis , said he was also studying backing private investment in public infrastructure and european-level aid to car manufacturers .
he stressed that no decisions have been made by the government yet as of how to proceed . dpa news agency -lrb- cat -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

27 . however , discussions on a smoking ban in all of the member states ' workplaces are still at the preliminary stage , meaning any new rules are unlikely to be implemented before 2010 .
" clearly one of the areas which we would like to see covered -lrb- by the ban -rrb- is bars , restaurants and pubs , which are enclosed spaces where workers on a daily basis are exposed to passive smoking and to the consequences that passive smoking has on their own health and safety , " said chantal hughes , spokeswoman of eu employment commissioner vladimir spidla .
smoking bans currently differ widely across the eu .

but moscow favors the young democrat over the cold war veteran . john mccain 's us presidential campaign begged at the enemy 's door this week when a wayward fundraising letter reached the desk of russia 's un envoy vitaly churkin in new york asking for a donation . the russians would n't spare a ruble for the republican , and sent mccain a sardonic message saying that , unlike the united states , the russian government does " not finance political activity in foreign countries . "
us laws would have prevented them from donating had they wanted to send mccain a check . russian officials , in fact , are n't banking on either mccain or democratic candidate barack obama mending relations upturned by russia 's recent war with us-ally georgia . hoping for a fresh start but the preference among russians is reported to be in favor of obama because he represents a clean slate and will be more open to new proposals , according to konstantin kosachyov , head of the russian duma 's foreign affairs committee and a senior figure in the dominant pro-kremlin party . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : mccain 's kgb comment did n't go over well in moscow both us candidates took a harsh stance on russia in a recent debate when asked if the late us president ronald reagan 's designation of the former soviet union as the " evil empire " still applied to modern russia . mccain said " maybe " while obama , who has moved closer to his opponent 's hard-line stance since the war in georgia , said russia exhibited " evil behavior " in that conflict . nonetheless , kosachyov said this week that mccain 's anti-russian bias was deep-set while obama was a more " comfortable " choice . " mccain got his political formation during the cold war , " kosachyov told news agency interfax .
" he dedicated most of his life to the fight against communism .
it 's clear that to this day he still thrashes along that front without seeing any real difference between the soviet union and modern russia . " the kremlin has had good , even personal , ties with republican presidents .

leonid brezhnev and richard nixon signed the first us-russian arms control treaties .
mikhail gorbachev and ronald reagan saw their countries through the end of the cold war . sense of soul or secret police but russian leaders sat up and took note when mccain poked fun at us president george w. bush for saying he looked into his russian counterpart vladimir putin 's eyes and " got a sense of his soul . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : obama is compared to jfk , but us-russia relations were tense during his tenure mccain quipped that he saw something else - " three letters - a k , a g and a b , " referring to the former president and now prime minister who was a high-ranking kgb intelligence officer until the fall of the soviet union in 1991 . democratic presidents are more difficult partners for moscow because they tend toward a more complicated foreign policy view in contrast to the tough-styled russian realism , russian observers said . the closest the two countries ever came to nuclear war , they point out , was the 1962 cuban missile crisis under the late us president john f. kennedy , to whom obama is often compared . democratic president jimmy carter led a boycott of the moscow 1980 summer olympics , while russia blames bill clinton for pushing kosovo toward independence from serbia . personal over party " russian authorities would find it more difficult to deal with obama , " andrei kortunov , head of the moscow-based new eurasia foundation , told ria-novosti news agency .
" he will make world affairs more complicated . " but kosachyov said his choice was based on the candidates ' personal profiles over their political parties . " obama does n't differ particularly in his beliefs about russia from the republican candidate , but he is a young politician , without prejudices and so , more ready to take on a new proposals and approaches , " he said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : us plans to build a missile shield in eastern europe have disconcerted russia kosachyov cited as an example obama 's more compromising stance on us plans to site a missile defense shield in eastern europe , which russia views as a security threat . the us candidates ' russia advisors reveal marked difference in how each may navigate the widening gulf between both countries . obama 's top russia strategist , stanford professor michael mcfaul , called obama " an engagement guy , not an isolation guy . " mccain 's top russia expert is stephen biegun , who served bush on the us national security council from 2001 to 2003 and raises fears among russian diplomats that a republican president would perpetuate the current adversarial approach . tension without economic interdependence us plans to site a missile defense system in eastern europe and its support for western military alliance nato 's enlargement into the post-soviet space are , moscow says , a direct threat to its security . in fact , russia is battling the united states for influence in post-soviet countries it views as its rightful sphere of influence and where the us is attracted by energy and strategic interests . analysts in moscow say part of the problem is that security troubles between the two cold-war foes are not tempered by the business and energy interests that govern russia 's relations with the european union - its largest client for natural gas . dpa news agency -lrb- kjb -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

but moscow favors the young democrat over the cold war veteran . john mccain 's us presidential campaign begged at the enemy 's door this week when a wayward fundraising letter reached the desk of russia 's un envoy vitaly churkin in new york asking for a donation . the russians would n't spare a ruble for the republican , and sent mccain a sardonic message saying that , unlike the united states , the russian government does " not finance political activity in foreign countries . "
us laws would have prevented them from donating had they wanted to send mccain a check . russian officials , in fact , are n't banking on either mccain or democratic candidate barack obama mending relations upturned by russia 's recent war with us-ally georgia . hoping for a fresh start but the preference among russians is reported to be in favor of obama because he represents a clean slate and will be more open to new proposals , according to konstantin kosachyov , head of the russian duma 's foreign affairs committee and a senior figure in the dominant pro-kremlin party . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : mccain 's kgb comment did n't go over well in moscow both us candidates took a harsh stance on russia in a recent debate when asked if the late us president ronald reagan 's designation of the former soviet union as the " evil empire " still applied to modern russia . mccain said " maybe " while obama , who has moved closer to his opponent 's hard-line stance since the war in georgia , said russia exhibited " evil behavior " in that conflict . nonetheless , kosachyov said this week that mccain 's anti-russian bias was deep-set while obama was a more " comfortable " choice . " mccain got his political formation during the cold war , " kosachyov told news agency interfax .
" he dedicated most of his life to the fight against communism .
it 's clear that to this day he still thrashes along that front without seeing any real difference between the soviet union and modern russia . " the kremlin has had good , even personal , ties with republican presidents .

leonid brezhnev and richard nixon signed the first us-russian arms control treaties .
mikhail gorbachev and ronald reagan saw their countries through the end of the cold war . sense of soul or secret police but russian leaders sat up and took note when mccain poked fun at us president george w. bush for saying he looked into his russian counterpart vladimir putin 's eyes and " got a sense of his soul . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : obama is compared to jfk , but us-russia relations were tense during his tenure mccain quipped that he saw something else - " three letters - a k , a g and a b , " referring to the former president and now prime minister who was a high-ranking kgb intelligence officer until the fall of the soviet union in 1991 . democratic presidents are more difficult partners for moscow because they tend toward a more complicated foreign policy view in contrast to the tough-styled russian realism , russian observers said . the closest the two countries ever came to nuclear war , they point out , was the 1962 cuban missile crisis under the late us president john f. kennedy , to whom obama is often compared . democratic president jimmy carter led a boycott of the moscow 1980 summer olympics , while russia blames bill clinton for pushing kosovo toward independence from serbia . personal over party " russian authorities would find it more difficult to deal with obama , " andrei kortunov , head of the moscow-based new eurasia foundation , told ria-novosti news agency .
" he will make world affairs more complicated . " but kosachyov said his choice was based on the candidates ' personal profiles over their political parties .

hungary will also get " substantial " help , the specifics of which will be announced in the next few days , imf director dominique strauss-kahn confirmed monday , oct.27. the imf has offered up to $ 200 billion in loans to countries facing financial difficulties caused by the current global economic crisis . on friday , the imf made a $ 2.1 billion loan to iceland . the current climate of market instability has thrust the imf into the spotlight .
some world leaders , including german chancellor angela merkel , have called for the global body to become more involved in policing global financial markets .
merkel called for " better international coordination " and " a strengthening of the role played by the imf in ensuring stability of the global financial system . " rich nations promise cooperation bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the imf said money is on the way to ukraine and hungary the g7 rich nations also promised to work together to stabilize global markets in a statement released monday .

" " we continue to monitor markets closely and cooperate as appropriate , " the statement from g7 finance ministers and central bank chiefs said . it was unclear whether that promise would be enough to bring stability to the markets .

germany 's dax was also down 3.54 percent at the start of trading monday and the british stock market slumped by more than 5 percent early on . ukraine facing political , financial turmoil ukraine began to run into problems when the global demand for steel , its main export , began to drop in recent weeks . earlier this month , the former soviet country stopped early withdrawals from savings accounts to stop a run on banks .

that has led to worries that the government will be unable to pay back some foreign loans that have been a driving force behind ukraine 's recent economic growth . " the imf is moving expeditiously to help ukraine , and this program is focused on the essential upfront measures needed to maintain confidence and economic and financial stability , " the imf chief said in his statement . yet the country is still in the midst of a political crisis .
president viktor yushchenko and prime minister yulia tymoshenko have been locked in a nasty fight over the president 's decision to call for new elections . the finance ministry in kyiv welcomed the imf 's support , saying it " opened a door to ukraine 's speedy cooperation with other international financial organizations . " hungary expected to set spending limits the imf , european governments and other partners are set to offer help to hungary .
while the imf did not release the size of the rescue package , analysts said it should be over $ 10 billion . hungary is vulnerable due to a large budget deficit , overvalued currency , low stock of foreign reserve and high levels of short-term foreign currency debt , afp news agency said .
the country 's national currency , the forint , has fallen sharply . last week , hungary 's central bank decided to raise its key interest rate by three points to 11.5 percent , the highest in the european union . dw staff -lrb- th -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

hungary will also get " substantial " help , the specifics of which will be announced in the next few days , imf director dominique strauss-kahn confirmed monday , oct.27. the imf has offered up to $ 200 billion in loans to countries facing financial difficulties caused by the current global economic crisis . on friday , the imf made a $ 2.1 billion loan to iceland . the current climate of market instability has thrust the imf into the spotlight .
some world leaders , including german chancellor angela merkel , have called for the global body to become more involved in policing global financial markets .
merkel called for " better international coordination " and " a strengthening of the role played by the imf in ensuring stability of the global financial system . " rich nations promise cooperation bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the imf said money is on the way to ukraine and hungary the g7 rich nations also promised to work together to stabilize global markets in a statement released monday .
the group of seven nations - made up of britain , canada , france , germany , italy , japan and the united states - sought to calm the global financial panic by affirming their " shared interest in a strong and stable international financial system . " " we continue to monitor markets closely and cooperate as appropriate , " the statement from g7 finance ministers and central bank chiefs said . it was unclear whether that promise would be enough to bring stability to the markets .
japan 's nikkei stock index and most other markets in asia posted major losses on monday .
germany 's dax was also down 3.54 percent at the start of trading monday and the british stock market slumped by more than 5 percent early on . ukraine facing political , financial turmoil ukraine began to run into problems when the global demand for steel , its main export , began to drop in recent weeks . earlier this month , the former soviet country stopped early withdrawals from savings accounts to stop a run on banks .
several of the county 's banks also needed help after ukraine 's stock market lost more than 70 percent of its value . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ukraine 's leaders are more at odds than it might appear the country has also begun using up foreign currency reserves to prop up its currency , the hryvnia , according to analysts .
that has led to worries that the government will be unable to pay back some foreign loans that have been a driving force behind ukraine 's recent economic growth . " the imf is moving expeditiously to help ukraine , and this program is focused on the essential upfront measures needed to maintain confidence and economic and financial stability , " the imf chief said in his statement . yet the country is still in the midst of a political crisis .
president viktor yushchenko and prime minister yulia tymoshenko have been locked in a nasty fight over the president 's decision to call for new elections . the finance ministry in kyiv welcomed the imf 's support , saying it " opened a door to ukraine 's speedy cooperation with other international financial organizations . " hungary expected to set spending limits the imf , european governments and other partners are set to offer help to hungary .
while the imf did not release the size of the rescue package , analysts said it should be over $ 10 billion . hungary is vulnerable due to a large budget deficit , overvalued currency , low stock of foreign reserve and high levels of short-term foreign currency debt , afp news agency said .
the country 's national currency , the forint , has fallen sharply . last week , hungary 's central bank decided to raise its key interest rate by three points to 11.5 percent , the highest in the european union . dw staff -lrb- th -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de politics -pipe- 27.10.2008 bavaria set to seal landmark coalition under new premier großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : seehofer takes the helm as the waters get rough the conservative christian social union -lrb- csu -rrb- , which has ruled bavaria alone for 42 years , is to sign a coalition deal with a liberal pro-business minority and name new csu chief horst seehofer as state premier . on monday , oct .
27 , seehofer and sabine leutheusser-schnarrenberger , the head of the free democratic party -lrb- fdp -rrb- are to ink the historic coalition agreement that ends over four decades of sole conservative rule in germany 's largest state .
the csu , the sister party to chancellor angela merkel 's christian democratic union , lost its absolute majority in state elections four weeks ago , forcing it to seek a governing partner .
the fdp won seats in the bavarian state assembly in the sept .
28 poll for the first time in 14 years and is to take over the economy and science ministries .
an fdp convention in the city of ingolstadt approved the arrangement sunday .
" it 's always hard to give something up , " said csu majority leader georg schmid , " but that 's how it is in a coalition and i think we 've reached a good consensus with each other , for example in distributing the ministries . "
the two parties plan to partly relax a strict ban on smoking in bars which was blamed by some for the csu 's loss of one third of its traditional support at the state election .
bavaria names new premier after the loss in support to just 43 per cent of ballots , the bavaria-only csu deposed both its former leader , erwin huber , and its state premier , guenther beckstein .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : rescuing bavaria 's state bank will be first on seehofer 's agenda seehofer was named csu chief at a party meeting on saturday and , on monday , is to be appointed to the position of state premier .
he relinquished his currents posts in berlin as federal minister of agriculture and minister for consumer affairs . despite receiving a 90.3 percent majority in the delegation 's vote for chairman on saturday , seehofer is not entirely without controversy within his own party .
reports of an extra-marital affair last year damaged his reputation among some of the more conservative party members who see the csu as a bastion of traditional values .
hurdles ahead for seehofer the csu has not only lost both broad support from the majority of voters and faith in its leadership , but the state 's economic situation is also in grave danger after nine-figure losses at partially state-run landesbank bayern lb as a result of the international finance crisis .
" i think the rest of the country looks at bavaria with a certain schadenfreude , " political scientist juergen falter told deutsche welle .
in addition to fighting for tax cuts and inheritance tax reform , seehofer has already promised to make the crisis at the state bank first priority .
the key to seehofer 's success , said falter , is to secure his position in bavaria so that he is unchallenged in berlin .
" he 'll raise his voice in national politics , " said falter .
" he 's good at that ; that 's his territory .
i think he 'll definitely perform well at the federal level . "
seehofer said in monday 's sueddeutsche zeitung , " my work place will be in munich , but my combat strength will also stretch to berlin . "
and if he 's to secure federal funds for bavaria 's troubled state bank , he 'll have to play his cards well in berlin . dw staff -lrb- kjb -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

merkel is also to pay a visit to queen elizabeth ii at buckingham palace .
germany and britain have unveiled the biggest rescues of banks outside the united states , but the moves have failed to counter a slide in world stock markets which is being seen as a harbinger of a global recession .
merkel 's coalition is debating pump-priming to counter the effects of a business contraction .
her party supporters from the cdu -lrb- christian democrats -rrb- have suggested cuts in taxes on motor vehicles and a possible income tax rebate .
action expected soon in berlin , finance minister peer steinbrueck said he expected action this week or next .
steinbrueck said he and his own social democratic party -lrb- spd -rrb- opposed tax cuts because taxpayers might simply move their gains into savings instead of spending them , or might import more rather than buying home goods .
stressing the urgency of action , steinbrueck said after meeting with his party in berlin that tax cuts might also not gain traction till next year when many people receive their tax findings .
the finance minister said his party favored job creation by encouraging municipalities to speed construction of day cares and schools and by lending money to the mittelstand , germany 's web of medium-sized companies .
further options available other options include soft loans and subsidies for new home-heating and home-insulation work .

five occupants were wounded , the defense ministry said . a spokesman said the incident occurred on a main road near the northern city of kunduz .
the troops , serving with the nato-led international security assistance force -lrb- isaf -rrb- , first fired warning shots at the minibus , the spokesman said .
when the driver continued to approach the checkpoint at high speed , the soldiers opened fire with sub-machine guns , hitting the vehicle 's engine , the spokesman said .
five men were wounded , among them two who suffered injuries serious enough to require treatment at the german base in mazar-i-sharif .
a search of the vehicle failed to turn up any arms .
the people in the minibus were civilians taking the body of a relative from kabul to the northeast province of badahkshan for burial , a local police official said .
they were in a hurry and driving at high speed when the soldiers opened fire , said abdul rahman aktash , deputy police chief of kunduz province .
latest incident comes as security deteriorates the incident happened a week after two german soldiers and five children were killed in a suicide attack near kunduz .
in august , a german soldier accidentally shot dead an afghan woman and two children at a checkpoint .
the security situation around kunduz , where most of germany 's 3,500-strong isaf contingent is based , has deteriorated in recent months .
this year more than 250 soldiers have lost their lives in afghanistan , more than in any year since the international military operation was launched in 2001 .
some 30 germans serving with isaf have been killed . dpa news agency -lrb- cat -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

merkel is also to pay a visit to queen elizabeth ii at buckingham palace .
germany and britain have unveiled the biggest rescues of banks outside the united states , but the moves have failed to counter a slide in world stock markets which is being seen as a harbinger of a global recession .
merkel 's coalition is debating pump-priming to counter the effects of a business contraction .
her party supporters from the cdu -lrb- christian democrats -rrb- have suggested cuts in taxes on motor vehicles and a possible income tax rebate .
action expected soon in berlin , finance minister peer steinbrueck said he expected action this week or next .
steinbrueck said he and his own social democratic party -lrb- spd -rrb- opposed tax cuts because taxpayers might simply move their gains into savings instead of spending them , or might import more rather than buying home goods .
stressing the urgency of action , steinbrueck said after meeting with his party in berlin that tax cuts might also not gain traction till next year when many people receive their tax findings .
the finance minister said his party favored job creation by encouraging municipalities to speed construction of day cares and schools and by lending money to the mittelstand , germany 's web of medium-sized companies .
further options available other options include soft loans and subsidies for new home-heating and home-insulation work .
those projects are popular in germany as they also reduce oil and gas use and help cut carbon dioxide emissions .
steinbrueck , who has won praise in recent weeks as germany 's chief firefighter in the crisis , said he was also studying backing private investment in public infrastructure and european-level aid to car manufacturers .
he stressed that no decisions have been made by the government yet as of how to proceed . dpa news agency -lrb- cat -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

but moscow favors the young democrat over the cold war veteran . john mccain 's us presidential campaign begged at the enemy 's door this week when a wayward fundraising letter reached the desk of russia 's un envoy vitaly churkin in new york asking for a donation . the russians would n't spare a ruble for the republican , and sent mccain a sardonic message saying that , unlike the united states , the russian government does " not finance political activity in foreign countries . "
us laws would have prevented them from donating had they wanted to send mccain a check . russian officials , in fact , are n't banking on either mccain or democratic candidate barack obama mending relations upturned by russia 's recent war with us-ally georgia . hoping for a fresh start but the preference among russians is reported to be in favor of obama because he represents a clean slate and will be more open to new proposals , according to konstantin kosachyov , head of the russian duma 's foreign affairs committee and a senior figure in the dominant pro-kremlin party . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : mccain 's kgb comment did n't go over well in moscow both us candidates took a harsh stance on russia in a recent debate when asked if the late us president ronald reagan 's designation of the former soviet union as the " evil empire " still applied to modern russia . mccain said " maybe " while obama , who has moved closer to his opponent 's hard-line stance since the war in georgia , said russia exhibited " evil behavior " in that conflict . nonetheless , kosachyov said this week that mccain 's anti-russian bias was deep-set while obama was a more " comfortable " choice . " mccain got his political formation during the cold war , " kosachyov told news agency interfax .
" he dedicated most of his life to the fight against communism .

" he will make world affairs more complicated . " but kosachyov said his choice was based on the candidates ' personal profiles over their political parties . " obama does n't differ particularly in his beliefs about russia from the republican candidate , but he is a young politician , without prejudices and so , more ready to take on a new proposals and approaches , " he said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : us plans to build a missile shield in eastern europe have disconcerted russia kosachyov cited as an example obama 's more compromising stance on us plans to site a missile defense shield in eastern europe , which russia views as a security threat . the us candidates ' russia advisors reveal marked difference in how each may navigate the widening gulf between both countries . obama 's top russia strategist , stanford professor michael mcfaul , called obama " an engagement guy , not an isolation guy .

that warning by a leading economist came as german scientists weighed in with their own grim predictions about rising sea levels . it would be a big mistake for leaders to ignore climate change during the financial crisis , said nicholas stern , a former british treasury economist , who released a seminal report in 2006 that said inaction on emissions blamed for global warming could cause economic pain equal to the great depression .
" that 's a very important lesson , tackle risk early , " stern told a climate and carbon conference in hong kong .
there have been worries that countries will be unwilling to commit to climate change goals at an international meeting scheduled in copenhagen at the end of next year .
stern said he was optimistic that countries would agree to reduce carbon emissions by 50 percent by 2050 .

governments should use the global financial crisis as an opportunity to kickstart green technologies , greenpeace and the european renewable energy council -lrb- erec -rrb- said in a " practical blueprint " presented in berlin on monday .
governments should aggressively invest in renewable power generation and energy , which could create a $ 360 billion -lrb- 285 billion euro -rrb- industry that could provide half of the world 's electricity , according to the study .
" especially in the context of today 's economic instability , investing in renewable energy technologies is a ' win-win-win ' scenario : a win for energy security , a win for the economy and a win for the climate , " the group said .
scientists warn of big rise in ocean levels bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : governments have been called on to invest in renewable energy german scientists announced monday that ocean levels will rise much more than previously thought because climate change is happening much faster than predicted .
they expect a one meter increase this century .
earlier estimates had predicted a rise of 18 to 59 centimeters .
" we now have to expect that the sea level will rise by a meter this century , " said hans joachim schellnhuber , who heads the potsdam institute for research on global warming effects .
he and jochem marotzke , a leading meteorologist , have been looking at ocean levels .
schellnhuber said it is " just barely possible " that world governments will be able to limit the rise in average global temperatures to just 2 degrees celsius by the end of the century , if they all strictly adhere to severe limits in carbon dioxide emissions . dw staff -lrb- th -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

27 welcomed a ceasefire deal in somalia as nato successfully completed its first anti-piracy mission off the somali coast .
but experts questioned the current international efforts to combat piracy . eu foreign policy chief javier solana and nato secretary general jaap de hoop scheffer stressed the importance of cooperation between the two brussels-based institutions during a regular meeting of ambassadors at the alliance 's headquarters .
one area in which the two organizations are working together is in the fight against pirates operating in the gulf of aden .
while the eu 's own operations are to begin shortly , de hoop scheffer announced that nato had just completed its first anti-piracy mission by escorting a cargo ship delivering supplies to the african union mission to somalia .
an italian destroyer as well as british and greek frigates arrived in the gulf of aden last week as the front guard of nato 's anti-piracy operation allied provider .
the nato chief said nato warships would next be escorting world food program -lrb- wfp -rrb- cargos delivering food aid to the region .
" the operation is moving well , and the contacts we are having with the eu are also good , " de hoop scheffer said .
the eu has also pledged another three or four vessels by december in a bid to stem a phenomenon that is threatening world trade .
solana , for his part , welcomed a ceasefire agreement clinched over the weekend by the somali government and parts of the islamist opposition .
" this agreement is an important step forward , " solana said in a statement issued by his office in brussels .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : de hoop scheffer and solana join forces against piracy " only an inclusive political process will bring durable peace to somalia , and i call on all somalis to rally behind the transitional federal government of somalia and the alliance for the re-liberation of somalia and their endeavor to achieve this , " the statement said .
political instability has played a major role in preventing somalia from stopping gangs of pirates from seizing commercial vessels sailing off the country 's coast , prompting foreign organizations and nations to intervene .
experts doubt plausability of international efforts but despite western navies being spurred into action by the recent spate of high-profile hijackings by somali pirates , some experts argue that a handful of warships can do little to stamp out the lucrative piracy business .
but experts say a beefed up naval presence can achieve little more than escort services for food aid deliveries .
" when it comes to suppressing piracy , an extra 10 or 11 ships is still not a huge amount of naval presence for a very large area , " said roger middleton , consultant researcher for london-based think-tank chatham house in an interview with the afp news agency .
bildunterschrift : the german navy frigate emden will soon be deployed in the fight against piracy the new deployments added to the foreign ships already operating off the coast of somalia will eventually bring to between 20 and 25 the total number of warships patrolling the area 's dangerous waters by the end of the year .
according to the international maritime bureau , somali pirates have attacked more than 60 ships since the start of 2008 , hijacked almost half of them and received millions of dollars in ransom money .
the hijacking on september 25 of a ukrainian cargo loaded with battle tanks and other weaponry captured the world 's attention and may have sped up international action .
spreading piracy may overwhelm task force but pirates have expanded their activities to the eastern coast and the indian ocean and foreign warships will already have their hands full trying to secure a maritime corridor in the gulf of aden .
" if there is sufficient coordination between all these foreign actors , it can act as a deterrent but it 's definitely not the death knell of somali piracy , " middleton told afp .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : nato ships are spread thinly around the african coast western navies with modern equipment are already stretched by conflicts elsewhere in the world and experts argue the number of foreign warships tasked with patrolling somalia 's waters is unlikely to increase significantly in 2009 .
many observers argue sending ships is a band-aid approach which fails to look at the root causes of the phenomenon .
most pirate groups operate from the coast of puntland , a lawless breakaway state in northern somalia .
observers say ineffective security forces there and poverty have allowed piracy to flourish .
in the 17th century , haiti 's french governor brought hundreds of prostitutes to the famous pirate lair of tortuga in a bid to tame the island 's troublesome buccaneers .
such a move is hardly an option in modern-day somalia and france has markedly changed tactics since , being the only country so far to have used its military firepower against the pirates .
circumstances negate use of force bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the french are the only ones to engage militarily so far but that approach is reserved for those countries with strong intervention capabilities , raises awkward questions with regard to international law and is often neutralized by the risk posed to hostages .
" sending warships can only have a limited effect ... one of the best ways of combating piracy would be to stop the decline of puntland , " said stig jarle hansen , a somalia expert with the denmark-based risk intelligence group .
hansen argues that not only is there no evidence of ties between pirates and somalia 's islamist shebab organization , which has been fighting the country 's government , but the islamists were more effective than most in combating piracy .
a 2006 ethiopian invasion to oust the islamic courts union that had taken control of much of the country and support a fragile transitional government had a major impact on the surge in piracy .
" before the invasion , the shebab were probably the best pirate fighters the country has known , " said hansen , also a senior researcher with the norwegian institute for urban and regional research .
however there are signs that major foreign players could seek to address some of the root causes and are mulling a " naval peacekeeping force " that also tackles illegal fishing and waste dumping in somali waters , two issues that are often used as justifications by pirates . dpa news agency / dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

27 welcomed a ceasefire deal in somalia as nato successfully completed its first anti-piracy mission off the somali coast .
but experts questioned the current international efforts to combat piracy . eu foreign policy chief javier solana and nato secretary general jaap de hoop scheffer stressed the importance of cooperation between the two brussels-based institutions during a regular meeting of ambassadors at the alliance 's headquarters .
one area in which the two organizations are working together is in the fight against pirates operating in the gulf of aden .
while the eu 's own operations are to begin shortly , de hoop scheffer announced that nato had just completed its first anti-piracy mission by escorting a cargo ship delivering supplies to the african union mission to somalia .
an italian destroyer as well as british and greek frigates arrived in the gulf of aden last week as the front guard of nato 's anti-piracy operation allied provider .
the nato chief said nato warships would next be escorting world food program -lrb- wfp -rrb- cargos delivering food aid to the region .
" the operation is moving well , and the contacts we are having with the eu are also good , " de hoop scheffer said .
the eu has also pledged another three or four vessels by december in a bid to stem a phenomenon that is threatening world trade .
solana , for his part , welcomed a ceasefire agreement clinched over the weekend by the somali government and parts of the islamist opposition .
" this agreement is an important step forward , " solana said in a statement issued by his office in brussels .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : de hoop scheffer and solana join forces against piracy " only an inclusive political process will bring durable peace to somalia , and i call on all somalis to rally behind the transitional federal government of somalia and the alliance for the re-liberation of somalia and their endeavor to achieve this , " the statement said .
political instability has played a major role in preventing somalia from stopping gangs of pirates from seizing commercial vessels sailing off the country 's coast , prompting foreign organizations and nations to intervene .
experts doubt plausability of international efforts but despite western navies being spurred into action by the recent spate of high-profile hijackings by somali pirates , some experts argue that a handful of warships can do little to stamp out the lucrative piracy business .
but experts say a beefed up naval presence can achieve little more than escort services for food aid deliveries .
" when it comes to suppressing piracy , an extra 10 or 11 ships is still not a huge amount of naval presence for a very large area , " said roger middleton , consultant researcher for london-based think-tank chatham house in an interview with the afp news agency .
bildunterschrift : the german navy frigate emden will soon be deployed in the fight against piracy the new deployments added to the foreign ships already operating off the coast of somalia will eventually bring to between 20 and 25 the total number of warships patrolling the area 's dangerous waters by the end of the year .
according to the international maritime bureau , somali pirates have attacked more than 60 ships since the start of 2008 , hijacked almost half of them and received millions of dollars in ransom money .
the hijacking on september 25 of a ukrainian cargo loaded with battle tanks and other weaponry captured the world 's attention and may have sped up international action .
spreading piracy may overwhelm task force but pirates have expanded their activities to the eastern coast and the indian ocean and foreign warships will already have their hands full trying to secure a maritime corridor in the gulf of aden .
" if there is sufficient coordination between all these foreign actors , it can act as a deterrent but it 's definitely not the death knell of somali piracy , " middleton told afp .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : nato ships are spread thinly around the african coast western navies with modern equipment are already stretched by conflicts elsewhere in the world and experts argue the number of foreign warships tasked with patrolling somalia 's waters is unlikely to increase significantly in 2009 .
many observers argue sending ships is a band-aid approach which fails to look at the root causes of the phenomenon .
most pirate groups operate from the coast of puntland , a lawless breakaway state in northern somalia .
observers say ineffective security forces there and poverty have allowed piracy to flourish .
in the 17th century , haiti 's french governor brought hundreds of prostitutes to the famous pirate lair of tortuga in a bid to tame the island 's troublesome buccaneers .
such a move is hardly an option in modern-day somalia and france has markedly changed tactics since , being the only country so far to have used its military firepower against the pirates .
circumstances negate use of force bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the french are the only ones to engage militarily so far but that approach is reserved for those countries with strong intervention capabilities , raises awkward questions with regard to international law and is often neutralized by the risk posed to hostages .
" sending warships can only have a limited effect ... one of the best ways of combating piracy would be to stop the decline of puntland , " said stig jarle hansen , a somalia expert with the denmark-based risk intelligence group .

an online poll of the mass circulation paper bild said on monday that 61 percent of some 16,000 voters believed that rangnick 's team was good enough for the title .
impressive start hoffenheim 's vedad ibisevic is the bundesliga top scorer with 10 goals .
demba ba or chinedu obasi have also been big scorers for the team .
rangnick 's successful formula of attacking football is helped by the fact , in his opinion , that " the players have been together for more than a year and know each other . "

27 , seehofer and sabine leutheusser-schnarrenberger , the head of the free democratic party -lrb- fdp -rrb- are to ink the historic coalition agreement that ends over four decades of sole conservative rule in germany 's largest state .
the csu , the sister party to chancellor angela merkel 's christian democratic union , lost its absolute majority in state elections four weeks ago , forcing it to seek a governing partner .
the fdp won seats in the bavarian state assembly in the sept .
28 poll for the first time in 14 years and is to take over the economy and science ministries .
an fdp convention in the city of ingolstadt approved the arrangement sunday .
" it 's always hard to give something up , " said csu majority leader georg schmid , " but that 's how it is in a coalition and i think we 've reached a good consensus with each other , for example in distributing the ministries . "
the two parties plan to partly relax a strict ban on smoking in bars which was blamed by some for the csu 's loss of one third of its traditional support at the state election .
bavaria names new premier after the loss in support to just 43 per cent of ballots , the bavaria-only csu deposed both its former leader , erwin huber , and its state premier , guenther beckstein .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : rescuing bavaria 's state bank will be first on seehofer 's agenda seehofer was named csu chief at a party meeting on saturday and , on monday , is to be appointed to the position of state premier .
he relinquished his currents posts in berlin as federal minister of agriculture and minister for consumer affairs . despite receiving a 90.3 percent majority in the delegation 's vote for chairman on saturday , seehofer is not entirely without controversy within his own party .
reports of an extra-marital affair last year damaged his reputation among some of the more conservative party members who see the csu as a bastion of traditional values .
hurdles ahead for seehofer the csu has not only lost both broad support from the majority of voters and faith in its leadership , but the state 's economic situation is also in grave danger after nine-figure losses at partially state-run landesbank bayern lb as a result of the international finance crisis .
" i think the rest of the country looks at bavaria with a certain schadenfreude , " political scientist juergen falter told deutsche welle .
in addition to fighting for tax cuts and inheritance tax reform , seehofer has already promised to make the crisis at the state bank first priority .
the key to seehofer 's success , said falter , is to secure his position in bavaria so that he is unchallenged in berlin .
" he 'll raise his voice in national politics , " said falter .
" he 's good at that ; that 's his territory .
i think he 'll definitely perform well at the federal level . "
seehofer said in monday 's sueddeutsche zeitung , " my work place will be in munich , but my combat strength will also stretch to berlin . "
and if he 's to secure federal funds for bavaria 's troubled state bank , he 'll have to play his cards well in berlin . dw staff -lrb- kjb -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

27 welcomed a ceasefire deal in somalia as nato successfully completed its first anti-piracy mission off the somali coast .
but experts questioned the current international efforts to combat piracy . eu foreign policy chief javier solana and nato secretary general jaap de hoop scheffer stressed the importance of cooperation between the two brussels-based institutions during a regular meeting of ambassadors at the alliance 's headquarters .
one area in which the two organizations are working together is in the fight against pirates operating in the gulf of aden .
while the eu 's own operations are to begin shortly , de hoop scheffer announced that nato had just completed its first anti-piracy mission by escorting a cargo ship delivering supplies to the african union mission to somalia .
an italian destroyer as well as british and greek frigates arrived in the gulf of aden last week as the front guard of nato 's anti-piracy operation allied provider .
the nato chief said nato warships would next be escorting world food program -lrb- wfp -rrb- cargos delivering food aid to the region .
" the operation is moving well , and the contacts we are having with the eu are also good , " de hoop scheffer said .
the eu has also pledged another three or four vessels by december in a bid to stem a phenomenon that is threatening world trade .
solana , for his part , welcomed a ceasefire agreement clinched over the weekend by the somali government and parts of the islamist opposition .
" this agreement is an important step forward , " solana said in a statement issued by his office in brussels .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : de hoop scheffer and solana join forces against piracy " only an inclusive political process will bring durable peace to somalia , and i call on all somalis to rally behind the transitional federal government of somalia and the alliance for the re-liberation of somalia and their endeavor to achieve this , " the statement said .
political instability has played a major role in preventing somalia from stopping gangs of pirates from seizing commercial vessels sailing off the country 's coast , prompting foreign organizations and nations to intervene .
experts doubt plausability of international efforts but despite western navies being spurred into action by the recent spate of high-profile hijackings by somali pirates , some experts argue that a handful of warships can do little to stamp out the lucrative piracy business .
but experts say a beefed up naval presence can achieve little more than escort services for food aid deliveries .
" when it comes to suppressing piracy , an extra 10 or 11 ships is still not a huge amount of naval presence for a very large area , " said roger middleton , consultant researcher for london-based think-tank chatham house in an interview with the afp news agency .
bildunterschrift : the german navy frigate emden will soon be deployed in the fight against piracy the new deployments added to the foreign ships already operating off the coast of somalia will eventually bring to between 20 and 25 the total number of warships patrolling the area 's dangerous waters by the end of the year .
according to the international maritime bureau , somali pirates have attacked more than 60 ships since the start of 2008 , hijacked almost half of them and received millions of dollars in ransom money .
the hijacking on september 25 of a ukrainian cargo loaded with battle tanks and other weaponry captured the world 's attention and may have sped up international action .
spreading piracy may overwhelm task force but pirates have expanded their activities to the eastern coast and the indian ocean and foreign warships will already have their hands full trying to secure a maritime corridor in the gulf of aden .
" if there is sufficient coordination between all these foreign actors , it can act as a deterrent but it 's definitely not the death knell of somali piracy , " middleton told afp .

many observers argue sending ships is a band-aid approach which fails to look at the root causes of the phenomenon .
most pirate groups operate from the coast of puntland , a lawless breakaway state in northern somalia .
observers say ineffective security forces there and poverty have allowed piracy to flourish .
in the 17th century , haiti 's french governor brought hundreds of prostitutes to the famous pirate lair of tortuga in a bid to tame the island 's troublesome buccaneers .

" sending warships can only have a limited effect ... one of the best ways of combating piracy would be to stop the decline of puntland , " said stig jarle hansen , a somalia expert with the denmark-based risk intelligence group .
hansen argues that not only is there no evidence of ties between pirates and somalia 's islamist shebab organization , which has been fighting the country 's government , but the islamists were more effective than most in combating piracy .
a 2006 ethiopian invasion to oust the islamic courts union that had taken control of much of the country and support a fragile transitional government had a major impact on the surge in piracy .
" before the invasion , the shebab were probably the best pirate fighters the country has known , " said hansen , also a senior researcher with the norwegian institute for urban and regional research .
however there are signs that major foreign players could seek to address some of the root causes and are mulling a " naval peacekeeping force " that also tackles illegal fishing and waste dumping in somali waters , two issues that are often used as justifications by pirates . dpa news agency / dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

27 welcomed a ceasefire deal in somalia as nato successfully completed its first anti-piracy mission off the somali coast .
but experts questioned the current international efforts to combat piracy . eu foreign policy chief javier solana and nato secretary general jaap de hoop scheffer stressed the importance of cooperation between the two brussels-based institutions during a regular meeting of ambassadors at the alliance 's headquarters .
one area in which the two organizations are working together is in the fight against pirates operating in the gulf of aden .
while the eu 's own operations are to begin shortly , de hoop scheffer announced that nato had just completed its first anti-piracy mission by escorting a cargo ship delivering supplies to the african union mission to somalia .
an italian destroyer as well as british and greek frigates arrived in the gulf of aden last week as the front guard of nato 's anti-piracy operation allied provider .
the nato chief said nato warships would next be escorting world food program -lrb- wfp -rrb- cargos delivering food aid to the region .
" the operation is moving well , and the contacts we are having with the eu are also good , " de hoop scheffer said .
the eu has also pledged another three or four vessels by december in a bid to stem a phenomenon that is threatening world trade .
solana , for his part , welcomed a ceasefire agreement clinched over the weekend by the somali government and parts of the islamist opposition .
" this agreement is an important step forward , " solana said in a statement issued by his office in brussels .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : de hoop scheffer and solana join forces against piracy " only an inclusive political process will bring durable peace to somalia , and i call on all somalis to rally behind the transitional federal government of somalia and the alliance for the re-liberation of somalia and their endeavor to achieve this , " the statement said .
political instability has played a major role in preventing somalia from stopping gangs of pirates from seizing commercial vessels sailing off the country 's coast , prompting foreign organizations and nations to intervene .
experts doubt plausability of international efforts but despite western navies being spurred into action by the recent spate of high-profile hijackings by somali pirates , some experts argue that a handful of warships can do little to stamp out the lucrative piracy business .
but experts say a beefed up naval presence can achieve little more than escort services for food aid deliveries .
" when it comes to suppressing piracy , an extra 10 or 11 ships is still not a huge amount of naval presence for a very large area , " said roger middleton , consultant researcher for london-based think-tank chatham house in an interview with the afp news agency .
bildunterschrift : the german navy frigate emden will soon be deployed in the fight against piracy the new deployments added to the foreign ships already operating off the coast of somalia will eventually bring to between 20 and 25 the total number of warships patrolling the area 's dangerous waters by the end of the year .
according to the international maritime bureau , somali pirates have attacked more than 60 ships since the start of 2008 , hijacked almost half of them and received millions of dollars in ransom money .
the hijacking on september 25 of a ukrainian cargo loaded with battle tanks and other weaponry captured the world 's attention and may have sped up international action .

that warning by a leading economist came as german scientists weighed in with their own grim predictions about rising sea levels . it would be a big mistake for leaders to ignore climate change during the financial crisis , said nicholas stern , a former british treasury economist , who released a seminal report in 2006 that said inaction on emissions blamed for global warming could cause economic pain equal to the great depression .
" that 's a very important lesson , tackle risk early , " stern told a climate and carbon conference in hong kong .
there have been worries that countries will be unwilling to commit to climate change goals at an international meeting scheduled in copenhagen at the end of next year .
stern said he was optimistic that countries would agree to reduce carbon emissions by 50 percent by 2050 .
green revolution offered as solution bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : stern warns that climate change will bring economic hardship stern said that the financial crisis represents an opportunity to use public spending to boost green technologies and mass public transportation .
" the lesson that we can draw out from this recession , is that you can boost demand in the best way possible by focusing on low carbon growth in future , " stern said .
greenpeace has taken up a similar call .
governments should use the global financial crisis as an opportunity to kickstart green technologies , greenpeace and the european renewable energy council -lrb- erec -rrb- said in a " practical blueprint " presented in berlin on monday .
governments should aggressively invest in renewable power generation and energy , which could create a $ 360 billion -lrb- 285 billion euro -rrb- industry that could provide half of the world 's electricity , according to the study .
" especially in the context of today 's economic instability , investing in renewable energy technologies is a ' win-win-win ' scenario : a win for energy security , a win for the economy and a win for the climate , " the group said .

" we now have to expect that the sea level will rise by a meter this century , " said hans joachim schellnhuber , who heads the potsdam institute for research on global warming effects .
he and jochem marotzke , a leading meteorologist , have been looking at ocean levels .

hungary will also get " substantial " help , the specifics of which will be announced in the next few days , imf director dominique strauss-kahn confirmed monday , oct.27. the imf has offered up to $ 200 billion in loans to countries facing financial difficulties caused by the current global economic crisis . on friday , the imf made a $ 2.1 billion loan to iceland . the current climate of market instability has thrust the imf into the spotlight .
some world leaders , including german chancellor angela merkel , have called for the global body to become more involved in policing global financial markets .
merkel called for " better international coordination " and " a strengthening of the role played by the imf in ensuring stability of the global financial system . " rich nations promise cooperation bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the imf said money is on the way to ukraine and hungary the g7 rich nations also promised to work together to stabilize global markets in a statement released monday .
the group of seven nations - made up of britain , canada , france , germany , italy , japan and the united states - sought to calm the global financial panic by affirming their " shared interest in a strong and stable international financial system . " " we continue to monitor markets closely and cooperate as appropriate , " the statement from g7 finance ministers and central bank chiefs said . it was unclear whether that promise would be enough to bring stability to the markets .
japan 's nikkei stock index and most other markets in asia posted major losses on monday .
germany 's dax was also down 3.54 percent at the start of trading monday and the british stock market slumped by more than 5 percent early on . ukraine facing political , financial turmoil ukraine began to run into problems when the global demand for steel , its main export , began to drop in recent weeks . earlier this month , the former soviet country stopped early withdrawals from savings accounts to stop a run on banks .
several of the county 's banks also needed help after ukraine 's stock market lost more than 70 percent of its value . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ukraine 's leaders are more at odds than it might appear the country has also begun using up foreign currency reserves to prop up its currency , the hryvnia , according to analysts .
that has led to worries that the government will be unable to pay back some foreign loans that have been a driving force behind ukraine 's recent economic growth . " the imf is moving expeditiously to help ukraine , and this program is focused on the essential upfront measures needed to maintain confidence and economic and financial stability , " the imf chief said in his statement . yet the country is still in the midst of a political crisis .
president viktor yushchenko and prime minister yulia tymoshenko have been locked in a nasty fight over the president 's decision to call for new elections . the finance ministry in kyiv welcomed the imf 's support , saying it " opened a door to ukraine 's speedy cooperation with other international financial organizations . " hungary expected to set spending limits the imf , european governments and other partners are set to offer help to hungary .
while the imf did not release the size of the rescue package , analysts said it should be over $ 10 billion . hungary is vulnerable due to a large budget deficit , overvalued currency , low stock of foreign reserve and high levels of short-term foreign currency debt , afp news agency said .
the country 's national currency , the forint , has fallen sharply . last week , hungary 's central bank decided to raise its key interest rate by three points to 11.5 percent , the highest in the european union . dw staff -lrb- th -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

five occupants were wounded , the defense ministry said . a spokesman said the incident occurred on a main road near the northern city of kunduz .
the troops , serving with the nato-led international security assistance force -lrb- isaf -rrb- , first fired warning shots at the minibus , the spokesman said .
when the driver continued to approach the checkpoint at high speed , the soldiers opened fire with sub-machine guns , hitting the vehicle 's engine , the spokesman said .
five men were wounded , among them two who suffered injuries serious enough to require treatment at the german base in mazar-i-sharif .
a search of the vehicle failed to turn up any arms .
the people in the minibus were civilians taking the body of a relative from kabul to the northeast province of badahkshan for burial , a local police official said .
they were in a hurry and driving at high speed when the soldiers opened fire , said abdul rahman aktash , deputy police chief of kunduz province .
latest incident comes as security deteriorates the incident happened a week after two german soldiers and five children were killed in a suicide attack near kunduz .
in august , a german soldier accidentally shot dead an afghan woman and two children at a checkpoint .
the security situation around kunduz , where most of germany 's 3,500-strong isaf contingent is based , has deteriorated in recent months .
this year more than 250 soldiers have lost their lives in afghanistan , more than in any year since the international military operation was launched in 2001 .

27 welcomed a ceasefire deal in somalia as nato successfully completed its first anti-piracy mission off the somali coast .
but experts questioned the current international efforts to combat piracy . eu foreign policy chief javier solana and nato secretary general jaap de hoop scheffer stressed the importance of cooperation between the two brussels-based institutions during a regular meeting of ambassadors at the alliance 's headquarters .
one area in which the two organizations are working together is in the fight against pirates operating in the gulf of aden .
while the eu 's own operations are to begin shortly , de hoop scheffer announced that nato had just completed its first anti-piracy mission by escorting a cargo ship delivering supplies to the african union mission to somalia .
an italian destroyer as well as british and greek frigates arrived in the gulf of aden last week as the front guard of nato 's anti-piracy operation allied provider .
the nato chief said nato warships would next be escorting world food program -lrb- wfp -rrb- cargos delivering food aid to the region .
" the operation is moving well , and the contacts we are having with the eu are also good , " de hoop scheffer said .
the eu has also pledged another three or four vessels by december in a bid to stem a phenomenon that is threatening world trade .
solana , for his part , welcomed a ceasefire agreement clinched over the weekend by the somali government and parts of the islamist opposition .
" this agreement is an important step forward , " solana said in a statement issued by his office in brussels .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : de hoop scheffer and solana join forces against piracy " only an inclusive political process will bring durable peace to somalia , and i call on all somalis to rally behind the transitional federal government of somalia and the alliance for the re-liberation of somalia and their endeavor to achieve this , " the statement said .
political instability has played a major role in preventing somalia from stopping gangs of pirates from seizing commercial vessels sailing off the country 's coast , prompting foreign organizations and nations to intervene .
experts doubt plausability of international efforts but despite western navies being spurred into action by the recent spate of high-profile hijackings by somali pirates , some experts argue that a handful of warships can do little to stamp out the lucrative piracy business .
but experts say a beefed up naval presence can achieve little more than escort services for food aid deliveries .
" when it comes to suppressing piracy , an extra 10 or 11 ships is still not a huge amount of naval presence for a very large area , " said roger middleton , consultant researcher for london-based think-tank chatham house in an interview with the afp news agency .
bildunterschrift : the german navy frigate emden will soon be deployed in the fight against piracy the new deployments added to the foreign ships already operating off the coast of somalia will eventually bring to between 20 and 25 the total number of warships patrolling the area 's dangerous waters by the end of the year .
according to the international maritime bureau , somali pirates have attacked more than 60 ships since the start of 2008 , hijacked almost half of them and received millions of dollars in ransom money .
the hijacking on september 25 of a ukrainian cargo loaded with battle tanks and other weaponry captured the world 's attention and may have sped up international action .
spreading piracy may overwhelm task force but pirates have expanded their activities to the eastern coast and the indian ocean and foreign warships will already have their hands full trying to secure a maritime corridor in the gulf of aden .
" if there is sufficient coordination between all these foreign actors , it can act as a deterrent but it 's definitely not the death knell of somali piracy , " middleton told afp .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : nato ships are spread thinly around the african coast western navies with modern equipment are already stretched by conflicts elsewhere in the world and experts argue the number of foreign warships tasked with patrolling somalia 's waters is unlikely to increase significantly in 2009 .
many observers argue sending ships is a band-aid approach which fails to look at the root causes of the phenomenon .
most pirate groups operate from the coast of puntland , a lawless breakaway state in northern somalia .
observers say ineffective security forces there and poverty have allowed piracy to flourish .
in the 17th century , haiti 's french governor brought hundreds of prostitutes to the famous pirate lair of tortuga in a bid to tame the island 's troublesome buccaneers .
such a move is hardly an option in modern-day somalia and france has markedly changed tactics since , being the only country so far to have used its military firepower against the pirates .
circumstances negate use of force bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the french are the only ones to engage militarily so far but that approach is reserved for those countries with strong intervention capabilities , raises awkward questions with regard to international law and is often neutralized by the risk posed to hostages .
" sending warships can only have a limited effect ... one of the best ways of combating piracy would be to stop the decline of puntland , " said stig jarle hansen , a somalia expert with the denmark-based risk intelligence group .
hansen argues that not only is there no evidence of ties between pirates and somalia 's islamist shebab organization , which has been fighting the country 's government , but the islamists were more effective than most in combating piracy .
a 2006 ethiopian invasion to oust the islamic courts union that had taken control of much of the country and support a fragile transitional government had a major impact on the surge in piracy .
" before the invasion , the shebab were probably the best pirate fighters the country has known , " said hansen , also a senior researcher with the norwegian institute for urban and regional research .
however there are signs that major foreign players could seek to address some of the root causes and are mulling a " naval peacekeeping force " that also tackles illegal fishing and waste dumping in somali waters , two issues that are often used as justifications by pirates . dpa news agency / dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

merkel is also to pay a visit to queen elizabeth ii at buckingham palace .
germany and britain have unveiled the biggest rescues of banks outside the united states , but the moves have failed to counter a slide in world stock markets which is being seen as a harbinger of a global recession .
merkel 's coalition is debating pump-priming to counter the effects of a business contraction .
her party supporters from the cdu -lrb- christian democrats -rrb- have suggested cuts in taxes on motor vehicles and a possible income tax rebate .
action expected soon in berlin , finance minister peer steinbrueck said he expected action this week or next .
steinbrueck said he and his own social democratic party -lrb- spd -rrb- opposed tax cuts because taxpayers might simply move their gains into savings instead of spending them , or might import more rather than buying home goods .
stressing the urgency of action , steinbrueck said after meeting with his party in berlin that tax cuts might also not gain traction till next year when many people receive their tax findings .
the finance minister said his party favored job creation by encouraging municipalities to speed construction of day cares and schools and by lending money to the mittelstand , germany 's web of medium-sized companies .
further options available other options include soft loans and subsidies for new home-heating and home-insulation work .
those projects are popular in germany as they also reduce oil and gas use and help cut carbon dioxide emissions .
steinbrueck , who has won praise in recent weeks as germany 's chief firefighter in the crisis , said he was also studying backing private investment in public infrastructure and european-level aid to car manufacturers .
he stressed that no decisions have been made by the government yet as of how to proceed . dpa news agency -lrb- cat -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

hungary will also get " substantial " help , the specifics of which will be announced in the next few days , imf director dominique strauss-kahn confirmed monday , oct.27. the imf has offered up to $ 200 billion in loans to countries facing financial difficulties caused by the current global economic crisis . on friday , the imf made a $ 2.1 billion loan to iceland . the current climate of market instability has thrust the imf into the spotlight .
some world leaders , including german chancellor angela merkel , have called for the global body to become more involved in policing global financial markets .

" " we continue to monitor markets closely and cooperate as appropriate , " the statement from g7 finance ministers and central bank chiefs said . it was unclear whether that promise would be enough to bring stability to the markets .

germany 's dax was also down 3.54 percent at the start of trading monday and the british stock market slumped by more than 5 percent early on . ukraine facing political , financial turmoil ukraine began to run into problems when the global demand for steel , its main export , began to drop in recent weeks . earlier this month , the former soviet country stopped early withdrawals from savings accounts to stop a run on banks .

that has led to worries that the government will be unable to pay back some foreign loans that have been a driving force behind ukraine 's recent economic growth . " the imf is moving expeditiously to help ukraine , and this program is focused on the essential upfront measures needed to maintain confidence and economic and financial stability , " the imf chief said in his statement . yet the country is still in the midst of a political crisis .
president viktor yushchenko and prime minister yulia tymoshenko have been locked in a nasty fight over the president 's decision to call for new elections . the finance ministry in kyiv welcomed the imf 's support , saying it " opened a door to ukraine 's speedy cooperation with other international financial organizations . " hungary expected to set spending limits the imf , european governments and other partners are set to offer help to hungary .
while the imf did not release the size of the rescue package , analysts said it should be over $ 10 billion . hungary is vulnerable due to a large budget deficit , overvalued currency , low stock of foreign reserve and high levels of short-term foreign currency debt , afp news agency said .

27 , seehofer and sabine leutheusser-schnarrenberger , the head of the free democratic party -lrb- fdp -rrb- are to ink the historic coalition agreement that ends over four decades of sole conservative rule in germany 's largest state .
the csu , the sister party to chancellor angela merkel 's christian democratic union , lost its absolute majority in state elections four weeks ago , forcing it to seek a governing partner .
the fdp won seats in the bavarian state assembly in the sept .
28 poll for the first time in 14 years and is to take over the economy and science ministries .
an fdp convention in the city of ingolstadt approved the arrangement sunday .
" it 's always hard to give something up , " said csu majority leader georg schmid , " but that 's how it is in a coalition and i think we 've reached a good consensus with each other , for example in distributing the ministries . "
the two parties plan to partly relax a strict ban on smoking in bars which was blamed by some for the csu 's loss of one third of its traditional support at the state election .
bavaria names new premier after the loss in support to just 43 per cent of ballots , the bavaria-only csu deposed both its former leader , erwin huber , and its state premier , guenther beckstein .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : rescuing bavaria 's state bank will be first on seehofer 's agenda seehofer was named csu chief at a party meeting on saturday and , on monday , is to be appointed to the position of state premier .
he relinquished his currents posts in berlin as federal minister of agriculture and minister for consumer affairs . despite receiving a 90.3 percent majority in the delegation 's vote for chairman on saturday , seehofer is not entirely without controversy within his own party .
reports of an extra-marital affair last year damaged his reputation among some of the more conservative party members who see the csu as a bastion of traditional values .
hurdles ahead for seehofer the csu has not only lost both broad support from the majority of voters and faith in its leadership , but the state 's economic situation is also in grave danger after nine-figure losses at partially state-run landesbank bayern lb as a result of the international finance crisis .
" i think the rest of the country looks at bavaria with a certain schadenfreude , " political scientist juergen falter told deutsche welle .
in addition to fighting for tax cuts and inheritance tax reform , seehofer has already promised to make the crisis at the state bank first priority .
the key to seehofer 's success , said falter , is to secure his position in bavaria so that he is unchallenged in berlin .
" he 'll raise his voice in national politics , " said falter .
" he 's good at that ; that 's his territory .
i think he 'll definitely perform well at the federal level . "
seehofer said in monday 's sueddeutsche zeitung , " my work place will be in munich , but my combat strength will also stretch to berlin . "
and if he 's to secure federal funds for bavaria 's troubled state bank , he 'll have to play his cards well in berlin . dw staff -lrb- kjb -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

27 . however , discussions on a smoking ban in all of the member states ' workplaces are still at the preliminary stage , meaning any new rules are unlikely to be implemented before 2010 .
" clearly one of the areas which we would like to see covered -lrb- by the ban -rrb- is bars , restaurants and pubs , which are enclosed spaces where workers on a daily basis are exposed to passive smoking and to the consequences that passive smoking has on their own health and safety , " said chantal hughes , spokeswoman of eu employment commissioner vladimir spidla .
smoking bans currently differ widely across the eu .
while ireland was the first eu country to make its pubs and restaurants smoke-free , puffing cigarettes is still allowed in some pubs in germany and belgium .
and smoking is still common in both bars and restaurants in central and eastern european countries like hungary and romania .
" a number of member states have already introduced smoking bans .
however , they are very different in terms of scope and nature , " hughes said .
" we have a duty to ensure that all workplaces are safe and secure for workers .
at this stage we do not think that this is the case , which is why the commissioner would like to see a ban in all workplaces , " the spokeswoman said .
the commission plans to consult with employers and trade unions first , and does not expect the new rules to be submitted for approval to national governments before late 2009 , when the next eu executive assumes office .
however , it is " important to start the debate and get the ball rolling , " hughes said . dpa news agency -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de politics -pipe- 27.10.2008 bavaria set to seal landmark coalition under new premier großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : seehofer takes the helm as the waters get rough the conservative christian social union -lrb- csu -rrb- , which has ruled bavaria alone for 42 years , is to sign a coalition deal with a liberal pro-business minority and name new csu chief horst seehofer as state premier . on monday , oct .
27 , seehofer and sabine leutheusser-schnarrenberger , the head of the free democratic party -lrb- fdp -rrb- are to ink the historic coalition agreement that ends over four decades of sole conservative rule in germany 's largest state .
the csu , the sister party to chancellor angela merkel 's christian democratic union , lost its absolute majority in state elections four weeks ago , forcing it to seek a governing partner .
the fdp won seats in the bavarian state assembly in the sept .
28 poll for the first time in 14 years and is to take over the economy and science ministries .
an fdp convention in the city of ingolstadt approved the arrangement sunday .
" it 's always hard to give something up , " said csu majority leader georg schmid , " but that 's how it is in a coalition and i think we 've reached a good consensus with each other , for example in distributing the ministries . "
the two parties plan to partly relax a strict ban on smoking in bars which was blamed by some for the csu 's loss of one third of its traditional support at the state election .
bavaria names new premier after the loss in support to just 43 per cent of ballots , the bavaria-only csu deposed both its former leader , erwin huber , and its state premier , guenther beckstein .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : rescuing bavaria 's state bank will be first on seehofer 's agenda seehofer was named csu chief at a party meeting on saturday and , on monday , is to be appointed to the position of state premier .
he relinquished his currents posts in berlin as federal minister of agriculture and minister for consumer affairs . despite receiving a 90.3 percent majority in the delegation 's vote for chairman on saturday , seehofer is not entirely without controversy within his own party .
reports of an extra-marital affair last year damaged his reputation among some of the more conservative party members who see the csu as a bastion of traditional values .
hurdles ahead for seehofer the csu has not only lost both broad support from the majority of voters and faith in its leadership , but the state 's economic situation is also in grave danger after nine-figure losses at partially state-run landesbank bayern lb as a result of the international finance crisis .
" i think the rest of the country looks at bavaria with a certain schadenfreude , " political scientist juergen falter told deutsche welle .
in addition to fighting for tax cuts and inheritance tax reform , seehofer has already promised to make the crisis at the state bank first priority .
the key to seehofer 's success , said falter , is to secure his position in bavaria so that he is unchallenged in berlin .
" he 'll raise his voice in national politics , " said falter .
" he 's good at that ; that 's his territory .
i think he 'll definitely perform well at the federal level . "
seehofer said in monday 's sueddeutsche zeitung , " my work place will be in munich , but my combat strength will also stretch to berlin . "
and if he 's to secure federal funds for bavaria 's troubled state bank , he 'll have to play his cards well in berlin . dw staff -lrb- kjb -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

27 . however , discussions on a smoking ban in all of the member states ' workplaces are still at the preliminary stage , meaning any new rules are unlikely to be implemented before 2010 .
" clearly one of the areas which we would like to see covered -lrb- by the ban -rrb- is bars , restaurants and pubs , which are enclosed spaces where workers on a daily basis are exposed to passive smoking and to the consequences that passive smoking has on their own health and safety , " said chantal hughes , spokeswoman of eu employment commissioner vladimir spidla .
smoking bans currently differ widely across the eu .
while ireland was the first eu country to make its pubs and restaurants smoke-free , puffing cigarettes is still allowed in some pubs in germany and belgium .
and smoking is still common in both bars and restaurants in central and eastern european countries like hungary and romania .
" a number of member states have already introduced smoking bans .
however , they are very different in terms of scope and nature , " hughes said .
" we have a duty to ensure that all workplaces are safe and secure for workers .
at this stage we do not think that this is the case , which is why the commissioner would like to see a ban in all workplaces , " the spokeswoman said .
the commission plans to consult with employers and trade unions first , and does not expect the new rules to be submitted for approval to national governments before late 2009 , when the next eu executive assumes office .
however , it is " important to start the debate and get the ball rolling , " hughes said . dpa news agency -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de environment -pipe- 27.10.2008 expert warns against putting climate fight on the back burner großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german scientists warn that water levels will increase substantially problems caused by climate change are more serious than the current financial crisis .
that warning by a leading economist came as german scientists weighed in with their own grim predictions about rising sea levels . it would be a big mistake for leaders to ignore climate change during the financial crisis , said nicholas stern , a former british treasury economist , who released a seminal report in 2006 that said inaction on emissions blamed for global warming could cause economic pain equal to the great depression .
" that 's a very important lesson , tackle risk early , " stern told a climate and carbon conference in hong kong .
there have been worries that countries will be unwilling to commit to climate change goals at an international meeting scheduled in copenhagen at the end of next year .
stern said he was optimistic that countries would agree to reduce carbon emissions by 50 percent by 2050 .
green revolution offered as solution bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : stern warns that climate change will bring economic hardship stern said that the financial crisis represents an opportunity to use public spending to boost green technologies and mass public transportation .
" the lesson that we can draw out from this recession , is that you can boost demand in the best way possible by focusing on low carbon growth in future , " stern said .
greenpeace has taken up a similar call .
governments should use the global financial crisis as an opportunity to kickstart green technologies , greenpeace and the european renewable energy council -lrb- erec -rrb- said in a " practical blueprint " presented in berlin on monday .
governments should aggressively invest in renewable power generation and energy , which could create a $ 360 billion -lrb- 285 billion euro -rrb- industry that could provide half of the world 's electricity , according to the study .
" especially in the context of today 's economic instability , investing in renewable energy technologies is a ' win-win-win ' scenario : a win for energy security , a win for the economy and a win for the climate , " the group said .
scientists warn of big rise in ocean levels bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : governments have been called on to invest in renewable energy german scientists announced monday that ocean levels will rise much more than previously thought because climate change is happening much faster than predicted .
they expect a one meter increase this century .
earlier estimates had predicted a rise of 18 to 59 centimeters .
" we now have to expect that the sea level will rise by a meter this century , " said hans joachim schellnhuber , who heads the potsdam institute for research on global warming effects .
he and jochem marotzke , a leading meteorologist , have been looking at ocean levels .
schellnhuber said it is " just barely possible " that world governments will be able to limit the rise in average global temperatures to just 2 degrees celsius by the end of the century , if they all strictly adhere to severe limits in carbon dioxide emissions . dw staff -lrb- th -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

but moscow favors the young democrat over the cold war veteran . john mccain 's us presidential campaign begged at the enemy 's door this week when a wayward fundraising letter reached the desk of russia 's un envoy vitaly churkin in new york asking for a donation . the russians would n't spare a ruble for the republican , and sent mccain a sardonic message saying that , unlike the united states , the russian government does " not finance political activity in foreign countries . "
us laws would have prevented them from donating had they wanted to send mccain a check . russian officials , in fact , are n't banking on either mccain or democratic candidate barack obama mending relations upturned by russia 's recent war with us-ally georgia . hoping for a fresh start but the preference among russians is reported to be in favor of obama because he represents a clean slate and will be more open to new proposals , according to konstantin kosachyov , head of the russian duma 's foreign affairs committee and a senior figure in the dominant pro-kremlin party . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : mccain 's kgb comment did n't go over well in moscow both us candidates took a harsh stance on russia in a recent debate when asked if the late us president ronald reagan 's designation of the former soviet union as the " evil empire " still applied to modern russia . mccain said " maybe " while obama , who has moved closer to his opponent 's hard-line stance since the war in georgia , said russia exhibited " evil behavior " in that conflict . nonetheless , kosachyov said this week that mccain 's anti-russian bias was deep-set while obama was a more " comfortable " choice . " mccain got his political formation during the cold war , " kosachyov told news agency interfax .
" he dedicated most of his life to the fight against communism .
it 's clear that to this day he still thrashes along that front without seeing any real difference between the soviet union and modern russia . " the kremlin has had good , even personal , ties with republican presidents .

" bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : obama is compared to jfk , but us-russia relations were tense during his tenure mccain quipped that he saw something else - " three letters - a k , a g and a b , " referring to the former president and now prime minister who was a high-ranking kgb intelligence officer until the fall of the soviet union in 1991 . democratic presidents are more difficult partners for moscow because they tend toward a more complicated foreign policy view in contrast to the tough-styled russian realism , russian observers said . the closest the two countries ever came to nuclear war , they point out , was the 1962 cuban missile crisis under the late us president john f. kennedy , to whom obama is often compared . democratic president jimmy carter led a boycott of the moscow 1980 summer olympics , while russia blames bill clinton for pushing kosovo toward independence from serbia . personal over party " russian authorities would find it more difficult to deal with obama , " andrei kortunov , head of the moscow-based new eurasia foundation , told ria-novosti news agency .
" he will make world affairs more complicated . " but kosachyov said his choice was based on the candidates ' personal profiles over their political parties . " obama does n't differ particularly in his beliefs about russia from the republican candidate , but he is a young politician , without prejudices and so , more ready to take on a new proposals and approaches , " he said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : us plans to build a missile shield in eastern europe have disconcerted russia kosachyov cited as an example obama 's more compromising stance on us plans to site a missile defense shield in eastern europe , which russia views as a security threat . the us candidates ' russia advisors reveal marked difference in how each may navigate the widening gulf between both countries . obama 's top russia strategist , stanford professor michael mcfaul , called obama " an engagement guy , not an isolation guy . " mccain 's top russia expert is stephen biegun , who served bush on the us national security council from 2001 to 2003 and raises fears among russian diplomats that a republican president would perpetuate the current adversarial approach . tension without economic interdependence us plans to site a missile defense system in eastern europe and its support for western military alliance nato 's enlargement into the post-soviet space are , moscow says , a direct threat to its security . in fact , russia is battling the united states for influence in post-soviet countries it views as its rightful sphere of influence and where the us is attracted by energy and strategic interests . analysts in moscow say part of the problem is that security troubles between the two cold-war foes are not tempered by the business and energy interests that govern russia 's relations with the european union - its largest client for natural gas . dpa news agency -lrb- kjb -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

27 welcomed a ceasefire deal in somalia as nato successfully completed its first anti-piracy mission off the somali coast .
but experts questioned the current international efforts to combat piracy . eu foreign policy chief javier solana and nato secretary general jaap de hoop scheffer stressed the importance of cooperation between the two brussels-based institutions during a regular meeting of ambassadors at the alliance 's headquarters .
one area in which the two organizations are working together is in the fight against pirates operating in the gulf of aden .
while the eu 's own operations are to begin shortly , de hoop scheffer announced that nato had just completed its first anti-piracy mission by escorting a cargo ship delivering supplies to the african union mission to somalia .
an italian destroyer as well as british and greek frigates arrived in the gulf of aden last week as the front guard of nato 's anti-piracy operation allied provider .
the nato chief said nato warships would next be escorting world food program -lrb- wfp -rrb- cargos delivering food aid to the region .
" the operation is moving well , and the contacts we are having with the eu are also good , " de hoop scheffer said .
the eu has also pledged another three or four vessels by december in a bid to stem a phenomenon that is threatening world trade .
solana , for his part , welcomed a ceasefire agreement clinched over the weekend by the somali government and parts of the islamist opposition .
" this agreement is an important step forward , " solana said in a statement issued by his office in brussels .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : de hoop scheffer and solana join forces against piracy " only an inclusive political process will bring durable peace to somalia , and i call on all somalis to rally behind the transitional federal government of somalia and the alliance for the re-liberation of somalia and their endeavor to achieve this , " the statement said .
political instability has played a major role in preventing somalia from stopping gangs of pirates from seizing commercial vessels sailing off the country 's coast , prompting foreign organizations and nations to intervene .
experts doubt plausability of international efforts but despite western navies being spurred into action by the recent spate of high-profile hijackings by somali pirates , some experts argue that a handful of warships can do little to stamp out the lucrative piracy business .
but experts say a beefed up naval presence can achieve little more than escort services for food aid deliveries .
" when it comes to suppressing piracy , an extra 10 or 11 ships is still not a huge amount of naval presence for a very large area , " said roger middleton , consultant researcher for london-based think-tank chatham house in an interview with the afp news agency .
bildunterschrift : the german navy frigate emden will soon be deployed in the fight against piracy the new deployments added to the foreign ships already operating off the coast of somalia will eventually bring to between 20 and 25 the total number of warships patrolling the area 's dangerous waters by the end of the year .
according to the international maritime bureau , somali pirates have attacked more than 60 ships since the start of 2008 , hijacked almost half of them and received millions of dollars in ransom money .
the hijacking on september 25 of a ukrainian cargo loaded with battle tanks and other weaponry captured the world 's attention and may have sped up international action .
spreading piracy may overwhelm task force but pirates have expanded their activities to the eastern coast and the indian ocean and foreign warships will already have their hands full trying to secure a maritime corridor in the gulf of aden .
" if there is sufficient coordination between all these foreign actors , it can act as a deterrent but it 's definitely not the death knell of somali piracy , " middleton told afp .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : nato ships are spread thinly around the african coast western navies with modern equipment are already stretched by conflicts elsewhere in the world and experts argue the number of foreign warships tasked with patrolling somalia 's waters is unlikely to increase significantly in 2009 .
many observers argue sending ships is a band-aid approach which fails to look at the root causes of the phenomenon .
most pirate groups operate from the coast of puntland , a lawless breakaway state in northern somalia .
observers say ineffective security forces there and poverty have allowed piracy to flourish .
in the 17th century , haiti 's french governor brought hundreds of prostitutes to the famous pirate lair of tortuga in a bid to tame the island 's troublesome buccaneers .
such a move is hardly an option in modern-day somalia and france has markedly changed tactics since , being the only country so far to have used its military firepower against the pirates .
circumstances negate use of force bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the french are the only ones to engage militarily so far but that approach is reserved for those countries with strong intervention capabilities , raises awkward questions with regard to international law and is often neutralized by the risk posed to hostages .
" sending warships can only have a limited effect ... one of the best ways of combating piracy would be to stop the decline of puntland , " said stig jarle hansen , a somalia expert with the denmark-based risk intelligence group .
hansen argues that not only is there no evidence of ties between pirates and somalia 's islamist shebab organization , which has been fighting the country 's government , but the islamists were more effective than most in combating piracy .
a 2006 ethiopian invasion to oust the islamic courts union that had taken control of much of the country and support a fragile transitional government had a major impact on the surge in piracy .
" before the invasion , the shebab were probably the best pirate fighters the country has known , " said hansen , also a senior researcher with the norwegian institute for urban and regional research .
however there are signs that major foreign players could seek to address some of the root causes and are mulling a " naval peacekeeping force " that also tackles illegal fishing and waste dumping in somali waters , two issues that are often used as justifications by pirates . dpa news agency / dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

germany 's lufthansa and russian carrier s7 airlines are both contenders . lufthansa has demanded that the government government take over 500 million euros -lrb- $ 631 million -rrb- of the flag carrier 's debts of around 900 million euros .
the state " might be ready to contribute financially in order to make the sale go through , " transport minister werner faymann said .
according to media reports , lufthansa is offering only a symbolic price for the government 's 42.75 percent stake in austrian airlines , with an option of paying more once the ailing carrier has recovered , according to dpa news service .
russian carrier remains interested the german carrier was seen as the only remaining bidder for government stake , but the holding 's chief executive officer , peter michaelis , confirmed monday that s7 , russia 's leading domestic airline , was still among the suitors .
air france-klm dropped out of the bidding process last week , citing a lack of transparency of austrian airline 's part in disclosing existing cooperation contracts with lufthansa .
the government 's mandate to privatize its 42.75 percent stake in austrian airlines was scheduled to run out tuesday , october 28 .
but the process was likely to be prolonged until december 31 , the finance ministry has announced .
with its fleet of 264 aircraft , lufthansa made 3.02 billion euros in earnings before interest , taxes , debt and amortization -lrb- ebitda -rrb- in 2007 .
operating 71 airplanes , s7 's ebitda was 81.6 million euros last year .
faced with high fuel costs and a decreasing numbers of passengers flying on its 99 aircraft , austrian airlines expects to end the year with a deficit of 125 million euros . dw staff -lrb- th -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

27 , seehofer and sabine leutheusser-schnarrenberger , the head of the free democratic party -lrb- fdp -rrb- are to ink the historic coalition agreement that ends over four decades of sole conservative rule in germany 's largest state .
the csu , the sister party to chancellor angela merkel 's christian democratic union , lost its absolute majority in state elections four weeks ago , forcing it to seek a governing partner .
the fdp won seats in the bavarian state assembly in the sept .
28 poll for the first time in 14 years and is to take over the economy and science ministries .
an fdp convention in the city of ingolstadt approved the arrangement sunday .
" it 's always hard to give something up , " said csu majority leader georg schmid , " but that 's how it is in a coalition and i think we 've reached a good consensus with each other , for example in distributing the ministries . "
the two parties plan to partly relax a strict ban on smoking in bars which was blamed by some for the csu 's loss of one third of its traditional support at the state election .

hurdles ahead for seehofer the csu has not only lost both broad support from the majority of voters and faith in its leadership , but the state 's economic situation is also in grave danger after nine-figure losses at partially state-run landesbank bayern lb as a result of the international finance crisis .
" i think the rest of the country looks at bavaria with a certain schadenfreude , " political scientist juergen falter told deutsche welle .
in addition to fighting for tax cuts and inheritance tax reform , seehofer has already promised to make the crisis at the state bank first priority .
the key to seehofer 's success , said falter , is to secure his position in bavaria so that he is unchallenged in berlin .
" he 'll raise his voice in national politics , " said falter .
" he 's good at that ; that 's his territory .
i think he 'll definitely perform well at the federal level . "

27 , seehofer and sabine leutheusser-schnarrenberger , the head of the free democratic party -lrb- fdp -rrb- are to ink the historic coalition agreement that ends over four decades of sole conservative rule in germany 's largest state .
the csu , the sister party to chancellor angela merkel 's christian democratic union , lost its absolute majority in state elections four weeks ago , forcing it to seek a governing partner .
the fdp won seats in the bavarian state assembly in the sept .
28 poll for the first time in 14 years and is to take over the economy and science ministries .
an fdp convention in the city of ingolstadt approved the arrangement sunday .
" it 's always hard to give something up , " said csu majority leader georg schmid , " but that 's how it is in a coalition and i think we 've reached a good consensus with each other , for example in distributing the ministries . "
the two parties plan to partly relax a strict ban on smoking in bars which was blamed by some for the csu 's loss of one third of its traditional support at the state election .
bavaria names new premier after the loss in support to just 43 per cent of ballots , the bavaria-only csu deposed both its former leader , erwin huber , and its state premier , guenther beckstein .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : rescuing bavaria 's state bank will be first on seehofer 's agenda seehofer was named csu chief at a party meeting on saturday and , on monday , is to be appointed to the position of state premier .
he relinquished his currents posts in berlin as federal minister of agriculture and minister for consumer affairs . despite receiving a 90.3 percent majority in the delegation 's vote for chairman on saturday , seehofer is not entirely without controversy within his own party .
reports of an extra-marital affair last year damaged his reputation among some of the more conservative party members who see the csu as a bastion of traditional values .
hurdles ahead for seehofer the csu has not only lost both broad support from the majority of voters and faith in its leadership , but the state 's economic situation is also in grave danger after nine-figure losses at partially state-run landesbank bayern lb as a result of the international finance crisis .
" i think the rest of the country looks at bavaria with a certain schadenfreude , " political scientist juergen falter told deutsche welle .
in addition to fighting for tax cuts and inheritance tax reform , seehofer has already promised to make the crisis at the state bank first priority .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de nato -pipe- 27.10.2008 nato begins anti-piracy mission as experts question plausability großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : nato 's anti-piracy mission off somalia is seen as inadequate by some experts the eu on monday , oct .
27 welcomed a ceasefire deal in somalia as nato successfully completed its first anti-piracy mission off the somali coast .
but experts questioned the current international efforts to combat piracy . eu foreign policy chief javier solana and nato secretary general jaap de hoop scheffer stressed the importance of cooperation between the two brussels-based institutions during a regular meeting of ambassadors at the alliance 's headquarters .
one area in which the two organizations are working together is in the fight against pirates operating in the gulf of aden .
while the eu 's own operations are to begin shortly , de hoop scheffer announced that nato had just completed its first anti-piracy mission by escorting a cargo ship delivering supplies to the african union mission to somalia .
an italian destroyer as well as british and greek frigates arrived in the gulf of aden last week as the front guard of nato 's anti-piracy operation allied provider .
the nato chief said nato warships would next be escorting world food program -lrb- wfp -rrb- cargos delivering food aid to the region .
" the operation is moving well , and the contacts we are having with the eu are also good , " de hoop scheffer said .
the eu has also pledged another three or four vessels by december in a bid to stem a phenomenon that is threatening world trade .
solana , for his part , welcomed a ceasefire agreement clinched over the weekend by the somali government and parts of the islamist opposition .
" this agreement is an important step forward , " solana said in a statement issued by his office in brussels .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : de hoop scheffer and solana join forces against piracy " only an inclusive political process will bring durable peace to somalia , and i call on all somalis to rally behind the transitional federal government of somalia and the alliance for the re-liberation of somalia and their endeavor to achieve this , " the statement said .
political instability has played a major role in preventing somalia from stopping gangs of pirates from seizing commercial vessels sailing off the country 's coast , prompting foreign organizations and nations to intervene .
experts doubt plausability of international efforts but despite western navies being spurred into action by the recent spate of high-profile hijackings by somali pirates , some experts argue that a handful of warships can do little to stamp out the lucrative piracy business .
but experts say a beefed up naval presence can achieve little more than escort services for food aid deliveries .
" when it comes to suppressing piracy , an extra 10 or 11 ships is still not a huge amount of naval presence for a very large area , " said roger middleton , consultant researcher for london-based think-tank chatham house in an interview with the afp news agency .
bildunterschrift : the german navy frigate emden will soon be deployed in the fight against piracy the new deployments added to the foreign ships already operating off the coast of somalia will eventually bring to between 20 and 25 the total number of warships patrolling the area 's dangerous waters by the end of the year .
according to the international maritime bureau , somali pirates have attacked more than 60 ships since the start of 2008 , hijacked almost half of them and received millions of dollars in ransom money .
the hijacking on september 25 of a ukrainian cargo loaded with battle tanks and other weaponry captured the world 's attention and may have sped up international action .
spreading piracy may overwhelm task force but pirates have expanded their activities to the eastern coast and the indian ocean and foreign warships will already have their hands full trying to secure a maritime corridor in the gulf of aden .
" if there is sufficient coordination between all these foreign actors , it can act as a deterrent but it 's definitely not the death knell of somali piracy , " middleton told afp .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : nato ships are spread thinly around the african coast western navies with modern equipment are already stretched by conflicts elsewhere in the world and experts argue the number of foreign warships tasked with patrolling somalia 's waters is unlikely to increase significantly in 2009 .
many observers argue sending ships is a band-aid approach which fails to look at the root causes of the phenomenon .
most pirate groups operate from the coast of puntland , a lawless breakaway state in northern somalia .
observers say ineffective security forces there and poverty have allowed piracy to flourish .
in the 17th century , haiti 's french governor brought hundreds of prostitutes to the famous pirate lair of tortuga in a bid to tame the island 's troublesome buccaneers .
such a move is hardly an option in modern-day somalia and france has markedly changed tactics since , being the only country so far to have used its military firepower against the pirates .
circumstances negate use of force bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the french are the only ones to engage militarily so far but that approach is reserved for those countries with strong intervention capabilities , raises awkward questions with regard to international law and is often neutralized by the risk posed to hostages .
" sending warships can only have a limited effect ... one of the best ways of combating piracy would be to stop the decline of puntland , " said stig jarle hansen , a somalia expert with the denmark-based risk intelligence group .
hansen argues that not only is there no evidence of ties between pirates and somalia 's islamist shebab organization , which has been fighting the country 's government , but the islamists were more effective than most in combating piracy .
a 2006 ethiopian invasion to oust the islamic courts union that had taken control of much of the country and support a fragile transitional government had a major impact on the surge in piracy .
" before the invasion , the shebab were probably the best pirate fighters the country has known , " said hansen , also a senior researcher with the norwegian institute for urban and regional research .
however there are signs that major foreign players could seek to address some of the root causes and are mulling a " naval peacekeeping force " that also tackles illegal fishing and waste dumping in somali waters , two issues that are often used as justifications by pirates . dpa news agency / dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the eu has also pledged another three or four vessels by december in a bid to stem a phenomenon that is threatening world trade .
solana , for his part , welcomed a ceasefire agreement clinched over the weekend by the somali government and parts of the islamist opposition .
" this agreement is an important step forward , " solana said in a statement issued by his office in brussels .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : de hoop scheffer and solana join forces against piracy " only an inclusive political process will bring durable peace to somalia , and i call on all somalis to rally behind the transitional federal government of somalia and the alliance for the re-liberation of somalia and their endeavor to achieve this , " the statement said .
political instability has played a major role in preventing somalia from stopping gangs of pirates from seizing commercial vessels sailing off the country 's coast , prompting foreign organizations and nations to intervene .
experts doubt plausability of international efforts but despite western navies being spurred into action by the recent spate of high-profile hijackings by somali pirates , some experts argue that a handful of warships can do little to stamp out the lucrative piracy business .
but experts say a beefed up naval presence can achieve little more than escort services for food aid deliveries .
" when it comes to suppressing piracy , an extra 10 or 11 ships is still not a huge amount of naval presence for a very large area , " said roger middleton , consultant researcher for london-based think-tank chatham house in an interview with the afp news agency .
bildunterschrift : the german navy frigate emden will soon be deployed in the fight against piracy the new deployments added to the foreign ships already operating off the coast of somalia will eventually bring to between 20 and 25 the total number of warships patrolling the area 's dangerous waters by the end of the year .
according to the international maritime bureau , somali pirates have attacked more than 60 ships since the start of 2008 , hijacked almost half of them and received millions of dollars in ransom money .
the hijacking on september 25 of a ukrainian cargo loaded with battle tanks and other weaponry captured the world 's attention and may have sped up international action .
spreading piracy may overwhelm task force but pirates have expanded their activities to the eastern coast and the indian ocean and foreign warships will already have their hands full trying to secure a maritime corridor in the gulf of aden .
" if there is sufficient coordination between all these foreign actors , it can act as a deterrent but it 's definitely not the death knell of somali piracy , " middleton told afp .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : nato ships are spread thinly around the african coast western navies with modern equipment are already stretched by conflicts elsewhere in the world and experts argue the number of foreign warships tasked with patrolling somalia 's waters is unlikely to increase significantly in 2009 .
many observers argue sending ships is a band-aid approach which fails to look at the root causes of the phenomenon .
most pirate groups operate from the coast of puntland , a lawless breakaway state in northern somalia .
observers say ineffective security forces there and poverty have allowed piracy to flourish .
in the 17th century , haiti 's french governor brought hundreds of prostitutes to the famous pirate lair of tortuga in a bid to tame the island 's troublesome buccaneers .
such a move is hardly an option in modern-day somalia and france has markedly changed tactics since , being the only country so far to have used its military firepower against the pirates .
circumstances negate use of force bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the french are the only ones to engage militarily so far but that approach is reserved for those countries with strong intervention capabilities , raises awkward questions with regard to international law and is often neutralized by the risk posed to hostages .
" sending warships can only have a limited effect ... one of the best ways of combating piracy would be to stop the decline of puntland , " said stig jarle hansen , a somalia expert with the denmark-based risk intelligence group .
hansen argues that not only is there no evidence of ties between pirates and somalia 's islamist shebab organization , which has been fighting the country 's government , but the islamists were more effective than most in combating piracy .
a 2006 ethiopian invasion to oust the islamic courts union that had taken control of much of the country and support a fragile transitional government had a major impact on the surge in piracy .
" before the invasion , the shebab were probably the best pirate fighters the country has known , " said hansen , also a senior researcher with the norwegian institute for urban and regional research .
however there are signs that major foreign players could seek to address some of the root causes and are mulling a " naval peacekeeping force " that also tackles illegal fishing and waste dumping in somali waters , two issues that are often used as justifications by pirates . dpa news agency / dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

that warning by a leading economist came as german scientists weighed in with their own grim predictions about rising sea levels . it would be a big mistake for leaders to ignore climate change during the financial crisis , said nicholas stern , a former british treasury economist , who released a seminal report in 2006 that said inaction on emissions blamed for global warming could cause economic pain equal to the great depression .
" that 's a very important lesson , tackle risk early , " stern told a climate and carbon conference in hong kong .
there have been worries that countries will be unwilling to commit to climate change goals at an international meeting scheduled in copenhagen at the end of next year .
stern said he was optimistic that countries would agree to reduce carbon emissions by 50 percent by 2050 .
green revolution offered as solution bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : stern warns that climate change will bring economic hardship stern said that the financial crisis represents an opportunity to use public spending to boost green technologies and mass public transportation .
" the lesson that we can draw out from this recession , is that you can boost demand in the best way possible by focusing on low carbon growth in future , " stern said .
greenpeace has taken up a similar call .
governments should use the global financial crisis as an opportunity to kickstart green technologies , greenpeace and the european renewable energy council -lrb- erec -rrb- said in a " practical blueprint " presented in berlin on monday .
governments should aggressively invest in renewable power generation and energy , which could create a $ 360 billion -lrb- 285 billion euro -rrb- industry that could provide half of the world 's electricity , according to the study .
" especially in the context of today 's economic instability , investing in renewable energy technologies is a ' win-win-win ' scenario : a win for energy security , a win for the economy and a win for the climate , " the group said .
scientists warn of big rise in ocean levels bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : governments have been called on to invest in renewable energy german scientists announced monday that ocean levels will rise much more than previously thought because climate change is happening much faster than predicted .
they expect a one meter increase this century .
earlier estimates had predicted a rise of 18 to 59 centimeters .
" we now have to expect that the sea level will rise by a meter this century , " said hans joachim schellnhuber , who heads the potsdam institute for research on global warming effects .
he and jochem marotzke , a leading meteorologist , have been looking at ocean levels .
schellnhuber said it is " just barely possible " that world governments will be able to limit the rise in average global temperatures to just 2 degrees celsius by the end of the century , if they all strictly adhere to severe limits in carbon dioxide emissions . dw staff -lrb- th -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

could they be heading for the title ?
team members say they 're just enjoying the ride . hoffenheim have shown that they are no fluke .
on sunday , the newcomers from a small town in southern germany crushed hamburg 3-0 .
the team destroyed hamburg with fast counter attacks that has become their trademark in their debut season in the bundesliga .
if they can keep up the pace , hoffenheim have the chance of being serious title contenders .
" let 's wait and see where it all ends .
we are having fun and are hungry , " defender andreas beck said after the hamburg game .
hoffenheim 's coach also said he did n't want his team to be distracted by its recent success .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hamburg simply could not keep up " should i be dancing on the tables ? " coach ralf rangnick asked reporters after the sunday win .
" the danger right now is that we start making mistakes . "
german soccer fans have been awed by the club 's rise .
the team plays arguably the most fun football in the country with a bunch of players who were virtually unknown before the season began .
an online poll of the mass circulation paper bild said on monday that 61 percent of some 16,000 voters believed that rangnick 's team was good enough for the title .
impressive start hoffenheim 's vedad ibisevic is the bundesliga top scorer with 10 goals .
demba ba or chinedu obasi have also been big scorers for the team .
rangnick 's successful formula of attacking football is helped by the fact , in his opinion , that " the players have been together for more than a year and know each other . "
hoffenheim have put in the best performance of a promoted team at this stage of the season since bayern munich joined the league in 1965-66 , featuring young players named franz beckenbauer and gerd mueller .
munich staged for a comeback bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : rangnick said he wants his players to stay focused munich chairman karl-heinz rummenigge expressed his " respect " for hoffenheim 's showings but is even more pleased that his team appears to have overcome a slump of three winless games with back-to-back victories .
munich have climbed into fourth place with 15 points , four behind hoffenheim , as they travel to eintracht frankfurt , who are upbeat as well after two wins , their first of the season .
but munich general manager uli hoeness is convinced " that we will be in the top three " if munich win in frankfurt and on saturday against bielefeld .
elsewhere , second-placed bayer leverkusen -lrb- 18 points -rrb- visit mid-table werder bremen on tuesday .
the day 's other games are vfl wolfsburg vs borussia moenchengladbach , sc karlsruhe vs schalke 04 and bielefeld vs bottom club energie cottbus .
in other action wednesday , hertha berlin meet hanover 96 , cologne play dortmund and the former leaders hamburg -lrb- third on 17 points -rrb- must reverse the latest negative trend when they host stuttgart .
" we will learn from this defeat , " vowed hamburg coach martin jol after the debacle in hoffenheim .

27 . however , discussions on a smoking ban in all of the member states ' workplaces are still at the preliminary stage , meaning any new rules are unlikely to be implemented before 2010 .
" clearly one of the areas which we would like to see covered -lrb- by the ban -rrb- is bars , restaurants and pubs , which are enclosed spaces where workers on a daily basis are exposed to passive smoking and to the consequences that passive smoking has on their own health and safety , " said chantal hughes , spokeswoman of eu employment commissioner vladimir spidla .
smoking bans currently differ widely across the eu .
while ireland was the first eu country to make its pubs and restaurants smoke-free , puffing cigarettes is still allowed in some pubs in germany and belgium .
and smoking is still common in both bars and restaurants in central and eastern european countries like hungary and romania .
" a number of member states have already introduced smoking bans .
however , they are very different in terms of scope and nature , " hughes said .
" we have a duty to ensure that all workplaces are safe and secure for workers .
at this stage we do not think that this is the case , which is why the commissioner would like to see a ban in all workplaces , " the spokeswoman said .
the commission plans to consult with employers and trade unions first , and does not expect the new rules to be submitted for approval to national governments before late 2009 , when the next eu executive assumes office .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de environment -pipe- 27.10.2008 expert warns against putting climate fight on the back burner großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german scientists warn that water levels will increase substantially problems caused by climate change are more serious than the current financial crisis .
that warning by a leading economist came as german scientists weighed in with their own grim predictions about rising sea levels . it would be a big mistake for leaders to ignore climate change during the financial crisis , said nicholas stern , a former british treasury economist , who released a seminal report in 2006 that said inaction on emissions blamed for global warming could cause economic pain equal to the great depression .
" that 's a very important lesson , tackle risk early , " stern told a climate and carbon conference in hong kong .
there have been worries that countries will be unwilling to commit to climate change goals at an international meeting scheduled in copenhagen at the end of next year .
stern said he was optimistic that countries would agree to reduce carbon emissions by 50 percent by 2050 .
green revolution offered as solution bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : stern warns that climate change will bring economic hardship stern said that the financial crisis represents an opportunity to use public spending to boost green technologies and mass public transportation .
" the lesson that we can draw out from this recession , is that you can boost demand in the best way possible by focusing on low carbon growth in future , " stern said .
greenpeace has taken up a similar call .
governments should use the global financial crisis as an opportunity to kickstart green technologies , greenpeace and the european renewable energy council -lrb- erec -rrb- said in a " practical blueprint " presented in berlin on monday .
governments should aggressively invest in renewable power generation and energy , which could create a $ 360 billion -lrb- 285 billion euro -rrb- industry that could provide half of the world 's electricity , according to the study .
" especially in the context of today 's economic instability , investing in renewable energy technologies is a ' win-win-win ' scenario : a win for energy security , a win for the economy and a win for the climate , " the group said .
scientists warn of big rise in ocean levels bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : governments have been called on to invest in renewable energy german scientists announced monday that ocean levels will rise much more than previously thought because climate change is happening much faster than predicted .
they expect a one meter increase this century .
earlier estimates had predicted a rise of 18 to 59 centimeters .
" we now have to expect that the sea level will rise by a meter this century , " said hans joachim schellnhuber , who heads the potsdam institute for research on global warming effects .
he and jochem marotzke , a leading meteorologist , have been looking at ocean levels .
schellnhuber said it is " just barely possible " that world governments will be able to limit the rise in average global temperatures to just 2 degrees celsius by the end of the century , if they all strictly adhere to severe limits in carbon dioxide emissions . dw staff -lrb- th -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

but moscow favors the young democrat over the cold war veteran . john mccain 's us presidential campaign begged at the enemy 's door this week when a wayward fundraising letter reached the desk of russia 's un envoy vitaly churkin in new york asking for a donation . the russians would n't spare a ruble for the republican , and sent mccain a sardonic message saying that , unlike the united states , the russian government does " not finance political activity in foreign countries . "
us laws would have prevented them from donating had they wanted to send mccain a check . russian officials , in fact , are n't banking on either mccain or democratic candidate barack obama mending relations upturned by russia 's recent war with us-ally georgia . hoping for a fresh start but the preference among russians is reported to be in favor of obama because he represents a clean slate and will be more open to new proposals , according to konstantin kosachyov , head of the russian duma 's foreign affairs committee and a senior figure in the dominant pro-kremlin party . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : mccain 's kgb comment did n't go over well in moscow both us candidates took a harsh stance on russia in a recent debate when asked if the late us president ronald reagan 's designation of the former soviet union as the " evil empire " still applied to modern russia . mccain said " maybe " while obama , who has moved closer to his opponent 's hard-line stance since the war in georgia , said russia exhibited " evil behavior " in that conflict . nonetheless , kosachyov said this week that mccain 's anti-russian bias was deep-set while obama was a more " comfortable " choice . " mccain got his political formation during the cold war , " kosachyov told news agency interfax .
" he dedicated most of his life to the fight against communism .
it 's clear that to this day he still thrashes along that front without seeing any real difference between the soviet union and modern russia . " the kremlin has had good , even personal , ties with republican presidents .
nikita khrushchev visited dwight eisenhower in the us .
leonid brezhnev and richard nixon signed the first us-russian arms control treaties .
mikhail gorbachev and ronald reagan saw their countries through the end of the cold war . sense of soul or secret police but russian leaders sat up and took note when mccain poked fun at us president george w. bush for saying he looked into his russian counterpart vladimir putin 's eyes and " got a sense of his soul . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : obama is compared to jfk , but us-russia relations were tense during his tenure mccain quipped that he saw something else - " three letters - a k , a g and a b , " referring to the former president and now prime minister who was a high-ranking kgb intelligence officer until the fall of the soviet union in 1991 . democratic presidents are more difficult partners for moscow because they tend toward a more complicated foreign policy view in contrast to the tough-styled russian realism , russian observers said . the closest the two countries ever came to nuclear war , they point out , was the 1962 cuban missile crisis under the late us president john f. kennedy , to whom obama is often compared . democratic president jimmy carter led a boycott of the moscow 1980 summer olympics , while russia blames bill clinton for pushing kosovo toward independence from serbia . personal over party " russian authorities would find it more difficult to deal with obama , " andrei kortunov , head of the moscow-based new eurasia foundation , told ria-novosti news agency .
" he will make world affairs more complicated . " but kosachyov said his choice was based on the candidates ' personal profiles over their political parties .

us laws would have prevented them from donating had they wanted to send mccain a check . russian officials , in fact , are n't banking on either mccain or democratic candidate barack obama mending relations upturned by russia 's recent war with us-ally georgia . hoping for a fresh start but the preference among russians is reported to be in favor of obama because he represents a clean slate and will be more open to new proposals , according to konstantin kosachyov , head of the russian duma 's foreign affairs committee and a senior figure in the dominant pro-kremlin party . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : mccain 's kgb comment did n't go over well in moscow both us candidates took a harsh stance on russia in a recent debate when asked if the late us president ronald reagan 's designation of the former soviet union as the " evil empire " still applied to modern russia . mccain said " maybe " while obama , who has moved closer to his opponent 's hard-line stance since the war in georgia , said russia exhibited " evil behavior " in that conflict . nonetheless , kosachyov said this week that mccain 's anti-russian bias was deep-set while obama was a more " comfortable " choice . " mccain got his political formation during the cold war , " kosachyov told news agency interfax .
" he dedicated most of his life to the fight against communism .
it 's clear that to this day he still thrashes along that front without seeing any real difference between the soviet union and modern russia . " the kremlin has had good , even personal , ties with republican presidents .
nikita khrushchev visited dwight eisenhower in the us .
leonid brezhnev and richard nixon signed the first us-russian arms control treaties .
mikhail gorbachev and ronald reagan saw their countries through the end of the cold war . sense of soul or secret police but russian leaders sat up and took note when mccain poked fun at us president george w. bush for saying he looked into his russian counterpart vladimir putin 's eyes and " got a sense of his soul . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : obama is compared to jfk , but us-russia relations were tense during his tenure mccain quipped that he saw something else - " three letters - a k , a g and a b , " referring to the former president and now prime minister who was a high-ranking kgb intelligence officer until the fall of the soviet union in 1991 . democratic presidents are more difficult partners for moscow because they tend toward a more complicated foreign policy view in contrast to the tough-styled russian realism , russian observers said . the closest the two countries ever came to nuclear war , they point out , was the 1962 cuban missile crisis under the late us president john f. kennedy , to whom obama is often compared . democratic president jimmy carter led a boycott of the moscow 1980 summer olympics , while russia blames bill clinton for pushing kosovo toward independence from serbia . personal over party " russian authorities would find it more difficult to deal with obama , " andrei kortunov , head of the moscow-based new eurasia foundation , told ria-novosti news agency .
" he will make world affairs more complicated . " but kosachyov said his choice was based on the candidates ' personal profiles over their political parties . " obama does n't differ particularly in his beliefs about russia from the republican candidate , but he is a young politician , without prejudices and so , more ready to take on a new proposals and approaches , " he said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : us plans to build a missile shield in eastern europe have disconcerted russia kosachyov cited as an example obama 's more compromising stance on us plans to site a missile defense shield in eastern europe , which russia views as a security threat . the us candidates ' russia advisors reveal marked difference in how each may navigate the widening gulf between both countries . obama 's top russia strategist , stanford professor michael mcfaul , called obama " an engagement guy , not an isolation guy . " mccain 's top russia expert is stephen biegun , who served bush on the us national security council from 2001 to 2003 and raises fears among russian diplomats that a republican president would perpetuate the current adversarial approach . tension without economic interdependence us plans to site a missile defense system in eastern europe and its support for western military alliance nato 's enlargement into the post-soviet space are , moscow says , a direct threat to its security . in fact , russia is battling the united states for influence in post-soviet countries it views as its rightful sphere of influence and where the us is attracted by energy and strategic interests . analysts in moscow say part of the problem is that security troubles between the two cold-war foes are not tempered by the business and energy interests that govern russia 's relations with the european union - its largest client for natural gas . dpa news agency -lrb- kjb -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de politics -pipe- 27.10.2008 bavaria set to seal landmark coalition under new premier großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : seehofer takes the helm as the waters get rough the conservative christian social union -lrb- csu -rrb- , which has ruled bavaria alone for 42 years , is to sign a coalition deal with a liberal pro-business minority and name new csu chief horst seehofer as state premier . on monday , oct .
27 , seehofer and sabine leutheusser-schnarrenberger , the head of the free democratic party -lrb- fdp -rrb- are to ink the historic coalition agreement that ends over four decades of sole conservative rule in germany 's largest state .
the csu , the sister party to chancellor angela merkel 's christian democratic union , lost its absolute majority in state elections four weeks ago , forcing it to seek a governing partner .
the fdp won seats in the bavarian state assembly in the sept .
28 poll for the first time in 14 years and is to take over the economy and science ministries .
an fdp convention in the city of ingolstadt approved the arrangement sunday .

the people in the minibus were civilians taking the body of a relative from kabul to the northeast province of badahkshan for burial , a local police official said .
they were in a hurry and driving at high speed when the soldiers opened fire , said abdul rahman aktash , deputy police chief of kunduz province .
latest incident comes as security deteriorates the incident happened a week after two german soldiers and five children were killed in a suicide attack near kunduz .

this year more than 250 soldiers have lost their lives in afghanistan , more than in any year since the international military operation was launched in 2001 .

27 , seehofer and sabine leutheusser-schnarrenberger , the head of the free democratic party -lrb- fdp -rrb- are to ink the historic coalition agreement that ends over four decades of sole conservative rule in germany 's largest state .
the csu , the sister party to chancellor angela merkel 's christian democratic union , lost its absolute majority in state elections four weeks ago , forcing it to seek a governing partner .
the fdp won seats in the bavarian state assembly in the sept .
28 poll for the first time in 14 years and is to take over the economy and science ministries .
an fdp convention in the city of ingolstadt approved the arrangement sunday .
" it 's always hard to give something up , " said csu majority leader georg schmid , " but that 's how it is in a coalition and i think we 've reached a good consensus with each other , for example in distributing the ministries . "
the two parties plan to partly relax a strict ban on smoking in bars which was blamed by some for the csu 's loss of one third of its traditional support at the state election .

hurdles ahead for seehofer the csu has not only lost both broad support from the majority of voters and faith in its leadership , but the state 's economic situation is also in grave danger after nine-figure losses at partially state-run landesbank bayern lb as a result of the international finance crisis .

in addition to fighting for tax cuts and inheritance tax reform , seehofer has already promised to make the crisis at the state bank first priority .

" i think the rest of the country looks at bavaria with a certain schadenfreude , " political scientist juergen falter told deutsche welle .
in addition to fighting for tax cuts and inheritance tax reform , seehofer has already promised to make the crisis at the state bank first priority .
the key to seehofer 's success , said falter , is to secure his position in bavaria so that he is unchallenged in berlin .
" he 'll raise his voice in national politics , " said falter .
" he 's good at that ; that 's his territory .
i think he 'll definitely perform well at the federal level . "
seehofer said in monday 's sueddeutsche zeitung , " my work place will be in munich , but my combat strength will also stretch to berlin . "
and if he 's to secure federal funds for bavaria 's troubled state bank , he 'll have to play his cards well in berlin . dw staff -lrb- kjb -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

27 welcomed a ceasefire deal in somalia as nato successfully completed its first anti-piracy mission off the somali coast .
but experts questioned the current international efforts to combat piracy . eu foreign policy chief javier solana and nato secretary general jaap de hoop scheffer stressed the importance of cooperation between the two brussels-based institutions during a regular meeting of ambassadors at the alliance 's headquarters .
one area in which the two organizations are working together is in the fight against pirates operating in the gulf of aden .
while the eu 's own operations are to begin shortly , de hoop scheffer announced that nato had just completed its first anti-piracy mission by escorting a cargo ship delivering supplies to the african union mission to somalia .
an italian destroyer as well as british and greek frigates arrived in the gulf of aden last week as the front guard of nato 's anti-piracy operation allied provider .
the nato chief said nato warships would next be escorting world food program -lrb- wfp -rrb- cargos delivering food aid to the region .
" the operation is moving well , and the contacts we are having with the eu are also good , " de hoop scheffer said .
the eu has also pledged another three or four vessels by december in a bid to stem a phenomenon that is threatening world trade .
solana , for his part , welcomed a ceasefire agreement clinched over the weekend by the somali government and parts of the islamist opposition .
" this agreement is an important step forward , " solana said in a statement issued by his office in brussels .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : de hoop scheffer and solana join forces against piracy " only an inclusive political process will bring durable peace to somalia , and i call on all somalis to rally behind the transitional federal government of somalia and the alliance for the re-liberation of somalia and their endeavor to achieve this , " the statement said .
political instability has played a major role in preventing somalia from stopping gangs of pirates from seizing commercial vessels sailing off the country 's coast , prompting foreign organizations and nations to intervene .
experts doubt plausability of international efforts but despite western navies being spurred into action by the recent spate of high-profile hijackings by somali pirates , some experts argue that a handful of warships can do little to stamp out the lucrative piracy business .
but experts say a beefed up naval presence can achieve little more than escort services for food aid deliveries .
" when it comes to suppressing piracy , an extra 10 or 11 ships is still not a huge amount of naval presence for a very large area , " said roger middleton , consultant researcher for london-based think-tank chatham house in an interview with the afp news agency .
bildunterschrift : the german navy frigate emden will soon be deployed in the fight against piracy the new deployments added to the foreign ships already operating off the coast of somalia will eventually bring to between 20 and 25 the total number of warships patrolling the area 's dangerous waters by the end of the year .
according to the international maritime bureau , somali pirates have attacked more than 60 ships since the start of 2008 , hijacked almost half of them and received millions of dollars in ransom money .
the hijacking on september 25 of a ukrainian cargo loaded with battle tanks and other weaponry captured the world 's attention and may have sped up international action .
spreading piracy may overwhelm task force but pirates have expanded their activities to the eastern coast and the indian ocean and foreign warships will already have their hands full trying to secure a maritime corridor in the gulf of aden .
" if there is sufficient coordination between all these foreign actors , it can act as a deterrent but it 's definitely not the death knell of somali piracy , " middleton told afp .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : nato ships are spread thinly around the african coast western navies with modern equipment are already stretched by conflicts elsewhere in the world and experts argue the number of foreign warships tasked with patrolling somalia 's waters is unlikely to increase significantly in 2009 .
many observers argue sending ships is a band-aid approach which fails to look at the root causes of the phenomenon .
most pirate groups operate from the coast of puntland , a lawless breakaway state in northern somalia .
observers say ineffective security forces there and poverty have allowed piracy to flourish .
in the 17th century , haiti 's french governor brought hundreds of prostitutes to the famous pirate lair of tortuga in a bid to tame the island 's troublesome buccaneers .
such a move is hardly an option in modern-day somalia and france has markedly changed tactics since , being the only country so far to have used its military firepower against the pirates .
circumstances negate use of force bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the french are the only ones to engage militarily so far but that approach is reserved for those countries with strong intervention capabilities , raises awkward questions with regard to international law and is often neutralized by the risk posed to hostages .
" sending warships can only have a limited effect ... one of the best ways of combating piracy would be to stop the decline of puntland , " said stig jarle hansen , a somalia expert with the denmark-based risk intelligence group .
hansen argues that not only is there no evidence of ties between pirates and somalia 's islamist shebab organization , which has been fighting the country 's government , but the islamists were more effective than most in combating piracy .
a 2006 ethiopian invasion to oust the islamic courts union that had taken control of much of the country and support a fragile transitional government had a major impact on the surge in piracy .
" before the invasion , the shebab were probably the best pirate fighters the country has known , " said hansen , also a senior researcher with the norwegian institute for urban and regional research .
however there are signs that major foreign players could seek to address some of the root causes and are mulling a " naval peacekeeping force " that also tackles illegal fishing and waste dumping in somali waters , two issues that are often used as justifications by pirates . dpa news agency / dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

27 welcomed a ceasefire deal in somalia as nato successfully completed its first anti-piracy mission off the somali coast .
but experts questioned the current international efforts to combat piracy . eu foreign policy chief javier solana and nato secretary general jaap de hoop scheffer stressed the importance of cooperation between the two brussels-based institutions during a regular meeting of ambassadors at the alliance 's headquarters .
one area in which the two organizations are working together is in the fight against pirates operating in the gulf of aden .
while the eu 's own operations are to begin shortly , de hoop scheffer announced that nato had just completed its first anti-piracy mission by escorting a cargo ship delivering supplies to the african union mission to somalia .
an italian destroyer as well as british and greek frigates arrived in the gulf of aden last week as the front guard of nato 's anti-piracy operation allied provider .
the nato chief said nato warships would next be escorting world food program -lrb- wfp -rrb- cargos delivering food aid to the region .
" the operation is moving well , and the contacts we are having with the eu are also good , " de hoop scheffer said .
the eu has also pledged another three or four vessels by december in a bid to stem a phenomenon that is threatening world trade .
solana , for his part , welcomed a ceasefire agreement clinched over the weekend by the somali government and parts of the islamist opposition .
" this agreement is an important step forward , " solana said in a statement issued by his office in brussels .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : de hoop scheffer and solana join forces against piracy " only an inclusive political process will bring durable peace to somalia , and i call on all somalis to rally behind the transitional federal government of somalia and the alliance for the re-liberation of somalia and their endeavor to achieve this , " the statement said .
political instability has played a major role in preventing somalia from stopping gangs of pirates from seizing commercial vessels sailing off the country 's coast , prompting foreign organizations and nations to intervene .
experts doubt plausability of international efforts but despite western navies being spurred into action by the recent spate of high-profile hijackings by somali pirates , some experts argue that a handful of warships can do little to stamp out the lucrative piracy business .
but experts say a beefed up naval presence can achieve little more than escort services for food aid deliveries .
" when it comes to suppressing piracy , an extra 10 or 11 ships is still not a huge amount of naval presence for a very large area , " said roger middleton , consultant researcher for london-based think-tank chatham house in an interview with the afp news agency .
bildunterschrift : the german navy frigate emden will soon be deployed in the fight against piracy the new deployments added to the foreign ships already operating off the coast of somalia will eventually bring to between 20 and 25 the total number of warships patrolling the area 's dangerous waters by the end of the year .
according to the international maritime bureau , somali pirates have attacked more than 60 ships since the start of 2008 , hijacked almost half of them and received millions of dollars in ransom money .
the hijacking on september 25 of a ukrainian cargo loaded with battle tanks and other weaponry captured the world 's attention and may have sped up international action .
spreading piracy may overwhelm task force but pirates have expanded their activities to the eastern coast and the indian ocean and foreign warships will already have their hands full trying to secure a maritime corridor in the gulf of aden .
" if there is sufficient coordination between all these foreign actors , it can act as a deterrent but it 's definitely not the death knell of somali piracy , " middleton told afp .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : nato ships are spread thinly around the african coast western navies with modern equipment are already stretched by conflicts elsewhere in the world and experts argue the number of foreign warships tasked with patrolling somalia 's waters is unlikely to increase significantly in 2009 .
many observers argue sending ships is a band-aid approach which fails to look at the root causes of the phenomenon .
most pirate groups operate from the coast of puntland , a lawless breakaway state in northern somalia .
observers say ineffective security forces there and poverty have allowed piracy to flourish .
in the 17th century , haiti 's french governor brought hundreds of prostitutes to the famous pirate lair of tortuga in a bid to tame the island 's troublesome buccaneers .
such a move is hardly an option in modern-day somalia and france has markedly changed tactics since , being the only country so far to have used its military firepower against the pirates .
circumstances negate use of force bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the french are the only ones to engage militarily so far but that approach is reserved for those countries with strong intervention capabilities , raises awkward questions with regard to international law and is often neutralized by the risk posed to hostages .
" sending warships can only have a limited effect ... one of the best ways of combating piracy would be to stop the decline of puntland , " said stig jarle hansen , a somalia expert with the denmark-based risk intelligence group .
hansen argues that not only is there no evidence of ties between pirates and somalia 's islamist shebab organization , which has been fighting the country 's government , but the islamists were more effective than most in combating piracy .
a 2006 ethiopian invasion to oust the islamic courts union that had taken control of much of the country and support a fragile transitional government had a major impact on the surge in piracy .
" before the invasion , the shebab were probably the best pirate fighters the country has known , " said hansen , also a senior researcher with the norwegian institute for urban and regional research .
however there are signs that major foreign players could seek to address some of the root causes and are mulling a " naval peacekeeping force " that also tackles illegal fishing and waste dumping in somali waters , two issues that are often used as justifications by pirates . dpa news agency / dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

germany 's lufthansa and russian carrier s7 airlines are both contenders . lufthansa has demanded that the government government take over 500 million euros -lrb- $ 631 million -rrb- of the flag carrier 's debts of around 900 million euros .
the state " might be ready to contribute financially in order to make the sale go through , " transport minister werner faymann said .
according to media reports , lufthansa is offering only a symbolic price for the government 's 42.75 percent stake in austrian airlines , with an option of paying more once the ailing carrier has recovered , according to dpa news service .
russian carrier remains interested the german carrier was seen as the only remaining bidder for government stake , but the holding 's chief executive officer , peter michaelis , confirmed monday that s7 , russia 's leading domestic airline , was still among the suitors .
air france-klm dropped out of the bidding process last week , citing a lack of transparency of austrian airline 's part in disclosing existing cooperation contracts with lufthansa .
the government 's mandate to privatize its 42.75 percent stake in austrian airlines was scheduled to run out tuesday , october 28 .
but the process was likely to be prolonged until december 31 , the finance ministry has announced .
with its fleet of 264 aircraft , lufthansa made 3.02 billion euros in earnings before interest , taxes , debt and amortization -lrb- ebitda -rrb- in 2007 .
operating 71 airplanes , s7 's ebitda was 81.6 million euros last year .
faced with high fuel costs and a decreasing numbers of passengers flying on its 99 aircraft , austrian airlines expects to end the year with a deficit of 125 million euros . dw staff -lrb- th -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

27 . however , discussions on a smoking ban in all of the member states ' workplaces are still at the preliminary stage , meaning any new rules are unlikely to be implemented before 2010 .
" clearly one of the areas which we would like to see covered -lrb- by the ban -rrb- is bars , restaurants and pubs , which are enclosed spaces where workers on a daily basis are exposed to passive smoking and to the consequences that passive smoking has on their own health and safety , " said chantal hughes , spokeswoman of eu employment commissioner vladimir spidla .
smoking bans currently differ widely across the eu .
while ireland was the first eu country to make its pubs and restaurants smoke-free , puffing cigarettes is still allowed in some pubs in germany and belgium .
and smoking is still common in both bars and restaurants in central and eastern european countries like hungary and romania .
" a number of member states have already introduced smoking bans .
however , they are very different in terms of scope and nature , " hughes said .
" we have a duty to ensure that all workplaces are safe and secure for workers .
at this stage we do not think that this is the case , which is why the commissioner would like to see a ban in all workplaces , " the spokeswoman said .
the commission plans to consult with employers and trade unions first , and does not expect the new rules to be submitted for approval to national governments before late 2009 , when the next eu executive assumes office .

five occupants were wounded , the defense ministry said . a spokesman said the incident occurred on a main road near the northern city of kunduz .
the troops , serving with the nato-led international security assistance force -lrb- isaf -rrb- , first fired warning shots at the minibus , the spokesman said .
when the driver continued to approach the checkpoint at high speed , the soldiers opened fire with sub-machine guns , hitting the vehicle 's engine , the spokesman said .
five men were wounded , among them two who suffered injuries serious enough to require treatment at the german base in mazar-i-sharif .
a search of the vehicle failed to turn up any arms .
the people in the minibus were civilians taking the body of a relative from kabul to the northeast province of badahkshan for burial , a local police official said .
they were in a hurry and driving at high speed when the soldiers opened fire , said abdul rahman aktash , deputy police chief of kunduz province .
latest incident comes as security deteriorates the incident happened a week after two german soldiers and five children were killed in a suicide attack near kunduz .

germany 's lufthansa and russian carrier s7 airlines are both contenders . lufthansa has demanded that the government government take over 500 million euros -lrb- $ 631 million -rrb- of the flag carrier 's debts of around 900 million euros .
the state " might be ready to contribute financially in order to make the sale go through , " transport minister werner faymann said .
according to media reports , lufthansa is offering only a symbolic price for the government 's 42.75 percent stake in austrian airlines , with an option of paying more once the ailing carrier has recovered , according to dpa news service .
russian carrier remains interested the german carrier was seen as the only remaining bidder for government stake , but the holding 's chief executive officer , peter michaelis , confirmed monday that s7 , russia 's leading domestic airline , was still among the suitors .
air france-klm dropped out of the bidding process last week , citing a lack of transparency of austrian airline 's part in disclosing existing cooperation contracts with lufthansa .
the government 's mandate to privatize its 42.75 percent stake in austrian airlines was scheduled to run out tuesday , october 28 .
but the process was likely to be prolonged until december 31 , the finance ministry has announced .
with its fleet of 264 aircraft , lufthansa made 3.02 billion euros in earnings before interest , taxes , debt and amortization -lrb- ebitda -rrb- in 2007 .
operating 71 airplanes , s7 's ebitda was 81.6 million euros last year .

merkel is also to pay a visit to queen elizabeth ii at buckingham palace .
germany and britain have unveiled the biggest rescues of banks outside the united states , but the moves have failed to counter a slide in world stock markets which is being seen as a harbinger of a global recession .

her party supporters from the cdu -lrb- christian democrats -rrb- have suggested cuts in taxes on motor vehicles and a possible income tax rebate .
action expected soon in berlin , finance minister peer steinbrueck said he expected action this week or next .
steinbrueck said he and his own social democratic party -lrb- spd -rrb- opposed tax cuts because taxpayers might simply move their gains into savings instead of spending them , or might import more rather than buying home goods .
stressing the urgency of action , steinbrueck said after meeting with his party in berlin that tax cuts might also not gain traction till next year when many people receive their tax findings .
the finance minister said his party favored job creation by encouraging municipalities to speed construction of day cares and schools and by lending money to the mittelstand , germany 's web of medium-sized companies .
further options available other options include soft loans and subsidies for new home-heating and home-insulation work .
those projects are popular in germany as they also reduce oil and gas use and help cut carbon dioxide emissions .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de nato -pipe- 27.10.2008 nato begins anti-piracy mission as experts question plausability großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : nato 's anti-piracy mission off somalia is seen as inadequate by some experts the eu on monday , oct .
27 welcomed a ceasefire deal in somalia as nato successfully completed its first anti-piracy mission off the somali coast .
but experts questioned the current international efforts to combat piracy . eu foreign policy chief javier solana and nato secretary general jaap de hoop scheffer stressed the importance of cooperation between the two brussels-based institutions during a regular meeting of ambassadors at the alliance 's headquarters .
one area in which the two organizations are working together is in the fight against pirates operating in the gulf of aden .
while the eu 's own operations are to begin shortly , de hoop scheffer announced that nato had just completed its first anti-piracy mission by escorting a cargo ship delivering supplies to the african union mission to somalia .
an italian destroyer as well as british and greek frigates arrived in the gulf of aden last week as the front guard of nato 's anti-piracy operation allied provider .
the nato chief said nato warships would next be escorting world food program -lrb- wfp -rrb- cargos delivering food aid to the region .
" the operation is moving well , and the contacts we are having with the eu are also good , " de hoop scheffer said .
the eu has also pledged another three or four vessels by december in a bid to stem a phenomenon that is threatening world trade .
solana , for his part , welcomed a ceasefire agreement clinched over the weekend by the somali government and parts of the islamist opposition .
" this agreement is an important step forward , " solana said in a statement issued by his office in brussels .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : de hoop scheffer and solana join forces against piracy " only an inclusive political process will bring durable peace to somalia , and i call on all somalis to rally behind the transitional federal government of somalia and the alliance for the re-liberation of somalia and their endeavor to achieve this , " the statement said .
political instability has played a major role in preventing somalia from stopping gangs of pirates from seizing commercial vessels sailing off the country 's coast , prompting foreign organizations and nations to intervene .
experts doubt plausability of international efforts but despite western navies being spurred into action by the recent spate of high-profile hijackings by somali pirates , some experts argue that a handful of warships can do little to stamp out the lucrative piracy business .
but experts say a beefed up naval presence can achieve little more than escort services for food aid deliveries .
" when it comes to suppressing piracy , an extra 10 or 11 ships is still not a huge amount of naval presence for a very large area , " said roger middleton , consultant researcher for london-based think-tank chatham house in an interview with the afp news agency .
bildunterschrift : the german navy frigate emden will soon be deployed in the fight against piracy the new deployments added to the foreign ships already operating off the coast of somalia will eventually bring to between 20 and 25 the total number of warships patrolling the area 's dangerous waters by the end of the year .
according to the international maritime bureau , somali pirates have attacked more than 60 ships since the start of 2008 , hijacked almost half of them and received millions of dollars in ransom money .
the hijacking on september 25 of a ukrainian cargo loaded with battle tanks and other weaponry captured the world 's attention and may have sped up international action .
spreading piracy may overwhelm task force but pirates have expanded their activities to the eastern coast and the indian ocean and foreign warships will already have their hands full trying to secure a maritime corridor in the gulf of aden .
" if there is sufficient coordination between all these foreign actors , it can act as a deterrent but it 's definitely not the death knell of somali piracy , " middleton told afp .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : nato ships are spread thinly around the african coast western navies with modern equipment are already stretched by conflicts elsewhere in the world and experts argue the number of foreign warships tasked with patrolling somalia 's waters is unlikely to increase significantly in 2009 .
many observers argue sending ships is a band-aid approach which fails to look at the root causes of the phenomenon .
most pirate groups operate from the coast of puntland , a lawless breakaway state in northern somalia .
observers say ineffective security forces there and poverty have allowed piracy to flourish .
in the 17th century , haiti 's french governor brought hundreds of prostitutes to the famous pirate lair of tortuga in a bid to tame the island 's troublesome buccaneers .
such a move is hardly an option in modern-day somalia and france has markedly changed tactics since , being the only country so far to have used its military firepower against the pirates .

27 welcomed a ceasefire deal in somalia as nato successfully completed its first anti-piracy mission off the somali coast .
but experts questioned the current international efforts to combat piracy . eu foreign policy chief javier solana and nato secretary general jaap de hoop scheffer stressed the importance of cooperation between the two brussels-based institutions during a regular meeting of ambassadors at the alliance 's headquarters .
one area in which the two organizations are working together is in the fight against pirates operating in the gulf of aden .
while the eu 's own operations are to begin shortly , de hoop scheffer announced that nato had just completed its first anti-piracy mission by escorting a cargo ship delivering supplies to the african union mission to somalia .
an italian destroyer as well as british and greek frigates arrived in the gulf of aden last week as the front guard of nato 's anti-piracy operation allied provider .
the nato chief said nato warships would next be escorting world food program -lrb- wfp -rrb- cargos delivering food aid to the region .
" the operation is moving well , and the contacts we are having with the eu are also good , " de hoop scheffer said .
the eu has also pledged another three or four vessels by december in a bid to stem a phenomenon that is threatening world trade .
solana , for his part , welcomed a ceasefire agreement clinched over the weekend by the somali government and parts of the islamist opposition .
" this agreement is an important step forward , " solana said in a statement issued by his office in brussels .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : de hoop scheffer and solana join forces against piracy " only an inclusive political process will bring durable peace to somalia , and i call on all somalis to rally behind the transitional federal government of somalia and the alliance for the re-liberation of somalia and their endeavor to achieve this , " the statement said .
political instability has played a major role in preventing somalia from stopping gangs of pirates from seizing commercial vessels sailing off the country 's coast , prompting foreign organizations and nations to intervene .
experts doubt plausability of international efforts but despite western navies being spurred into action by the recent spate of high-profile hijackings by somali pirates , some experts argue that a handful of warships can do little to stamp out the lucrative piracy business .
but experts say a beefed up naval presence can achieve little more than escort services for food aid deliveries .
" when it comes to suppressing piracy , an extra 10 or 11 ships is still not a huge amount of naval presence for a very large area , " said roger middleton , consultant researcher for london-based think-tank chatham house in an interview with the afp news agency .
bildunterschrift : the german navy frigate emden will soon be deployed in the fight against piracy the new deployments added to the foreign ships already operating off the coast of somalia will eventually bring to between 20 and 25 the total number of warships patrolling the area 's dangerous waters by the end of the year .
according to the international maritime bureau , somali pirates have attacked more than 60 ships since the start of 2008 , hijacked almost half of them and received millions of dollars in ransom money .
the hijacking on september 25 of a ukrainian cargo loaded with battle tanks and other weaponry captured the world 's attention and may have sped up international action .
spreading piracy may overwhelm task force but pirates have expanded their activities to the eastern coast and the indian ocean and foreign warships will already have their hands full trying to secure a maritime corridor in the gulf of aden .
" if there is sufficient coordination between all these foreign actors , it can act as a deterrent but it 's definitely not the death knell of somali piracy , " middleton told afp .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : nato ships are spread thinly around the african coast western navies with modern equipment are already stretched by conflicts elsewhere in the world and experts argue the number of foreign warships tasked with patrolling somalia 's waters is unlikely to increase significantly in 2009 .
many observers argue sending ships is a band-aid approach which fails to look at the root causes of the phenomenon .
most pirate groups operate from the coast of puntland , a lawless breakaway state in northern somalia .
observers say ineffective security forces there and poverty have allowed piracy to flourish .
in the 17th century , haiti 's french governor brought hundreds of prostitutes to the famous pirate lair of tortuga in a bid to tame the island 's troublesome buccaneers .
such a move is hardly an option in modern-day somalia and france has markedly changed tactics since , being the only country so far to have used its military firepower against the pirates .
circumstances negate use of force bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the french are the only ones to engage militarily so far but that approach is reserved for those countries with strong intervention capabilities , raises awkward questions with regard to international law and is often neutralized by the risk posed to hostages .

but experts questioned the current international efforts to combat piracy . eu foreign policy chief javier solana and nato secretary general jaap de hoop scheffer stressed the importance of cooperation between the two brussels-based institutions during a regular meeting of ambassadors at the alliance 's headquarters .
one area in which the two organizations are working together is in the fight against pirates operating in the gulf of aden .
while the eu 's own operations are to begin shortly , de hoop scheffer announced that nato had just completed its first anti-piracy mission by escorting a cargo ship delivering supplies to the african union mission to somalia .
an italian destroyer as well as british and greek frigates arrived in the gulf of aden last week as the front guard of nato 's anti-piracy operation allied provider .
the nato chief said nato warships would next be escorting world food program -lrb- wfp -rrb- cargos delivering food aid to the region .
" the operation is moving well , and the contacts we are having with the eu are also good , " de hoop scheffer said .
the eu has also pledged another three or four vessels by december in a bid to stem a phenomenon that is threatening world trade .
solana , for his part , welcomed a ceasefire agreement clinched over the weekend by the somali government and parts of the islamist opposition .
" this agreement is an important step forward , " solana said in a statement issued by his office in brussels .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : de hoop scheffer and solana join forces against piracy " only an inclusive political process will bring durable peace to somalia , and i call on all somalis to rally behind the transitional federal government of somalia and the alliance for the re-liberation of somalia and their endeavor to achieve this , " the statement said .
political instability has played a major role in preventing somalia from stopping gangs of pirates from seizing commercial vessels sailing off the country 's coast , prompting foreign organizations and nations to intervene .
experts doubt plausability of international efforts but despite western navies being spurred into action by the recent spate of high-profile hijackings by somali pirates , some experts argue that a handful of warships can do little to stamp out the lucrative piracy business .
but experts say a beefed up naval presence can achieve little more than escort services for food aid deliveries .
" when it comes to suppressing piracy , an extra 10 or 11 ships is still not a huge amount of naval presence for a very large area , " said roger middleton , consultant researcher for london-based think-tank chatham house in an interview with the afp news agency .
bildunterschrift : the german navy frigate emden will soon be deployed in the fight against piracy the new deployments added to the foreign ships already operating off the coast of somalia will eventually bring to between 20 and 25 the total number of warships patrolling the area 's dangerous waters by the end of the year .
according to the international maritime bureau , somali pirates have attacked more than 60 ships since the start of 2008 , hijacked almost half of them and received millions of dollars in ransom money .
the hijacking on september 25 of a ukrainian cargo loaded with battle tanks and other weaponry captured the world 's attention and may have sped up international action .
spreading piracy may overwhelm task force but pirates have expanded their activities to the eastern coast and the indian ocean and foreign warships will already have their hands full trying to secure a maritime corridor in the gulf of aden .
" if there is sufficient coordination between all these foreign actors , it can act as a deterrent but it 's definitely not the death knell of somali piracy , " middleton told afp .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : nato ships are spread thinly around the african coast western navies with modern equipment are already stretched by conflicts elsewhere in the world and experts argue the number of foreign warships tasked with patrolling somalia 's waters is unlikely to increase significantly in 2009 .
many observers argue sending ships is a band-aid approach which fails to look at the root causes of the phenomenon .
most pirate groups operate from the coast of puntland , a lawless breakaway state in northern somalia .
observers say ineffective security forces there and poverty have allowed piracy to flourish .
in the 17th century , haiti 's french governor brought hundreds of prostitutes to the famous pirate lair of tortuga in a bid to tame the island 's troublesome buccaneers .
such a move is hardly an option in modern-day somalia and france has markedly changed tactics since , being the only country so far to have used its military firepower against the pirates .
circumstances negate use of force bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the french are the only ones to engage militarily so far but that approach is reserved for those countries with strong intervention capabilities , raises awkward questions with regard to international law and is often neutralized by the risk posed to hostages .
" sending warships can only have a limited effect ... one of the best ways of combating piracy would be to stop the decline of puntland , " said stig jarle hansen , a somalia expert with the denmark-based risk intelligence group .
hansen argues that not only is there no evidence of ties between pirates and somalia 's islamist shebab organization , which has been fighting the country 's government , but the islamists were more effective than most in combating piracy .
a 2006 ethiopian invasion to oust the islamic courts union that had taken control of much of the country and support a fragile transitional government had a major impact on the surge in piracy .
" before the invasion , the shebab were probably the best pirate fighters the country has known , " said hansen , also a senior researcher with the norwegian institute for urban and regional research .
however there are signs that major foreign players could seek to address some of the root causes and are mulling a " naval peacekeeping force " that also tackles illegal fishing and waste dumping in somali waters , two issues that are often used as justifications by pirates . dpa news agency / dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

that warning by a leading economist came as german scientists weighed in with their own grim predictions about rising sea levels . it would be a big mistake for leaders to ignore climate change during the financial crisis , said nicholas stern , a former british treasury economist , who released a seminal report in 2006 that said inaction on emissions blamed for global warming could cause economic pain equal to the great depression .
" that 's a very important lesson , tackle risk early , " stern told a climate and carbon conference in hong kong .
there have been worries that countries will be unwilling to commit to climate change goals at an international meeting scheduled in copenhagen at the end of next year .
stern said he was optimistic that countries would agree to reduce carbon emissions by 50 percent by 2050 .
green revolution offered as solution bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : stern warns that climate change will bring economic hardship stern said that the financial crisis represents an opportunity to use public spending to boost green technologies and mass public transportation .
" the lesson that we can draw out from this recession , is that you can boost demand in the best way possible by focusing on low carbon growth in future , " stern said .
greenpeace has taken up a similar call .
governments should use the global financial crisis as an opportunity to kickstart green technologies , greenpeace and the european renewable energy council -lrb- erec -rrb- said in a " practical blueprint " presented in berlin on monday .
governments should aggressively invest in renewable power generation and energy , which could create a $ 360 billion -lrb- 285 billion euro -rrb- industry that could provide half of the world 's electricity , according to the study .
" especially in the context of today 's economic instability , investing in renewable energy technologies is a ' win-win-win ' scenario : a win for energy security , a win for the economy and a win for the climate , " the group said .
scientists warn of big rise in ocean levels bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : governments have been called on to invest in renewable energy german scientists announced monday that ocean levels will rise much more than previously thought because climate change is happening much faster than predicted .
they expect a one meter increase this century .
earlier estimates had predicted a rise of 18 to 59 centimeters .
" we now have to expect that the sea level will rise by a meter this century , " said hans joachim schellnhuber , who heads the potsdam institute for research on global warming effects .
he and jochem marotzke , a leading meteorologist , have been looking at ocean levels .
schellnhuber said it is " just barely possible " that world governments will be able to limit the rise in average global temperatures to just 2 degrees celsius by the end of the century , if they all strictly adhere to severe limits in carbon dioxide emissions . dw staff -lrb- th -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

hungary will also get " substantial " help , the specifics of which will be announced in the next few days , imf director dominique strauss-kahn confirmed monday , oct.27. the imf has offered up to $ 200 billion in loans to countries facing financial difficulties caused by the current global economic crisis . on friday , the imf made a $ 2.1 billion loan to iceland . the current climate of market instability has thrust the imf into the spotlight .
some world leaders , including german chancellor angela merkel , have called for the global body to become more involved in policing global financial markets .
merkel called for " better international coordination " and " a strengthening of the role played by the imf in ensuring stability of the global financial system . " rich nations promise cooperation bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the imf said money is on the way to ukraine and hungary the g7 rich nations also promised to work together to stabilize global markets in a statement released monday .

" " we continue to monitor markets closely and cooperate as appropriate , " the statement from g7 finance ministers and central bank chiefs said . it was unclear whether that promise would be enough to bring stability to the markets .
japan 's nikkei stock index and most other markets in asia posted major losses on monday .
germany 's dax was also down 3.54 percent at the start of trading monday and the british stock market slumped by more than 5 percent early on . ukraine facing political , financial turmoil ukraine began to run into problems when the global demand for steel , its main export , began to drop in recent weeks . earlier this month , the former soviet country stopped early withdrawals from savings accounts to stop a run on banks .
several of the county 's banks also needed help after ukraine 's stock market lost more than 70 percent of its value . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ukraine 's leaders are more at odds than it might appear the country has also begun using up foreign currency reserves to prop up its currency , the hryvnia , according to analysts .
that has led to worries that the government will be unable to pay back some foreign loans that have been a driving force behind ukraine 's recent economic growth . " the imf is moving expeditiously to help ukraine , and this program is focused on the essential upfront measures needed to maintain confidence and economic and financial stability , " the imf chief said in his statement . yet the country is still in the midst of a political crisis .
president viktor yushchenko and prime minister yulia tymoshenko have been locked in a nasty fight over the president 's decision to call for new elections . the finance ministry in kyiv welcomed the imf 's support , saying it " opened a door to ukraine 's speedy cooperation with other international financial organizations . " hungary expected to set spending limits the imf , european governments and other partners are set to offer help to hungary .
while the imf did not release the size of the rescue package , analysts said it should be over $ 10 billion . hungary is vulnerable due to a large budget deficit , overvalued currency , low stock of foreign reserve and high levels of short-term foreign currency debt , afp news agency said .
the country 's national currency , the forint , has fallen sharply . last week , hungary 's central bank decided to raise its key interest rate by three points to 11.5 percent , the highest in the european union . dw staff -lrb- th -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

27 , seehofer and sabine leutheusser-schnarrenberger , the head of the free democratic party -lrb- fdp -rrb- are to ink the historic coalition agreement that ends over four decades of sole conservative rule in germany 's largest state .
the csu , the sister party to chancellor angela merkel 's christian democratic union , lost its absolute majority in state elections four weeks ago , forcing it to seek a governing partner .
the fdp won seats in the bavarian state assembly in the sept .
28 poll for the first time in 14 years and is to take over the economy and science ministries .
an fdp convention in the city of ingolstadt approved the arrangement sunday .
" it 's always hard to give something up , " said csu majority leader georg schmid , " but that 's how it is in a coalition and i think we 've reached a good consensus with each other , for example in distributing the ministries . "
the two parties plan to partly relax a strict ban on smoking in bars which was blamed by some for the csu 's loss of one third of its traditional support at the state election .
bavaria names new premier after the loss in support to just 43 per cent of ballots , the bavaria-only csu deposed both its former leader , erwin huber , and its state premier , guenther beckstein .

he relinquished his currents posts in berlin as federal minister of agriculture and minister for consumer affairs . despite receiving a 90.3 percent majority in the delegation 's vote for chairman on saturday , seehofer is not entirely without controversy within his own party .
reports of an extra-marital affair last year damaged his reputation among some of the more conservative party members who see the csu as a bastion of traditional values .
hurdles ahead for seehofer the csu has not only lost both broad support from the majority of voters and faith in its leadership , but the state 's economic situation is also in grave danger after nine-figure losses at partially state-run landesbank bayern lb as a result of the international finance crisis .
" i think the rest of the country looks at bavaria with a certain schadenfreude , " political scientist juergen falter told deutsche welle .
in addition to fighting for tax cuts and inheritance tax reform , seehofer has already promised to make the crisis at the state bank first priority .
the key to seehofer 's success , said falter , is to secure his position in bavaria so that he is unchallenged in berlin .
" he 'll raise his voice in national politics , " said falter .
" he 's good at that ; that 's his territory .
i think he 'll definitely perform well at the federal level . "

27 , seehofer and sabine leutheusser-schnarrenberger , the head of the free democratic party -lrb- fdp -rrb- are to ink the historic coalition agreement that ends over four decades of sole conservative rule in germany 's largest state .
the csu , the sister party to chancellor angela merkel 's christian democratic union , lost its absolute majority in state elections four weeks ago , forcing it to seek a governing partner .
the fdp won seats in the bavarian state assembly in the sept .
28 poll for the first time in 14 years and is to take over the economy and science ministries .
an fdp convention in the city of ingolstadt approved the arrangement sunday .
" it 's always hard to give something up , " said csu majority leader georg schmid , " but that 's how it is in a coalition and i think we 've reached a good consensus with each other , for example in distributing the ministries . "
the two parties plan to partly relax a strict ban on smoking in bars which was blamed by some for the csu 's loss of one third of its traditional support at the state election .
bavaria names new premier after the loss in support to just 43 per cent of ballots , the bavaria-only csu deposed both its former leader , erwin huber , and its state premier , guenther beckstein .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : rescuing bavaria 's state bank will be first on seehofer 's agenda seehofer was named csu chief at a party meeting on saturday and , on monday , is to be appointed to the position of state premier .
he relinquished his currents posts in berlin as federal minister of agriculture and minister for consumer affairs . despite receiving a 90.3 percent majority in the delegation 's vote for chairman on saturday , seehofer is not entirely without controversy within his own party .
reports of an extra-marital affair last year damaged his reputation among some of the more conservative party members who see the csu as a bastion of traditional values .
hurdles ahead for seehofer the csu has not only lost both broad support from the majority of voters and faith in its leadership , but the state 's economic situation is also in grave danger after nine-figure losses at partially state-run landesbank bayern lb as a result of the international finance crisis .
" i think the rest of the country looks at bavaria with a certain schadenfreude , " political scientist juergen falter told deutsche welle .
in addition to fighting for tax cuts and inheritance tax reform , seehofer has already promised to make the crisis at the state bank first priority .
the key to seehofer 's success , said falter , is to secure his position in bavaria so that he is unchallenged in berlin .
" he 'll raise his voice in national politics , " said falter .
" he 's good at that ; that 's his territory .
i think he 'll definitely perform well at the federal level . "
seehofer said in monday 's sueddeutsche zeitung , " my work place will be in munich , but my combat strength will also stretch to berlin . "

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de environment -pipe- 27.10.2008 expert warns against putting climate fight on the back burner großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german scientists warn that water levels will increase substantially problems caused by climate change are more serious than the current financial crisis .
that warning by a leading economist came as german scientists weighed in with their own grim predictions about rising sea levels . it would be a big mistake for leaders to ignore climate change during the financial crisis , said nicholas stern , a former british treasury economist , who released a seminal report in 2006 that said inaction on emissions blamed for global warming could cause economic pain equal to the great depression .
" that 's a very important lesson , tackle risk early , " stern told a climate and carbon conference in hong kong .
there have been worries that countries will be unwilling to commit to climate change goals at an international meeting scheduled in copenhagen at the end of next year .
stern said he was optimistic that countries would agree to reduce carbon emissions by 50 percent by 2050 .
green revolution offered as solution bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : stern warns that climate change will bring economic hardship stern said that the financial crisis represents an opportunity to use public spending to boost green technologies and mass public transportation .
" the lesson that we can draw out from this recession , is that you can boost demand in the best way possible by focusing on low carbon growth in future , " stern said .
greenpeace has taken up a similar call .
governments should use the global financial crisis as an opportunity to kickstart green technologies , greenpeace and the european renewable energy council -lrb- erec -rrb- said in a " practical blueprint " presented in berlin on monday .
governments should aggressively invest in renewable power generation and energy , which could create a $ 360 billion -lrb- 285 billion euro -rrb- industry that could provide half of the world 's electricity , according to the study .
" especially in the context of today 's economic instability , investing in renewable energy technologies is a ' win-win-win ' scenario : a win for energy security , a win for the economy and a win for the climate , " the group said .
scientists warn of big rise in ocean levels bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : governments have been called on to invest in renewable energy german scientists announced monday that ocean levels will rise much more than previously thought because climate change is happening much faster than predicted .
they expect a one meter increase this century .
earlier estimates had predicted a rise of 18 to 59 centimeters .
" we now have to expect that the sea level will rise by a meter this century , " said hans joachim schellnhuber , who heads the potsdam institute for research on global warming effects .
he and jochem marotzke , a leading meteorologist , have been looking at ocean levels .
schellnhuber said it is " just barely possible " that world governments will be able to limit the rise in average global temperatures to just 2 degrees celsius by the end of the century , if they all strictly adhere to severe limits in carbon dioxide emissions . dw staff -lrb- th -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

that warning by a leading economist came as german scientists weighed in with their own grim predictions about rising sea levels . it would be a big mistake for leaders to ignore climate change during the financial crisis , said nicholas stern , a former british treasury economist , who released a seminal report in 2006 that said inaction on emissions blamed for global warming could cause economic pain equal to the great depression .
" that 's a very important lesson , tackle risk early , " stern told a climate and carbon conference in hong kong .
there have been worries that countries will be unwilling to commit to climate change goals at an international meeting scheduled in copenhagen at the end of next year .
stern said he was optimistic that countries would agree to reduce carbon emissions by 50 percent by 2050 .
green revolution offered as solution bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : stern warns that climate change will bring economic hardship stern said that the financial crisis represents an opportunity to use public spending to boost green technologies and mass public transportation .
" the lesson that we can draw out from this recession , is that you can boost demand in the best way possible by focusing on low carbon growth in future , " stern said .
greenpeace has taken up a similar call .
governments should use the global financial crisis as an opportunity to kickstart green technologies , greenpeace and the european renewable energy council -lrb- erec -rrb- said in a " practical blueprint " presented in berlin on monday .
governments should aggressively invest in renewable power generation and energy , which could create a $ 360 billion -lrb- 285 billion euro -rrb- industry that could provide half of the world 's electricity , according to the study .
" especially in the context of today 's economic instability , investing in renewable energy technologies is a ' win-win-win ' scenario : a win for energy security , a win for the economy and a win for the climate , " the group said .
scientists warn of big rise in ocean levels bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : governments have been called on to invest in renewable energy german scientists announced monday that ocean levels will rise much more than previously thought because climate change is happening much faster than predicted .
they expect a one meter increase this century .
earlier estimates had predicted a rise of 18 to 59 centimeters .
" we now have to expect that the sea level will rise by a meter this century , " said hans joachim schellnhuber , who heads the potsdam institute for research on global warming effects .
he and jochem marotzke , a leading meteorologist , have been looking at ocean levels .
schellnhuber said it is " just barely possible " that world governments will be able to limit the rise in average global temperatures to just 2 degrees celsius by the end of the century , if they all strictly adhere to severe limits in carbon dioxide emissions . dw staff -lrb- th -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

police investigating the two attacks on september 29 said the members were part of a group of extremist hindus with links to the youth wing of the nationalist bharatiya janata party -lrb- bjp -rrb- , india 's main opposition party . the surprise arrests have indicated a change of course for police , who have blamed muslim activists for a wave of bombings that have killed more than 145 people across the country since may .
ascetic on a motorcycle among those arrested is a sadhvi or woman ascetic called pragya singh , who was detained by mumbai authorities on allegations that her motorcycle was used in the attack .
police said singh , who is in her late 20s , might also have helped plan the attack .
the bomb used in the attack was placed on a motorcycle and exploded amid a crowd .
also being questioned for the malegaon and modasa bomb blasts last month is a retired army major .
the ex-army officer is said to have once headed a bjp ex-servicemen cell in mumbai .
while investigations have yet to unravel the full conspiracy police say some of those arrested have links with a hindu right wing group , ‘ hindu jagran manch ’ .
members of these groups have been accused of involvement in recent attacks on christians in the eastern state of orissa leaving more than 40 people dead .
more than 20,000 christians in the district of kandhamal fled their homes for state-run camps .
calls for a ban on extremist hindu groups , including the right wing vishwa hindu parishad or world hindu council , gained momentum among some political groups .
protests by hindu groups the arrests sparked off protests in vadodara , a city in the state of gujarat , by hindu groups who burnt effigies of neighbouring maharashtra ’ s chief minister vilas rao deshmukh warning him to release the hindu activists and not dub them as terrorists .
jagan patel , a youth leader , joined the protests .
" hindus have never indulged in such acts and will never be involved even in the future " , he said .
" we want the maharastra chief minister , vilas rao deshmukh and his home minister r. r. patil to treat hindus well or face the consequences . "
a group called the indian mujahideen claimed responsibility for some of the terror attacks across indian cities in the last few months and police arrested over 30 muslim youth believed to be part of the conspiracy .
but the law enforcement agencies have till date not come up with decisive proof concerning their involvement in terror acts .
the arrests of hindu activists are regarded by many as a major development in the police investigation . murali krishnan -lrb- new delhi -rrb- 27/10/08 send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic 9797 media center watch and listen explore new content daily in dw 's multimedia archive .

germany 's lufthansa and russian carrier s7 airlines are both contenders . lufthansa has demanded that the government government take over 500 million euros -lrb- $ 631 million -rrb- of the flag carrier 's debts of around 900 million euros .
the state " might be ready to contribute financially in order to make the sale go through , " transport minister werner faymann said .
according to media reports , lufthansa is offering only a symbolic price for the government 's 42.75 percent stake in austrian airlines , with an option of paying more once the ailing carrier has recovered , according to dpa news service .
russian carrier remains interested the german carrier was seen as the only remaining bidder for government stake , but the holding 's chief executive officer , peter michaelis , confirmed monday that s7 , russia 's leading domestic airline , was still among the suitors .
air france-klm dropped out of the bidding process last week , citing a lack of transparency of austrian airline 's part in disclosing existing cooperation contracts with lufthansa .
the government 's mandate to privatize its 42.75 percent stake in austrian airlines was scheduled to run out tuesday , october 28 .
but the process was likely to be prolonged until december 31 , the finance ministry has announced .

operating 71 airplanes , s7 's ebitda was 81.6 million euros last year .

five occupants were wounded , the defense ministry said . a spokesman said the incident occurred on a main road near the northern city of kunduz .
the troops , serving with the nato-led international security assistance force -lrb- isaf -rrb- , first fired warning shots at the minibus , the spokesman said .
when the driver continued to approach the checkpoint at high speed , the soldiers opened fire with sub-machine guns , hitting the vehicle 's engine , the spokesman said .
five men were wounded , among them two who suffered injuries serious enough to require treatment at the german base in mazar-i-sharif .
a search of the vehicle failed to turn up any arms .
the people in the minibus were civilians taking the body of a relative from kabul to the northeast province of badahkshan for burial , a local police official said .
they were in a hurry and driving at high speed when the soldiers opened fire , said abdul rahman aktash , deputy police chief of kunduz province .
latest incident comes as security deteriorates the incident happened a week after two german soldiers and five children were killed in a suicide attack near kunduz .
in august , a german soldier accidentally shot dead an afghan woman and two children at a checkpoint .
the security situation around kunduz , where most of germany 's 3,500-strong isaf contingent is based , has deteriorated in recent months .

five men were wounded , among them two who suffered injuries serious enough to require treatment at the german base in mazar-i-sharif .
a search of the vehicle failed to turn up any arms .
the people in the minibus were civilians taking the body of a relative from kabul to the northeast province of badahkshan for burial , a local police official said .

27 . however , discussions on a smoking ban in all of the member states ' workplaces are still at the preliminary stage , meaning any new rules are unlikely to be implemented before 2010 .
" clearly one of the areas which we would like to see covered -lrb- by the ban -rrb- is bars , restaurants and pubs , which are enclosed spaces where workers on a daily basis are exposed to passive smoking and to the consequences that passive smoking has on their own health and safety , " said chantal hughes , spokeswoman of eu employment commissioner vladimir spidla .
smoking bans currently differ widely across the eu .
while ireland was the first eu country to make its pubs and restaurants smoke-free , puffing cigarettes is still allowed in some pubs in germany and belgium .
and smoking is still common in both bars and restaurants in central and eastern european countries like hungary and romania .
" a number of member states have already introduced smoking bans .
however , they are very different in terms of scope and nature , " hughes said .
" we have a duty to ensure that all workplaces are safe and secure for workers .
at this stage we do not think that this is the case , which is why the commissioner would like to see a ban in all workplaces , " the spokeswoman said .
the commission plans to consult with employers and trade unions first , and does not expect the new rules to be submitted for approval to national governments before late 2009 , when the next eu executive assumes office .
however , it is " important to start the debate and get the ball rolling , " hughes said . dpa news agency -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

that warning by a leading economist came as german scientists weighed in with their own grim predictions about rising sea levels . it would be a big mistake for leaders to ignore climate change during the financial crisis , said nicholas stern , a former british treasury economist , who released a seminal report in 2006 that said inaction on emissions blamed for global warming could cause economic pain equal to the great depression .
" that 's a very important lesson , tackle risk early , " stern told a climate and carbon conference in hong kong .

but moscow favors the young democrat over the cold war veteran . john mccain 's us presidential campaign begged at the enemy 's door this week when a wayward fundraising letter reached the desk of russia 's un envoy vitaly churkin in new york asking for a donation . the russians would n't spare a ruble for the republican , and sent mccain a sardonic message saying that , unlike the united states , the russian government does " not finance political activity in foreign countries . "
us laws would have prevented them from donating had they wanted to send mccain a check . russian officials , in fact , are n't banking on either mccain or democratic candidate barack obama mending relations upturned by russia 's recent war with us-ally georgia . hoping for a fresh start but the preference among russians is reported to be in favor of obama because he represents a clean slate and will be more open to new proposals , according to konstantin kosachyov , head of the russian duma 's foreign affairs committee and a senior figure in the dominant pro-kremlin party . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : mccain 's kgb comment did n't go over well in moscow both us candidates took a harsh stance on russia in a recent debate when asked if the late us president ronald reagan 's designation of the former soviet union as the " evil empire " still applied to modern russia . mccain said " maybe " while obama , who has moved closer to his opponent 's hard-line stance since the war in georgia , said russia exhibited " evil behavior " in that conflict . nonetheless , kosachyov said this week that mccain 's anti-russian bias was deep-set while obama was a more " comfortable " choice . " mccain got his political formation during the cold war , " kosachyov told news agency interfax .
" he dedicated most of his life to the fight against communism .
it 's clear that to this day he still thrashes along that front without seeing any real difference between the soviet union and modern russia . " the kremlin has had good , even personal , ties with republican presidents .

smoking bans currently differ widely across the eu .

27 , seehofer and sabine leutheusser-schnarrenberger , the head of the free democratic party -lrb- fdp -rrb- are to ink the historic coalition agreement that ends over four decades of sole conservative rule in germany 's largest state .
the csu , the sister party to chancellor angela merkel 's christian democratic union , lost its absolute majority in state elections four weeks ago , forcing it to seek a governing partner .
the fdp won seats in the bavarian state assembly in the sept .
28 poll for the first time in 14 years and is to take over the economy and science ministries .
an fdp convention in the city of ingolstadt approved the arrangement sunday .
" it 's always hard to give something up , " said csu majority leader georg schmid , " but that 's how it is in a coalition and i think we 've reached a good consensus with each other , for example in distributing the ministries . "
the two parties plan to partly relax a strict ban on smoking in bars which was blamed by some for the csu 's loss of one third of its traditional support at the state election .
bavaria names new premier after the loss in support to just 43 per cent of ballots , the bavaria-only csu deposed both its former leader , erwin huber , and its state premier , guenther beckstein .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : rescuing bavaria 's state bank will be first on seehofer 's agenda seehofer was named csu chief at a party meeting on saturday and , on monday , is to be appointed to the position of state premier .
he relinquished his currents posts in berlin as federal minister of agriculture and minister for consumer affairs . despite receiving a 90.3 percent majority in the delegation 's vote for chairman on saturday , seehofer is not entirely without controversy within his own party .
reports of an extra-marital affair last year damaged his reputation among some of the more conservative party members who see the csu as a bastion of traditional values .
hurdles ahead for seehofer the csu has not only lost both broad support from the majority of voters and faith in its leadership , but the state 's economic situation is also in grave danger after nine-figure losses at partially state-run landesbank bayern lb as a result of the international finance crisis .
" i think the rest of the country looks at bavaria with a certain schadenfreude , " political scientist juergen falter told deutsche welle .
in addition to fighting for tax cuts and inheritance tax reform , seehofer has already promised to make the crisis at the state bank first priority .
the key to seehofer 's success , said falter , is to secure his position in bavaria so that he is unchallenged in berlin .
" he 'll raise his voice in national politics , " said falter .
" he 's good at that ; that 's his territory .
i think he 'll definitely perform well at the federal level . "
seehofer said in monday 's sueddeutsche zeitung , " my work place will be in munich , but my combat strength will also stretch to berlin . "
and if he 's to secure federal funds for bavaria 's troubled state bank , he 'll have to play his cards well in berlin . dw staff -lrb- kjb -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

27 , seehofer and sabine leutheusser-schnarrenberger , the head of the free democratic party -lrb- fdp -rrb- are to ink the historic coalition agreement that ends over four decades of sole conservative rule in germany 's largest state .
the csu , the sister party to chancellor angela merkel 's christian democratic union , lost its absolute majority in state elections four weeks ago , forcing it to seek a governing partner .
the fdp won seats in the bavarian state assembly in the sept .
28 poll for the first time in 14 years and is to take over the economy and science ministries .
an fdp convention in the city of ingolstadt approved the arrangement sunday .
" it 's always hard to give something up , " said csu majority leader georg schmid , " but that 's how it is in a coalition and i think we 've reached a good consensus with each other , for example in distributing the ministries . "
the two parties plan to partly relax a strict ban on smoking in bars which was blamed by some for the csu 's loss of one third of its traditional support at the state election .
bavaria names new premier after the loss in support to just 43 per cent of ballots , the bavaria-only csu deposed both its former leader , erwin huber , and its state premier , guenther beckstein .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : rescuing bavaria 's state bank will be first on seehofer 's agenda seehofer was named csu chief at a party meeting on saturday and , on monday , is to be appointed to the position of state premier .
he relinquished his currents posts in berlin as federal minister of agriculture and minister for consumer affairs . despite receiving a 90.3 percent majority in the delegation 's vote for chairman on saturday , seehofer is not entirely without controversy within his own party .
reports of an extra-marital affair last year damaged his reputation among some of the more conservative party members who see the csu as a bastion of traditional values .
hurdles ahead for seehofer the csu has not only lost both broad support from the majority of voters and faith in its leadership , but the state 's economic situation is also in grave danger after nine-figure losses at partially state-run landesbank bayern lb as a result of the international finance crisis .
" i think the rest of the country looks at bavaria with a certain schadenfreude , " political scientist juergen falter told deutsche welle .
in addition to fighting for tax cuts and inheritance tax reform , seehofer has already promised to make the crisis at the state bank first priority .
the key to seehofer 's success , said falter , is to secure his position in bavaria so that he is unchallenged in berlin .
" he 'll raise his voice in national politics , " said falter .
" he 's good at that ; that 's his territory .
i think he 'll definitely perform well at the federal level . "
seehofer said in monday 's sueddeutsche zeitung , " my work place will be in munich , but my combat strength will also stretch to berlin . "

president viktor yushchenko and prime minister yulia tymoshenko have been locked in a nasty fight over the president 's decision to call for new elections . the finance ministry in kyiv welcomed the imf 's support , saying it " opened a door to ukraine 's speedy cooperation with other international financial organizations . " hungary expected to set spending limits the imf , european governments and other partners are set to offer help to hungary .
while the imf did not release the size of the rescue package , analysts said it should be over $ 10 billion . hungary is vulnerable due to a large budget deficit , overvalued currency , low stock of foreign reserve and high levels of short-term foreign currency debt , afp news agency said .

germany 's lufthansa and russian carrier s7 airlines are both contenders . lufthansa has demanded that the government government take over 500 million euros -lrb- $ 631 million -rrb- of the flag carrier 's debts of around 900 million euros .
the state " might be ready to contribute financially in order to make the sale go through , " transport minister werner faymann said .
according to media reports , lufthansa is offering only a symbolic price for the government 's 42.75 percent stake in austrian airlines , with an option of paying more once the ailing carrier has recovered , according to dpa news service .
russian carrier remains interested the german carrier was seen as the only remaining bidder for government stake , but the holding 's chief executive officer , peter michaelis , confirmed monday that s7 , russia 's leading domestic airline , was still among the suitors .
air france-klm dropped out of the bidding process last week , citing a lack of transparency of austrian airline 's part in disclosing existing cooperation contracts with lufthansa .
the government 's mandate to privatize its 42.75 percent stake in austrian airlines was scheduled to run out tuesday , october 28 .
but the process was likely to be prolonged until december 31 , the finance ministry has announced .
with its fleet of 264 aircraft , lufthansa made 3.02 billion euros in earnings before interest , taxes , debt and amortization -lrb- ebitda -rrb- in 2007 .
operating 71 airplanes , s7 's ebitda was 81.6 million euros last year .
faced with high fuel costs and a decreasing numbers of passengers flying on its 99 aircraft , austrian airlines expects to end the year with a deficit of 125 million euros . dw staff -lrb- th -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

27 welcomed a ceasefire deal in somalia as nato successfully completed its first anti-piracy mission off the somali coast .
but experts questioned the current international efforts to combat piracy . eu foreign policy chief javier solana and nato secretary general jaap de hoop scheffer stressed the importance of cooperation between the two brussels-based institutions during a regular meeting of ambassadors at the alliance 's headquarters .
one area in which the two organizations are working together is in the fight against pirates operating in the gulf of aden .
while the eu 's own operations are to begin shortly , de hoop scheffer announced that nato had just completed its first anti-piracy mission by escorting a cargo ship delivering supplies to the african union mission to somalia .
an italian destroyer as well as british and greek frigates arrived in the gulf of aden last week as the front guard of nato 's anti-piracy operation allied provider .
the nato chief said nato warships would next be escorting world food program -lrb- wfp -rrb- cargos delivering food aid to the region .
" the operation is moving well , and the contacts we are having with the eu are also good , " de hoop scheffer said .
the eu has also pledged another three or four vessels by december in a bid to stem a phenomenon that is threatening world trade .
solana , for his part , welcomed a ceasefire agreement clinched over the weekend by the somali government and parts of the islamist opposition .
" this agreement is an important step forward , " solana said in a statement issued by his office in brussels .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : de hoop scheffer and solana join forces against piracy " only an inclusive political process will bring durable peace to somalia , and i call on all somalis to rally behind the transitional federal government of somalia and the alliance for the re-liberation of somalia and their endeavor to achieve this , " the statement said .
political instability has played a major role in preventing somalia from stopping gangs of pirates from seizing commercial vessels sailing off the country 's coast , prompting foreign organizations and nations to intervene .
experts doubt plausability of international efforts but despite western navies being spurred into action by the recent spate of high-profile hijackings by somali pirates , some experts argue that a handful of warships can do little to stamp out the lucrative piracy business .
but experts say a beefed up naval presence can achieve little more than escort services for food aid deliveries .
" when it comes to suppressing piracy , an extra 10 or 11 ships is still not a huge amount of naval presence for a very large area , " said roger middleton , consultant researcher for london-based think-tank chatham house in an interview with the afp news agency .
bildunterschrift : the german navy frigate emden will soon be deployed in the fight against piracy the new deployments added to the foreign ships already operating off the coast of somalia will eventually bring to between 20 and 25 the total number of warships patrolling the area 's dangerous waters by the end of the year .
according to the international maritime bureau , somali pirates have attacked more than 60 ships since the start of 2008 , hijacked almost half of them and received millions of dollars in ransom money .
the hijacking on september 25 of a ukrainian cargo loaded with battle tanks and other weaponry captured the world 's attention and may have sped up international action .
spreading piracy may overwhelm task force but pirates have expanded their activities to the eastern coast and the indian ocean and foreign warships will already have their hands full trying to secure a maritime corridor in the gulf of aden .
" if there is sufficient coordination between all these foreign actors , it can act as a deterrent but it 's definitely not the death knell of somali piracy , " middleton told afp .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : nato ships are spread thinly around the african coast western navies with modern equipment are already stretched by conflicts elsewhere in the world and experts argue the number of foreign warships tasked with patrolling somalia 's waters is unlikely to increase significantly in 2009 .
many observers argue sending ships is a band-aid approach which fails to look at the root causes of the phenomenon .
most pirate groups operate from the coast of puntland , a lawless breakaway state in northern somalia .
observers say ineffective security forces there and poverty have allowed piracy to flourish .
in the 17th century , haiti 's french governor brought hundreds of prostitutes to the famous pirate lair of tortuga in a bid to tame the island 's troublesome buccaneers .
such a move is hardly an option in modern-day somalia and france has markedly changed tactics since , being the only country so far to have used its military firepower against the pirates .
circumstances negate use of force bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the french are the only ones to engage militarily so far but that approach is reserved for those countries with strong intervention capabilities , raises awkward questions with regard to international law and is often neutralized by the risk posed to hostages .
" sending warships can only have a limited effect ... one of the best ways of combating piracy would be to stop the decline of puntland , " said stig jarle hansen , a somalia expert with the denmark-based risk intelligence group .
hansen argues that not only is there no evidence of ties between pirates and somalia 's islamist shebab organization , which has been fighting the country 's government , but the islamists were more effective than most in combating piracy .
a 2006 ethiopian invasion to oust the islamic courts union that had taken control of much of the country and support a fragile transitional government had a major impact on the surge in piracy .
" before the invasion , the shebab were probably the best pirate fighters the country has known , " said hansen , also a senior researcher with the norwegian institute for urban and regional research .
however there are signs that major foreign players could seek to address some of the root causes and are mulling a " naval peacekeeping force " that also tackles illegal fishing and waste dumping in somali waters , two issues that are often used as justifications by pirates . dpa news agency / dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

27 welcomed a ceasefire deal in somalia as nato successfully completed its first anti-piracy mission off the somali coast .
but experts questioned the current international efforts to combat piracy . eu foreign policy chief javier solana and nato secretary general jaap de hoop scheffer stressed the importance of cooperation between the two brussels-based institutions during a regular meeting of ambassadors at the alliance 's headquarters .
one area in which the two organizations are working together is in the fight against pirates operating in the gulf of aden .
while the eu 's own operations are to begin shortly , de hoop scheffer announced that nato had just completed its first anti-piracy mission by escorting a cargo ship delivering supplies to the african union mission to somalia .
an italian destroyer as well as british and greek frigates arrived in the gulf of aden last week as the front guard of nato 's anti-piracy operation allied provider .
the nato chief said nato warships would next be escorting world food program -lrb- wfp -rrb- cargos delivering food aid to the region .
" the operation is moving well , and the contacts we are having with the eu are also good , " de hoop scheffer said .
the eu has also pledged another three or four vessels by december in a bid to stem a phenomenon that is threatening world trade .
solana , for his part , welcomed a ceasefire agreement clinched over the weekend by the somali government and parts of the islamist opposition .
" this agreement is an important step forward , " solana said in a statement issued by his office in brussels .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : de hoop scheffer and solana join forces against piracy " only an inclusive political process will bring durable peace to somalia , and i call on all somalis to rally behind the transitional federal government of somalia and the alliance for the re-liberation of somalia and their endeavor to achieve this , " the statement said .
political instability has played a major role in preventing somalia from stopping gangs of pirates from seizing commercial vessels sailing off the country 's coast , prompting foreign organizations and nations to intervene .
experts doubt plausability of international efforts but despite western navies being spurred into action by the recent spate of high-profile hijackings by somali pirates , some experts argue that a handful of warships can do little to stamp out the lucrative piracy business .
but experts say a beefed up naval presence can achieve little more than escort services for food aid deliveries .
" when it comes to suppressing piracy , an extra 10 or 11 ships is still not a huge amount of naval presence for a very large area , " said roger middleton , consultant researcher for london-based think-tank chatham house in an interview with the afp news agency .
bildunterschrift : the german navy frigate emden will soon be deployed in the fight against piracy the new deployments added to the foreign ships already operating off the coast of somalia will eventually bring to between 20 and 25 the total number of warships patrolling the area 's dangerous waters by the end of the year .
according to the international maritime bureau , somali pirates have attacked more than 60 ships since the start of 2008 , hijacked almost half of them and received millions of dollars in ransom money .
the hijacking on september 25 of a ukrainian cargo loaded with battle tanks and other weaponry captured the world 's attention and may have sped up international action .
spreading piracy may overwhelm task force but pirates have expanded their activities to the eastern coast and the indian ocean and foreign warships will already have their hands full trying to secure a maritime corridor in the gulf of aden .
" if there is sufficient coordination between all these foreign actors , it can act as a deterrent but it 's definitely not the death knell of somali piracy , " middleton told afp .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : nato ships are spread thinly around the african coast western navies with modern equipment are already stretched by conflicts elsewhere in the world and experts argue the number of foreign warships tasked with patrolling somalia 's waters is unlikely to increase significantly in 2009 .
many observers argue sending ships is a band-aid approach which fails to look at the root causes of the phenomenon .
most pirate groups operate from the coast of puntland , a lawless breakaway state in northern somalia .
observers say ineffective security forces there and poverty have allowed piracy to flourish .
in the 17th century , haiti 's french governor brought hundreds of prostitutes to the famous pirate lair of tortuga in a bid to tame the island 's troublesome buccaneers .
such a move is hardly an option in modern-day somalia and france has markedly changed tactics since , being the only country so far to have used its military firepower against the pirates .
circumstances negate use of force bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the french are the only ones to engage militarily so far but that approach is reserved for those countries with strong intervention capabilities , raises awkward questions with regard to international law and is often neutralized by the risk posed to hostages .
" sending warships can only have a limited effect ... one of the best ways of combating piracy would be to stop the decline of puntland , " said stig jarle hansen , a somalia expert with the denmark-based risk intelligence group .
hansen argues that not only is there no evidence of ties between pirates and somalia 's islamist shebab organization , which has been fighting the country 's government , but the islamists were more effective than most in combating piracy .
a 2006 ethiopian invasion to oust the islamic courts union that had taken control of much of the country and support a fragile transitional government had a major impact on the surge in piracy .
" before the invasion , the shebab were probably the best pirate fighters the country has known , " said hansen , also a senior researcher with the norwegian institute for urban and regional research .
however there are signs that major foreign players could seek to address some of the root causes and are mulling a " naval peacekeeping force " that also tackles illegal fishing and waste dumping in somali waters , two issues that are often used as justifications by pirates . dpa news agency / dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

could they be heading for the title ?
team members say they 're just enjoying the ride . hoffenheim have shown that they are no fluke .
on sunday , the newcomers from a small town in southern germany crushed hamburg 3-0 .
the team destroyed hamburg with fast counter attacks that has become their trademark in their debut season in the bundesliga .
if they can keep up the pace , hoffenheim have the chance of being serious title contenders .
" let 's wait and see where it all ends .
we are having fun and are hungry , " defender andreas beck said after the hamburg game .
hoffenheim 's coach also said he did n't want his team to be distracted by its recent success .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hamburg simply could not keep up " should i be dancing on the tables ? " coach ralf rangnick asked reporters after the sunday win .
" the danger right now is that we start making mistakes . "
german soccer fans have been awed by the club 's rise .
the team plays arguably the most fun football in the country with a bunch of players who were virtually unknown before the season began .
an online poll of the mass circulation paper bild said on monday that 61 percent of some 16,000 voters believed that rangnick 's team was good enough for the title .
impressive start hoffenheim 's vedad ibisevic is the bundesliga top scorer with 10 goals .
demba ba or chinedu obasi have also been big scorers for the team .
rangnick 's successful formula of attacking football is helped by the fact , in his opinion , that " the players have been together for more than a year and know each other . "
hoffenheim have put in the best performance of a promoted team at this stage of the season since bayern munich joined the league in 1965-66 , featuring young players named franz beckenbauer and gerd mueller .
munich staged for a comeback bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : rangnick said he wants his players to stay focused munich chairman karl-heinz rummenigge expressed his " respect " for hoffenheim 's showings but is even more pleased that his team appears to have overcome a slump of three winless games with back-to-back victories .
munich have climbed into fourth place with 15 points , four behind hoffenheim , as they travel to eintracht frankfurt , who are upbeat as well after two wins , their first of the season .
but munich general manager uli hoeness is convinced " that we will be in the top three " if munich win in frankfurt and on saturday against bielefeld .
elsewhere , second-placed bayer leverkusen -lrb- 18 points -rrb- visit mid-table werder bremen on tuesday .
the day 's other games are vfl wolfsburg vs borussia moenchengladbach , sc karlsruhe vs schalke 04 and bielefeld vs bottom club energie cottbus .
in other action wednesday , hertha berlin meet hanover 96 , cologne play dortmund and the former leaders hamburg -lrb- third on 17 points -rrb- must reverse the latest negative trend when they host stuttgart .
" we will learn from this defeat , " vowed hamburg coach martin jol after the debacle in hoffenheim .

germany 's lufthansa and russian carrier s7 airlines are both contenders . lufthansa has demanded that the government government take over 500 million euros -lrb- $ 631 million -rrb- of the flag carrier 's debts of around 900 million euros .
the state " might be ready to contribute financially in order to make the sale go through , " transport minister werner faymann said .
according to media reports , lufthansa is offering only a symbolic price for the government 's 42.75 percent stake in austrian airlines , with an option of paying more once the ailing carrier has recovered , according to dpa news service .
russian carrier remains interested the german carrier was seen as the only remaining bidder for government stake , but the holding 's chief executive officer , peter michaelis , confirmed monday that s7 , russia 's leading domestic airline , was still among the suitors .
air france-klm dropped out of the bidding process last week , citing a lack of transparency of austrian airline 's part in disclosing existing cooperation contracts with lufthansa .
the government 's mandate to privatize its 42.75 percent stake in austrian airlines was scheduled to run out tuesday , october 28 .
but the process was likely to be prolonged until december 31 , the finance ministry has announced .
with its fleet of 264 aircraft , lufthansa made 3.02 billion euros in earnings before interest , taxes , debt and amortization -lrb- ebitda -rrb- in 2007 .
operating 71 airplanes , s7 's ebitda was 81.6 million euros last year .
faced with high fuel costs and a decreasing numbers of passengers flying on its 99 aircraft , austrian airlines expects to end the year with a deficit of 125 million euros . dw staff -lrb- th -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

27 welcomed a ceasefire deal in somalia as nato successfully completed its first anti-piracy mission off the somali coast .
but experts questioned the current international efforts to combat piracy . eu foreign policy chief javier solana and nato secretary general jaap de hoop scheffer stressed the importance of cooperation between the two brussels-based institutions during a regular meeting of ambassadors at the alliance 's headquarters .
one area in which the two organizations are working together is in the fight against pirates operating in the gulf of aden .
while the eu 's own operations are to begin shortly , de hoop scheffer announced that nato had just completed its first anti-piracy mission by escorting a cargo ship delivering supplies to the african union mission to somalia .
an italian destroyer as well as british and greek frigates arrived in the gulf of aden last week as the front guard of nato 's anti-piracy operation allied provider .
the nato chief said nato warships would next be escorting world food program -lrb- wfp -rrb- cargos delivering food aid to the region .
" the operation is moving well , and the contacts we are having with the eu are also good , " de hoop scheffer said .
the eu has also pledged another three or four vessels by december in a bid to stem a phenomenon that is threatening world trade .
solana , for his part , welcomed a ceasefire agreement clinched over the weekend by the somali government and parts of the islamist opposition .
" this agreement is an important step forward , " solana said in a statement issued by his office in brussels .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : de hoop scheffer and solana join forces against piracy " only an inclusive political process will bring durable peace to somalia , and i call on all somalis to rally behind the transitional federal government of somalia and the alliance for the re-liberation of somalia and their endeavor to achieve this , " the statement said .
political instability has played a major role in preventing somalia from stopping gangs of pirates from seizing commercial vessels sailing off the country 's coast , prompting foreign organizations and nations to intervene .
experts doubt plausability of international efforts but despite western navies being spurred into action by the recent spate of high-profile hijackings by somali pirates , some experts argue that a handful of warships can do little to stamp out the lucrative piracy business .
but experts say a beefed up naval presence can achieve little more than escort services for food aid deliveries .
" when it comes to suppressing piracy , an extra 10 or 11 ships is still not a huge amount of naval presence for a very large area , " said roger middleton , consultant researcher for london-based think-tank chatham house in an interview with the afp news agency .
bildunterschrift : the german navy frigate emden will soon be deployed in the fight against piracy the new deployments added to the foreign ships already operating off the coast of somalia will eventually bring to between 20 and 25 the total number of warships patrolling the area 's dangerous waters by the end of the year .
according to the international maritime bureau , somali pirates have attacked more than 60 ships since the start of 2008 , hijacked almost half of them and received millions of dollars in ransom money .
the hijacking on september 25 of a ukrainian cargo loaded with battle tanks and other weaponry captured the world 's attention and may have sped up international action .
spreading piracy may overwhelm task force but pirates have expanded their activities to the eastern coast and the indian ocean and foreign warships will already have their hands full trying to secure a maritime corridor in the gulf of aden .
" if there is sufficient coordination between all these foreign actors , it can act as a deterrent but it 's definitely not the death knell of somali piracy , " middleton told afp .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : nato ships are spread thinly around the african coast western navies with modern equipment are already stretched by conflicts elsewhere in the world and experts argue the number of foreign warships tasked with patrolling somalia 's waters is unlikely to increase significantly in 2009 .
many observers argue sending ships is a band-aid approach which fails to look at the root causes of the phenomenon .
most pirate groups operate from the coast of puntland , a lawless breakaway state in northern somalia .
observers say ineffective security forces there and poverty have allowed piracy to flourish .
in the 17th century , haiti 's french governor brought hundreds of prostitutes to the famous pirate lair of tortuga in a bid to tame the island 's troublesome buccaneers .
such a move is hardly an option in modern-day somalia and france has markedly changed tactics since , being the only country so far to have used its military firepower against the pirates .
circumstances negate use of force bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the french are the only ones to engage militarily so far but that approach is reserved for those countries with strong intervention capabilities , raises awkward questions with regard to international law and is often neutralized by the risk posed to hostages .
" sending warships can only have a limited effect ... one of the best ways of combating piracy would be to stop the decline of puntland , " said stig jarle hansen , a somalia expert with the denmark-based risk intelligence group .
hansen argues that not only is there no evidence of ties between pirates and somalia 's islamist shebab organization , which has been fighting the country 's government , but the islamists were more effective than most in combating piracy .
a 2006 ethiopian invasion to oust the islamic courts union that had taken control of much of the country and support a fragile transitional government had a major impact on the surge in piracy .
" before the invasion , the shebab were probably the best pirate fighters the country has known , " said hansen , also a senior researcher with the norwegian institute for urban and regional research .
however there are signs that major foreign players could seek to address some of the root causes and are mulling a " naval peacekeeping force " that also tackles illegal fishing and waste dumping in somali waters , two issues that are often used as justifications by pirates . dpa news agency / dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

27 . however , discussions on a smoking ban in all of the member states ' workplaces are still at the preliminary stage , meaning any new rules are unlikely to be implemented before 2010 .
" clearly one of the areas which we would like to see covered -lrb- by the ban -rrb- is bars , restaurants and pubs , which are enclosed spaces where workers on a daily basis are exposed to passive smoking and to the consequences that passive smoking has on their own health and safety , " said chantal hughes , spokeswoman of eu employment commissioner vladimir spidla .
smoking bans currently differ widely across the eu .
while ireland was the first eu country to make its pubs and restaurants smoke-free , puffing cigarettes is still allowed in some pubs in germany and belgium .
and smoking is still common in both bars and restaurants in central and eastern european countries like hungary and romania .
" a number of member states have already introduced smoking bans .
however , they are very different in terms of scope and nature , " hughes said .
" we have a duty to ensure that all workplaces are safe and secure for workers .
at this stage we do not think that this is the case , which is why the commissioner would like to see a ban in all workplaces , " the spokeswoman said .
the commission plans to consult with employers and trade unions first , and does not expect the new rules to be submitted for approval to national governments before late 2009 , when the next eu executive assumes office .
however , it is " important to start the debate and get the ball rolling , " hughes said . dpa news agency -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

chicago police investigating the killing of her mother and brother have been searching the area where they lived with seven-year-old julian .
his mother julia , the actress 's sister , found the bodies at the family home .
julia 's husband - the boy 's stepfather - has been in custody since shortly after the killings .
darnell donerson , 57 , and jason hudson , 29 , were both found shot dead on friday when julia returned from work .
a state-wide alert has been called in illinois for the missing little boy .
mourners have been stopping by the hudson home , many laying teddy bears and messages along the chain link fence around the property .
" we love you , " one message read .
another said : " we 'll find the people who did this . "
hunt for clues news of the reward came in a statement released by hudson 's publicist , lisa kasteler , on sunday evening .
jennifer hudson won an oscar for her role in dreamgirls in 2006 " jennifer and her family appreciate the enormous amount of love , support and prayers they have received while she and her family try to cope with this tragedy and continue the search for julian , " the statement said .
julia hudson 's son , whose full name is julian king , is believed to have been in the house with his grandmother and uncle before the shooting .
deputy police chief joseph patterson said ms donerson 's body had been found on the living-room floor of her home in the south side of chicago .
jason hudson 's body was discovered in the bedroom .
investigators say there did not appear to be any sign of forced entry .

police transferred him back to the idc on sunday " based on his active parole violation unrelated to this investigation " , monique bond said .
jennifer hudson , 27 , a singer-turned-actress who found fame on american idol in 2005 , won an oscar for best supporting actress in the hit-film dreamgirls in 2006 and starred in the film sex and the city .

the midlands bore the brunt of the cuts with scores of lines and hundreds of stations closing down .
miles and miles of track fell into disuse across the midlands its rail network shrank dramatically when beeching 's report the reshaping of british railways was published in 1963 .
leslie oppitz , author of the lost railways series of books said : " it was an awful shock to people working on the railways because thousands of jobs were lost along with lost tracks and stations and people were marooned in a sense . "
richard jones , who used to work on the railways in the shropshire town of oswestry , said the beeching axe was a bitter blow .
he said : " the railway had been a major employer and when it finished people had to go away to work . "
brian rowe also lost his job in the town .
too many lines he said : " when they closed the lines we were absolutely isolated and the town really suffered . "
but 45 years after beeching some routes that closed have been reopened .
carriages have been converted into holiday apartments in coalport trains are running again on the line from walsall to rugeley and midland metro trams run on the old track bed between birmingham and wolverhampton .
the railways are now carrying ever-increasing numbers of passengers and rail experts maintain that beeching cut too many lines .
nick higton , of consultancy firm arup , said : " the thing about beeching that was indefensible was not only did he shut the lines but the government then allowed the routes of those lines to be ripped up and now when we want to put some of them back it 's impossible . "
some lines have found new uses .
' more expensive ' south of stratford-upon-avon , in warwickshire , one route now forms part of the national cycle network .
at the disused railway station at coalport , shropshire , trains have returned although the new carriages have been converted into luxury holiday apartments .
in stratford-upon-avon cyclists now use the old railway route the beeching era is still remembered by many including former midlands mp , now labour peer lord snape .
he agrees that the cuts were too severe .
he said : " the fact that he -lrb- beeching -rrb- was wrong is amply illustrated by the fact that we 're trying to restore some of those lines even now although it 's proving to be a lot more expensive to put them back than it was to take them out in the first place . "
the good news is that in the future the rail network could expand if high-speed lines are built .
although it will not mean a return to the steam days it will certainly help to bring back the convenience of travelling by rail that was lost after the beeching cuts .

the midlands bore the brunt of the cuts with scores of lines and hundreds of stations closing down .
miles and miles of track fell into disuse across the midlands its rail network shrank dramatically when beeching 's report the reshaping of british railways was published in 1963 .
leslie oppitz , author of the lost railways series of books said : " it was an awful shock to people working on the railways because thousands of jobs were lost along with lost tracks and stations and people were marooned in a sense . "
richard jones , who used to work on the railways in the shropshire town of oswestry , said the beeching axe was a bitter blow .
he said : " the railway had been a major employer and when it finished people had to go away to work . "
brian rowe also lost his job in the town .
too many lines he said : " when they closed the lines we were absolutely isolated and the town really suffered . "
but 45 years after beeching some routes that closed have been reopened .
carriages have been converted into holiday apartments in coalport trains are running again on the line from walsall to rugeley and midland metro trams run on the old track bed between birmingham and wolverhampton .
the railways are now carrying ever-increasing numbers of passengers and rail experts maintain that beeching cut too many lines .
nick higton , of consultancy firm arup , said : " the thing about beeching that was indefensible was not only did he shut the lines but the government then allowed the routes of those lines to be ripped up and now when we want to put some of them back it 's impossible . "
some lines have found new uses .
' more expensive ' south of stratford-upon-avon , in warwickshire , one route now forms part of the national cycle network .
at the disused railway station at coalport , shropshire , trains have returned although the new carriages have been converted into luxury holiday apartments .
in stratford-upon-avon cyclists now use the old railway route the beeching era is still remembered by many including former midlands mp , now labour peer lord snape .
he agrees that the cuts were too severe .
he said : " the fact that he -lrb- beeching -rrb- was wrong is amply illustrated by the fact that we 're trying to restore some of those lines even now although it 's proving to be a lot more expensive to put them back than it was to take them out in the first place . "
the good news is that in the future the rail network could expand if high-speed lines are built .
although it will not mean a return to the steam days it will certainly help to bring back the convenience of travelling by rail that was lost after the beeching cuts .

a television documentary reports that those who died were among 400 afghan asylum-seekers denied entry to australia by the former government .
their fate was examined by a social research group , the edmund rice centre , which says it has proof of nine deaths .
the policy under which the afghans were returned home has since been dropped .
the previous howard government 's so-called pacific solution policy detained people with asylum claims on islands in the pacific , preventing them from setting foot on australian soil .
incoming prime minister kevin rudd cancelled the pacific solution and the forced returns policy .
deaths reported the deaths were brought to light by a television documentary due to air on the sbs channel later this month .
about 400 afghans detained at the australian detention centre on the pacific island of nauru were returned to their homeland , having had their asylum claims rejected .
according to many in their own accounts , they were assured by australian immigration officials that it was safe for them to return home , and told that they would be held in detention for the rest of their lives if they failed to do so .
but an investigation by the social justice group , the edmund rice centre , has found that some were killed by the taleban .
it documented the deaths of nine of the failed asylum seekers at the hands of the taleban and believes the true figure is actually closer to 20 .
the investigation also found that many afghans who were returned home are hiding in pakistan , or were forced to move between there and afghanistan in order to evade capture .
they include an afghan man whose daughters were killed in an attack on his home near kabul , after his bid for asylum was rejected by australia in 2002 .
controversial policy the director of the edmund rice centre , phil glendenning , has said that much of the information used to locate returned asylum seekers had come from sympathetic immigration officials , angry about the controversial asylum policies of the howard government , which introduced the pacific solution .
the new immigration minister , chris evans , has asked his department to look into the claims .
meanwhile , his predecessor phillip ruddock said that " mistakes were possible , " but added that australia 's asylum system was " robust and credible " .
he said that the united nations refugee convention did not prevent asylum seekers from being returned to dangerous places .

a television documentary reports that those who died were among 400 afghan asylum-seekers denied entry to australia by the former government .
their fate was examined by a social research group , the edmund rice centre , which says it has proof of nine deaths .
the policy under which the afghans were returned home has since been dropped .
the previous howard government 's so-called pacific solution policy detained people with asylum claims on islands in the pacific , preventing them from setting foot on australian soil .
incoming prime minister kevin rudd cancelled the pacific solution and the forced returns policy .
deaths reported the deaths were brought to light by a television documentary due to air on the sbs channel later this month .
about 400 afghans detained at the australian detention centre on the pacific island of nauru were returned to their homeland , having had their asylum claims rejected .
according to many in their own accounts , they were assured by australian immigration officials that it was safe for them to return home , and told that they would be held in detention for the rest of their lives if they failed to do so .
but an investigation by the social justice group , the edmund rice centre , has found that some were killed by the taleban .
it documented the deaths of nine of the failed asylum seekers at the hands of the taleban and believes the true figure is actually closer to 20 .
the investigation also found that many afghans who were returned home are hiding in pakistan , or were forced to move between there and afghanistan in order to evade capture .
they include an afghan man whose daughters were killed in an attack on his home near kabul , after his bid for asylum was rejected by australia in 2002 .
controversial policy the director of the edmund rice centre , phil glendenning , has said that much of the information used to locate returned asylum seekers had come from sympathetic immigration officials , angry about the controversial asylum policies of the howard government , which introduced the pacific solution .
the new immigration minister , chris evans , has asked his department to look into the claims .
meanwhile , his predecessor phillip ruddock said that " mistakes were possible , " but added that australia 's asylum system was " robust and credible " .
he said that the united nations refugee convention did not prevent asylum seekers from being returned to dangerous places .

advertisement no need to ' die of embarrassment ' a programme aimed at cutting deaths from bowel cancer in wales is starting with a plea to men to overcome any embarrassment and check their health .
people aged 60-69 are being sent home screening test kits , and organisers say it is the first scheme to cover men as well as women .
they aim to cut deaths by 15 % , but they say they need men to get involved .
programme head hilary fielder said : " to make bowel screening a success , we need to break through the embarrassment . "
by 2015 the screening programme will cover everyone from the ages of 50 to 74 .
while bowel cancer remains the third biggest killer disease in wales , 90 % of cases caught early are treatable .
just doing a simple thing in the privacy of your bathroom for three mornings is not a big deal clinical oncologist dr tim maughan dr fielder , director of bowel screening wales , said : " we know that men often find it difficult to take care of their health .
" some find the subject , and bowel cancer in particular , embarrassing . "
it is for that reason the screening programme will rely on testing kits which can be used in the privacy of the home .
a new laboratory and testing system has been set up by the velindre nhs trust to deal with the screening kits , which will be returned by post .
if the tests reveal any abnormal results , patients can then be offered further medical investigations .
public health problem " bowel cancer is the third biggest killer of men and women in wales , " added dr fielder .
" screening aims to detect bowel cancer at an early stage in people with no symptoms .
this is when treatment is more likely to be effective . "
the scheme is set to be extended after two years to people aged up to 74 , and after seven years it is hoped it will cover everyone living in wales from the ages of 50 to 74 .
dr tim maughan , consultant clinical oncologist at velindre hospital in cardiff , said : " it affects 2,000 people every year in wales and 1,000 of those people die so it 's a really big public health problem .
" the tests , which are a test on the faeces where you take a tiny sample one a day for three days , will save 160 lives .
that 's the prediction from the data we have , so it 's going to be a really big change .
show on the road " just doing a simple thing in the privacy of your bathroom for three mornings is not a big deal .
" please do what you 're asked - take your samples , send it back .
let 's get this show on the road . "
offering the tests every two years to those age groups is expected to cost nearly £ 9m a year by 2015 .
health minister edwina hart said the new programme would build on the success of two current cancer screening schemes in wales , for breast and cervical cancer .
" the risk of developing bowel cancer increases with age , which is why the initial roll-out of the programme is focusing on the age group most at risk , " she said .
" this new service is expected to reduce mortality from bowel cancer by 15 % in the screened population . "
