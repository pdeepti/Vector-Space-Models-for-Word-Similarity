former us senator sam nunn spoke with deutsche welle about the foreign policy of both presidential candidates .
he also called on the us to decrease its nuclear arsenal and increase its support for the united nations . sam nunn , a former democratic senator , is often tipped for a leadership post should barack obama be elected president of the united states .
nunn , 59 , honed his foreign and military policy expertise as the chair of the senate armed services committee .
since leaving office in 1997 , he has devoted himself to working to reduce the threat from nuclear weapons and currently serves as the ceo of the nuclear threat initiative -lrb- nti -rrb- .
nunn was recently in berlin , where he spoke with deutsche welle .
you have said that germany can play an important role in bringing the united states , nato and russia closer to each other .
what specific measures could this involve ?
first , i think we have to decide and russia has to decide whether we want russia to be part of the europe-atlantic security arc .
if so , then we and russia need to start sitting down and talking about those issues : finding out what their problems are with security , trying to address those problems , giving each other reassurance , having military to military meetings .
now the nato-russian council was set up for that purpose .
it worked for awhile , but it clearly is n't working anymore .
winston churchill once said : " no matter how beautiful your strategy at some point you need to look at the results . "
the results are the trajectory of nato-russia relationships – whether it 's in energy security or overall security or missile defense – is not heading in a very constructive direction .
what role can germany play in improving these ties and negotiations ?
that 's something that germany will have to decide that for itself .
i can only say that these are difficult questions and i believe the german people and the german government – with their close relationship with the united states , their leadership in nato and the european community , their friendship with both eastern europe and russia – that they are in a unique position to begin stimulating both sides to ask these questions and begin to answer them .
i do n't have all the answers but i think i do know what some of the questions are .
how would the foreign policy of an obama 's presidency differ from that of the current us administration ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : nunn would like to see the us reduce its nuclear weapons arsenal i believe both obama and mccain would both move in different directions than this administration .
i 'm very confident on the obama side that he would listen to people in europe , i 'm certain that mccain would do likewise .
i believe both of them would try a more multilateral approach .
i believe obama would reach out and look for new directions of partnership between the united states and europe and i hope also with russia and with other people around the globe .
you have brought up the argument regarding nuclear weapons that it 's hard to convince others to quit smoking when you 're a chain smoker yourself .
does the us need to reduce its nuclear arsenal ?
i think we 've got far too many nuclear weapons .
i think the russians have far too many nuclear weapons .
i think all the nuclear powers need to look at how many they need .
but i also think it 's important to look at the operational status of those weapons .
this means the way you posture your nuclear weapons , whether they 're on quick alert , how rapidly they can be fired , the warning time , the decision time on both sides .
all of that is enormously important and just as important as the numbers .
so what i would like to see is military-to-military , civilian-to-civilian top-level discussions on how we can give each other more warning time .
the president of russia or the president of the united states would have more than a few minutes to decide whether to fire the weapons if they get a warning , which could be a false warning .
i do n't think anybody expects a first strike .
we 've moved away from confrontation .
there 's no more warsaw pact , no more soviet union , no more massive tank armies .
but we have not taken that into account in a significant way in the operational status of our forces .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : iran is watching closely how other countries deal with the nuclear issue if we really are serious about trying to keep countries like iran , north korea and others from acquiring nuclear weapons , then we ought to de-emphasize their importance .
we ought to make it clear to the world that we are not relying on those nuclear weapons for first strike unless we are struck ourselves with nuclear weapons .
as long as we , russia and other nuclear powers give nuclear weapons great prestige and we act as if they are essential for our own defense , it 's enormously difficult to try and convince other countries not to acquire these weapons .
and that 's where we are right now .
does this need for better cooperation between countries mean that the united states should become more involved in the united nations ?
on the nuclear side , certainly we ought to be more involved and we ought to get more behind iaea , the international atomic energy agency , that 's the official arm of the un in dealing with these questions .
this enormously important organization won the noble peace prize two years ago .
they are going to be increasingly important .
they need more funds , they need more help , they need more support .
it 's not just the united states , it 's our friends , germany and others , that need to understand that the iaea is being given a job without sufficient resources today .
so yes , we need to be more supportive in that regard . interview : jan m. schaefer -lrb- th -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

former us senator sam nunn spoke with deutsche welle about the foreign policy of both presidential candidates .
he also called on the us to decrease its nuclear arsenal and increase its support for the united nations . sam nunn , a former democratic senator , is often tipped for a leadership post should barack obama be elected president of the united states .
nunn , 59 , honed his foreign and military policy expertise as the chair of the senate armed services committee .
since leaving office in 1997 , he has devoted himself to working to reduce the threat from nuclear weapons and currently serves as the ceo of the nuclear threat initiative -lrb- nti -rrb- .
nunn was recently in berlin , where he spoke with deutsche welle .
you have said that germany can play an important role in bringing the united states , nato and russia closer to each other .
what specific measures could this involve ?
first , i think we have to decide and russia has to decide whether we want russia to be part of the europe-atlantic security arc .
if so , then we and russia need to start sitting down and talking about those issues : finding out what their problems are with security , trying to address those problems , giving each other reassurance , having military to military meetings .
now the nato-russian council was set up for that purpose .
it worked for awhile , but it clearly is n't working anymore .
winston churchill once said : " no matter how beautiful your strategy at some point you need to look at the results . "
the results are the trajectory of nato-russia relationships – whether it 's in energy security or overall security or missile defense – is not heading in a very constructive direction .
what role can germany play in improving these ties and negotiations ?
that 's something that germany will have to decide that for itself .
i can only say that these are difficult questions and i believe the german people and the german government – with their close relationship with the united states , their leadership in nato and the european community , their friendship with both eastern europe and russia – that they are in a unique position to begin stimulating both sides to ask these questions and begin to answer them .
i do n't have all the answers but i think i do know what some of the questions are .
how would the foreign policy of an obama 's presidency differ from that of the current us administration ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : nunn would like to see the us reduce its nuclear weapons arsenal i believe both obama and mccain would both move in different directions than this administration .
i 'm very confident on the obama side that he would listen to people in europe , i 'm certain that mccain would do likewise .
i believe both of them would try a more multilateral approach .
i believe obama would reach out and look for new directions of partnership between the united states and europe and i hope also with russia and with other people around the globe .
you have brought up the argument regarding nuclear weapons that it 's hard to convince others to quit smoking when you 're a chain smoker yourself .
does the us need to reduce its nuclear arsenal ?
i think we 've got far too many nuclear weapons .
i think the russians have far too many nuclear weapons .
i think all the nuclear powers need to look at how many they need .
but i also think it 's important to look at the operational status of those weapons .
this means the way you posture your nuclear weapons , whether they 're on quick alert , how rapidly they can be fired , the warning time , the decision time on both sides .
all of that is enormously important and just as important as the numbers .
so what i would like to see is military-to-military , civilian-to-civilian top-level discussions on how we can give each other more warning time .
the president of russia or the president of the united states would have more than a few minutes to decide whether to fire the weapons if they get a warning , which could be a false warning .
i do n't think anybody expects a first strike .
we 've moved away from confrontation .
there 's no more warsaw pact , no more soviet union , no more massive tank armies .
but we have not taken that into account in a significant way in the operational status of our forces .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : iran is watching closely how other countries deal with the nuclear issue if we really are serious about trying to keep countries like iran , north korea and others from acquiring nuclear weapons , then we ought to de-emphasize their importance .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de euro 2008 -pipe- 17.06.2008 loew under fire after germany disappoint in euro 2008 großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : loew , r , and his austrian counterpart were banned form the touchline after losing to croatia , coach joachim loew promised that fans would see a different germany against austria .
but what they got was more of the same against a weaker opponent .
now some are turning on yogi . euro 2008 was supposed to be the tournament where the new german brand of power soccer , pioneered by loew and his predecessor juergen klinsmann , resulted in some silverware .
instead , the co-favorites struggled to survive a first-round group that was among the weakest ever in the competition .
germany 's 1-0 win against austria came against a side whose main striker played most of his matches this season for werder bremen 's amateurs - in the bundesliga 's third division .
nonetheless , germany needed a 120 km / h -lrb- 74.5 mph -rrb- free kick from michael ballack to best their much smaller southern neighbors .
after the match , many credited ballack with saving yogi 's hide .
bildunterschrift : one moment of ballack brilliance made up for a dismal performance " the captain personally spared the team and above all the team management the unpleasant discussions that would have followed germany potentially exiting the tournament in vienna , " wrote the on-line version of the frankfurter allgemeine zeitung newspaper .
" ballack was loew 's savior . "
empty words ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : mario gomez and the rest of germany 's attack have been weak after germany 's shock loss to croatia on june 12 , germany 's governing soccer body , the dfb , was quick to assure the press that loew would retain his job , even if the team were to crash out of euro 2008 .
but few people put much stock in those assurances , and some experts are beginning to question the coach , who was sent to grandstands , together with his austrian counterpart , for complaining about the officiating .
" it fit the quality of the match that it was game over after 40 minutes for the two men responsible for the teams ' strategy and style , " wrote the daily tagesspiegel newspaper .
bloggers have been even harsher .
" you ca n't play more horridly , " wrote one disappointed german fan on a soccer discussion forum .
" but i though it was even worse how loew sat in the stands , relaxed and chewing gum , as though he were on vacation . "
the catch-22 is that poor performances undermine a coach 's credibility with his players , and some pundits are already questioning whether klinsmann 's former assistant has the necessary authority within the team .
" it was difficult to see a shortcoming in having assistant coach hans-dieter flick take over in the second half , " wrote the tagespiegel .
" the way the germans were playing , it did n't seem like they were open to any sort of instructions anyway . "
do or die against portugal bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : loew has also been criticized for sticking with lehmann loew probably does n't need a win against quarterfinal opponents portugal , now one of the tournament favorites , in order to keep his job .
but both fans and the dfb higher-ups will want to see a return to the fluid , short-passing game germany played against their first euro 2008 foes poland .
" loew won his most important game thus far and will be allowed to continue modernizing the national squad , " wrote the financial times germany .
" they 're in bitter need of it . "
and some hope that germany 's underdog status going into that match will remove the pressure that may have kept the team from playing its best in the group stage .
" as ballack himself said with a bit of relief , germany is a clear outsider against portugal , and maybe that was loew 's plan , " wrote the berliner zeitung newspaper .
" if so , it was a stroke of genius . "
but should germany maintain their lethargic form and get thrashed by cristiano ronaldo and co . , no one will be calling loew a genius .
instead , job guarantee or not , many will call for his head . jefferson chase send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

you have brought up the argument regarding nuclear weapons that it 's hard to convince others to quit smoking when you 're a chain smoker yourself .
does the us need to reduce its nuclear arsenal ?
i think we 've got far too many nuclear weapons .
i think the russians have far too many nuclear weapons .
i think all the nuclear powers need to look at how many they need .
but i also think it 's important to look at the operational status of those weapons .
this means the way you posture your nuclear weapons , whether they 're on quick alert , how rapidly they can be fired , the warning time , the decision time on both sides .
all of that is enormously important and just as important as the numbers .
so what i would like to see is military-to-military , civilian-to-civilian top-level discussions on how we can give each other more warning time .
the president of russia or the president of the united states would have more than a few minutes to decide whether to fire the weapons if they get a warning , which could be a false warning .
i do n't think anybody expects a first strike .
we 've moved away from confrontation .
there 's no more warsaw pact , no more soviet union , no more massive tank armies .
but we have not taken that into account in a significant way in the operational status of our forces .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : iran is watching closely how other countries deal with the nuclear issue if we really are serious about trying to keep countries like iran , north korea and others from acquiring nuclear weapons , then we ought to de-emphasize their importance .
we ought to make it clear to the world that we are not relying on those nuclear weapons for first strike unless we are struck ourselves with nuclear weapons .
as long as we , russia and other nuclear powers give nuclear weapons great prestige and we act as if they are essential for our own defense , it 's enormously difficult to try and convince other countries not to acquire these weapons .
and that 's where we are right now .
does this need for better cooperation between countries mean that the united states should become more involved in the united nations ?
on the nuclear side , certainly we ought to be more involved and we ought to get more behind iaea , the international atomic energy agency , that 's the official arm of the un in dealing with these questions .
this enormously important organization won the noble peace prize two years ago .
they are going to be increasingly important .
they need more funds , they need more help , they need more support .
it 's not just the united states , it 's our friends , germany and others , that need to understand that the iaea is being given a job without sufficient resources today .

former us senator sam nunn spoke with deutsche welle about the foreign policy of both presidential candidates .
he also called on the us to decrease its nuclear arsenal and increase its support for the united nations . sam nunn , a former democratic senator , is often tipped for a leadership post should barack obama be elected president of the united states .
nunn , 59 , honed his foreign and military policy expertise as the chair of the senate armed services committee .
since leaving office in 1997 , he has devoted himself to working to reduce the threat from nuclear weapons and currently serves as the ceo of the nuclear threat initiative -lrb- nti -rrb- .
nunn was recently in berlin , where he spoke with deutsche welle .
you have said that germany can play an important role in bringing the united states , nato and russia closer to each other .
what specific measures could this involve ?
first , i think we have to decide and russia has to decide whether we want russia to be part of the europe-atlantic security arc .
if so , then we and russia need to start sitting down and talking about those issues : finding out what their problems are with security , trying to address those problems , giving each other reassurance , having military to military meetings .
now the nato-russian council was set up for that purpose .
it worked for awhile , but it clearly is n't working anymore .
winston churchill once said : " no matter how beautiful your strategy at some point you need to look at the results . "
the results are the trajectory of nato-russia relationships – whether it 's in energy security or overall security or missile defense – is not heading in a very constructive direction .
what role can germany play in improving these ties and negotiations ?
that 's something that germany will have to decide that for itself .
i can only say that these are difficult questions and i believe the german people and the german government – with their close relationship with the united states , their leadership in nato and the european community , their friendship with both eastern europe and russia – that they are in a unique position to begin stimulating both sides to ask these questions and begin to answer them .
i do n't have all the answers but i think i do know what some of the questions are .
how would the foreign policy of an obama 's presidency differ from that of the current us administration ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : nunn would like to see the us reduce its nuclear weapons arsenal i believe both obama and mccain would both move in different directions than this administration .
i 'm very confident on the obama side that he would listen to people in europe , i 'm certain that mccain would do likewise .
i believe both of them would try a more multilateral approach .
i believe obama would reach out and look for new directions of partnership between the united states and europe and i hope also with russia and with other people around the globe .

former us senator sam nunn spoke with deutsche welle about the foreign policy of both presidential candidates .
he also called on the us to decrease its nuclear arsenal and increase its support for the united nations . sam nunn , a former democratic senator , is often tipped for a leadership post should barack obama be elected president of the united states .
nunn , 59 , honed his foreign and military policy expertise as the chair of the senate armed services committee .
since leaving office in 1997 , he has devoted himself to working to reduce the threat from nuclear weapons and currently serves as the ceo of the nuclear threat initiative -lrb- nti -rrb- .
nunn was recently in berlin , where he spoke with deutsche welle .
you have said that germany can play an important role in bringing the united states , nato and russia closer to each other .
what specific measures could this involve ?
first , i think we have to decide and russia has to decide whether we want russia to be part of the europe-atlantic security arc .
if so , then we and russia need to start sitting down and talking about those issues : finding out what their problems are with security , trying to address those problems , giving each other reassurance , having military to military meetings .
now the nato-russian council was set up for that purpose .
it worked for awhile , but it clearly is n't working anymore .
winston churchill once said : " no matter how beautiful your strategy at some point you need to look at the results . "
the results are the trajectory of nato-russia relationships – whether it 's in energy security or overall security or missile defense – is not heading in a very constructive direction .
what role can germany play in improving these ties and negotiations ?
that 's something that germany will have to decide that for itself .
i can only say that these are difficult questions and i believe the german people and the german government – with their close relationship with the united states , their leadership in nato and the european community , their friendship with both eastern europe and russia – that they are in a unique position to begin stimulating both sides to ask these questions and begin to answer them .
i do n't have all the answers but i think i do know what some of the questions are .
how would the foreign policy of an obama 's presidency differ from that of the current us administration ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : nunn would like to see the us reduce its nuclear weapons arsenal i believe both obama and mccain would both move in different directions than this administration .
i 'm very confident on the obama side that he would listen to people in europe , i 'm certain that mccain would do likewise .
i believe both of them would try a more multilateral approach .
i believe obama would reach out and look for new directions of partnership between the united states and europe and i hope also with russia and with other people around the globe .
you have brought up the argument regarding nuclear weapons that it 's hard to convince others to quit smoking when you 're a chain smoker yourself .
does the us need to reduce its nuclear arsenal ?
i think we 've got far too many nuclear weapons .
i think the russians have far too many nuclear weapons .
i think all the nuclear powers need to look at how many they need .
but i also think it 's important to look at the operational status of those weapons .
this means the way you posture your nuclear weapons , whether they 're on quick alert , how rapidly they can be fired , the warning time , the decision time on both sides .
all of that is enormously important and just as important as the numbers .
so what i would like to see is military-to-military , civilian-to-civilian top-level discussions on how we can give each other more warning time .
the president of russia or the president of the united states would have more than a few minutes to decide whether to fire the weapons if they get a warning , which could be a false warning .
i do n't think anybody expects a first strike .
we 've moved away from confrontation .
there 's no more warsaw pact , no more soviet union , no more massive tank armies .
but we have not taken that into account in a significant way in the operational status of our forces .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : iran is watching closely how other countries deal with the nuclear issue if we really are serious about trying to keep countries like iran , north korea and others from acquiring nuclear weapons , then we ought to de-emphasize their importance .
we ought to make it clear to the world that we are not relying on those nuclear weapons for first strike unless we are struck ourselves with nuclear weapons .
as long as we , russia and other nuclear powers give nuclear weapons great prestige and we act as if they are essential for our own defense , it 's enormously difficult to try and convince other countries not to acquire these weapons .
and that 's where we are right now .
does this need for better cooperation between countries mean that the united states should become more involved in the united nations ?
on the nuclear side , certainly we ought to be more involved and we ought to get more behind iaea , the international atomic energy agency , that 's the official arm of the un in dealing with these questions .
this enormously important organization won the noble peace prize two years ago .
they are going to be increasingly important .
they need more funds , they need more help , they need more support .
it 's not just the united states , it 's our friends , germany and others , that need to understand that the iaea is being given a job without sufficient resources today .
so yes , we need to be more supportive in that regard . interview : jan m. schaefer -lrb- th -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

italy , meanwhile , remain positive despite coming under intense pressure . the backdrop to this latest installment of the rivalry between the old foes could not be more different to their last meeting in a major tournament .
back in 2006 , italy overcame france at berlin 's majestic olympic stadium to be crowned champions of the world .
on tuesday at euro 2008 , those two same soccer superpowers roll up their sleeves in a back alley scrap for a route out of group c on the heels of already qualified holland .
wide margin defeats to the dutch -lrb- 3-0 and 4-1 respectively -rrb- and 1-1 and 0-0 draws with romania left italy and france requiring a win and romania to draw or lose to holland .
given their inferior goal difference that is the only way france can make it .
italy would still have a chance if they draw with france , and romania lose , leaving them both with two points .
here the permutations require the services of a rocket scientist , but in a nutshell italy would go through if they produce a score draw with france and romania lose .
the reward is a quarter-final date with group d winners spain in vienna next sunday .
shaky rearguard without vieira 's protection again france keeper gregory coupet , reeling from france 's heaviest defeat in almost three decades against the dutch , summed up the somber mood in les bleus ' camp .
" today we 've got our heads down , " he said at the team 's training headquarters in chatel-saint-denis on sunday , the day after the holland game .
" there 's tiredness , questions being asked . we need time to breathe and to prepare quickly for italy . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : france will be without their captain patrick vieira france , whose famed defense , the traditional bedrock of raymond domenech 's side , was embarrassingly torn apart by holland , will continue to be without talismanic captain patrick vieira who missed the opening two games with a left thigh problem .
domenech has a real tactical conundrum on his hands as he 's already tried 4-4-2 and 4-3-2-1 with different players - while his opposite number roberto donadoni made no fewer than five changes for the azzurri 's second game against romania .
hero buffon accepts fragile lifeline italy would already be down and out if it had n't been for keeper gianluigi buffon 's heroics in saving a late penalty from adrian mutu .
" this is the match of our lives , " said the italian keeper .
" after suffering a defeat such as we did against holland you either roll over or you appeal to your pride and that 's what we did against romania .
like ourselves , france will be surprised only to have mustered one point after two matches .
but it seems that italy are on better form as we have come off a good match . "
bildunterschrift : gianluigi buffon was beaten three times against the dutch both sides know each other well with france coming out on top when they met in the euro 2000 final only for italy to gain handsome compensation in the 2006 world cup .
they were also drawn together in qualifying for this competition .
thierry henry , who was deployed as a lone striker in that game , reflecting on the monumental task lying ahead in zurich , said : " now we know that we have to beat italy and hope for good news from the other match .
it 's ' do-able ' but it 's going to be a knife edge game with the italians .
we still have a possibility of qualifying , we 're not defeated .
" this is not the first time we 've been in this situation and i hope once more we can lift our heads and get out of it .
we 'll try and prepare the best possible for italy , " he added .
donadoni convinced his players are up for it up at their euro headquarters in austria , donadoni said he could sense the determination in his players to pull off a houdini-style escape against les bleus .
" we have to beat france , " the former ac milan winger said .
" it is a crucial match because when you still have a chance to qualify , you have to push yourself to the limit .
i saw already at training ... that the players are determined to prove how good they are against the french .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : italy 's players train for " the match of their lives " " they have a real hunger to prepare in the best possible manner for this challenge , which will dictate whether or not we progress or not , " he added .
" we are ready .
it is the last match of the group stages , we know what is at stake and we will put our heart and soul into winning what is a key match . "
donadoni said statistics and records mean nothing in a game like this .
" it has been said that italy has not managed to beat france in a normal game for 30 years , " donadoni said .
" but the statistics , quite frankly , are n't important .
before last week , it had been 30 years since the netherlands last beat italy and we all know what happened there . "
striking dilemma adds to italian woes as his side have scored just one goal in two games , donadoni admitted he is considering playing sampdoria striker antonio cassano up front alongside bayern munich 's luca toni .
having used udinese 's antonio di natale against the dutch and juventus star alessandro del piero against romania , the azzurri 's forwards have yet to fire in the tournament .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : which of italy 's strikers will be in the pink on tuesday ?
" you will see who i select on the day , " donadoni said .
" cassano reminds me of myself when i was playing , but he plays more forward , while i had other responsibilities .
he does n't help out so much at getting the ball back , which irritates me sometimes as soccer is also about playing when you do n't have the ball . "
donadoni insists all concentration will be in zurich rather than the other group c clash between the dutch and romanians in berne .
" you ca n't afford to think about the other match , those things are out of our control , " said the italian .
" all that worries us is to do the best we can .

thierry henry , who was deployed as a lone striker in that game , reflecting on the monumental task lying ahead in zurich , said : " now we know that we have to beat italy and hope for good news from the other match .
it 's ' do-able ' but it 's going to be a knife edge game with the italians .
we still have a possibility of qualifying , we 're not defeated .

italy , meanwhile , remain positive despite coming under intense pressure . the backdrop to this latest installment of the rivalry between the old foes could not be more different to their last meeting in a major tournament .
back in 2006 , italy overcame france at berlin 's majestic olympic stadium to be crowned champions of the world .
on tuesday at euro 2008 , those two same soccer superpowers roll up their sleeves in a back alley scrap for a route out of group c on the heels of already qualified holland .
wide margin defeats to the dutch -lrb- 3-0 and 4-1 respectively -rrb- and 1-1 and 0-0 draws with romania left italy and france requiring a win and romania to draw or lose to holland .
given their inferior goal difference that is the only way france can make it .
italy would still have a chance if they draw with france , and romania lose , leaving them both with two points .
here the permutations require the services of a rocket scientist , but in a nutshell italy would go through if they produce a score draw with france and romania lose .
the reward is a quarter-final date with group d winners spain in vienna next sunday .
shaky rearguard without vieira 's protection again france keeper gregory coupet , reeling from france 's heaviest defeat in almost three decades against the dutch , summed up the somber mood in les bleus ' camp .
" today we 've got our heads down , " he said at the team 's training headquarters in chatel-saint-denis on sunday , the day after the holland game .
" there 's tiredness , questions being asked . we need time to breathe and to prepare quickly for italy . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : france will be without their captain patrick vieira france , whose famed defense , the traditional bedrock of raymond domenech 's side , was embarrassingly torn apart by holland , will continue to be without talismanic captain patrick vieira who missed the opening two games with a left thigh problem .
domenech has a real tactical conundrum on his hands as he 's already tried 4-4-2 and 4-3-2-1 with different players - while his opposite number roberto donadoni made no fewer than five changes for the azzurri 's second game against romania .
hero buffon accepts fragile lifeline italy would already be down and out if it had n't been for keeper gianluigi buffon 's heroics in saving a late penalty from adrian mutu .
" this is the match of our lives , " said the italian keeper .
" after suffering a defeat such as we did against holland you either roll over or you appeal to your pride and that 's what we did against romania .

while there was n't any one issue which sunk the treaty , voters seemed concerned that it would overrule national laws on sensitive issues such as abortion , taxation and military neutrality .
at their first meeting after the vote on monday , foreign ministers discussed whether ireland could be offered concessions which could convince irish voters to pass a new referendum on the lisbon treaty later this year .
some suggested drafting a declaration which would include assurances that ireland could opt out of a number of key areas .
ireland is the only eu country whose constitution requires new eu treaties to be approved via a referendum .

" we are n't going to overcome the crisis when we lecture the irish or when we put them in the corner , " juncker said after a meeting of the eu 's 27 foreign ministers on monday , june 16 .

eu grapples with ireland question bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : are the needs of small countries being ignored ?
less than a week ago , a majority of irish rejected the eu treaty , which is designed to make the bloc more efficient and give it a stronger voice in the world .
while there was n't any one issue which sunk the treaty , voters seemed concerned that it would overrule national laws on sensitive issues such as abortion , taxation and military neutrality .
at their first meeting after the vote on monday , foreign ministers discussed whether ireland could be offered concessions which could convince irish voters to pass a new referendum on the lisbon treaty later this year .
some suggested drafting a declaration which would include assurances that ireland could opt out of a number of key areas .
ireland is the only eu country whose constitution requires new eu treaties to be approved via a referendum .
while 18 national parliaments have already said yes to lisbon , the treaty can not come into force until it is ratified by all 27 member states .

however , a repeat referendum a year later approved the treaty after the danish government won legally-binding opt-outs in such areas as defense , justice and citizenship .

the german captain 's goal gave his side the 1-0 victory they needed to advance with croatia from group b into the quarter-finals .
before the game , an austrian newspaper had handed out a newsprint for the game showing a nude ballack with the headline " strip him naked . "
the 31-year-old was visibly relieved after the game .
" we put ourselves into a very difficult situation ahead of the match , " he said .
" the defeat against croatia meant that we could not lose against austria , and that put us under a lot of pressure . "
germany captain silences his doubters bildunterschrift : ballack 's thunderbolt silenced his critics and eliminated austria asked what he had meant to say with his sign after scoring , ballack said that much had been written ahead of the game .
" if you read everything that the austrian press and public said , you would have believed that they had won the world cup three times and that we could hardly kick a ball , " he said .
" that is why i think that my goal silenced them . "
ballack could quite easily have used the gesture , too , to silence his own critics , who have been multiplying since a far-from impressive display by the german captain in germany 's 2-1 loss to croatia in their previous game .
" we wanted to win this game against austria , as we came here with a goal , " he said .
" we did not want to be eliminated after the first round , and for that we worked very hard .
i think you ca n't fault our work-rate in the game against austria .
" obviously we 're happy to have made it to the quarter-finals , particularly after the difficult match we had against croatia , " he added .
" we had everything to lose and we were certainly favorites to win -lrb- against austria -rrb- .
you could tell that we were not as agile as we should have been because we tensed up , yet our desire to win proved decisive . "
respect , but no fear bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : with players like deco and ronaldo , portugal are a force looking ahead to their quarter-final clash , ballack said he had a lot of respect for portugal , who looked very impressive in their first two matches at the finals .
" but we do not fear them , " he said .
" they are a good side , and it is practically a rematch from the game at the world cup in 2006 .
but we do not have to be scared of them .
i know several portugal players , not just those that i play with .
" all their players are very good individually and they play well as a team as well , " he said .
" they 're very good in attack and not too focused on defense .
they have great players , not least -lrb- cristiano -rrb- ronaldo , who had a great season in england and it will be a very difficult task .
" nobody has to tell us that they are good players .
i am also looking forward to playing against their coach , who will be coaching me at chelsea next season . "
for ballack and his team-mates , the game against austria could well have been a turning point .
the win over austria was certainly a step in the right direction toward the german goal of winning a fourth european title .
but portugal will be a very different proposition to austria .
" both teams want to go far in this competition and portugal are probably favorites , ” ballack said .
“ we 've maybe slipped to a different role and who knows , maybe that will favor us . "
reactions are muted both home and abroad germany reacted more relieved than delighted to the national team 's euro 2008 quarter-final berth as the 1-0 win against austria gave no reason for optimism . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the fans celebrated but more with a sense of relief tens of thousands of germans partied in the nation 's fan zones during the game but post-match celebrations were very subdued - given the poor quality of play in vienna which only saw one glorious moment from the winning free-kick by ballack . " ballack fulfils the minimal goal , " said kicker sports magazine on its web site , naming the germans ' performance " anything but convincing . " the bild daily spoke of " many individual mistakes " as germany stumbled into a quarter-final date with portugal on thursday . german football icon franz beckenbauer struck a similar line in his column in bild . " do we have a chance against cristiano ronaldo and his portuguese with such a performance ?
no , definitely not , " he said .
" our 11 must improve considerably to reach the semi-finals .
the german midfield appeared to be lacking ideas , there was hardly any passing . " german press see no reason the cheer the sueddeutsche zeitung -lrb- sz -rrb- also issued a devastating assessment , fearing a return to the poor " rumble " soccer germany played in the first years of the decade . " on thursday , portugal waits for the uninspired team of coach joachim loew , which appears to be drawing close the rumble soccer era again which seemed to have been overcome , " the sz said . the german media had mixed feelings about portugal .
some pointed out that germany wrapped up its great 2006 world cup campaign with a 3-1 win over portugal in the match for third place .
but also not forgotten was a 3-0 humiliation at euro 2000 . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : loew lost his cool with the official and hickersburger there was also concern whether loew will be able to coach his team from the sideline on thursday in basle , switzerland , as he was sent off -lrb- along with austrian helmsman josef hickersberger -rrb- after a dispute with the fourth match official . the ruling body uefa was expected to deal with the case and issue a ruling later tuesday , with kicker naming a ban " possible . " germany 's performance did also not raise eyebrows abroad . foreign papers mostly unimpressed austria lamented its first-round exit as host , but the kronenzeitung pointed out that only " the individual class of ballack made the difference . " the chelsea midfielder was also singled out elsewhere , with italy 's la gazzetta dello sport speaking of " not much game , a lot of ballack " and britain 's the sun saying : " ball of fame , chelsea ace comes up trumps . " but the guardian did not rule out a german improvement , saying that ballack could become the vital figure for germany in the aim to reach its goal of going very far in the tournament . " germany have one of euro 2008 's more influential players - and that , in itself , should give them hope for the remainder of a competition in which , thus far , they have flickered without truly igniting , " the paper wrote . dw staff / dpa -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the german captain 's goal gave his side the 1-0 victory they needed to advance with croatia from group b into the quarter-finals .
before the game , an austrian newspaper had handed out a newsprint for the game showing a nude ballack with the headline " strip him naked . "
the 31-year-old was visibly relieved after the game .
" we put ourselves into a very difficult situation ahead of the match , " he said .
" the defeat against croatia meant that we could not lose against austria , and that put us under a lot of pressure . "
germany captain silences his doubters bildunterschrift : ballack 's thunderbolt silenced his critics and eliminated austria asked what he had meant to say with his sign after scoring , ballack said that much had been written ahead of the game .
" if you read everything that the austrian press and public said , you would have believed that they had won the world cup three times and that we could hardly kick a ball , " he said .
" that is why i think that my goal silenced them . "
ballack could quite easily have used the gesture , too , to silence his own critics , who have been multiplying since a far-from impressive display by the german captain in germany 's 2-1 loss to croatia in their previous game .
" we wanted to win this game against austria , as we came here with a goal , " he said .
" we did not want to be eliminated after the first round , and for that we worked very hard .
i think you ca n't fault our work-rate in the game against austria .
" obviously we 're happy to have made it to the quarter-finals , particularly after the difficult match we had against croatia , " he added .
" we had everything to lose and we were certainly favorites to win -lrb- against austria -rrb- .
you could tell that we were not as agile as we should have been because we tensed up , yet our desire to win proved decisive . "
respect , but no fear bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : with players like deco and ronaldo , portugal are a force looking ahead to their quarter-final clash , ballack said he had a lot of respect for portugal , who looked very impressive in their first two matches at the finals .
" but we do not fear them , " he said .
" they are a good side , and it is practically a rematch from the game at the world cup in 2006 .
but we do not have to be scared of them .
i know several portugal players , not just those that i play with .
" all their players are very good individually and they play well as a team as well , " he said .
" they 're very good in attack and not too focused on defense .
they have great players , not least -lrb- cristiano -rrb- ronaldo , who had a great season in england and it will be a very difficult task .
" nobody has to tell us that they are good players .
i am also looking forward to playing against their coach , who will be coaching me at chelsea next season . "
for ballack and his team-mates , the game against austria could well have been a turning point .
the win over austria was certainly a step in the right direction toward the german goal of winning a fourth european title .

the german captain 's goal gave his side the 1-0 victory they needed to advance with croatia from group b into the quarter-finals .
before the game , an austrian newspaper had handed out a newsprint for the game showing a nude ballack with the headline " strip him naked . "
the 31-year-old was visibly relieved after the game .
" we put ourselves into a very difficult situation ahead of the match , " he said .
" the defeat against croatia meant that we could not lose against austria , and that put us under a lot of pressure . "
germany captain silences his doubters bildunterschrift : ballack 's thunderbolt silenced his critics and eliminated austria asked what he had meant to say with his sign after scoring , ballack said that much had been written ahead of the game .
" if you read everything that the austrian press and public said , you would have believed that they had won the world cup three times and that we could hardly kick a ball , " he said .
" that is why i think that my goal silenced them . "
ballack could quite easily have used the gesture , too , to silence his own critics , who have been multiplying since a far-from impressive display by the german captain in germany 's 2-1 loss to croatia in their previous game .
" we wanted to win this game against austria , as we came here with a goal , " he said .
" we did not want to be eliminated after the first round , and for that we worked very hard .
i think you ca n't fault our work-rate in the game against austria .
" obviously we 're happy to have made it to the quarter-finals , particularly after the difficult match we had against croatia , " he added .
" we had everything to lose and we were certainly favorites to win -lrb- against austria -rrb- .
you could tell that we were not as agile as we should have been because we tensed up , yet our desire to win proved decisive . "
respect , but no fear bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : with players like deco and ronaldo , portugal are a force looking ahead to their quarter-final clash , ballack said he had a lot of respect for portugal , who looked very impressive in their first two matches at the finals .
" but we do not fear them , " he said .
" they are a good side , and it is practically a rematch from the game at the world cup in 2006 .
but we do not have to be scared of them .
i know several portugal players , not just those that i play with .
" all their players are very good individually and they play well as a team as well , " he said .
" they 're very good in attack and not too focused on defense .
they have great players , not least -lrb- cristiano -rrb- ronaldo , who had a great season in england and it will be a very difficult task .
" nobody has to tell us that they are good players .
i am also looking forward to playing against their coach , who will be coaching me at chelsea next season . "
for ballack and his team-mates , the game against austria could well have been a turning point .
the win over austria was certainly a step in the right direction toward the german goal of winning a fourth european title .
but portugal will be a very different proposition to austria .
" both teams want to go far in this competition and portugal are probably favorites , ” ballack said .
“ we 've maybe slipped to a different role and who knows , maybe that will favor us . "
reactions are muted both home and abroad germany reacted more relieved than delighted to the national team 's euro 2008 quarter-final berth as the 1-0 win against austria gave no reason for optimism . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the fans celebrated but more with a sense of relief tens of thousands of germans partied in the nation 's fan zones during the game but post-match celebrations were very subdued - given the poor quality of play in vienna which only saw one glorious moment from the winning free-kick by ballack . " ballack fulfils the minimal goal , " said kicker sports magazine on its web site , naming the germans ' performance " anything but convincing . " the bild daily spoke of " many individual mistakes " as germany stumbled into a quarter-final date with portugal on thursday . german football icon franz beckenbauer struck a similar line in his column in bild . " do we have a chance against cristiano ronaldo and his portuguese with such a performance ?
no , definitely not , " he said .
" our 11 must improve considerably to reach the semi-finals .
the german midfield appeared to be lacking ideas , there was hardly any passing . " german press see no reason the cheer the sueddeutsche zeitung -lrb- sz -rrb- also issued a devastating assessment , fearing a return to the poor " rumble " soccer germany played in the first years of the decade . " on thursday , portugal waits for the uninspired team of coach joachim loew , which appears to be drawing close the rumble soccer era again which seemed to have been overcome , " the sz said . the german media had mixed feelings about portugal .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de euro 2008 -pipe- 17.06.2008 loew under fire after germany disappoint in euro 2008 großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : loew , r , and his austrian counterpart were banned form the touchline after losing to croatia , coach joachim loew promised that fans would see a different germany against austria .
but what they got was more of the same against a weaker opponent .
now some are turning on yogi . euro 2008 was supposed to be the tournament where the new german brand of power soccer , pioneered by loew and his predecessor juergen klinsmann , resulted in some silverware .
instead , the co-favorites struggled to survive a first-round group that was among the weakest ever in the competition .
germany 's 1-0 win against austria came against a side whose main striker played most of his matches this season for werder bremen 's amateurs - in the bundesliga 's third division .
nonetheless , germany needed a 120 km / h -lrb- 74.5 mph -rrb- free kick from michael ballack to best their much smaller southern neighbors .
after the match , many credited ballack with saving yogi 's hide .
bildunterschrift : one moment of ballack brilliance made up for a dismal performance " the captain personally spared the team and above all the team management the unpleasant discussions that would have followed germany potentially exiting the tournament in vienna , " wrote the on-line version of the frankfurter allgemeine zeitung newspaper .
" ballack was loew 's savior . "
empty words ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : mario gomez and the rest of germany 's attack have been weak after germany 's shock loss to croatia on june 12 , germany 's governing soccer body , the dfb , was quick to assure the press that loew would retain his job , even if the team were to crash out of euro 2008 .
but few people put much stock in those assurances , and some experts are beginning to question the coach , who was sent to grandstands , together with his austrian counterpart , for complaining about the officiating .
" it fit the quality of the match that it was game over after 40 minutes for the two men responsible for the teams ' strategy and style , " wrote the daily tagesspiegel newspaper .
bloggers have been even harsher .
" you ca n't play more horridly , " wrote one disappointed german fan on a soccer discussion forum .

the german captain 's goal gave his side the 1-0 victory they needed to advance with croatia from group b into the quarter-finals .
before the game , an austrian newspaper had handed out a newsprint for the game showing a nude ballack with the headline " strip him naked . "
the 31-year-old was visibly relieved after the game .
" we put ourselves into a very difficult situation ahead of the match , " he said .
" the defeat against croatia meant that we could not lose against austria , and that put us under a lot of pressure . "
germany captain silences his doubters bildunterschrift : ballack 's thunderbolt silenced his critics and eliminated austria asked what he had meant to say with his sign after scoring , ballack said that much had been written ahead of the game .
" if you read everything that the austrian press and public said , you would have believed that they had won the world cup three times and that we could hardly kick a ball , " he said .
" that is why i think that my goal silenced them . "
ballack could quite easily have used the gesture , too , to silence his own critics , who have been multiplying since a far-from impressive display by the german captain in germany 's 2-1 loss to croatia in their previous game .
" we wanted to win this game against austria , as we came here with a goal , " he said .
" we did not want to be eliminated after the first round , and for that we worked very hard .
i think you ca n't fault our work-rate in the game against austria .
" obviously we 're happy to have made it to the quarter-finals , particularly after the difficult match we had against croatia , " he added .
" we had everything to lose and we were certainly favorites to win -lrb- against austria -rrb- .
you could tell that we were not as agile as we should have been because we tensed up , yet our desire to win proved decisive . "
respect , but no fear bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : with players like deco and ronaldo , portugal are a force looking ahead to their quarter-final clash , ballack said he had a lot of respect for portugal , who looked very impressive in their first two matches at the finals .
" but we do not fear them , " he said .
" they are a good side , and it is practically a rematch from the game at the world cup in 2006 .
but we do not have to be scared of them .
i know several portugal players , not just those that i play with .
" all their players are very good individually and they play well as a team as well , " he said .
" they 're very good in attack and not too focused on defense .
they have great players , not least -lrb- cristiano -rrb- ronaldo , who had a great season in england and it will be a very difficult task .
" nobody has to tell us that they are good players .
i am also looking forward to playing against their coach , who will be coaching me at chelsea next season . "
for ballack and his team-mates , the game against austria could well have been a turning point .
the win over austria was certainly a step in the right direction toward the german goal of winning a fourth european title .
but portugal will be a very different proposition to austria .
" both teams want to go far in this competition and portugal are probably favorites , ” ballack said .
“ we 've maybe slipped to a different role and who knows , maybe that will favor us . "
reactions are muted both home and abroad germany reacted more relieved than delighted to the national team 's euro 2008 quarter-final berth as the 1-0 win against austria gave no reason for optimism . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the fans celebrated but more with a sense of relief tens of thousands of germans partied in the nation 's fan zones during the game but post-match celebrations were very subdued - given the poor quality of play in vienna which only saw one glorious moment from the winning free-kick by ballack . " ballack fulfils the minimal goal , " said kicker sports magazine on its web site , naming the germans ' performance " anything but convincing . " the bild daily spoke of " many individual mistakes " as germany stumbled into a quarter-final date with portugal on thursday . german football icon franz beckenbauer struck a similar line in his column in bild . " do we have a chance against cristiano ronaldo and his portuguese with such a performance ?
no , definitely not , " he said .
" our 11 must improve considerably to reach the semi-finals .
the german midfield appeared to be lacking ideas , there was hardly any passing . " german press see no reason the cheer the sueddeutsche zeitung -lrb- sz -rrb- also issued a devastating assessment , fearing a return to the poor " rumble " soccer germany played in the first years of the decade . " on thursday , portugal waits for the uninspired team of coach joachim loew , which appears to be drawing close the rumble soccer era again which seemed to have been overcome , " the sz said . the german media had mixed feelings about portugal .

but also not forgotten was a 3-0 humiliation at euro 2000 . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : loew lost his cool with the official and hickersburger there was also concern whether loew will be able to coach his team from the sideline on thursday in basle , switzerland , as he was sent off -lrb- along with austrian helmsman josef hickersberger -rrb- after a dispute with the fourth match official . the ruling body uefa was expected to deal with the case and issue a ruling later tuesday , with kicker naming a ban " possible . " germany 's performance did also not raise eyebrows abroad . foreign papers mostly unimpressed austria lamented its first-round exit as host , but the kronenzeitung pointed out that only " the individual class of ballack made the difference . " the chelsea midfielder was also singled out elsewhere , with italy 's la gazzetta dello sport speaking of " not much game , a lot of ballack " and britain 's the sun saying : " ball of fame , chelsea ace comes up trumps . " but the guardian did not rule out a german improvement , saying that ballack could become the vital figure for germany in the aim to reach its goal of going very far in the tournament .

the german captain 's goal gave his side the 1-0 victory they needed to advance with croatia from group b into the quarter-finals .
before the game , an austrian newspaper had handed out a newsprint for the game showing a nude ballack with the headline " strip him naked . "
the 31-year-old was visibly relieved after the game .
" we put ourselves into a very difficult situation ahead of the match , " he said .
" the defeat against croatia meant that we could not lose against austria , and that put us under a lot of pressure . "
germany captain silences his doubters bildunterschrift : ballack 's thunderbolt silenced his critics and eliminated austria asked what he had meant to say with his sign after scoring , ballack said that much had been written ahead of the game .
" if you read everything that the austrian press and public said , you would have believed that they had won the world cup three times and that we could hardly kick a ball , " he said .
" that is why i think that my goal silenced them . "
ballack could quite easily have used the gesture , too , to silence his own critics , who have been multiplying since a far-from impressive display by the german captain in germany 's 2-1 loss to croatia in their previous game .
" we wanted to win this game against austria , as we came here with a goal , " he said .
" we did not want to be eliminated after the first round , and for that we worked very hard .
i think you ca n't fault our work-rate in the game against austria .
" obviously we 're happy to have made it to the quarter-finals , particularly after the difficult match we had against croatia , " he added .
" we had everything to lose and we were certainly favorites to win -lrb- against austria -rrb- .
you could tell that we were not as agile as we should have been because we tensed up , yet our desire to win proved decisive . "
respect , but no fear bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : with players like deco and ronaldo , portugal are a force looking ahead to their quarter-final clash , ballack said he had a lot of respect for portugal , who looked very impressive in their first two matches at the finals .
" but we do not fear them , " he said .
" they are a good side , and it is practically a rematch from the game at the world cup in 2006 .
but we do not have to be scared of them .
i know several portugal players , not just those that i play with .
" all their players are very good individually and they play well as a team as well , " he said .
" they 're very good in attack and not too focused on defense .
they have great players , not least -lrb- cristiano -rrb- ronaldo , who had a great season in england and it will be a very difficult task .
" nobody has to tell us that they are good players .
i am also looking forward to playing against their coach , who will be coaching me at chelsea next season . "
for ballack and his team-mates , the game against austria could well have been a turning point .
the win over austria was certainly a step in the right direction toward the german goal of winning a fourth european title .
but portugal will be a very different proposition to austria .
" both teams want to go far in this competition and portugal are probably favorites , ” ballack said .
“ we 've maybe slipped to a different role and who knows , maybe that will favor us . "
reactions are muted both home and abroad germany reacted more relieved than delighted to the national team 's euro 2008 quarter-final berth as the 1-0 win against austria gave no reason for optimism . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the fans celebrated but more with a sense of relief tens of thousands of germans partied in the nation 's fan zones during the game but post-match celebrations were very subdued - given the poor quality of play in vienna which only saw one glorious moment from the winning free-kick by ballack . " ballack fulfils the minimal goal , " said kicker sports magazine on its web site , naming the germans ' performance " anything but convincing . " the bild daily spoke of " many individual mistakes " as germany stumbled into a quarter-final date with portugal on thursday . german football icon franz beckenbauer struck a similar line in his column in bild . " do we have a chance against cristiano ronaldo and his portuguese with such a performance ?
no , definitely not , " he said .
" our 11 must improve considerably to reach the semi-finals .
the german midfield appeared to be lacking ideas , there was hardly any passing . " german press see no reason the cheer the sueddeutsche zeitung -lrb- sz -rrb- also issued a devastating assessment , fearing a return to the poor " rumble " soccer germany played in the first years of the decade . " on thursday , portugal waits for the uninspired team of coach joachim loew , which appears to be drawing close the rumble soccer era again which seemed to have been overcome , " the sz said . the german media had mixed feelings about portugal .
some pointed out that germany wrapped up its great 2006 world cup campaign with a 3-1 win over portugal in the match for third place .
but also not forgotten was a 3-0 humiliation at euro 2000 . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : loew lost his cool with the official and hickersburger there was also concern whether loew will be able to coach his team from the sideline on thursday in basle , switzerland , as he was sent off -lrb- along with austrian helmsman josef hickersberger -rrb- after a dispute with the fourth match official . the ruling body uefa was expected to deal with the case and issue a ruling later tuesday , with kicker naming a ban " possible . " germany 's performance did also not raise eyebrows abroad . foreign papers mostly unimpressed austria lamented its first-round exit as host , but the kronenzeitung pointed out that only " the individual class of ballack made the difference . " the chelsea midfielder was also singled out elsewhere , with italy 's la gazzetta dello sport speaking of " not much game , a lot of ballack " and britain 's the sun saying : " ball of fame , chelsea ace comes up trumps . " but the guardian did not rule out a german improvement , saying that ballack could become the vital figure for germany in the aim to reach its goal of going very far in the tournament . " germany have one of euro 2008 's more influential players - and that , in itself , should give them hope for the remainder of a competition in which , thus far , they have flickered without truly igniting , " the paper wrote . dw staff / dpa -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" we are n't going to overcome the crisis when we lecture the irish or when we put them in the corner , " juncker said after a meeting of the eu 's 27 foreign ministers on monday , june 16 .
it would be " arrogant " to tell the irish that their votes do n't count because they are from a small country , juncker said in an article in the financial times deutschland newspaper .

eu grapples with ireland question bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : are the needs of small countries being ignored ?
less than a week ago , a majority of irish rejected the eu treaty , which is designed to make the bloc more efficient and give it a stronger voice in the world .
while there was n't any one issue which sunk the treaty , voters seemed concerned that it would overrule national laws on sensitive issues such as abortion , taxation and military neutrality .
at their first meeting after the vote on monday , foreign ministers discussed whether ireland could be offered concessions which could convince irish voters to pass a new referendum on the lisbon treaty later this year .
some suggested drafting a declaration which would include assurances that ireland could opt out of a number of key areas .
ireland is the only eu country whose constitution requires new eu treaties to be approved via a referendum .
while 18 national parliaments have already said yes to lisbon , the treaty can not come into force until it is ratified by all 27 member states .
germany wants decision this year bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : juncker said big eu countries are being arrogant while most eu ministers wanted to wait before deciding how to proceed , german foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier said that a solution would need to be found " this year . "
steinmeier also suggested that " the danish model from 1992 could be a model in this crisis . "
in 1992 , denmark voted against the maastricht treaty that created the european union out of the european community .
however , a repeat referendum a year later approved the treaty after the danish government won legally-binding opt-outs in such areas as defense , justice and citizenship .

" the secretary general welcomes the announcement by french president sarkozy that there are no obstacles to france rejoining the integrated command , " nato spokesman james appathurai said on tuesday , june 17 . the white house likewise embraced the move .
" we welcome the announcement , " gordon johndroe , white house national security spokesman , said . stephen hadley , president george w. bush 's national security adviser , said in april at the nato summit in bucharest that bush was in favor of france coming back into the integrated command , and generally favored european partners boosting capacities for eu and nato missions . hadley " made it very clear that the united states wants a strong partner in europe , wants a strong eu partner , and that involves both more military capability for those countries , but also partnering nato 's military capability with eu civilian and political capabilities , " johndroe added . a return to nato military command france announced a return to nato on tuesday , 42 years after former president charles de gaulle left the alliance it helped found , angry at what he saw as the anglo-american dominance of the alliance . " i want the alliance to be more european , and how can we have a more european alliance without france , " said sarkozy . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : sarkozy outlined plans for a reintegration into nato 's military wing after 42 years the president announced his country ’ s return while outlining france ’ s defense priorities over the next 15 years , during which , he said , terrorism would be the number one threat . sarkozy said the military must put a new emphasis on security within france 's borders and adapt to modern challenges from terrorism to computer attacks . underscoring the focus on intelligence-gathering , a new national security council will be set up at elysee palace .
sarkozy urged a strong european defence policy and said france would revamp ties with nato . but he insisted that france would always retain control of its own forces and keep independent control of its nuclear deterrent , which would remain the cornerstone of its defence structure .

as part of the plan , sarkozy called for the establishment of a european rapid intervention force of 60,000 soldiers . until recently , the united states and britain have been reluctant to strengthen european defenses , concerned that such a move would prove expensive and duplicate nato capabilities . critics fear loss of french foreign policy independence though france continues to play a role in decision-making bodies , it is not part of the integrated command structure .

" obviously , it 's up to france exactly how and when it wants to resume its full participation in nato structures , " said appathurai . in france , however , not all were excited about the announcement . several members of sarkozy 's own ruling party have protested what they see as a loss of france ’ s hallmark independence in foreign policy - a betrayal of de gaulle 's legacy . members of the opposition socialist party likewise criticized the move , accusing the president , the most atlanticist french president in recent years , of sucking up to washington . sarkozy hit back at his critics .

in germany , they had a realistic chance of such a celebration but were left a little disappointed by germany 's performance on monday night . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some germany fans did n't seem too upset by their side 's insipid performance " there is not much to celebrate , because the real test of character starts in the next round when we will face portugal .
i guess we lost the plot when we lost to croatia , it might just be the end of the road because it is going to be a really tough game against portugal , we might just need something special or we kiss good buy to this tournament , " said a germany soccer fan from asia in a neighborhood in the northern part of the western german city of bonn . another germany supporter , originally from ghana , had a different view .

former us senator sam nunn spoke with deutsche welle about the foreign policy of both presidential candidates .
he also called on the us to decrease its nuclear arsenal and increase its support for the united nations . sam nunn , a former democratic senator , is often tipped for a leadership post should barack obama be elected president of the united states .
nunn , 59 , honed his foreign and military policy expertise as the chair of the senate armed services committee .
since leaving office in 1997 , he has devoted himself to working to reduce the threat from nuclear weapons and currently serves as the ceo of the nuclear threat initiative -lrb- nti -rrb- .
nunn was recently in berlin , where he spoke with deutsche welle .
you have said that germany can play an important role in bringing the united states , nato and russia closer to each other .
what specific measures could this involve ?
first , i think we have to decide and russia has to decide whether we want russia to be part of the europe-atlantic security arc .
if so , then we and russia need to start sitting down and talking about those issues : finding out what their problems are with security , trying to address those problems , giving each other reassurance , having military to military meetings .
now the nato-russian council was set up for that purpose .
it worked for awhile , but it clearly is n't working anymore .
winston churchill once said : " no matter how beautiful your strategy at some point you need to look at the results . "
the results are the trajectory of nato-russia relationships – whether it 's in energy security or overall security or missile defense – is not heading in a very constructive direction .
what role can germany play in improving these ties and negotiations ?
that 's something that germany will have to decide that for itself .
i can only say that these are difficult questions and i believe the german people and the german government – with their close relationship with the united states , their leadership in nato and the european community , their friendship with both eastern europe and russia – that they are in a unique position to begin stimulating both sides to ask these questions and begin to answer them .
i do n't have all the answers but i think i do know what some of the questions are .
how would the foreign policy of an obama 's presidency differ from that of the current us administration ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : nunn would like to see the us reduce its nuclear weapons arsenal i believe both obama and mccain would both move in different directions than this administration .
i 'm very confident on the obama side that he would listen to people in europe , i 'm certain that mccain would do likewise .
i believe both of them would try a more multilateral approach .
i believe obama would reach out and look for new directions of partnership between the united states and europe and i hope also with russia and with other people around the globe .
you have brought up the argument regarding nuclear weapons that it 's hard to convince others to quit smoking when you 're a chain smoker yourself .
does the us need to reduce its nuclear arsenal ?
i think we 've got far too many nuclear weapons .
i think the russians have far too many nuclear weapons .
i think all the nuclear powers need to look at how many they need .
but i also think it 's important to look at the operational status of those weapons .
this means the way you posture your nuclear weapons , whether they 're on quick alert , how rapidly they can be fired , the warning time , the decision time on both sides .
all of that is enormously important and just as important as the numbers .
so what i would like to see is military-to-military , civilian-to-civilian top-level discussions on how we can give each other more warning time .
the president of russia or the president of the united states would have more than a few minutes to decide whether to fire the weapons if they get a warning , which could be a false warning .
i do n't think anybody expects a first strike .
we 've moved away from confrontation .
there 's no more warsaw pact , no more soviet union , no more massive tank armies .
but we have not taken that into account in a significant way in the operational status of our forces .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : iran is watching closely how other countries deal with the nuclear issue if we really are serious about trying to keep countries like iran , north korea and others from acquiring nuclear weapons , then we ought to de-emphasize their importance .
we ought to make it clear to the world that we are not relying on those nuclear weapons for first strike unless we are struck ourselves with nuclear weapons .
as long as we , russia and other nuclear powers give nuclear weapons great prestige and we act as if they are essential for our own defense , it 's enormously difficult to try and convince other countries not to acquire these weapons .
and that 's where we are right now .
does this need for better cooperation between countries mean that the united states should become more involved in the united nations ?
on the nuclear side , certainly we ought to be more involved and we ought to get more behind iaea , the international atomic energy agency , that 's the official arm of the un in dealing with these questions .
this enormously important organization won the noble peace prize two years ago .
they are going to be increasingly important .
they need more funds , they need more help , they need more support .
it 's not just the united states , it 's our friends , germany and others , that need to understand that the iaea is being given a job without sufficient resources today .
so yes , we need to be more supportive in that regard . interview : jan m. schaefer -lrb- th -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

italy , meanwhile , remain positive despite coming under intense pressure . the backdrop to this latest installment of the rivalry between the old foes could not be more different to their last meeting in a major tournament .
back in 2006 , italy overcame france at berlin 's majestic olympic stadium to be crowned champions of the world .
on tuesday at euro 2008 , those two same soccer superpowers roll up their sleeves in a back alley scrap for a route out of group c on the heels of already qualified holland .
wide margin defeats to the dutch -lrb- 3-0 and 4-1 respectively -rrb- and 1-1 and 0-0 draws with romania left italy and france requiring a win and romania to draw or lose to holland .
given their inferior goal difference that is the only way france can make it .
italy would still have a chance if they draw with france , and romania lose , leaving them both with two points .
here the permutations require the services of a rocket scientist , but in a nutshell italy would go through if they produce a score draw with france and romania lose .
the reward is a quarter-final date with group d winners spain in vienna next sunday .
shaky rearguard without vieira 's protection again france keeper gregory coupet , reeling from france 's heaviest defeat in almost three decades against the dutch , summed up the somber mood in les bleus ' camp .
" today we 've got our heads down , " he said at the team 's training headquarters in chatel-saint-denis on sunday , the day after the holland game .
" there 's tiredness , questions being asked . we need time to breathe and to prepare quickly for italy . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : france will be without their captain patrick vieira france , whose famed defense , the traditional bedrock of raymond domenech 's side , was embarrassingly torn apart by holland , will continue to be without talismanic captain patrick vieira who missed the opening two games with a left thigh problem .
domenech has a real tactical conundrum on his hands as he 's already tried 4-4-2 and 4-3-2-1 with different players - while his opposite number roberto donadoni made no fewer than five changes for the azzurri 's second game against romania .
hero buffon accepts fragile lifeline italy would already be down and out if it had n't been for keeper gianluigi buffon 's heroics in saving a late penalty from adrian mutu .
" this is the match of our lives , " said the italian keeper .
" after suffering a defeat such as we did against holland you either roll over or you appeal to your pride and that 's what we did against romania .
like ourselves , france will be surprised only to have mustered one point after two matches .
but it seems that italy are on better form as we have come off a good match . "
bildunterschrift : gianluigi buffon was beaten three times against the dutch both sides know each other well with france coming out on top when they met in the euro 2000 final only for italy to gain handsome compensation in the 2006 world cup .
they were also drawn together in qualifying for this competition .
thierry henry , who was deployed as a lone striker in that game , reflecting on the monumental task lying ahead in zurich , said : " now we know that we have to beat italy and hope for good news from the other match .
it 's ' do-able ' but it 's going to be a knife edge game with the italians .
we still have a possibility of qualifying , we 're not defeated .
" this is not the first time we 've been in this situation and i hope once more we can lift our heads and get out of it .
we 'll try and prepare the best possible for italy , " he added .
donadoni convinced his players are up for it up at their euro headquarters in austria , donadoni said he could sense the determination in his players to pull off a houdini-style escape against les bleus .
" we have to beat france , " the former ac milan winger said .
" it is a crucial match because when you still have a chance to qualify , you have to push yourself to the limit .
i saw already at training ... that the players are determined to prove how good they are against the french .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : italy 's players train for " the match of their lives " " they have a real hunger to prepare in the best possible manner for this challenge , which will dictate whether or not we progress or not , " he added .
" we are ready .
it is the last match of the group stages , we know what is at stake and we will put our heart and soul into winning what is a key match . "
donadoni said statistics and records mean nothing in a game like this .
" it has been said that italy has not managed to beat france in a normal game for 30 years , " donadoni said .
" but the statistics , quite frankly , are n't important .
before last week , it had been 30 years since the netherlands last beat italy and we all know what happened there . "
striking dilemma adds to italian woes as his side have scored just one goal in two games , donadoni admitted he is considering playing sampdoria striker antonio cassano up front alongside bayern munich 's luca toni .
having used udinese 's antonio di natale against the dutch and juventus star alessandro del piero against romania , the azzurri 's forwards have yet to fire in the tournament .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : which of italy 's strikers will be in the pink on tuesday ?
" you will see who i select on the day , " donadoni said .
" cassano reminds me of myself when i was playing , but he plays more forward , while i had other responsibilities .
he does n't help out so much at getting the ball back , which irritates me sometimes as soccer is also about playing when you do n't have the ball . "
donadoni insists all concentration will be in zurich rather than the other group c clash between the dutch and romanians in berne .
" you ca n't afford to think about the other match , those things are out of our control , " said the italian .
" all that worries us is to do the best we can .
after that we may not have our destiny in our own hands , but we just have to get on with the job in hand . " our suitcases are n't packed yet , they are still open .

italy , meanwhile , remain positive despite coming under intense pressure . the backdrop to this latest installment of the rivalry between the old foes could not be more different to their last meeting in a major tournament .
back in 2006 , italy overcame france at berlin 's majestic olympic stadium to be crowned champions of the world .
on tuesday at euro 2008 , those two same soccer superpowers roll up their sleeves in a back alley scrap for a route out of group c on the heels of already qualified holland .
wide margin defeats to the dutch -lrb- 3-0 and 4-1 respectively -rrb- and 1-1 and 0-0 draws with romania left italy and france requiring a win and romania to draw or lose to holland .
given their inferior goal difference that is the only way france can make it .
italy would still have a chance if they draw with france , and romania lose , leaving them both with two points .
here the permutations require the services of a rocket scientist , but in a nutshell italy would go through if they produce a score draw with france and romania lose .
the reward is a quarter-final date with group d winners spain in vienna next sunday .
shaky rearguard without vieira 's protection again france keeper gregory coupet , reeling from france 's heaviest defeat in almost three decades against the dutch , summed up the somber mood in les bleus ' camp .
" today we 've got our heads down , " he said at the team 's training headquarters in chatel-saint-denis on sunday , the day after the holland game .
" there 's tiredness , questions being asked . we need time to breathe and to prepare quickly for italy . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : france will be without their captain patrick vieira france , whose famed defense , the traditional bedrock of raymond domenech 's side , was embarrassingly torn apart by holland , will continue to be without talismanic captain patrick vieira who missed the opening two games with a left thigh problem .
domenech has a real tactical conundrum on his hands as he 's already tried 4-4-2 and 4-3-2-1 with different players - while his opposite number roberto donadoni made no fewer than five changes for the azzurri 's second game against romania .
hero buffon accepts fragile lifeline italy would already be down and out if it had n't been for keeper gianluigi buffon 's heroics in saving a late penalty from adrian mutu .
" this is the match of our lives , " said the italian keeper .
" after suffering a defeat such as we did against holland you either roll over or you appeal to your pride and that 's what we did against romania .
like ourselves , france will be surprised only to have mustered one point after two matches .
but it seems that italy are on better form as we have come off a good match . "
bildunterschrift : gianluigi buffon was beaten three times against the dutch both sides know each other well with france coming out on top when they met in the euro 2000 final only for italy to gain handsome compensation in the 2006 world cup .
they were also drawn together in qualifying for this competition .
thierry henry , who was deployed as a lone striker in that game , reflecting on the monumental task lying ahead in zurich , said : " now we know that we have to beat italy and hope for good news from the other match .
it 's ' do-able ' but it 's going to be a knife edge game with the italians .
we still have a possibility of qualifying , we 're not defeated .
" this is not the first time we 've been in this situation and i hope once more we can lift our heads and get out of it .

italy , meanwhile , remain positive despite coming under intense pressure . the backdrop to this latest installment of the rivalry between the old foes could not be more different to their last meeting in a major tournament .
back in 2006 , italy overcame france at berlin 's majestic olympic stadium to be crowned champions of the world .
on tuesday at euro 2008 , those two same soccer superpowers roll up their sleeves in a back alley scrap for a route out of group c on the heels of already qualified holland .
wide margin defeats to the dutch -lrb- 3-0 and 4-1 respectively -rrb- and 1-1 and 0-0 draws with romania left italy and france requiring a win and romania to draw or lose to holland .
given their inferior goal difference that is the only way france can make it .
italy would still have a chance if they draw with france , and romania lose , leaving them both with two points .
here the permutations require the services of a rocket scientist , but in a nutshell italy would go through if they produce a score draw with france and romania lose .
the reward is a quarter-final date with group d winners spain in vienna next sunday .
shaky rearguard without vieira 's protection again france keeper gregory coupet , reeling from france 's heaviest defeat in almost three decades against the dutch , summed up the somber mood in les bleus ' camp .
" today we 've got our heads down , " he said at the team 's training headquarters in chatel-saint-denis on sunday , the day after the holland game .
" there 's tiredness , questions being asked . we need time to breathe and to prepare quickly for italy . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : france will be without their captain patrick vieira france , whose famed defense , the traditional bedrock of raymond domenech 's side , was embarrassingly torn apart by holland , will continue to be without talismanic captain patrick vieira who missed the opening two games with a left thigh problem .
domenech has a real tactical conundrum on his hands as he 's already tried 4-4-2 and 4-3-2-1 with different players - while his opposite number roberto donadoni made no fewer than five changes for the azzurri 's second game against romania .
hero buffon accepts fragile lifeline italy would already be down and out if it had n't been for keeper gianluigi buffon 's heroics in saving a late penalty from adrian mutu .
" this is the match of our lives , " said the italian keeper .
" after suffering a defeat such as we did against holland you either roll over or you appeal to your pride and that 's what we did against romania .
like ourselves , france will be surprised only to have mustered one point after two matches .
but it seems that italy are on better form as we have come off a good match . "
bildunterschrift : gianluigi buffon was beaten three times against the dutch both sides know each other well with france coming out on top when they met in the euro 2000 final only for italy to gain handsome compensation in the 2006 world cup .
they were also drawn together in qualifying for this competition .
thierry henry , who was deployed as a lone striker in that game , reflecting on the monumental task lying ahead in zurich , said : " now we know that we have to beat italy and hope for good news from the other match .
it 's ' do-able ' but it 's going to be a knife edge game with the italians .
we still have a possibility of qualifying , we 're not defeated .
" this is not the first time we 've been in this situation and i hope once more we can lift our heads and get out of it .
we 'll try and prepare the best possible for italy , " he added .
donadoni convinced his players are up for it up at their euro headquarters in austria , donadoni said he could sense the determination in his players to pull off a houdini-style escape against les bleus .
" we have to beat france , " the former ac milan winger said .
" it is a crucial match because when you still have a chance to qualify , you have to push yourself to the limit .
i saw already at training ... that the players are determined to prove how good they are against the french .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : italy 's players train for " the match of their lives " " they have a real hunger to prepare in the best possible manner for this challenge , which will dictate whether or not we progress or not , " he added .
" we are ready .
it is the last match of the group stages , we know what is at stake and we will put our heart and soul into winning what is a key match . "
donadoni said statistics and records mean nothing in a game like this .
" it has been said that italy has not managed to beat france in a normal game for 30 years , " donadoni said .
" but the statistics , quite frankly , are n't important .
before last week , it had been 30 years since the netherlands last beat italy and we all know what happened there . "
striking dilemma adds to italian woes as his side have scored just one goal in two games , donadoni admitted he is considering playing sampdoria striker antonio cassano up front alongside bayern munich 's luca toni .
having used udinese 's antonio di natale against the dutch and juventus star alessandro del piero against romania , the azzurri 's forwards have yet to fire in the tournament .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : which of italy 's strikers will be in the pink on tuesday ?
" you will see who i select on the day , " donadoni said .
" cassano reminds me of myself when i was playing , but he plays more forward , while i had other responsibilities .
he does n't help out so much at getting the ball back , which irritates me sometimes as soccer is also about playing when you do n't have the ball . "
donadoni insists all concentration will be in zurich rather than the other group c clash between the dutch and romanians in berne .
" you ca n't afford to think about the other match , those things are out of our control , " said the italian .
" all that worries us is to do the best we can .
after that we may not have our destiny in our own hands , but we just have to get on with the job in hand . " our suitcases are n't packed yet , they are still open .

former us senator sam nunn spoke with deutsche welle about the foreign policy of both presidential candidates .
he also called on the us to decrease its nuclear arsenal and increase its support for the united nations . sam nunn , a former democratic senator , is often tipped for a leadership post should barack obama be elected president of the united states .
nunn , 59 , honed his foreign and military policy expertise as the chair of the senate armed services committee .
since leaving office in 1997 , he has devoted himself to working to reduce the threat from nuclear weapons and currently serves as the ceo of the nuclear threat initiative -lrb- nti -rrb- .
nunn was recently in berlin , where he spoke with deutsche welle .
you have said that germany can play an important role in bringing the united states , nato and russia closer to each other .
what specific measures could this involve ?
first , i think we have to decide and russia has to decide whether we want russia to be part of the europe-atlantic security arc .
if so , then we and russia need to start sitting down and talking about those issues : finding out what their problems are with security , trying to address those problems , giving each other reassurance , having military to military meetings .
now the nato-russian council was set up for that purpose .
it worked for awhile , but it clearly is n't working anymore .
winston churchill once said : " no matter how beautiful your strategy at some point you need to look at the results . "
the results are the trajectory of nato-russia relationships – whether it 's in energy security or overall security or missile defense – is not heading in a very constructive direction .
what role can germany play in improving these ties and negotiations ?
that 's something that germany will have to decide that for itself .
i can only say that these are difficult questions and i believe the german people and the german government – with their close relationship with the united states , their leadership in nato and the european community , their friendship with both eastern europe and russia – that they are in a unique position to begin stimulating both sides to ask these questions and begin to answer them .
i do n't have all the answers but i think i do know what some of the questions are .
how would the foreign policy of an obama 's presidency differ from that of the current us administration ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : nunn would like to see the us reduce its nuclear weapons arsenal i believe both obama and mccain would both move in different directions than this administration .
i 'm very confident on the obama side that he would listen to people in europe , i 'm certain that mccain would do likewise .
i believe both of them would try a more multilateral approach .
i believe obama would reach out and look for new directions of partnership between the united states and europe and i hope also with russia and with other people around the globe .
you have brought up the argument regarding nuclear weapons that it 's hard to convince others to quit smoking when you 're a chain smoker yourself .
does the us need to reduce its nuclear arsenal ?
i think we 've got far too many nuclear weapons .
i think the russians have far too many nuclear weapons .
i think all the nuclear powers need to look at how many they need .
but i also think it 's important to look at the operational status of those weapons .
this means the way you posture your nuclear weapons , whether they 're on quick alert , how rapidly they can be fired , the warning time , the decision time on both sides .
all of that is enormously important and just as important as the numbers .
so what i would like to see is military-to-military , civilian-to-civilian top-level discussions on how we can give each other more warning time .
the president of russia or the president of the united states would have more than a few minutes to decide whether to fire the weapons if they get a warning , which could be a false warning .
i do n't think anybody expects a first strike .
we 've moved away from confrontation .
there 's no more warsaw pact , no more soviet union , no more massive tank armies .
but we have not taken that into account in a significant way in the operational status of our forces .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : iran is watching closely how other countries deal with the nuclear issue if we really are serious about trying to keep countries like iran , north korea and others from acquiring nuclear weapons , then we ought to de-emphasize their importance .
we ought to make it clear to the world that we are not relying on those nuclear weapons for first strike unless we are struck ourselves with nuclear weapons .
as long as we , russia and other nuclear powers give nuclear weapons great prestige and we act as if they are essential for our own defense , it 's enormously difficult to try and convince other countries not to acquire these weapons .
and that 's where we are right now .
does this need for better cooperation between countries mean that the united states should become more involved in the united nations ?
on the nuclear side , certainly we ought to be more involved and we ought to get more behind iaea , the international atomic energy agency , that 's the official arm of the un in dealing with these questions .
this enormously important organization won the noble peace prize two years ago .
they are going to be increasingly important .
they need more funds , they need more help , they need more support .
it 's not just the united states , it 's our friends , germany and others , that need to understand that the iaea is being given a job without sufficient resources today .
so yes , we need to be more supportive in that regard . interview : jan m. schaefer -lrb- th -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

former us senator sam nunn spoke with deutsche welle about the foreign policy of both presidential candidates .
he also called on the us to decrease its nuclear arsenal and increase its support for the united nations . sam nunn , a former democratic senator , is often tipped for a leadership post should barack obama be elected president of the united states .
nunn , 59 , honed his foreign and military policy expertise as the chair of the senate armed services committee .
since leaving office in 1997 , he has devoted himself to working to reduce the threat from nuclear weapons and currently serves as the ceo of the nuclear threat initiative -lrb- nti -rrb- .
nunn was recently in berlin , where he spoke with deutsche welle .
you have said that germany can play an important role in bringing the united states , nato and russia closer to each other .
what specific measures could this involve ?
first , i think we have to decide and russia has to decide whether we want russia to be part of the europe-atlantic security arc .
if so , then we and russia need to start sitting down and talking about those issues : finding out what their problems are with security , trying to address those problems , giving each other reassurance , having military to military meetings .
now the nato-russian council was set up for that purpose .
it worked for awhile , but it clearly is n't working anymore .
winston churchill once said : " no matter how beautiful your strategy at some point you need to look at the results . "
the results are the trajectory of nato-russia relationships – whether it 's in energy security or overall security or missile defense – is not heading in a very constructive direction .
what role can germany play in improving these ties and negotiations ?
that 's something that germany will have to decide that for itself .
i can only say that these are difficult questions and i believe the german people and the german government – with their close relationship with the united states , their leadership in nato and the european community , their friendship with both eastern europe and russia – that they are in a unique position to begin stimulating both sides to ask these questions and begin to answer them .
i do n't have all the answers but i think i do know what some of the questions are .
how would the foreign policy of an obama 's presidency differ from that of the current us administration ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : nunn would like to see the us reduce its nuclear weapons arsenal i believe both obama and mccain would both move in different directions than this administration .
i 'm very confident on the obama side that he would listen to people in europe , i 'm certain that mccain would do likewise .
i believe both of them would try a more multilateral approach .
i believe obama would reach out and look for new directions of partnership between the united states and europe and i hope also with russia and with other people around the globe .
you have brought up the argument regarding nuclear weapons that it 's hard to convince others to quit smoking when you 're a chain smoker yourself .
does the us need to reduce its nuclear arsenal ?
i think we 've got far too many nuclear weapons .
i think the russians have far too many nuclear weapons .
i think all the nuclear powers need to look at how many they need .
but i also think it 's important to look at the operational status of those weapons .
this means the way you posture your nuclear weapons , whether they 're on quick alert , how rapidly they can be fired , the warning time , the decision time on both sides .
all of that is enormously important and just as important as the numbers .
so what i would like to see is military-to-military , civilian-to-civilian top-level discussions on how we can give each other more warning time .
the president of russia or the president of the united states would have more than a few minutes to decide whether to fire the weapons if they get a warning , which could be a false warning .
i do n't think anybody expects a first strike .
we 've moved away from confrontation .
there 's no more warsaw pact , no more soviet union , no more massive tank armies .
but we have not taken that into account in a significant way in the operational status of our forces .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : iran is watching closely how other countries deal with the nuclear issue if we really are serious about trying to keep countries like iran , north korea and others from acquiring nuclear weapons , then we ought to de-emphasize their importance .
we ought to make it clear to the world that we are not relying on those nuclear weapons for first strike unless we are struck ourselves with nuclear weapons .
as long as we , russia and other nuclear powers give nuclear weapons great prestige and we act as if they are essential for our own defense , it 's enormously difficult to try and convince other countries not to acquire these weapons .
and that 's where we are right now .
does this need for better cooperation between countries mean that the united states should become more involved in the united nations ?
on the nuclear side , certainly we ought to be more involved and we ought to get more behind iaea , the international atomic energy agency , that 's the official arm of the un in dealing with these questions .
this enormously important organization won the noble peace prize two years ago .
they are going to be increasingly important .
they need more funds , they need more help , they need more support .
it 's not just the united states , it 's our friends , germany and others , that need to understand that the iaea is being given a job without sufficient resources today .
so yes , we need to be more supportive in that regard . interview : jan m. schaefer -lrb- th -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

for the neutral , it would be a great soccer spectacle .
but for some fans , it would be a crisis of loyalties . spanish fans , especially those who follow real madrid , will rejoice that david villa 's last-gasp winner against sweden will almost certainly put off , for the time being , their having to achieve what world champions italy and runners-up france could not .
namely , avoid being turned over by a dutch team hitting peak form .
spain 's successes over russia and the swedes mean luis aragones ' men won group d after the russians defeated greece 1-0 on saturday and ended the greeks reign as european champions .
that means a quarter-final meeting with romania , france - or world champions italy , who controversially knocked the " furia roja " out in the last eight of the 1934 and 1994 world cups .
for many reasons , this allows the spanish faithful to breathe a little easier - at least for now .
if both the dutch and spain keep up their current form , they will put off the potentially juicy clash until later in the tournament and postpone a conflict of interest for spanish fans of the ' oranje ' .
real madrid 's dutchmen making spanish proud bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : robben and van nistelrooy have enjoyed success in spain in a country where club famously comes before country , real fans must feel they are in a win-win situation as their trio wesley sneijder , arjen robben and ruud van nistelrooy have been on fire for holland in two games where they have over-run both the italians and the french .
if and when the dutch and the spanish do meet , given their extensive personnel links , it will be an interesting meeting of soccer minds .
the dutch would have a slight advantage , given their intimate knowledge of the spanish system through playing in la liga .
giovanni van bronckhorst , who netted against the italians along with sneijder and van nistelrooy , spent four years at barcelona , though he has now returned home to feyenoord .
holland have for decades made superb travelers and their ability to indulge in cultural assimilation is second to none .
although they have a solid foundation of home-based players , nine in the squad turning out in the eredivisie , six more ply their trade in the english premiership .
real 's goalscoring trio aside ' only ' four play in spain - the fourth ' mosquetero ' being sevilla defender khalid boulahrouz .
holland stars find home-from-home in la liga but the links with la liga are tried and tested and spain has become almost a second home for a roll call of famous dutch players throughout the decades .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : dutchman frank rijkaard was coach at barcelona all that has changed recently is today real madrid are more orange than barcelona , who has traditionally had the deeper dutch hue with the likes of johan cruyff , fellow recent coaches louis van gaal and frank rijkaard and a long roll call of dutch internationals from johan neeskens to patrick kluivert and marc overmars .
real may of course try to balance things up next season by bringing in a portuguese-speaker in the shape of cristiano ronaldo .
portuguese has regularly been heard in the corridors of the nou camp - but barca 's preference in that regard has historically been for lusophones who hail from brazil .
whatever the domestic ramifications for next year 's la liga contest , one thing is clear on the evidence of euro 2008 to date : the dutch , with their 21st-century variant of total football are unquestionably the latinos of northern europe , with van basten a proponent of flair-fuelled , attacking football from the flanks - a concept foreign to so many teams today .
possible semi-final clash pits friends and colleagues bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : torres and villa have combined with lethal effect a quarter-final encounter with the swedes - or possibly the russians - would thus prove a fascinating clash of styles before a potential semi pitting holland 's real madrid forward line against real madrid pillars of the spanish defense in the shape of iker casillas and sergio ramos .
meanwhile , the dutch will have their defense tested - perhaps for the first time to such an extent in euro 2008 - by the hot form of valencia-liverpool tandem david villa and fernando torres .
it would make for a fascinating contest at any level bit let 's hope there is much to play for when these two countries meet . dw staff / afp -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the suits allege the european aircraft manufacturer misled investors . two us law firms have filed a lawsuit against the european aerospace giant , accusing its managers of misleading investors about the company 's finances and its ability to meet delivery deadlines for its a380 jet .
delays with the a380 superjumbo has caused major headaches for eads .
new york-based law firm dreier llp , which filed one lawsuit , said in a statement monday , june 16 that managers and core eads shareholders engaged in " rampant insider trading based on their knowledge of the problems surrounding the a380 . "
eads already knew in 2005 and 2006 that problems were looming and raced to sell their shares , according to the lawsuit .

" the appointment should be made this week , " a senior un official told reuters on condition of anonymity on tuesday , june 17 .
" the planned arrival is on friday . "
zannier , a career diplomat and former director of the osce 's conflict prevention center in vienna , becomes the seventh special representative of the un secretary-general in kosovo since a nato bombing campaign in 1999 forced serb forces to halt the killing and ethnic cleansing of albanians during a crackdown on guerrillas .

but un veto holder russia , which backs serbia in opposing kosovo 's secession , has blocked the withdrawal of the mission , believing that the new state would claim more credibility without its overseers in attendance .
ethnic albanian-majority kosovo 's parliament declared its independence from serbia on february 17 .
it has since been recognized by the united states and most members of the european union .
serbia and russia vehemently oppose kosovo 's independence and the introduction of an eu police and justice mission dubbed eulex to the territory , without the approval of the un security council .
new representative 's powers unclear the appointment of zannier appears to be an attempt at a compromise by the un secretary-general ban ki-moon , who has said that the italian 's appointment would be part of proposals to " reconfigure " the mission .

it had been the eu 's hope to have a 2,200-strong police and justice mission up and running by june 15 , when kosovo 's first state constitution came into being .

" the appointment should be made this week , " a senior un official told reuters on condition of anonymity on tuesday , june 17 .
" the planned arrival is on friday . "
zannier , a career diplomat and former director of the osce 's conflict prevention center in vienna , becomes the seventh special representative of the un secretary-general in kosovo since a nato bombing campaign in 1999 forced serb forces to halt the killing and ethnic cleansing of albanians during a crackdown on guerrillas .

but un veto holder russia , which backs serbia in opposing kosovo 's secession , has blocked the withdrawal of the mission , believing that the new state would claim more credibility without its overseers in attendance .
ethnic albanian-majority kosovo 's parliament declared its independence from serbia on february 17 .
it has since been recognized by the united states and most members of the european union .
serbia and russia vehemently oppose kosovo 's independence and the introduction of an eu police and justice mission dubbed eulex to the territory , without the approval of the un security council .
new representative 's powers unclear the appointment of zannier appears to be an attempt at a compromise by the un secretary-general ban ki-moon , who has said that the italian 's appointment would be part of proposals to " reconfigure " the mission .

it had been the eu 's hope to have a 2,200-strong police and justice mission up and running by june 15 , when kosovo 's first state constitution came into being .

former us senator sam nunn spoke with deutsche welle about the foreign policy of both presidential candidates .
he also called on the us to decrease its nuclear arsenal and increase its support for the united nations . sam nunn , a former democratic senator , is often tipped for a leadership post should barack obama be elected president of the united states .
nunn , 59 , honed his foreign and military policy expertise as the chair of the senate armed services committee .
since leaving office in 1997 , he has devoted himself to working to reduce the threat from nuclear weapons and currently serves as the ceo of the nuclear threat initiative -lrb- nti -rrb- .
nunn was recently in berlin , where he spoke with deutsche welle .
you have said that germany can play an important role in bringing the united states , nato and russia closer to each other .
what specific measures could this involve ?
first , i think we have to decide and russia has to decide whether we want russia to be part of the europe-atlantic security arc .
if so , then we and russia need to start sitting down and talking about those issues : finding out what their problems are with security , trying to address those problems , giving each other reassurance , having military to military meetings .
now the nato-russian council was set up for that purpose .
it worked for awhile , but it clearly is n't working anymore .
winston churchill once said : " no matter how beautiful your strategy at some point you need to look at the results . "
the results are the trajectory of nato-russia relationships – whether it 's in energy security or overall security or missile defense – is not heading in a very constructive direction .
what role can germany play in improving these ties and negotiations ?
that 's something that germany will have to decide that for itself .
i can only say that these are difficult questions and i believe the german people and the german government – with their close relationship with the united states , their leadership in nato and the european community , their friendship with both eastern europe and russia – that they are in a unique position to begin stimulating both sides to ask these questions and begin to answer them .
i do n't have all the answers but i think i do know what some of the questions are .
how would the foreign policy of an obama 's presidency differ from that of the current us administration ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : nunn would like to see the us reduce its nuclear weapons arsenal i believe both obama and mccain would both move in different directions than this administration .
i 'm very confident on the obama side that he would listen to people in europe , i 'm certain that mccain would do likewise .
i believe both of them would try a more multilateral approach .
i believe obama would reach out and look for new directions of partnership between the united states and europe and i hope also with russia and with other people around the globe .
you have brought up the argument regarding nuclear weapons that it 's hard to convince others to quit smoking when you 're a chain smoker yourself .
does the us need to reduce its nuclear arsenal ?
i think we 've got far too many nuclear weapons .
i think the russians have far too many nuclear weapons .
i think all the nuclear powers need to look at how many they need .
but i also think it 's important to look at the operational status of those weapons .
this means the way you posture your nuclear weapons , whether they 're on quick alert , how rapidly they can be fired , the warning time , the decision time on both sides .
all of that is enormously important and just as important as the numbers .
so what i would like to see is military-to-military , civilian-to-civilian top-level discussions on how we can give each other more warning time .
the president of russia or the president of the united states would have more than a few minutes to decide whether to fire the weapons if they get a warning , which could be a false warning .
i do n't think anybody expects a first strike .
we 've moved away from confrontation .
there 's no more warsaw pact , no more soviet union , no more massive tank armies .
but we have not taken that into account in a significant way in the operational status of our forces .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : iran is watching closely how other countries deal with the nuclear issue if we really are serious about trying to keep countries like iran , north korea and others from acquiring nuclear weapons , then we ought to de-emphasize their importance .
we ought to make it clear to the world that we are not relying on those nuclear weapons for first strike unless we are struck ourselves with nuclear weapons .
as long as we , russia and other nuclear powers give nuclear weapons great prestige and we act as if they are essential for our own defense , it 's enormously difficult to try and convince other countries not to acquire these weapons .
and that 's where we are right now .
does this need for better cooperation between countries mean that the united states should become more involved in the united nations ?

" we are n't going to overcome the crisis when we lecture the irish or when we put them in the corner , " juncker said after a meeting of the eu 's 27 foreign ministers on monday , june 16 .
it would be " arrogant " to tell the irish that their votes do n't count because they are from a small country , juncker said in an article in the financial times deutschland newspaper .
small countries do n't like it when big countries lecture them , juncker said in the article , which was published tuesday .
yet it would also be a mistake for europe to leave ireland behind , juncker said .
he particularly criticized german and french leaders who hinted that the ratification could go forward despite the irish " no " vote .
eu grapples with ireland question bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : are the needs of small countries being ignored ?
less than a week ago , a majority of irish rejected the eu treaty , which is designed to make the bloc more efficient and give it a stronger voice in the world .
while there was n't any one issue which sunk the treaty , voters seemed concerned that it would overrule national laws on sensitive issues such as abortion , taxation and military neutrality .
at their first meeting after the vote on monday , foreign ministers discussed whether ireland could be offered concessions which could convince irish voters to pass a new referendum on the lisbon treaty later this year .
some suggested drafting a declaration which would include assurances that ireland could opt out of a number of key areas .
ireland is the only eu country whose constitution requires new eu treaties to be approved via a referendum .
while 18 national parliaments have already said yes to lisbon , the treaty can not come into force until it is ratified by all 27 member states .
germany wants decision this year bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : juncker said big eu countries are being arrogant while most eu ministers wanted to wait before deciding how to proceed , german foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier said that a solution would need to be found " this year . "
steinmeier also suggested that " the danish model from 1992 could be a model in this crisis . "
in 1992 , denmark voted against the maastricht treaty that created the european union out of the european community .
however , a repeat referendum a year later approved the treaty after the danish government won legally-binding opt-outs in such areas as defense , justice and citizenship .
keeping europe together bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : eu foreign ministers want ireland to figure out a plan so far , no one has openly called for the expansion of a two-speed europe , where some countries would move forward with integration while leaving the others out .
this already exists in some areas , such as the common currency -lrb- not all countries use the euro -rrb- and the schengen agreement -lrb- not all countries allow free movement . -rrb-
" it is hard to imagine that a two-speed europe could be created in questions such as decision-making procedures and the institutions , " said latvia 's maris riekstins .
but members were adamant on monday that the lisbon treaty was still viable .
british foreign minister david miliband said that monday 's meeting had left three things clear : the irish vote needs to be respected , the irish government needs some time to decide the next move and europe needs to " stick together . "
eu to ponder what went wrong bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : will the irish vote again ?
and while austria 's ursula plassnik said it would be unfair to corner ireland and force the country to undergo a revote , denmark 's per stig moeller said that since the irish government had signed the treaty , it was now up to ireland to find a solution .
the eu executive has commissioned a survey to try and find out what went wrong in ireland , and most ministers concurred on monday that dublin would know best .
" there will not be any attempt from the outside , from member states or from brussels , to influence or push the irish government in some way , " latvia 's riekstins said .
yet ireland might not be the only stumbling block to the treaty coming intoforce .
the czech republic 's government has referred the treaty text to its constitutional court .

for the neutral , it would be a great soccer spectacle .
but for some fans , it would be a crisis of loyalties . spanish fans , especially those who follow real madrid , will rejoice that david villa 's last-gasp winner against sweden will almost certainly put off , for the time being , their having to achieve what world champions italy and runners-up france could not .
namely , avoid being turned over by a dutch team hitting peak form .
spain 's successes over russia and the swedes mean luis aragones ' men won group d after the russians defeated greece 1-0 on saturday and ended the greeks reign as european champions .
that means a quarter-final meeting with romania , france - or world champions italy , who controversially knocked the " furia roja " out in the last eight of the 1934 and 1994 world cups .
for many reasons , this allows the spanish faithful to breathe a little easier - at least for now .
if both the dutch and spain keep up their current form , they will put off the potentially juicy clash until later in the tournament and postpone a conflict of interest for spanish fans of the ' oranje ' .
real madrid 's dutchmen making spanish proud bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : robben and van nistelrooy have enjoyed success in spain in a country where club famously comes before country , real fans must feel they are in a win-win situation as their trio wesley sneijder , arjen robben and ruud van nistelrooy have been on fire for holland in two games where they have over-run both the italians and the french .
if and when the dutch and the spanish do meet , given their extensive personnel links , it will be an interesting meeting of soccer minds .
the dutch would have a slight advantage , given their intimate knowledge of the spanish system through playing in la liga .
giovanni van bronckhorst , who netted against the italians along with sneijder and van nistelrooy , spent four years at barcelona , though he has now returned home to feyenoord .
holland have for decades made superb travelers and their ability to indulge in cultural assimilation is second to none .
although they have a solid foundation of home-based players , nine in the squad turning out in the eredivisie , six more ply their trade in the english premiership .
real 's goalscoring trio aside ' only ' four play in spain - the fourth ' mosquetero ' being sevilla defender khalid boulahrouz .
holland stars find home-from-home in la liga but the links with la liga are tried and tested and spain has become almost a second home for a roll call of famous dutch players throughout the decades .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : dutchman frank rijkaard was coach at barcelona all that has changed recently is today real madrid are more orange than barcelona , who has traditionally had the deeper dutch hue with the likes of johan cruyff , fellow recent coaches louis van gaal and frank rijkaard and a long roll call of dutch internationals from johan neeskens to patrick kluivert and marc overmars .
real may of course try to balance things up next season by bringing in a portuguese-speaker in the shape of cristiano ronaldo .
portuguese has regularly been heard in the corridors of the nou camp - but barca 's preference in that regard has historically been for lusophones who hail from brazil .
whatever the domestic ramifications for next year 's la liga contest , one thing is clear on the evidence of euro 2008 to date : the dutch , with their 21st-century variant of total football are unquestionably the latinos of northern europe , with van basten a proponent of flair-fuelled , attacking football from the flanks - a concept foreign to so many teams today .
possible semi-final clash pits friends and colleagues bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : torres and villa have combined with lethal effect a quarter-final encounter with the swedes - or possibly the russians - would thus prove a fascinating clash of styles before a potential semi pitting holland 's real madrid forward line against real madrid pillars of the spanish defense in the shape of iker casillas and sergio ramos .
meanwhile , the dutch will have their defense tested - perhaps for the first time to such an extent in euro 2008 - by the hot form of valencia-liverpool tandem david villa and fernando torres .
it would make for a fascinating contest at any level bit let 's hope there is much to play for when these two countries meet . dw staff / afp -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

but the scientists said they would like to study the issue longer to make absolutely sure that young children exposed to such electro-magnetic fields did not develop health problems in old age . the bureau , which employs top radiation scientists , advised parents not to let children keep phones permanently in their clothing until such a risk had been ruled out .
large numbers of germans fear mobile phones may be lethal after alarming reports about them in the media .
more than 50 german research projects since 2002 were analyzed for the report .
in some cases , genetic activity in human cells was observed to change under the influence of radiation , but this did not alter the overall conclusion that the phones were safe .

the german captain 's goal gave his side the 1-0 victory they needed to advance with croatia from group b into the quarter-finals .
before the game , an austrian newspaper had handed out a newsprint for the game showing a nude ballack with the headline " strip him naked . "
the 31-year-old was visibly relieved after the game .
" we put ourselves into a very difficult situation ahead of the match , " he said .
" the defeat against croatia meant that we could not lose against austria , and that put us under a lot of pressure . "
germany captain silences his doubters bildunterschrift : ballack 's thunderbolt silenced his critics and eliminated austria asked what he had meant to say with his sign after scoring , ballack said that much had been written ahead of the game .
" if you read everything that the austrian press and public said , you would have believed that they had won the world cup three times and that we could hardly kick a ball , " he said .
" that is why i think that my goal silenced them . "
ballack could quite easily have used the gesture , too , to silence his own critics , who have been multiplying since a far-from impressive display by the german captain in germany 's 2-1 loss to croatia in their previous game .
" we wanted to win this game against austria , as we came here with a goal , " he said .
" we did not want to be eliminated after the first round , and for that we worked very hard .
i think you ca n't fault our work-rate in the game against austria .
" obviously we 're happy to have made it to the quarter-finals , particularly after the difficult match we had against croatia , " he added .
" we had everything to lose and we were certainly favorites to win -lrb- against austria -rrb- .
you could tell that we were not as agile as we should have been because we tensed up , yet our desire to win proved decisive . "
respect , but no fear bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : with players like deco and ronaldo , portugal are a force looking ahead to their quarter-final clash , ballack said he had a lot of respect for portugal , who looked very impressive in their first two matches at the finals .
" but we do not fear them , " he said .
" they are a good side , and it is practically a rematch from the game at the world cup in 2006 .
but we do not have to be scared of them .
i know several portugal players , not just those that i play with .
" all their players are very good individually and they play well as a team as well , " he said .
" they 're very good in attack and not too focused on defense .
they have great players , not least -lrb- cristiano -rrb- ronaldo , who had a great season in england and it will be a very difficult task .
" nobody has to tell us that they are good players .
i am also looking forward to playing against their coach , who will be coaching me at chelsea next season . "
for ballack and his team-mates , the game against austria could well have been a turning point .
the win over austria was certainly a step in the right direction toward the german goal of winning a fourth european title .
but portugal will be a very different proposition to austria .
" both teams want to go far in this competition and portugal are probably favorites , ” ballack said .
“ we 've maybe slipped to a different role and who knows , maybe that will favor us . "
reactions are muted both home and abroad germany reacted more relieved than delighted to the national team 's euro 2008 quarter-final berth as the 1-0 win against austria gave no reason for optimism . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the fans celebrated but more with a sense of relief tens of thousands of germans partied in the nation 's fan zones during the game but post-match celebrations were very subdued - given the poor quality of play in vienna which only saw one glorious moment from the winning free-kick by ballack . " ballack fulfils the minimal goal , " said kicker sports magazine on its web site , naming the germans ' performance " anything but convincing . " the bild daily spoke of " many individual mistakes " as germany stumbled into a quarter-final date with portugal on thursday . german football icon franz beckenbauer struck a similar line in his column in bild . " do we have a chance against cristiano ronaldo and his portuguese with such a performance ?
no , definitely not , " he said .
" our 11 must improve considerably to reach the semi-finals .
the german midfield appeared to be lacking ideas , there was hardly any passing . " german press see no reason the cheer the sueddeutsche zeitung -lrb- sz -rrb- also issued a devastating assessment , fearing a return to the poor " rumble " soccer germany played in the first years of the decade . " on thursday , portugal waits for the uninspired team of coach joachim loew , which appears to be drawing close the rumble soccer era again which seemed to have been overcome , " the sz said . the german media had mixed feelings about portugal .
some pointed out that germany wrapped up its great 2006 world cup campaign with a 3-1 win over portugal in the match for third place .
but also not forgotten was a 3-0 humiliation at euro 2000 . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : loew lost his cool with the official and hickersburger there was also concern whether loew will be able to coach his team from the sideline on thursday in basle , switzerland , as he was sent off -lrb- along with austrian helmsman josef hickersberger -rrb- after a dispute with the fourth match official . the ruling body uefa was expected to deal with the case and issue a ruling later tuesday , with kicker naming a ban " possible . " germany 's performance did also not raise eyebrows abroad . foreign papers mostly unimpressed austria lamented its first-round exit as host , but the kronenzeitung pointed out that only " the individual class of ballack made the difference . " the chelsea midfielder was also singled out elsewhere , with italy 's la gazzetta dello sport speaking of " not much game , a lot of ballack " and britain 's the sun saying : " ball of fame , chelsea ace comes up trumps . " but the guardian did not rule out a german improvement , saying that ballack could become the vital figure for germany in the aim to reach its goal of going very far in the tournament . " germany have one of euro 2008 's more influential players - and that , in itself , should give them hope for the remainder of a competition in which , thus far , they have flickered without truly igniting , " the paper wrote . dw staff / dpa -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

italy , meanwhile , remain positive despite coming under intense pressure . the backdrop to this latest installment of the rivalry between the old foes could not be more different to their last meeting in a major tournament .
back in 2006 , italy overcame france at berlin 's majestic olympic stadium to be crowned champions of the world .
on tuesday at euro 2008 , those two same soccer superpowers roll up their sleeves in a back alley scrap for a route out of group c on the heels of already qualified holland .
wide margin defeats to the dutch -lrb- 3-0 and 4-1 respectively -rrb- and 1-1 and 0-0 draws with romania left italy and france requiring a win and romania to draw or lose to holland .
given their inferior goal difference that is the only way france can make it .
italy would still have a chance if they draw with france , and romania lose , leaving them both with two points .
here the permutations require the services of a rocket scientist , but in a nutshell italy would go through if they produce a score draw with france and romania lose .
the reward is a quarter-final date with group d winners spain in vienna next sunday .
shaky rearguard without vieira 's protection again france keeper gregory coupet , reeling from france 's heaviest defeat in almost three decades against the dutch , summed up the somber mood in les bleus ' camp .
" today we 've got our heads down , " he said at the team 's training headquarters in chatel-saint-denis on sunday , the day after the holland game .
" there 's tiredness , questions being asked . we need time to breathe and to prepare quickly for italy . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : france will be without their captain patrick vieira france , whose famed defense , the traditional bedrock of raymond domenech 's side , was embarrassingly torn apart by holland , will continue to be without talismanic captain patrick vieira who missed the opening two games with a left thigh problem .
domenech has a real tactical conundrum on his hands as he 's already tried 4-4-2 and 4-3-2-1 with different players - while his opposite number roberto donadoni made no fewer than five changes for the azzurri 's second game against romania .
hero buffon accepts fragile lifeline italy would already be down and out if it had n't been for keeper gianluigi buffon 's heroics in saving a late penalty from adrian mutu .
" this is the match of our lives , " said the italian keeper .
" after suffering a defeat such as we did against holland you either roll over or you appeal to your pride and that 's what we did against romania .
like ourselves , france will be surprised only to have mustered one point after two matches .
but it seems that italy are on better form as we have come off a good match . "
bildunterschrift : gianluigi buffon was beaten three times against the dutch both sides know each other well with france coming out on top when they met in the euro 2000 final only for italy to gain handsome compensation in the 2006 world cup .
they were also drawn together in qualifying for this competition .
thierry henry , who was deployed as a lone striker in that game , reflecting on the monumental task lying ahead in zurich , said : " now we know that we have to beat italy and hope for good news from the other match .
it 's ' do-able ' but it 's going to be a knife edge game with the italians .
we still have a possibility of qualifying , we 're not defeated .
" this is not the first time we 've been in this situation and i hope once more we can lift our heads and get out of it .
we 'll try and prepare the best possible for italy , " he added .
donadoni convinced his players are up for it up at their euro headquarters in austria , donadoni said he could sense the determination in his players to pull off a houdini-style escape against les bleus .
" we have to beat france , " the former ac milan winger said .
" it is a crucial match because when you still have a chance to qualify , you have to push yourself to the limit .
i saw already at training ... that the players are determined to prove how good they are against the french .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : italy 's players train for " the match of their lives " " they have a real hunger to prepare in the best possible manner for this challenge , which will dictate whether or not we progress or not , " he added .
" we are ready .
it is the last match of the group stages , we know what is at stake and we will put our heart and soul into winning what is a key match . "
donadoni said statistics and records mean nothing in a game like this .
" it has been said that italy has not managed to beat france in a normal game for 30 years , " donadoni said .
" but the statistics , quite frankly , are n't important .
before last week , it had been 30 years since the netherlands last beat italy and we all know what happened there . "
striking dilemma adds to italian woes as his side have scored just one goal in two games , donadoni admitted he is considering playing sampdoria striker antonio cassano up front alongside bayern munich 's luca toni .
having used udinese 's antonio di natale against the dutch and juventus star alessandro del piero against romania , the azzurri 's forwards have yet to fire in the tournament .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : which of italy 's strikers will be in the pink on tuesday ?
" you will see who i select on the day , " donadoni said .
" cassano reminds me of myself when i was playing , but he plays more forward , while i had other responsibilities .
he does n't help out so much at getting the ball back , which irritates me sometimes as soccer is also about playing when you do n't have the ball . "
donadoni insists all concentration will be in zurich rather than the other group c clash between the dutch and romanians in berne .
" you ca n't afford to think about the other match , those things are out of our control , " said the italian .
" all that worries us is to do the best we can .
after that we may not have our destiny in our own hands , but we just have to get on with the job in hand . " our suitcases are n't packed yet , they are still open .

former us senator sam nunn spoke with deutsche welle about the foreign policy of both presidential candidates .
he also called on the us to decrease its nuclear arsenal and increase its support for the united nations . sam nunn , a former democratic senator , is often tipped for a leadership post should barack obama be elected president of the united states .
nunn , 59 , honed his foreign and military policy expertise as the chair of the senate armed services committee .
since leaving office in 1997 , he has devoted himself to working to reduce the threat from nuclear weapons and currently serves as the ceo of the nuclear threat initiative -lrb- nti -rrb- .
nunn was recently in berlin , where he spoke with deutsche welle .
you have said that germany can play an important role in bringing the united states , nato and russia closer to each other .
what specific measures could this involve ?
first , i think we have to decide and russia has to decide whether we want russia to be part of the europe-atlantic security arc .
if so , then we and russia need to start sitting down and talking about those issues : finding out what their problems are with security , trying to address those problems , giving each other reassurance , having military to military meetings .
now the nato-russian council was set up for that purpose .
it worked for awhile , but it clearly is n't working anymore .
winston churchill once said : " no matter how beautiful your strategy at some point you need to look at the results . "
the results are the trajectory of nato-russia relationships – whether it 's in energy security or overall security or missile defense – is not heading in a very constructive direction .
what role can germany play in improving these ties and negotiations ?
that 's something that germany will have to decide that for itself .
i can only say that these are difficult questions and i believe the german people and the german government – with their close relationship with the united states , their leadership in nato and the european community , their friendship with both eastern europe and russia – that they are in a unique position to begin stimulating both sides to ask these questions and begin to answer them .
i do n't have all the answers but i think i do know what some of the questions are .
how would the foreign policy of an obama 's presidency differ from that of the current us administration ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : nunn would like to see the us reduce its nuclear weapons arsenal i believe both obama and mccain would both move in different directions than this administration .
i 'm very confident on the obama side that he would listen to people in europe , i 'm certain that mccain would do likewise .
i believe both of them would try a more multilateral approach .
i believe obama would reach out and look for new directions of partnership between the united states and europe and i hope also with russia and with other people around the globe .
you have brought up the argument regarding nuclear weapons that it 's hard to convince others to quit smoking when you 're a chain smoker yourself .
does the us need to reduce its nuclear arsenal ?
i think we 've got far too many nuclear weapons .
i think the russians have far too many nuclear weapons .
i think all the nuclear powers need to look at how many they need .
but i also think it 's important to look at the operational status of those weapons .
this means the way you posture your nuclear weapons , whether they 're on quick alert , how rapidly they can be fired , the warning time , the decision time on both sides .
all of that is enormously important and just as important as the numbers .
so what i would like to see is military-to-military , civilian-to-civilian top-level discussions on how we can give each other more warning time .
the president of russia or the president of the united states would have more than a few minutes to decide whether to fire the weapons if they get a warning , which could be a false warning .
i do n't think anybody expects a first strike .
we 've moved away from confrontation .
there 's no more warsaw pact , no more soviet union , no more massive tank armies .
but we have not taken that into account in a significant way in the operational status of our forces .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : iran is watching closely how other countries deal with the nuclear issue if we really are serious about trying to keep countries like iran , north korea and others from acquiring nuclear weapons , then we ought to de-emphasize their importance .
we ought to make it clear to the world that we are not relying on those nuclear weapons for first strike unless we are struck ourselves with nuclear weapons .
as long as we , russia and other nuclear powers give nuclear weapons great prestige and we act as if they are essential for our own defense , it 's enormously difficult to try and convince other countries not to acquire these weapons .
and that 's where we are right now .
does this need for better cooperation between countries mean that the united states should become more involved in the united nations ?
on the nuclear side , certainly we ought to be more involved and we ought to get more behind iaea , the international atomic energy agency , that 's the official arm of the un in dealing with these questions .
this enormously important organization won the noble peace prize two years ago .
they are going to be increasingly important .
they need more funds , they need more help , they need more support .
it 's not just the united states , it 's our friends , germany and others , that need to understand that the iaea is being given a job without sufficient resources today .
so yes , we need to be more supportive in that regard . interview : jan m. schaefer -lrb- th -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

you have said that germany can play an important role in bringing the united states , nato and russia closer to each other .
what specific measures could this involve ?
first , i think we have to decide and russia has to decide whether we want russia to be part of the europe-atlantic security arc .
if so , then we and russia need to start sitting down and talking about those issues : finding out what their problems are with security , trying to address those problems , giving each other reassurance , having military to military meetings .
now the nato-russian council was set up for that purpose .
it worked for awhile , but it clearly is n't working anymore .
winston churchill once said : " no matter how beautiful your strategy at some point you need to look at the results . "
the results are the trajectory of nato-russia relationships – whether it 's in energy security or overall security or missile defense – is not heading in a very constructive direction .
what role can germany play in improving these ties and negotiations ?
that 's something that germany will have to decide that for itself .
i can only say that these are difficult questions and i believe the german people and the german government – with their close relationship with the united states , their leadership in nato and the european community , their friendship with both eastern europe and russia – that they are in a unique position to begin stimulating both sides to ask these questions and begin to answer them .
i do n't have all the answers but i think i do know what some of the questions are .
how would the foreign policy of an obama 's presidency differ from that of the current us administration ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : nunn would like to see the us reduce its nuclear weapons arsenal i believe both obama and mccain would both move in different directions than this administration .
i 'm very confident on the obama side that he would listen to people in europe , i 'm certain that mccain would do likewise .
i believe both of them would try a more multilateral approach .
i believe obama would reach out and look for new directions of partnership between the united states and europe and i hope also with russia and with other people around the globe .
you have brought up the argument regarding nuclear weapons that it 's hard to convince others to quit smoking when you 're a chain smoker yourself .
does the us need to reduce its nuclear arsenal ?
i think we 've got far too many nuclear weapons .
i think the russians have far too many nuclear weapons .
i think all the nuclear powers need to look at how many they need .
but i also think it 's important to look at the operational status of those weapons .
this means the way you posture your nuclear weapons , whether they 're on quick alert , how rapidly they can be fired , the warning time , the decision time on both sides .
all of that is enormously important and just as important as the numbers .
so what i would like to see is military-to-military , civilian-to-civilian top-level discussions on how we can give each other more warning time .
the president of russia or the president of the united states would have more than a few minutes to decide whether to fire the weapons if they get a warning , which could be a false warning .
i do n't think anybody expects a first strike .
we 've moved away from confrontation .
there 's no more warsaw pact , no more soviet union , no more massive tank armies .
but we have not taken that into account in a significant way in the operational status of our forces .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : iran is watching closely how other countries deal with the nuclear issue if we really are serious about trying to keep countries like iran , north korea and others from acquiring nuclear weapons , then we ought to de-emphasize their importance .
we ought to make it clear to the world that we are not relying on those nuclear weapons for first strike unless we are struck ourselves with nuclear weapons .
as long as we , russia and other nuclear powers give nuclear weapons great prestige and we act as if they are essential for our own defense , it 's enormously difficult to try and convince other countries not to acquire these weapons .
and that 's where we are right now .
does this need for better cooperation between countries mean that the united states should become more involved in the united nations ?
on the nuclear side , certainly we ought to be more involved and we ought to get more behind iaea , the international atomic energy agency , that 's the official arm of the un in dealing with these questions .
this enormously important organization won the noble peace prize two years ago .
they are going to be increasingly important .
they need more funds , they need more help , they need more support .
it 's not just the united states , it 's our friends , germany and others , that need to understand that the iaea is being given a job without sufficient resources today .
so yes , we need to be more supportive in that regard . interview : jan m. schaefer -lrb- th -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" we are n't going to overcome the crisis when we lecture the irish or when we put them in the corner , " juncker said after a meeting of the eu 's 27 foreign ministers on monday , june 16 .
it would be " arrogant " to tell the irish that their votes do n't count because they are from a small country , juncker said in an article in the financial times deutschland newspaper .
small countries do n't like it when big countries lecture them , juncker said in the article , which was published tuesday .
yet it would also be a mistake for europe to leave ireland behind , juncker said .
he particularly criticized german and french leaders who hinted that the ratification could go forward despite the irish " no " vote .
eu grapples with ireland question bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : are the needs of small countries being ignored ?
less than a week ago , a majority of irish rejected the eu treaty , which is designed to make the bloc more efficient and give it a stronger voice in the world .
while there was n't any one issue which sunk the treaty , voters seemed concerned that it would overrule national laws on sensitive issues such as abortion , taxation and military neutrality .
at their first meeting after the vote on monday , foreign ministers discussed whether ireland could be offered concessions which could convince irish voters to pass a new referendum on the lisbon treaty later this year .
some suggested drafting a declaration which would include assurances that ireland could opt out of a number of key areas .
ireland is the only eu country whose constitution requires new eu treaties to be approved via a referendum .
while 18 national parliaments have already said yes to lisbon , the treaty can not come into force until it is ratified by all 27 member states .
germany wants decision this year bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : juncker said big eu countries are being arrogant while most eu ministers wanted to wait before deciding how to proceed , german foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier said that a solution would need to be found " this year . "
steinmeier also suggested that " the danish model from 1992 could be a model in this crisis . "
in 1992 , denmark voted against the maastricht treaty that created the european union out of the european community .
however , a repeat referendum a year later approved the treaty after the danish government won legally-binding opt-outs in such areas as defense , justice and citizenship .
keeping europe together bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : eu foreign ministers want ireland to figure out a plan so far , no one has openly called for the expansion of a two-speed europe , where some countries would move forward with integration while leaving the others out .
this already exists in some areas , such as the common currency -lrb- not all countries use the euro -rrb- and the schengen agreement -lrb- not all countries allow free movement . -rrb-
" it is hard to imagine that a two-speed europe could be created in questions such as decision-making procedures and the institutions , " said latvia 's maris riekstins .
but members were adamant on monday that the lisbon treaty was still viable .
british foreign minister david miliband said that monday 's meeting had left three things clear : the irish vote needs to be respected , the irish government needs some time to decide the next move and europe needs to " stick together . "
eu to ponder what went wrong bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : will the irish vote again ?
and while austria 's ursula plassnik said it would be unfair to corner ireland and force the country to undergo a revote , denmark 's per stig moeller said that since the irish government had signed the treaty , it was now up to ireland to find a solution .
the eu executive has commissioned a survey to try and find out what went wrong in ireland , and most ministers concurred on monday that dublin would know best .
" there will not be any attempt from the outside , from member states or from brussels , to influence or push the irish government in some way , " latvia 's riekstins said .
yet ireland might not be the only stumbling block to the treaty coming intoforce .
the czech republic 's government has referred the treaty text to its constitutional court .

for the neutral , it would be a great soccer spectacle .
but for some fans , it would be a crisis of loyalties . spanish fans , especially those who follow real madrid , will rejoice that david villa 's last-gasp winner against sweden will almost certainly put off , for the time being , their having to achieve what world champions italy and runners-up france could not .
namely , avoid being turned over by a dutch team hitting peak form .
spain 's successes over russia and the swedes mean luis aragones ' men won group d after the russians defeated greece 1-0 on saturday and ended the greeks reign as european champions .
that means a quarter-final meeting with romania , france - or world champions italy , who controversially knocked the " furia roja " out in the last eight of the 1934 and 1994 world cups .
for many reasons , this allows the spanish faithful to breathe a little easier - at least for now .
if both the dutch and spain keep up their current form , they will put off the potentially juicy clash until later in the tournament and postpone a conflict of interest for spanish fans of the ' oranje ' .
real madrid 's dutchmen making spanish proud bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : robben and van nistelrooy have enjoyed success in spain in a country where club famously comes before country , real fans must feel they are in a win-win situation as their trio wesley sneijder , arjen robben and ruud van nistelrooy have been on fire for holland in two games where they have over-run both the italians and the french .
if and when the dutch and the spanish do meet , given their extensive personnel links , it will be an interesting meeting of soccer minds .
the dutch would have a slight advantage , given their intimate knowledge of the spanish system through playing in la liga .
giovanni van bronckhorst , who netted against the italians along with sneijder and van nistelrooy , spent four years at barcelona , though he has now returned home to feyenoord .
holland have for decades made superb travelers and their ability to indulge in cultural assimilation is second to none .
although they have a solid foundation of home-based players , nine in the squad turning out in the eredivisie , six more ply their trade in the english premiership .
real 's goalscoring trio aside ' only ' four play in spain - the fourth ' mosquetero ' being sevilla defender khalid boulahrouz .
holland stars find home-from-home in la liga but the links with la liga are tried and tested and spain has become almost a second home for a roll call of famous dutch players throughout the decades .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : dutchman frank rijkaard was coach at barcelona all that has changed recently is today real madrid are more orange than barcelona , who has traditionally had the deeper dutch hue with the likes of johan cruyff , fellow recent coaches louis van gaal and frank rijkaard and a long roll call of dutch internationals from johan neeskens to patrick kluivert and marc overmars .
real may of course try to balance things up next season by bringing in a portuguese-speaker in the shape of cristiano ronaldo .
portuguese has regularly been heard in the corridors of the nou camp - but barca 's preference in that regard has historically been for lusophones who hail from brazil .
whatever the domestic ramifications for next year 's la liga contest , one thing is clear on the evidence of euro 2008 to date : the dutch , with their 21st-century variant of total football are unquestionably the latinos of northern europe , with van basten a proponent of flair-fuelled , attacking football from the flanks - a concept foreign to so many teams today .
possible semi-final clash pits friends and colleagues bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : torres and villa have combined with lethal effect a quarter-final encounter with the swedes - or possibly the russians - would thus prove a fascinating clash of styles before a potential semi pitting holland 's real madrid forward line against real madrid pillars of the spanish defense in the shape of iker casillas and sergio ramos .
meanwhile , the dutch will have their defense tested - perhaps for the first time to such an extent in euro 2008 - by the hot form of valencia-liverpool tandem david villa and fernando torres .
it would make for a fascinating contest at any level bit let 's hope there is much to play for when these two countries meet . dw staff / afp -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" the secretary general welcomes the announcement by french president sarkozy that there are no obstacles to france rejoining the integrated command , " nato spokesman james appathurai said on tuesday , june 17 . the white house likewise embraced the move .
" we welcome the announcement , " gordon johndroe , white house national security spokesman , said . stephen hadley , president george w. bush 's national security adviser , said in april at the nato summit in bucharest that bush was in favor of france coming back into the integrated command , and generally favored european partners boosting capacities for eu and nato missions . hadley " made it very clear that the united states wants a strong partner in europe , wants a strong eu partner , and that involves both more military capability for those countries , but also partnering nato 's military capability with eu civilian and political capabilities , " johndroe added . a return to nato military command france announced a return to nato on tuesday , 42 years after former president charles de gaulle left the alliance it helped found , angry at what he saw as the anglo-american dominance of the alliance . " i want the alliance to be more european , and how can we have a more european alliance without france , " said sarkozy . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : sarkozy outlined plans for a reintegration into nato 's military wing after 42 years the president announced his country ’ s return while outlining france ’ s defense priorities over the next 15 years , during which , he said , terrorism would be the number one threat . sarkozy said the military must put a new emphasis on security within france 's borders and adapt to modern challenges from terrorism to computer attacks . underscoring the focus on intelligence-gathering , a new national security council will be set up at elysee palace .
sarkozy urged a strong european defence policy and said france would revamp ties with nato . but he insisted that france would always retain control of its own forces and keep independent control of its nuclear deterrent , which would remain the cornerstone of its defence structure .
leaner , more mobile army the plan further shows france maintaining defence spending at about two percent of gross domestic product .
that means that from now until 2020 , some 377 billion euros -lrb- $ 579.1 billion -rrb- will be spent on defense -lrb- excluding pensions -rrb- . in order to create a more mobile and better-equipped military , the proposals also call for a cutting back of thousands of troops .
the air force staff , for example , would be cut from 65,000 to 50,000 .
four permanent bases in africa would also be closed as defense aims shift . former nato head and eu foreign policy chief javier solana welcomed the reforms . " i think the armed forces of several countries are very big on paper .
but what is needed are forces that are available , even if there 's no need for millions of soldiers , forces that are available in a real way , with proper equipment , " he said .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the plans foresee the creation of a leaner , more mobile french army despite the country ’ s individual cuts , the new strategy is said to showcase the government ’ s desire to make european defense a priority once france takes over the eu ’ s rotating presidency beginning july 1 .
as part of the plan , sarkozy called for the establishment of a european rapid intervention force of 60,000 soldiers . until recently , the united states and britain have been reluctant to strengthen european defenses , concerned that such a move would prove expensive and duplicate nato capabilities . critics fear loss of french foreign policy independence though france continues to play a role in decision-making bodies , it is not part of the integrated command structure .
french troops have taken part in nato operations over the last several decades .
in the 1990s , france sent troops to the balkans .
two years ago , troops went to pakistan to help with disaster relief work following the earthquake . france likewise has a contingent in the nato-led security force in afghanistan ; sarkozy has committed to expanding that , sending some 700 soldiers to the volatile east to help with operations in the war-torn country . still , questions remained about how exactly france would re-enter the fray .
" obviously , it 's up to france exactly how and when it wants to resume its full participation in nato structures , " said appathurai . in france , however , not all were excited about the announcement . several members of sarkozy 's own ruling party have protested what they see as a loss of france ’ s hallmark independence in foreign policy - a betrayal of de gaulle 's legacy . members of the opposition socialist party likewise criticized the move , accusing the president , the most atlanticist french president in recent years , of sucking up to washington . sarkozy hit back at his critics .
" we can renew our relations with nato without fear for our independence and without running the risk of being unwillingly dragged into a war . " dw staff -lrb- cat -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

delays with the a380 superjumbo has caused major headaches for eads .

eads already knew in 2005 and 2006 that problems were looming and raced to sell their shares , according to the lawsuit .

" the appointment should be made this week , " a senior un official told reuters on condition of anonymity on tuesday , june 17 .
" the planned arrival is on friday . "
zannier , a career diplomat and former director of the osce 's conflict prevention center in vienna , becomes the seventh special representative of the un secretary-general in kosovo since a nato bombing campaign in 1999 forced serb forces to halt the killing and ethnic cleansing of albanians during a crackdown on guerrillas .
serbia , russia oppose end of un mission bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : kosovo declared independence on feb .
17 german diplomat ruecker was supposed to be the last special representative and would leave once the newly independent state 's constitution took effect on sunday .
but un veto holder russia , which backs serbia in opposing kosovo 's secession , has blocked the withdrawal of the mission , believing that the new state would claim more credibility without its overseers in attendance .
ethnic albanian-majority kosovo 's parliament declared its independence from serbia on february 17 .
it has since been recognized by the united states and most members of the european union .
serbia and russia vehemently oppose kosovo 's independence and the introduction of an eu police and justice mission dubbed eulex to the territory , without the approval of the un security council .
new representative 's powers unclear the appointment of zannier appears to be an attempt at a compromise by the un secretary-general ban ki-moon , who has said that the italian 's appointment would be part of proposals to " reconfigure " the mission .
it cedes certain powers to pristina and for the european union to take over policing and justice oversight in return for a continued un presence .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : serb opposition to kosovo has turned violent in recent months however , with serbia and russia still insisting on security council authorization , it is unclear what powers zannier will have and how he will be expected to implement the new un proposals on the ground in kosovo .
it had been the eu 's hope to have a 2,200-strong police and justice mission up and running by june 15 , when kosovo 's first state constitution came into being .
the eu currently has only around 300 staff on the ground , and there is no immediate prospect of it deploying in the north , where hostile serbs say the mission is illegal . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

some suggested drafting a declaration which would include assurances that ireland could opt out of a number of key areas .
ireland is the only eu country whose constitution requires new eu treaties to be approved via a referendum .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de euro 2008 -pipe- 17.06.2008 old foes prepare for crucial clash with euro survival at stake großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : france and italy face a very different battle to the one in the summer of 2006 france go into their do or die clash with italy in zurich on tuesday , june 17 beset by doubt , reports of internal strife and player fatigue .
italy , meanwhile , remain positive despite coming under intense pressure . the backdrop to this latest installment of the rivalry between the old foes could not be more different to their last meeting in a major tournament .
back in 2006 , italy overcame france at berlin 's majestic olympic stadium to be crowned champions of the world .
on tuesday at euro 2008 , those two same soccer superpowers roll up their sleeves in a back alley scrap for a route out of group c on the heels of already qualified holland .
wide margin defeats to the dutch -lrb- 3-0 and 4-1 respectively -rrb- and 1-1 and 0-0 draws with romania left italy and france requiring a win and romania to draw or lose to holland .
given their inferior goal difference that is the only way france can make it .
italy would still have a chance if they draw with france , and romania lose , leaving them both with two points .
here the permutations require the services of a rocket scientist , but in a nutshell italy would go through if they produce a score draw with france and romania lose .
the reward is a quarter-final date with group d winners spain in vienna next sunday .
shaky rearguard without vieira 's protection again france keeper gregory coupet , reeling from france 's heaviest defeat in almost three decades against the dutch , summed up the somber mood in les bleus ' camp .
" today we 've got our heads down , " he said at the team 's training headquarters in chatel-saint-denis on sunday , the day after the holland game .
" there 's tiredness , questions being asked . we need time to breathe and to prepare quickly for italy . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : france will be without their captain patrick vieira france , whose famed defense , the traditional bedrock of raymond domenech 's side , was embarrassingly torn apart by holland , will continue to be without talismanic captain patrick vieira who missed the opening two games with a left thigh problem .
domenech has a real tactical conundrum on his hands as he 's already tried 4-4-2 and 4-3-2-1 with different players - while his opposite number roberto donadoni made no fewer than five changes for the azzurri 's second game against romania .
hero buffon accepts fragile lifeline italy would already be down and out if it had n't been for keeper gianluigi buffon 's heroics in saving a late penalty from adrian mutu .
" this is the match of our lives , " said the italian keeper .
" after suffering a defeat such as we did against holland you either roll over or you appeal to your pride and that 's what we did against romania .
like ourselves , france will be surprised only to have mustered one point after two matches .
but it seems that italy are on better form as we have come off a good match . "
bildunterschrift : gianluigi buffon was beaten three times against the dutch both sides know each other well with france coming out on top when they met in the euro 2000 final only for italy to gain handsome compensation in the 2006 world cup .
they were also drawn together in qualifying for this competition .
thierry henry , who was deployed as a lone striker in that game , reflecting on the monumental task lying ahead in zurich , said : " now we know that we have to beat italy and hope for good news from the other match .
it 's ' do-able ' but it 's going to be a knife edge game with the italians .
we still have a possibility of qualifying , we 're not defeated .
" this is not the first time we 've been in this situation and i hope once more we can lift our heads and get out of it .
we 'll try and prepare the best possible for italy , " he added .
donadoni convinced his players are up for it up at their euro headquarters in austria , donadoni said he could sense the determination in his players to pull off a houdini-style escape against les bleus .
" we have to beat france , " the former ac milan winger said .
" it is a crucial match because when you still have a chance to qualify , you have to push yourself to the limit .
i saw already at training ... that the players are determined to prove how good they are against the french .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : italy 's players train for " the match of their lives " " they have a real hunger to prepare in the best possible manner for this challenge , which will dictate whether or not we progress or not , " he added .
" we are ready .
it is the last match of the group stages , we know what is at stake and we will put our heart and soul into winning what is a key match . "
donadoni said statistics and records mean nothing in a game like this .
" it has been said that italy has not managed to beat france in a normal game for 30 years , " donadoni said .
" but the statistics , quite frankly , are n't important .
before last week , it had been 30 years since the netherlands last beat italy and we all know what happened there . "
striking dilemma adds to italian woes as his side have scored just one goal in two games , donadoni admitted he is considering playing sampdoria striker antonio cassano up front alongside bayern munich 's luca toni .
having used udinese 's antonio di natale against the dutch and juventus star alessandro del piero against romania , the azzurri 's forwards have yet to fire in the tournament .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : which of italy 's strikers will be in the pink on tuesday ?
" you will see who i select on the day , " donadoni said .
" cassano reminds me of myself when i was playing , but he plays more forward , while i had other responsibilities .
he does n't help out so much at getting the ball back , which irritates me sometimes as soccer is also about playing when you do n't have the ball . "
donadoni insists all concentration will be in zurich rather than the other group c clash between the dutch and romanians in berne .
" you ca n't afford to think about the other match , those things are out of our control , " said the italian .
" all that worries us is to do the best we can .
after that we may not have our destiny in our own hands , but we just have to get on with the job in hand . " our suitcases are n't packed yet , they are still open .

" the appointment should be made this week , " a senior un official told reuters on condition of anonymity on tuesday , june 17 .
" the planned arrival is on friday . "
zannier , a career diplomat and former director of the osce 's conflict prevention center in vienna , becomes the seventh special representative of the un secretary-general in kosovo since a nato bombing campaign in 1999 forced serb forces to halt the killing and ethnic cleansing of albanians during a crackdown on guerrillas .
serbia , russia oppose end of un mission bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : kosovo declared independence on feb .
17 german diplomat ruecker was supposed to be the last special representative and would leave once the newly independent state 's constitution took effect on sunday .
but un veto holder russia , which backs serbia in opposing kosovo 's secession , has blocked the withdrawal of the mission , believing that the new state would claim more credibility without its overseers in attendance .
ethnic albanian-majority kosovo 's parliament declared its independence from serbia on february 17 .
it has since been recognized by the united states and most members of the european union .
serbia and russia vehemently oppose kosovo 's independence and the introduction of an eu police and justice mission dubbed eulex to the territory , without the approval of the un security council .
new representative 's powers unclear the appointment of zannier appears to be an attempt at a compromise by the un secretary-general ban ki-moon , who has said that the italian 's appointment would be part of proposals to " reconfigure " the mission .
it cedes certain powers to pristina and for the european union to take over policing and justice oversight in return for a continued un presence .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : serb opposition to kosovo has turned violent in recent months however , with serbia and russia still insisting on security council authorization , it is unclear what powers zannier will have and how he will be expected to implement the new un proposals on the ground in kosovo .
it had been the eu 's hope to have a 2,200-strong police and justice mission up and running by june 15 , when kosovo 's first state constitution came into being .
the eu currently has only around 300 staff on the ground , and there is no immediate prospect of it deploying in the north , where hostile serbs say the mission is illegal . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" the appointment should be made this week , " a senior un official told reuters on condition of anonymity on tuesday , june 17 .
" the planned arrival is on friday . "
zannier , a career diplomat and former director of the osce 's conflict prevention center in vienna , becomes the seventh special representative of the un secretary-general in kosovo since a nato bombing campaign in 1999 forced serb forces to halt the killing and ethnic cleansing of albanians during a crackdown on guerrillas .
serbia , russia oppose end of un mission bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : kosovo declared independence on feb .
17 german diplomat ruecker was supposed to be the last special representative and would leave once the newly independent state 's constitution took effect on sunday .
but un veto holder russia , which backs serbia in opposing kosovo 's secession , has blocked the withdrawal of the mission , believing that the new state would claim more credibility without its overseers in attendance .
ethnic albanian-majority kosovo 's parliament declared its independence from serbia on february 17 .
it has since been recognized by the united states and most members of the european union .
serbia and russia vehemently oppose kosovo 's independence and the introduction of an eu police and justice mission dubbed eulex to the territory , without the approval of the un security council .
new representative 's powers unclear the appointment of zannier appears to be an attempt at a compromise by the un secretary-general ban ki-moon , who has said that the italian 's appointment would be part of proposals to " reconfigure " the mission .
it cedes certain powers to pristina and for the european union to take over policing and justice oversight in return for a continued un presence .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : serb opposition to kosovo has turned violent in recent months however , with serbia and russia still insisting on security council authorization , it is unclear what powers zannier will have and how he will be expected to implement the new un proposals on the ground in kosovo .
it had been the eu 's hope to have a 2,200-strong police and justice mission up and running by june 15 , when kosovo 's first state constitution came into being .
the eu currently has only around 300 staff on the ground , and there is no immediate prospect of it deploying in the north , where hostile serbs say the mission is illegal . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the german captain 's goal gave his side the 1-0 victory they needed to advance with croatia from group b into the quarter-finals .
before the game , an austrian newspaper had handed out a newsprint for the game showing a nude ballack with the headline " strip him naked . "
the 31-year-old was visibly relieved after the game .
" we put ourselves into a very difficult situation ahead of the match , " he said .
" the defeat against croatia meant that we could not lose against austria , and that put us under a lot of pressure . "
germany captain silences his doubters bildunterschrift : ballack 's thunderbolt silenced his critics and eliminated austria asked what he had meant to say with his sign after scoring , ballack said that much had been written ahead of the game .
" if you read everything that the austrian press and public said , you would have believed that they had won the world cup three times and that we could hardly kick a ball , " he said .
" that is why i think that my goal silenced them . "
ballack could quite easily have used the gesture , too , to silence his own critics , who have been multiplying since a far-from impressive display by the german captain in germany 's 2-1 loss to croatia in their previous game .
" we wanted to win this game against austria , as we came here with a goal , " he said .
" we did not want to be eliminated after the first round , and for that we worked very hard .
i think you ca n't fault our work-rate in the game against austria .
" obviously we 're happy to have made it to the quarter-finals , particularly after the difficult match we had against croatia , " he added .
" we had everything to lose and we were certainly favorites to win -lrb- against austria -rrb- .
you could tell that we were not as agile as we should have been because we tensed up , yet our desire to win proved decisive . "
respect , but no fear bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : with players like deco and ronaldo , portugal are a force looking ahead to their quarter-final clash , ballack said he had a lot of respect for portugal , who looked very impressive in their first two matches at the finals .
" but we do not fear them , " he said .
" they are a good side , and it is practically a rematch from the game at the world cup in 2006 .
but we do not have to be scared of them .
i know several portugal players , not just those that i play with .
" all their players are very good individually and they play well as a team as well , " he said .
" they 're very good in attack and not too focused on defense .
they have great players , not least -lrb- cristiano -rrb- ronaldo , who had a great season in england and it will be a very difficult task .
" nobody has to tell us that they are good players .
i am also looking forward to playing against their coach , who will be coaching me at chelsea next season . "
for ballack and his team-mates , the game against austria could well have been a turning point .
the win over austria was certainly a step in the right direction toward the german goal of winning a fourth european title .
but portugal will be a very different proposition to austria .
" both teams want to go far in this competition and portugal are probably favorites , ” ballack said .
“ we 've maybe slipped to a different role and who knows , maybe that will favor us . "
reactions are muted both home and abroad germany reacted more relieved than delighted to the national team 's euro 2008 quarter-final berth as the 1-0 win against austria gave no reason for optimism . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the fans celebrated but more with a sense of relief tens of thousands of germans partied in the nation 's fan zones during the game but post-match celebrations were very subdued - given the poor quality of play in vienna which only saw one glorious moment from the winning free-kick by ballack . " ballack fulfils the minimal goal , " said kicker sports magazine on its web site , naming the germans ' performance " anything but convincing . " the bild daily spoke of " many individual mistakes " as germany stumbled into a quarter-final date with portugal on thursday . german football icon franz beckenbauer struck a similar line in his column in bild . " do we have a chance against cristiano ronaldo and his portuguese with such a performance ?
no , definitely not , " he said .
" our 11 must improve considerably to reach the semi-finals .
the german midfield appeared to be lacking ideas , there was hardly any passing . " german press see no reason the cheer the sueddeutsche zeitung -lrb- sz -rrb- also issued a devastating assessment , fearing a return to the poor " rumble " soccer germany played in the first years of the decade . " on thursday , portugal waits for the uninspired team of coach joachim loew , which appears to be drawing close the rumble soccer era again which seemed to have been overcome , " the sz said . the german media had mixed feelings about portugal .
some pointed out that germany wrapped up its great 2006 world cup campaign with a 3-1 win over portugal in the match for third place .
but also not forgotten was a 3-0 humiliation at euro 2000 . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : loew lost his cool with the official and hickersburger there was also concern whether loew will be able to coach his team from the sideline on thursday in basle , switzerland , as he was sent off -lrb- along with austrian helmsman josef hickersberger -rrb- after a dispute with the fourth match official . the ruling body uefa was expected to deal with the case and issue a ruling later tuesday , with kicker naming a ban " possible . " germany 's performance did also not raise eyebrows abroad . foreign papers mostly unimpressed austria lamented its first-round exit as host , but the kronenzeitung pointed out that only " the individual class of ballack made the difference . " the chelsea midfielder was also singled out elsewhere , with italy 's la gazzetta dello sport speaking of " not much game , a lot of ballack " and britain 's the sun saying : " ball of fame , chelsea ace comes up trumps . " but the guardian did not rule out a german improvement , saying that ballack could become the vital figure for germany in the aim to reach its goal of going very far in the tournament . " germany have one of euro 2008 's more influential players - and that , in itself , should give them hope for the remainder of a competition in which , thus far , they have flickered without truly igniting , " the paper wrote . dw staff / dpa -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

italy , meanwhile , remain positive despite coming under intense pressure . the backdrop to this latest installment of the rivalry between the old foes could not be more different to their last meeting in a major tournament .
back in 2006 , italy overcame france at berlin 's majestic olympic stadium to be crowned champions of the world .
on tuesday at euro 2008 , those two same soccer superpowers roll up their sleeves in a back alley scrap for a route out of group c on the heels of already qualified holland .
wide margin defeats to the dutch -lrb- 3-0 and 4-1 respectively -rrb- and 1-1 and 0-0 draws with romania left italy and france requiring a win and romania to draw or lose to holland .
given their inferior goal difference that is the only way france can make it .
italy would still have a chance if they draw with france , and romania lose , leaving them both with two points .
here the permutations require the services of a rocket scientist , but in a nutshell italy would go through if they produce a score draw with france and romania lose .
the reward is a quarter-final date with group d winners spain in vienna next sunday .
shaky rearguard without vieira 's protection again france keeper gregory coupet , reeling from france 's heaviest defeat in almost three decades against the dutch , summed up the somber mood in les bleus ' camp .
" today we 've got our heads down , " he said at the team 's training headquarters in chatel-saint-denis on sunday , the day after the holland game .
" there 's tiredness , questions being asked . we need time to breathe and to prepare quickly for italy . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : france will be without their captain patrick vieira france , whose famed defense , the traditional bedrock of raymond domenech 's side , was embarrassingly torn apart by holland , will continue to be without talismanic captain patrick vieira who missed the opening two games with a left thigh problem .
domenech has a real tactical conundrum on his hands as he 's already tried 4-4-2 and 4-3-2-1 with different players - while his opposite number roberto donadoni made no fewer than five changes for the azzurri 's second game against romania .
hero buffon accepts fragile lifeline italy would already be down and out if it had n't been for keeper gianluigi buffon 's heroics in saving a late penalty from adrian mutu .
" this is the match of our lives , " said the italian keeper .
" after suffering a defeat such as we did against holland you either roll over or you appeal to your pride and that 's what we did against romania .
like ourselves , france will be surprised only to have mustered one point after two matches .
but it seems that italy are on better form as we have come off a good match . "
bildunterschrift : gianluigi buffon was beaten three times against the dutch both sides know each other well with france coming out on top when they met in the euro 2000 final only for italy to gain handsome compensation in the 2006 world cup .
they were also drawn together in qualifying for this competition .
thierry henry , who was deployed as a lone striker in that game , reflecting on the monumental task lying ahead in zurich , said : " now we know that we have to beat italy and hope for good news from the other match .
it 's ' do-able ' but it 's going to be a knife edge game with the italians .
we still have a possibility of qualifying , we 're not defeated .
" this is not the first time we 've been in this situation and i hope once more we can lift our heads and get out of it .
we 'll try and prepare the best possible for italy , " he added .
donadoni convinced his players are up for it up at their euro headquarters in austria , donadoni said he could sense the determination in his players to pull off a houdini-style escape against les bleus .
" we have to beat france , " the former ac milan winger said .
" it is a crucial match because when you still have a chance to qualify , you have to push yourself to the limit .
i saw already at training ... that the players are determined to prove how good they are against the french .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : italy 's players train for " the match of their lives " " they have a real hunger to prepare in the best possible manner for this challenge , which will dictate whether or not we progress or not , " he added .
" we are ready .
it is the last match of the group stages , we know what is at stake and we will put our heart and soul into winning what is a key match . "
donadoni said statistics and records mean nothing in a game like this .
" it has been said that italy has not managed to beat france in a normal game for 30 years , " donadoni said .
" but the statistics , quite frankly , are n't important .
before last week , it had been 30 years since the netherlands last beat italy and we all know what happened there . "
striking dilemma adds to italian woes as his side have scored just one goal in two games , donadoni admitted he is considering playing sampdoria striker antonio cassano up front alongside bayern munich 's luca toni .
having used udinese 's antonio di natale against the dutch and juventus star alessandro del piero against romania , the azzurri 's forwards have yet to fire in the tournament .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : which of italy 's strikers will be in the pink on tuesday ?
" you will see who i select on the day , " donadoni said .
" cassano reminds me of myself when i was playing , but he plays more forward , while i had other responsibilities .
he does n't help out so much at getting the ball back , which irritates me sometimes as soccer is also about playing when you do n't have the ball . "
donadoni insists all concentration will be in zurich rather than the other group c clash between the dutch and romanians in berne .
" you ca n't afford to think about the other match , those things are out of our control , " said the italian .
" all that worries us is to do the best we can .
after that we may not have our destiny in our own hands , but we just have to get on with the job in hand . " our suitcases are n't packed yet , they are still open .

the german captain 's goal gave his side the 1-0 victory they needed to advance with croatia from group b into the quarter-finals .
before the game , an austrian newspaper had handed out a newsprint for the game showing a nude ballack with the headline " strip him naked . "
the 31-year-old was visibly relieved after the game .
" we put ourselves into a very difficult situation ahead of the match , " he said .
" the defeat against croatia meant that we could not lose against austria , and that put us under a lot of pressure . "
germany captain silences his doubters bildunterschrift : ballack 's thunderbolt silenced his critics and eliminated austria asked what he had meant to say with his sign after scoring , ballack said that much had been written ahead of the game .
" if you read everything that the austrian press and public said , you would have believed that they had won the world cup three times and that we could hardly kick a ball , " he said .
" that is why i think that my goal silenced them . "
ballack could quite easily have used the gesture , too , to silence his own critics , who have been multiplying since a far-from impressive display by the german captain in germany 's 2-1 loss to croatia in their previous game .
" we wanted to win this game against austria , as we came here with a goal , " he said .
" we did not want to be eliminated after the first round , and for that we worked very hard .
i think you ca n't fault our work-rate in the game against austria .
" obviously we 're happy to have made it to the quarter-finals , particularly after the difficult match we had against croatia , " he added .
" we had everything to lose and we were certainly favorites to win -lrb- against austria -rrb- .
you could tell that we were not as agile as we should have been because we tensed up , yet our desire to win proved decisive . "
respect , but no fear bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : with players like deco and ronaldo , portugal are a force looking ahead to their quarter-final clash , ballack said he had a lot of respect for portugal , who looked very impressive in their first two matches at the finals .
" but we do not fear them , " he said .
" they are a good side , and it is practically a rematch from the game at the world cup in 2006 .
but we do not have to be scared of them .
i know several portugal players , not just those that i play with .
" all their players are very good individually and they play well as a team as well , " he said .
" they 're very good in attack and not too focused on defense .
they have great players , not least -lrb- cristiano -rrb- ronaldo , who had a great season in england and it will be a very difficult task .
" nobody has to tell us that they are good players .
i am also looking forward to playing against their coach , who will be coaching me at chelsea next season . "
for ballack and his team-mates , the game against austria could well have been a turning point .
the win over austria was certainly a step in the right direction toward the german goal of winning a fourth european title .
but portugal will be a very different proposition to austria .
" both teams want to go far in this competition and portugal are probably favorites , ” ballack said .
“ we 've maybe slipped to a different role and who knows , maybe that will favor us . "
reactions are muted both home and abroad germany reacted more relieved than delighted to the national team 's euro 2008 quarter-final berth as the 1-0 win against austria gave no reason for optimism . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the fans celebrated but more with a sense of relief tens of thousands of germans partied in the nation 's fan zones during the game but post-match celebrations were very subdued - given the poor quality of play in vienna which only saw one glorious moment from the winning free-kick by ballack . " ballack fulfils the minimal goal , " said kicker sports magazine on its web site , naming the germans ' performance " anything but convincing . " the bild daily spoke of " many individual mistakes " as germany stumbled into a quarter-final date with portugal on thursday . german football icon franz beckenbauer struck a similar line in his column in bild . " do we have a chance against cristiano ronaldo and his portuguese with such a performance ?
no , definitely not , " he said .
" our 11 must improve considerably to reach the semi-finals .
the german midfield appeared to be lacking ideas , there was hardly any passing . " german press see no reason the cheer the sueddeutsche zeitung -lrb- sz -rrb- also issued a devastating assessment , fearing a return to the poor " rumble " soccer germany played in the first years of the decade . " on thursday , portugal waits for the uninspired team of coach joachim loew , which appears to be drawing close the rumble soccer era again which seemed to have been overcome , " the sz said . the german media had mixed feelings about portugal .
some pointed out that germany wrapped up its great 2006 world cup campaign with a 3-1 win over portugal in the match for third place .
but also not forgotten was a 3-0 humiliation at euro 2000 . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : loew lost his cool with the official and hickersburger there was also concern whether loew will be able to coach his team from the sideline on thursday in basle , switzerland , as he was sent off -lrb- along with austrian helmsman josef hickersberger -rrb- after a dispute with the fourth match official . the ruling body uefa was expected to deal with the case and issue a ruling later tuesday , with kicker naming a ban " possible . " germany 's performance did also not raise eyebrows abroad . foreign papers mostly unimpressed austria lamented its first-round exit as host , but the kronenzeitung pointed out that only " the individual class of ballack made the difference . " the chelsea midfielder was also singled out elsewhere , with italy 's la gazzetta dello sport speaking of " not much game , a lot of ballack " and britain 's the sun saying : " ball of fame , chelsea ace comes up trumps . " but the guardian did not rule out a german improvement , saying that ballack could become the vital figure for germany in the aim to reach its goal of going very far in the tournament . " germany have one of euro 2008 's more influential players - and that , in itself , should give them hope for the remainder of a competition in which , thus far , they have flickered without truly igniting , " the paper wrote . dw staff / dpa -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

but the scientists said they would like to study the issue longer to make absolutely sure that young children exposed to such electro-magnetic fields did not develop health problems in old age . the bureau , which employs top radiation scientists , advised parents not to let children keep phones permanently in their clothing until such a risk had been ruled out .
large numbers of germans fear mobile phones may be lethal after alarming reports about them in the media .
more than 50 german research projects since 2002 were analyzed for the report .
in some cases , genetic activity in human cells was observed to change under the influence of radiation , but this did not alter the overall conclusion that the phones were safe .

but the scientists said they would like to study the issue longer to make absolutely sure that young children exposed to such electro-magnetic fields did not develop health problems in old age . the bureau , which employs top radiation scientists , advised parents not to let children keep phones permanently in their clothing until such a risk had been ruled out .
large numbers of germans fear mobile phones may be lethal after alarming reports about them in the media .
more than 50 german research projects since 2002 were analyzed for the report .
in some cases , genetic activity in human cells was observed to change under the influence of radiation , but this did not alter the overall conclusion that the phones were safe .

" the east german uprising began as a series of strikes and protests at living standards ; it soon turned political , with town halls being stormed amid vocal demands for german reunification . economic disaster the immediate trigger for the unrest was an announcement by the communist government that it would increase working hours for factory employees while simultaneously drastically raising the price of groceries . the backdrop to the uprising was a policy of " expanding socialism according to plan " by east germany 's communists in the early 1950s .
it involved a combination of expropriating farms to create massive industrial-scale farming collectives and stepping up construction of the heavy-industry sector .
that combined with crushing world war ii reparations payments plunged the east german economy into chaos . as austerity measures became the order of the day , the country fell into economic crisis as more and more people left for the relative prosperity of west germany .
by the spring of 1953 , close to 30,000 people left east germany every month . workers lay down tools then came the strikes .
during the last days of may and early june , dissatisfied workers began laying down their tools .
but the first massive wave of protest came on june 16 , as thousands of construction workers , emboldened by the death of stalin , protested on berlin 's stalinallee -lrb- today 's karl marx allee -rrb- against wage cuts , forming a long protest march through east berlin . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : there were chaotic scenes in berlin on june 17 as thousands took to the streets the following day , more than a million people went on strike and took to the streets in more than 700 cities and communities .
what began as an uprising for better wages quickly turned into a protest for freedom , democracy and unity in germany .
the workers called for greater government transparency , a better quality of life , the resignation of the gdr 's government , free elections by secret ballot and reunification . the tense situation escalated further in east berlin , the epicenter of the unrest .
the gdr regime turned to the soviet union for help .
soviet tanks rolled into the unarmed crowd of protesters .
the troops began firing at the workers on friedrichstrasse and at potsdamer platz , killing dozens of people . seen today , the dramatic images of defenseless protesters standing off against massive tanks evoke images of the democracy protests at china 's tiananmen square , which would follow years later . during the days following june 17 , as many as 10,000 protesters and members of the strike committee were arrested . more than 1,500 protesters were given lengthy prison sentences . despite the crackdown , the revolt quietly simmered in east germany for decades to come until the peaceful protests of 1989 .
that time around the soviet tanks stayed off the streets and within a year the berlin wall fell and east and west germany were reunited . " major landmark " for many years , the 1953 uprising was ignored by east germany .
in the west , it was a public holiday but largely forgotten by ordinary people . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : an unknown number of people were killed in the uprising that has changed in recent years with many german towns renaming streets after people involved in the uprising , museums organizing special exhibitions on the topic and the publication of a spate of books about the events . five years ago , then german president johannes rau told a special session of parliament in berlin on the 50th anniversary of the uprising that the event was a watershed in european history .

they are demanding the release of human rights activist dr binayak sen. sen was arrested by the chhattisgarh authorities in may last year on charges of links with maoist group leaders .
the protests are also directed at the extreme measures adopted by the state to clamp down on left-wing extremism . over a year since human rights activist dr binayak sen was arrested in the central indian state of chhattisgarh , protests demanding his release are building up across the country and the world .
along with several national and international organisations , 22 nobel laureates have taken up sen ’ s cause .
he was arrested in 2007 on charges of alleged links with left-wing extremists , also known as naxalites .
there is also growing opposition to the state government ’ s repressive measures to curb naxalism generally .
these include repressive laws such as the chhattisgarh special public security act and the unlawful activities prevention act .
these laws prohibit any acts that “ pose obstacles to the maintenance of public order ” or “ encourage disobedience of law ” .
violation of freedom of expression civic rights activists say they violate freedom of expression .
they are an effort to curb political dissent in the state , says gautam bandhopadhyay , an executive member of the people ’ s union for civil liberties , or pucl , in chhattisgarh .
“ these acts are written in such a way that anyone who has any tendency against state behaviour or against state actions - not only today , also if they have had any experiences in the past - that they should be behind bars . ”
there have also been protests against the government-sponsored anti-naxal campaign known as the ‘ salwa judum ’ , or peace hunt .
this controversial campaign involves providing arms to local tribal communities and training them to fight against naxalite groups .
but the campaign is far from peaceful , says pucl national president rajendra sail : “ salwa judum volunteers are going around threatening all people who are supposedly supporting the naxalites in the villages .
their houses are being burnt , their cattle are being taken away , they have been uprooted from their fields and they are being beaten up . ”
“ the majority of these people - 70,000 people according to our estimates - have been lodged in relief camps in the forests or on the roadsides away from their homes , and they are living as refugees in their own land . ”
claims of success some , however , claim that the salwa judum has been effective in weakening naxal control over the local population .
retired brigadier bk ponwar trains police officers in guerrilla warfare to combat the naxals and is closely associated with the salwa judum movement : “ the best thing to happen in any such violent movement by an underground organisation is that the people should say : ‘ detach the movement ’ .
once that happens the beginning of the end has commenced .
with the population going against an insurgency movement , the insurgents are without water .
the pond has been emptied and the fish is without water . ”
several government committee reports recommend that the salwa judum campaign be ended and the supreme court of india opposes the arming of civilians .
the people ’ s union of civil liberties has filed a petition demanding the withdrawal of salwa judum but this is still being heard in the supreme court .
in the meantime , the local tribal people continue to get caught in the crossfire . pia chandavarkar 17/06/08 send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic 05 media center watch and listen explore new content daily in dw 's multimedia archive .

it involved a combination of expropriating farms to create massive industrial-scale farming collectives and stepping up construction of the heavy-industry sector .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de asia -pipe- 17.06.2008 plight of afghan refugees großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : afghan refugees returning home from pakistan seven years after the fall of the taliban , afghans still constitute the biggest group of refugees cared for by the un high commissioner for refugees .
as the unhcr mentions in its annual report , it provides protection or help to three million afghans , who are mostly in neighbouring pakistan or iran . “ i am tasveera and i am from afghanistan and have been living in pakistan since 1984 . ”
tasveera was almost a year old when she left afghanistan with her family and came to pakistan .
now 25 , she lives with her mother in islamabad , where she is learning english .
she doesn ’ t have many memories of her country or her hometown perwan .
all she knows is they were forced to leave the country by the dire conditions : “ the situation was not good and we had a lot of problems there .
we had to leave our country and go to a safe place for our security .
and so we came here in pakistan . ”
tasveera is one of almost two million afghan refugees currently living in pakistan .
some of them have been settled in cities and towns , while some still live in camps .
several mass refugee movements there was a mass exodus from afghanistan in the 1980s under the soviet occupation .
in recent years , hundreds of thousands of people have been displaced as a result of fighting between us-led foreign troops and taliban militants .
repatriation programmes resumed after the fall of the taliban regime but many refugees say they do not want to return .
vivian tan from the unhcr islamabad explained why : “ the afghans that we have spoken to usually cite a number of reasons for not wanting to go back .
this can range from lack of security in parts of afghanistan to general lack of jobs , education , and other basic facilities such as clinics . ”
returnees need land despite this general reluctance , over five million afghans have returned to their country from iran , pakistan and other countries since 2002 .
but for most of them , starting a new life in the country that they left years ago has not been easy .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de asia -pipe- 17.06.2008 angry protests in chhattisgarh großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a tribal member at a meeting with naxalites human rights groups in the central indian state of chhattisgarh have begun a ten-day hunger strike in the capital raipur .
they are demanding the release of human rights activist dr binayak sen. sen was arrested by the chhattisgarh authorities in may last year on charges of links with maoist group leaders .
the protests are also directed at the extreme measures adopted by the state to clamp down on left-wing extremism . over a year since human rights activist dr binayak sen was arrested in the central indian state of chhattisgarh , protests demanding his release are building up across the country and the world .
along with several national and international organisations , 22 nobel laureates have taken up sen ’ s cause .
he was arrested in 2007 on charges of alleged links with left-wing extremists , also known as naxalites .
there is also growing opposition to the state government ’ s repressive measures to curb naxalism generally .
these include repressive laws such as the chhattisgarh special public security act and the unlawful activities prevention act .
these laws prohibit any acts that “ pose obstacles to the maintenance of public order ” or “ encourage disobedience of law ” .
violation of freedom of expression civic rights activists say they violate freedom of expression .
they are an effort to curb political dissent in the state , says gautam bandhopadhyay , an executive member of the people ’ s union for civil liberties , or pucl , in chhattisgarh .
“ these acts are written in such a way that anyone who has any tendency against state behaviour or against state actions - not only today , also if they have had any experiences in the past - that they should be behind bars . ”
there have also been protests against the government-sponsored anti-naxal campaign known as the ‘ salwa judum ’ , or peace hunt .
this controversial campaign involves providing arms to local tribal communities and training them to fight against naxalite groups .
but the campaign is far from peaceful , says pucl national president rajendra sail : “ salwa judum volunteers are going around threatening all people who are supposedly supporting the naxalites in the villages .
their houses are being burnt , their cattle are being taken away , they have been uprooted from their fields and they are being beaten up . ”
“ the majority of these people - 70,000 people according to our estimates - have been lodged in relief camps in the forests or on the roadsides away from their homes , and they are living as refugees in their own land . ”
claims of success some , however , claim that the salwa judum has been effective in weakening naxal control over the local population .
retired brigadier bk ponwar trains police officers in guerrilla warfare to combat the naxals and is closely associated with the salwa judum movement : “ the best thing to happen in any such violent movement by an underground organisation is that the people should say : ‘ detach the movement ’ .
once that happens the beginning of the end has commenced .

" the secretary general welcomes the announcement by french president sarkozy that there are no obstacles to france rejoining the integrated command , " nato spokesman james appathurai said on tuesday , june 17 . the white house likewise embraced the move .
" we welcome the announcement , " gordon johndroe , white house national security spokesman , said . stephen hadley , president george w. bush 's national security adviser , said in april at the nato summit in bucharest that bush was in favor of france coming back into the integrated command , and generally favored european partners boosting capacities for eu and nato missions . hadley " made it very clear that the united states wants a strong partner in europe , wants a strong eu partner , and that involves both more military capability for those countries , but also partnering nato 's military capability with eu civilian and political capabilities , " johndroe added . a return to nato military command france announced a return to nato on tuesday , 42 years after former president charles de gaulle left the alliance it helped found , angry at what he saw as the anglo-american dominance of the alliance . " i want the alliance to be more european , and how can we have a more european alliance without france , " said sarkozy . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : sarkozy outlined plans for a reintegration into nato 's military wing after 42 years the president announced his country ’ s return while outlining france ’ s defense priorities over the next 15 years , during which , he said , terrorism would be the number one threat . sarkozy said the military must put a new emphasis on security within france 's borders and adapt to modern challenges from terrorism to computer attacks . underscoring the focus on intelligence-gathering , a new national security council will be set up at elysee palace .
sarkozy urged a strong european defence policy and said france would revamp ties with nato . but he insisted that france would always retain control of its own forces and keep independent control of its nuclear deterrent , which would remain the cornerstone of its defence structure .
leaner , more mobile army the plan further shows france maintaining defence spending at about two percent of gross domestic product .
that means that from now until 2020 , some 377 billion euros -lrb- $ 579.1 billion -rrb- will be spent on defense -lrb- excluding pensions -rrb- . in order to create a more mobile and better-equipped military , the proposals also call for a cutting back of thousands of troops .
the air force staff , for example , would be cut from 65,000 to 50,000 .
four permanent bases in africa would also be closed as defense aims shift . former nato head and eu foreign policy chief javier solana welcomed the reforms . " i think the armed forces of several countries are very big on paper .
but what is needed are forces that are available , even if there 's no need for millions of soldiers , forces that are available in a real way , with proper equipment , " he said .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the plans foresee the creation of a leaner , more mobile french army despite the country ’ s individual cuts , the new strategy is said to showcase the government ’ s desire to make european defense a priority once france takes over the eu ’ s rotating presidency beginning july 1 .
as part of the plan , sarkozy called for the establishment of a european rapid intervention force of 60,000 soldiers . until recently , the united states and britain have been reluctant to strengthen european defenses , concerned that such a move would prove expensive and duplicate nato capabilities . critics fear loss of french foreign policy independence though france continues to play a role in decision-making bodies , it is not part of the integrated command structure .
french troops have taken part in nato operations over the last several decades .
in the 1990s , france sent troops to the balkans .
two years ago , troops went to pakistan to help with disaster relief work following the earthquake . france likewise has a contingent in the nato-led security force in afghanistan ; sarkozy has committed to expanding that , sending some 700 soldiers to the volatile east to help with operations in the war-torn country . still , questions remained about how exactly france would re-enter the fray .
" obviously , it 's up to france exactly how and when it wants to resume its full participation in nato structures , " said appathurai . in france , however , not all were excited about the announcement . several members of sarkozy 's own ruling party have protested what they see as a loss of france ’ s hallmark independence in foreign policy - a betrayal of de gaulle 's legacy . members of the opposition socialist party likewise criticized the move , accusing the president , the most atlanticist french president in recent years , of sucking up to washington . sarkozy hit back at his critics .

" we welcome the announcement , " gordon johndroe , white house national security spokesman , said . stephen hadley , president george w. bush 's national security adviser , said in april at the nato summit in bucharest that bush was in favor of france coming back into the integrated command , and generally favored european partners boosting capacities for eu and nato missions . hadley " made it very clear that the united states wants a strong partner in europe , wants a strong eu partner , and that involves both more military capability for those countries , but also partnering nato 's military capability with eu civilian and political capabilities , " johndroe added . a return to nato military command france announced a return to nato on tuesday , 42 years after former president charles de gaulle left the alliance it helped found , angry at what he saw as the anglo-american dominance of the alliance . " i want the alliance to be more european , and how can we have a more european alliance without france , " said sarkozy . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : sarkozy outlined plans for a reintegration into nato 's military wing after 42 years the president announced his country ’ s return while outlining france ’ s defense priorities over the next 15 years , during which , he said , terrorism would be the number one threat . sarkozy said the military must put a new emphasis on security within france 's borders and adapt to modern challenges from terrorism to computer attacks . underscoring the focus on intelligence-gathering , a new national security council will be set up at elysee palace .
sarkozy urged a strong european defence policy and said france would revamp ties with nato . but he insisted that france would always retain control of its own forces and keep independent control of its nuclear deterrent , which would remain the cornerstone of its defence structure .
leaner , more mobile army the plan further shows france maintaining defence spending at about two percent of gross domestic product .
that means that from now until 2020 , some 377 billion euros -lrb- $ 579.1 billion -rrb- will be spent on defense -lrb- excluding pensions -rrb- . in order to create a more mobile and better-equipped military , the proposals also call for a cutting back of thousands of troops .
the air force staff , for example , would be cut from 65,000 to 50,000 .
four permanent bases in africa would also be closed as defense aims shift . former nato head and eu foreign policy chief javier solana welcomed the reforms . " i think the armed forces of several countries are very big on paper .
but what is needed are forces that are available , even if there 's no need for millions of soldiers , forces that are available in a real way , with proper equipment , " he said .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the plans foresee the creation of a leaner , more mobile french army despite the country ’ s individual cuts , the new strategy is said to showcase the government ’ s desire to make european defense a priority once france takes over the eu ’ s rotating presidency beginning july 1 .
as part of the plan , sarkozy called for the establishment of a european rapid intervention force of 60,000 soldiers . until recently , the united states and britain have been reluctant to strengthen european defenses , concerned that such a move would prove expensive and duplicate nato capabilities . critics fear loss of french foreign policy independence though france continues to play a role in decision-making bodies , it is not part of the integrated command structure .
french troops have taken part in nato operations over the last several decades .
in the 1990s , france sent troops to the balkans .
two years ago , troops went to pakistan to help with disaster relief work following the earthquake . france likewise has a contingent in the nato-led security force in afghanistan ; sarkozy has committed to expanding that , sending some 700 soldiers to the volatile east to help with operations in the war-torn country . still , questions remained about how exactly france would re-enter the fray .
" obviously , it 's up to france exactly how and when it wants to resume its full participation in nato structures , " said appathurai . in france , however , not all were excited about the announcement . several members of sarkozy 's own ruling party have protested what they see as a loss of france ’ s hallmark independence in foreign policy - a betrayal of de gaulle 's legacy . members of the opposition socialist party likewise criticized the move , accusing the president , the most atlanticist french president in recent years , of sucking up to washington . sarkozy hit back at his critics .
" we can renew our relations with nato without fear for our independence and without running the risk of being unwillingly dragged into a war . " dw staff -lrb- cat -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

former us senator sam nunn spoke with deutsche welle about the foreign policy of both presidential candidates .
he also called on the us to decrease its nuclear arsenal and increase its support for the united nations . sam nunn , a former democratic senator , is often tipped for a leadership post should barack obama be elected president of the united states .
nunn , 59 , honed his foreign and military policy expertise as the chair of the senate armed services committee .
since leaving office in 1997 , he has devoted himself to working to reduce the threat from nuclear weapons and currently serves as the ceo of the nuclear threat initiative -lrb- nti -rrb- .
nunn was recently in berlin , where he spoke with deutsche welle .
you have said that germany can play an important role in bringing the united states , nato and russia closer to each other .
what specific measures could this involve ?
first , i think we have to decide and russia has to decide whether we want russia to be part of the europe-atlantic security arc .
if so , then we and russia need to start sitting down and talking about those issues : finding out what their problems are with security , trying to address those problems , giving each other reassurance , having military to military meetings .
now the nato-russian council was set up for that purpose .
it worked for awhile , but it clearly is n't working anymore .
winston churchill once said : " no matter how beautiful your strategy at some point you need to look at the results . "
the results are the trajectory of nato-russia relationships – whether it 's in energy security or overall security or missile defense – is not heading in a very constructive direction .
what role can germany play in improving these ties and negotiations ?
that 's something that germany will have to decide that for itself .
i can only say that these are difficult questions and i believe the german people and the german government – with their close relationship with the united states , their leadership in nato and the european community , their friendship with both eastern europe and russia – that they are in a unique position to begin stimulating both sides to ask these questions and begin to answer them .
i do n't have all the answers but i think i do know what some of the questions are .
how would the foreign policy of an obama 's presidency differ from that of the current us administration ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : nunn would like to see the us reduce its nuclear weapons arsenal i believe both obama and mccain would both move in different directions than this administration .
i 'm very confident on the obama side that he would listen to people in europe , i 'm certain that mccain would do likewise .
i believe both of them would try a more multilateral approach .
i believe obama would reach out and look for new directions of partnership between the united states and europe and i hope also with russia and with other people around the globe .
you have brought up the argument regarding nuclear weapons that it 's hard to convince others to quit smoking when you 're a chain smoker yourself .
does the us need to reduce its nuclear arsenal ?
i think we 've got far too many nuclear weapons .
i think the russians have far too many nuclear weapons .
i think all the nuclear powers need to look at how many they need .
but i also think it 's important to look at the operational status of those weapons .
this means the way you posture your nuclear weapons , whether they 're on quick alert , how rapidly they can be fired , the warning time , the decision time on both sides .
all of that is enormously important and just as important as the numbers .
so what i would like to see is military-to-military , civilian-to-civilian top-level discussions on how we can give each other more warning time .
the president of russia or the president of the united states would have more than a few minutes to decide whether to fire the weapons if they get a warning , which could be a false warning .
i do n't think anybody expects a first strike .
we 've moved away from confrontation .
there 's no more warsaw pact , no more soviet union , no more massive tank armies .
but we have not taken that into account in a significant way in the operational status of our forces .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : iran is watching closely how other countries deal with the nuclear issue if we really are serious about trying to keep countries like iran , north korea and others from acquiring nuclear weapons , then we ought to de-emphasize their importance .
we ought to make it clear to the world that we are not relying on those nuclear weapons for first strike unless we are struck ourselves with nuclear weapons .
as long as we , russia and other nuclear powers give nuclear weapons great prestige and we act as if they are essential for our own defense , it 's enormously difficult to try and convince other countries not to acquire these weapons .
and that 's where we are right now .
does this need for better cooperation between countries mean that the united states should become more involved in the united nations ?
on the nuclear side , certainly we ought to be more involved and we ought to get more behind iaea , the international atomic energy agency , that 's the official arm of the un in dealing with these questions .
this enormously important organization won the noble peace prize two years ago .
they are going to be increasingly important .
they need more funds , they need more help , they need more support .
it 's not just the united states , it 's our friends , germany and others , that need to understand that the iaea is being given a job without sufficient resources today .

former us senator sam nunn spoke with deutsche welle about the foreign policy of both presidential candidates .
he also called on the us to decrease its nuclear arsenal and increase its support for the united nations . sam nunn , a former democratic senator , is often tipped for a leadership post should barack obama be elected president of the united states .
nunn , 59 , honed his foreign and military policy expertise as the chair of the senate armed services committee .
since leaving office in 1997 , he has devoted himself to working to reduce the threat from nuclear weapons and currently serves as the ceo of the nuclear threat initiative -lrb- nti -rrb- .
nunn was recently in berlin , where he spoke with deutsche welle .
you have said that germany can play an important role in bringing the united states , nato and russia closer to each other .
what specific measures could this involve ?
first , i think we have to decide and russia has to decide whether we want russia to be part of the europe-atlantic security arc .
if so , then we and russia need to start sitting down and talking about those issues : finding out what their problems are with security , trying to address those problems , giving each other reassurance , having military to military meetings .
now the nato-russian council was set up for that purpose .
it worked for awhile , but it clearly is n't working anymore .
winston churchill once said : " no matter how beautiful your strategy at some point you need to look at the results . "
the results are the trajectory of nato-russia relationships – whether it 's in energy security or overall security or missile defense – is not heading in a very constructive direction .
what role can germany play in improving these ties and negotiations ?
that 's something that germany will have to decide that for itself .
i can only say that these are difficult questions and i believe the german people and the german government – with their close relationship with the united states , their leadership in nato and the european community , their friendship with both eastern europe and russia – that they are in a unique position to begin stimulating both sides to ask these questions and begin to answer them .
i do n't have all the answers but i think i do know what some of the questions are .
how would the foreign policy of an obama 's presidency differ from that of the current us administration ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : nunn would like to see the us reduce its nuclear weapons arsenal i believe both obama and mccain would both move in different directions than this administration .
i 'm very confident on the obama side that he would listen to people in europe , i 'm certain that mccain would do likewise .
i believe both of them would try a more multilateral approach .
i believe obama would reach out and look for new directions of partnership between the united states and europe and i hope also with russia and with other people around the globe .
you have brought up the argument regarding nuclear weapons that it 's hard to convince others to quit smoking when you 're a chain smoker yourself .
does the us need to reduce its nuclear arsenal ?
i think we 've got far too many nuclear weapons .
i think the russians have far too many nuclear weapons .
i think all the nuclear powers need to look at how many they need .
but i also think it 's important to look at the operational status of those weapons .
this means the way you posture your nuclear weapons , whether they 're on quick alert , how rapidly they can be fired , the warning time , the decision time on both sides .
all of that is enormously important and just as important as the numbers .
so what i would like to see is military-to-military , civilian-to-civilian top-level discussions on how we can give each other more warning time .
the president of russia or the president of the united states would have more than a few minutes to decide whether to fire the weapons if they get a warning , which could be a false warning .
i do n't think anybody expects a first strike .
we 've moved away from confrontation .
there 's no more warsaw pact , no more soviet union , no more massive tank armies .
but we have not taken that into account in a significant way in the operational status of our forces .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : iran is watching closely how other countries deal with the nuclear issue if we really are serious about trying to keep countries like iran , north korea and others from acquiring nuclear weapons , then we ought to de-emphasize their importance .
we ought to make it clear to the world that we are not relying on those nuclear weapons for first strike unless we are struck ourselves with nuclear weapons .
as long as we , russia and other nuclear powers give nuclear weapons great prestige and we act as if they are essential for our own defense , it 's enormously difficult to try and convince other countries not to acquire these weapons .
and that 's where we are right now .
does this need for better cooperation between countries mean that the united states should become more involved in the united nations ?
on the nuclear side , certainly we ought to be more involved and we ought to get more behind iaea , the international atomic energy agency , that 's the official arm of the un in dealing with these questions .
this enormously important organization won the noble peace prize two years ago .
they are going to be increasingly important .
they need more funds , they need more help , they need more support .

" the secretary general welcomes the announcement by french president sarkozy that there are no obstacles to france rejoining the integrated command , " nato spokesman james appathurai said on tuesday , june 17 . the white house likewise embraced the move .
" we welcome the announcement , " gordon johndroe , white house national security spokesman , said . stephen hadley , president george w. bush 's national security adviser , said in april at the nato summit in bucharest that bush was in favor of france coming back into the integrated command , and generally favored european partners boosting capacities for eu and nato missions . hadley " made it very clear that the united states wants a strong partner in europe , wants a strong eu partner , and that involves both more military capability for those countries , but also partnering nato 's military capability with eu civilian and political capabilities , " johndroe added . a return to nato military command france announced a return to nato on tuesday , 42 years after former president charles de gaulle left the alliance it helped found , angry at what he saw as the anglo-american dominance of the alliance . " i want the alliance to be more european , and how can we have a more european alliance without france , " said sarkozy . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : sarkozy outlined plans for a reintegration into nato 's military wing after 42 years the president announced his country ’ s return while outlining france ’ s defense priorities over the next 15 years , during which , he said , terrorism would be the number one threat . sarkozy said the military must put a new emphasis on security within france 's borders and adapt to modern challenges from terrorism to computer attacks . underscoring the focus on intelligence-gathering , a new national security council will be set up at elysee palace .
sarkozy urged a strong european defence policy and said france would revamp ties with nato . but he insisted that france would always retain control of its own forces and keep independent control of its nuclear deterrent , which would remain the cornerstone of its defence structure .
leaner , more mobile army the plan further shows france maintaining defence spending at about two percent of gross domestic product .
that means that from now until 2020 , some 377 billion euros -lrb- $ 579.1 billion -rrb- will be spent on defense -lrb- excluding pensions -rrb- . in order to create a more mobile and better-equipped military , the proposals also call for a cutting back of thousands of troops .
the air force staff , for example , would be cut from 65,000 to 50,000 .
four permanent bases in africa would also be closed as defense aims shift . former nato head and eu foreign policy chief javier solana welcomed the reforms . " i think the armed forces of several countries are very big on paper .
but what is needed are forces that are available , even if there 's no need for millions of soldiers , forces that are available in a real way , with proper equipment , " he said .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the plans foresee the creation of a leaner , more mobile french army despite the country ’ s individual cuts , the new strategy is said to showcase the government ’ s desire to make european defense a priority once france takes over the eu ’ s rotating presidency beginning july 1 .
as part of the plan , sarkozy called for the establishment of a european rapid intervention force of 60,000 soldiers . until recently , the united states and britain have been reluctant to strengthen european defenses , concerned that such a move would prove expensive and duplicate nato capabilities . critics fear loss of french foreign policy independence though france continues to play a role in decision-making bodies , it is not part of the integrated command structure .
french troops have taken part in nato operations over the last several decades .
in the 1990s , france sent troops to the balkans .
two years ago , troops went to pakistan to help with disaster relief work following the earthquake . france likewise has a contingent in the nato-led security force in afghanistan ; sarkozy has committed to expanding that , sending some 700 soldiers to the volatile east to help with operations in the war-torn country . still , questions remained about how exactly france would re-enter the fray .
" obviously , it 's up to france exactly how and when it wants to resume its full participation in nato structures , " said appathurai . in france , however , not all were excited about the announcement . several members of sarkozy 's own ruling party have protested what they see as a loss of france ’ s hallmark independence in foreign policy - a betrayal of de gaulle 's legacy . members of the opposition socialist party likewise criticized the move , accusing the president , the most atlanticist french president in recent years , of sucking up to washington . sarkozy hit back at his critics .
" we can renew our relations with nato without fear for our independence and without running the risk of being unwillingly dragged into a war . " dw staff -lrb- cat -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

italy , meanwhile , remain positive despite coming under intense pressure . the backdrop to this latest installment of the rivalry between the old foes could not be more different to their last meeting in a major tournament .
back in 2006 , italy overcame france at berlin 's majestic olympic stadium to be crowned champions of the world .
on tuesday at euro 2008 , those two same soccer superpowers roll up their sleeves in a back alley scrap for a route out of group c on the heels of already qualified holland .
wide margin defeats to the dutch -lrb- 3-0 and 4-1 respectively -rrb- and 1-1 and 0-0 draws with romania left italy and france requiring a win and romania to draw or lose to holland .
given their inferior goal difference that is the only way france can make it .
italy would still have a chance if they draw with france , and romania lose , leaving them both with two points .
here the permutations require the services of a rocket scientist , but in a nutshell italy would go through if they produce a score draw with france and romania lose .
the reward is a quarter-final date with group d winners spain in vienna next sunday .
shaky rearguard without vieira 's protection again france keeper gregory coupet , reeling from france 's heaviest defeat in almost three decades against the dutch , summed up the somber mood in les bleus ' camp .
" today we 've got our heads down , " he said at the team 's training headquarters in chatel-saint-denis on sunday , the day after the holland game .
" there 's tiredness , questions being asked . we need time to breathe and to prepare quickly for italy . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : france will be without their captain patrick vieira france , whose famed defense , the traditional bedrock of raymond domenech 's side , was embarrassingly torn apart by holland , will continue to be without talismanic captain patrick vieira who missed the opening two games with a left thigh problem .
domenech has a real tactical conundrum on his hands as he 's already tried 4-4-2 and 4-3-2-1 with different players - while his opposite number roberto donadoni made no fewer than five changes for the azzurri 's second game against romania .
hero buffon accepts fragile lifeline italy would already be down and out if it had n't been for keeper gianluigi buffon 's heroics in saving a late penalty from adrian mutu .
" this is the match of our lives , " said the italian keeper .
" after suffering a defeat such as we did against holland you either roll over or you appeal to your pride and that 's what we did against romania .
like ourselves , france will be surprised only to have mustered one point after two matches .
but it seems that italy are on better form as we have come off a good match . "
bildunterschrift : gianluigi buffon was beaten three times against the dutch both sides know each other well with france coming out on top when they met in the euro 2000 final only for italy to gain handsome compensation in the 2006 world cup .
they were also drawn together in qualifying for this competition .
thierry henry , who was deployed as a lone striker in that game , reflecting on the monumental task lying ahead in zurich , said : " now we know that we have to beat italy and hope for good news from the other match .
it 's ' do-able ' but it 's going to be a knife edge game with the italians .
we still have a possibility of qualifying , we 're not defeated .
" this is not the first time we 've been in this situation and i hope once more we can lift our heads and get out of it .
we 'll try and prepare the best possible for italy , " he added .
donadoni convinced his players are up for it up at their euro headquarters in austria , donadoni said he could sense the determination in his players to pull off a houdini-style escape against les bleus .
" we have to beat france , " the former ac milan winger said .
" it is a crucial match because when you still have a chance to qualify , you have to push yourself to the limit .
i saw already at training ... that the players are determined to prove how good they are against the french .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : italy 's players train for " the match of their lives " " they have a real hunger to prepare in the best possible manner for this challenge , which will dictate whether or not we progress or not , " he added .
" we are ready .
it is the last match of the group stages , we know what is at stake and we will put our heart and soul into winning what is a key match . "
donadoni said statistics and records mean nothing in a game like this .
" it has been said that italy has not managed to beat france in a normal game for 30 years , " donadoni said .
" but the statistics , quite frankly , are n't important .
before last week , it had been 30 years since the netherlands last beat italy and we all know what happened there . "
striking dilemma adds to italian woes as his side have scored just one goal in two games , donadoni admitted he is considering playing sampdoria striker antonio cassano up front alongside bayern munich 's luca toni .
having used udinese 's antonio di natale against the dutch and juventus star alessandro del piero against romania , the azzurri 's forwards have yet to fire in the tournament .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : which of italy 's strikers will be in the pink on tuesday ?
" you will see who i select on the day , " donadoni said .
" cassano reminds me of myself when i was playing , but he plays more forward , while i had other responsibilities .
he does n't help out so much at getting the ball back , which irritates me sometimes as soccer is also about playing when you do n't have the ball . "
donadoni insists all concentration will be in zurich rather than the other group c clash between the dutch and romanians in berne .
" you ca n't afford to think about the other match , those things are out of our control , " said the italian .

italy , meanwhile , remain positive despite coming under intense pressure . the backdrop to this latest installment of the rivalry between the old foes could not be more different to their last meeting in a major tournament .
back in 2006 , italy overcame france at berlin 's majestic olympic stadium to be crowned champions of the world .
on tuesday at euro 2008 , those two same soccer superpowers roll up their sleeves in a back alley scrap for a route out of group c on the heels of already qualified holland .
wide margin defeats to the dutch -lrb- 3-0 and 4-1 respectively -rrb- and 1-1 and 0-0 draws with romania left italy and france requiring a win and romania to draw or lose to holland .
given their inferior goal difference that is the only way france can make it .
italy would still have a chance if they draw with france , and romania lose , leaving them both with two points .
here the permutations require the services of a rocket scientist , but in a nutshell italy would go through if they produce a score draw with france and romania lose .
the reward is a quarter-final date with group d winners spain in vienna next sunday .
shaky rearguard without vieira 's protection again france keeper gregory coupet , reeling from france 's heaviest defeat in almost three decades against the dutch , summed up the somber mood in les bleus ' camp .
" today we 've got our heads down , " he said at the team 's training headquarters in chatel-saint-denis on sunday , the day after the holland game .
" there 's tiredness , questions being asked . we need time to breathe and to prepare quickly for italy . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : france will be without their captain patrick vieira france , whose famed defense , the traditional bedrock of raymond domenech 's side , was embarrassingly torn apart by holland , will continue to be without talismanic captain patrick vieira who missed the opening two games with a left thigh problem .
domenech has a real tactical conundrum on his hands as he 's already tried 4-4-2 and 4-3-2-1 with different players - while his opposite number roberto donadoni made no fewer than five changes for the azzurri 's second game against romania .
hero buffon accepts fragile lifeline italy would already be down and out if it had n't been for keeper gianluigi buffon 's heroics in saving a late penalty from adrian mutu .
" this is the match of our lives , " said the italian keeper .
" after suffering a defeat such as we did against holland you either roll over or you appeal to your pride and that 's what we did against romania .
like ourselves , france will be surprised only to have mustered one point after two matches .
but it seems that italy are on better form as we have come off a good match . "
bildunterschrift : gianluigi buffon was beaten three times against the dutch both sides know each other well with france coming out on top when they met in the euro 2000 final only for italy to gain handsome compensation in the 2006 world cup .
they were also drawn together in qualifying for this competition .
thierry henry , who was deployed as a lone striker in that game , reflecting on the monumental task lying ahead in zurich , said : " now we know that we have to beat italy and hope for good news from the other match .
it 's ' do-able ' but it 's going to be a knife edge game with the italians .
we still have a possibility of qualifying , we 're not defeated .
" this is not the first time we 've been in this situation and i hope once more we can lift our heads and get out of it .
we 'll try and prepare the best possible for italy , " he added .
donadoni convinced his players are up for it up at their euro headquarters in austria , donadoni said he could sense the determination in his players to pull off a houdini-style escape against les bleus .
" we have to beat france , " the former ac milan winger said .
" it is a crucial match because when you still have a chance to qualify , you have to push yourself to the limit .
i saw already at training ... that the players are determined to prove how good they are against the french .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : italy 's players train for " the match of their lives " " they have a real hunger to prepare in the best possible manner for this challenge , which will dictate whether or not we progress or not , " he added .
" we are ready .
it is the last match of the group stages , we know what is at stake and we will put our heart and soul into winning what is a key match . "
donadoni said statistics and records mean nothing in a game like this .
" it has been said that italy has not managed to beat france in a normal game for 30 years , " donadoni said .
" but the statistics , quite frankly , are n't important .
before last week , it had been 30 years since the netherlands last beat italy and we all know what happened there . "
striking dilemma adds to italian woes as his side have scored just one goal in two games , donadoni admitted he is considering playing sampdoria striker antonio cassano up front alongside bayern munich 's luca toni .
having used udinese 's antonio di natale against the dutch and juventus star alessandro del piero against romania , the azzurri 's forwards have yet to fire in the tournament .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : which of italy 's strikers will be in the pink on tuesday ?
" you will see who i select on the day , " donadoni said .
" cassano reminds me of myself when i was playing , but he plays more forward , while i had other responsibilities .
he does n't help out so much at getting the ball back , which irritates me sometimes as soccer is also about playing when you do n't have the ball . "
donadoni insists all concentration will be in zurich rather than the other group c clash between the dutch and romanians in berne .
" you ca n't afford to think about the other match , those things are out of our control , " said the italian .
" all that worries us is to do the best we can .
after that we may not have our destiny in our own hands , but we just have to get on with the job in hand . " our suitcases are n't packed yet , they are still open .

italy , meanwhile , remain positive despite coming under intense pressure . the backdrop to this latest installment of the rivalry between the old foes could not be more different to their last meeting in a major tournament .
back in 2006 , italy overcame france at berlin 's majestic olympic stadium to be crowned champions of the world .
on tuesday at euro 2008 , those two same soccer superpowers roll up their sleeves in a back alley scrap for a route out of group c on the heels of already qualified holland .
wide margin defeats to the dutch -lrb- 3-0 and 4-1 respectively -rrb- and 1-1 and 0-0 draws with romania left italy and france requiring a win and romania to draw or lose to holland .
given their inferior goal difference that is the only way france can make it .
italy would still have a chance if they draw with france , and romania lose , leaving them both with two points .
here the permutations require the services of a rocket scientist , but in a nutshell italy would go through if they produce a score draw with france and romania lose .
the reward is a quarter-final date with group d winners spain in vienna next sunday .
shaky rearguard without vieira 's protection again france keeper gregory coupet , reeling from france 's heaviest defeat in almost three decades against the dutch , summed up the somber mood in les bleus ' camp .
" today we 've got our heads down , " he said at the team 's training headquarters in chatel-saint-denis on sunday , the day after the holland game .
" there 's tiredness , questions being asked . we need time to breathe and to prepare quickly for italy . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : france will be without their captain patrick vieira france , whose famed defense , the traditional bedrock of raymond domenech 's side , was embarrassingly torn apart by holland , will continue to be without talismanic captain patrick vieira who missed the opening two games with a left thigh problem .
domenech has a real tactical conundrum on his hands as he 's already tried 4-4-2 and 4-3-2-1 with different players - while his opposite number roberto donadoni made no fewer than five changes for the azzurri 's second game against romania .
hero buffon accepts fragile lifeline italy would already be down and out if it had n't been for keeper gianluigi buffon 's heroics in saving a late penalty from adrian mutu .
" this is the match of our lives , " said the italian keeper .
" after suffering a defeat such as we did against holland you either roll over or you appeal to your pride and that 's what we did against romania .
like ourselves , france will be surprised only to have mustered one point after two matches .
but it seems that italy are on better form as we have come off a good match . "
bildunterschrift : gianluigi buffon was beaten three times against the dutch both sides know each other well with france coming out on top when they met in the euro 2000 final only for italy to gain handsome compensation in the 2006 world cup .
they were also drawn together in qualifying for this competition .
thierry henry , who was deployed as a lone striker in that game , reflecting on the monumental task lying ahead in zurich , said : " now we know that we have to beat italy and hope for good news from the other match .
it 's ' do-able ' but it 's going to be a knife edge game with the italians .
we still have a possibility of qualifying , we 're not defeated .
" this is not the first time we 've been in this situation and i hope once more we can lift our heads and get out of it .
we 'll try and prepare the best possible for italy , " he added .
donadoni convinced his players are up for it up at their euro headquarters in austria , donadoni said he could sense the determination in his players to pull off a houdini-style escape against les bleus .
" we have to beat france , " the former ac milan winger said .
" it is a crucial match because when you still have a chance to qualify , you have to push yourself to the limit .
i saw already at training ... that the players are determined to prove how good they are against the french .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : italy 's players train for " the match of their lives " " they have a real hunger to prepare in the best possible manner for this challenge , which will dictate whether or not we progress or not , " he added .
" we are ready .
it is the last match of the group stages , we know what is at stake and we will put our heart and soul into winning what is a key match . "
donadoni said statistics and records mean nothing in a game like this .
" it has been said that italy has not managed to beat france in a normal game for 30 years , " donadoni said .
" but the statistics , quite frankly , are n't important .
before last week , it had been 30 years since the netherlands last beat italy and we all know what happened there . "
striking dilemma adds to italian woes as his side have scored just one goal in two games , donadoni admitted he is considering playing sampdoria striker antonio cassano up front alongside bayern munich 's luca toni .
having used udinese 's antonio di natale against the dutch and juventus star alessandro del piero against romania , the azzurri 's forwards have yet to fire in the tournament .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : which of italy 's strikers will be in the pink on tuesday ?
" you will see who i select on the day , " donadoni said .
" cassano reminds me of myself when i was playing , but he plays more forward , while i had other responsibilities .
he does n't help out so much at getting the ball back , which irritates me sometimes as soccer is also about playing when you do n't have the ball . "
donadoni insists all concentration will be in zurich rather than the other group c clash between the dutch and romanians in berne .
" you ca n't afford to think about the other match , those things are out of our control , " said the italian .
" all that worries us is to do the best we can .
after that we may not have our destiny in our own hands , but we just have to get on with the job in hand . " our suitcases are n't packed yet , they are still open .

" we are n't going to overcome the crisis when we lecture the irish or when we put them in the corner , " juncker said after a meeting of the eu 's 27 foreign ministers on monday , june 16 .
it would be " arrogant " to tell the irish that their votes do n't count because they are from a small country , juncker said in an article in the financial times deutschland newspaper .
small countries do n't like it when big countries lecture them , juncker said in the article , which was published tuesday .

eu grapples with ireland question bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : are the needs of small countries being ignored ?
less than a week ago , a majority of irish rejected the eu treaty , which is designed to make the bloc more efficient and give it a stronger voice in the world .
while there was n't any one issue which sunk the treaty , voters seemed concerned that it would overrule national laws on sensitive issues such as abortion , taxation and military neutrality .
at their first meeting after the vote on monday , foreign ministers discussed whether ireland could be offered concessions which could convince irish voters to pass a new referendum on the lisbon treaty later this year .
some suggested drafting a declaration which would include assurances that ireland could opt out of a number of key areas .
ireland is the only eu country whose constitution requires new eu treaties to be approved via a referendum .
while 18 national parliaments have already said yes to lisbon , the treaty can not come into force until it is ratified by all 27 member states .
germany wants decision this year bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : juncker said big eu countries are being arrogant while most eu ministers wanted to wait before deciding how to proceed , german foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier said that a solution would need to be found " this year .

however , a repeat referendum a year later approved the treaty after the danish government won legally-binding opt-outs in such areas as defense , justice and citizenship .

eu grapples with ireland question bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : are the needs of small countries being ignored ?
less than a week ago , a majority of irish rejected the eu treaty , which is designed to make the bloc more efficient and give it a stronger voice in the world .
while there was n't any one issue which sunk the treaty , voters seemed concerned that it would overrule national laws on sensitive issues such as abortion , taxation and military neutrality .
at their first meeting after the vote on monday , foreign ministers discussed whether ireland could be offered concessions which could convince irish voters to pass a new referendum on the lisbon treaty later this year .
some suggested drafting a declaration which would include assurances that ireland could opt out of a number of key areas .
ireland is the only eu country whose constitution requires new eu treaties to be approved via a referendum .
while 18 national parliaments have already said yes to lisbon , the treaty can not come into force until it is ratified by all 27 member states .

steinmeier also suggested that " the danish model from 1992 could be a model in this crisis . "

however , a repeat referendum a year later approved the treaty after the danish government won legally-binding opt-outs in such areas as defense , justice and citizenship .

the german captain 's goal gave his side the 1-0 victory they needed to advance with croatia from group b into the quarter-finals .
before the game , an austrian newspaper had handed out a newsprint for the game showing a nude ballack with the headline " strip him naked . "
the 31-year-old was visibly relieved after the game .
" we put ourselves into a very difficult situation ahead of the match , " he said .
" the defeat against croatia meant that we could not lose against austria , and that put us under a lot of pressure . "
germany captain silences his doubters bildunterschrift : ballack 's thunderbolt silenced his critics and eliminated austria asked what he had meant to say with his sign after scoring , ballack said that much had been written ahead of the game .
" if you read everything that the austrian press and public said , you would have believed that they had won the world cup three times and that we could hardly kick a ball , " he said .
" that is why i think that my goal silenced them . "
ballack could quite easily have used the gesture , too , to silence his own critics , who have been multiplying since a far-from impressive display by the german captain in germany 's 2-1 loss to croatia in their previous game .
" we wanted to win this game against austria , as we came here with a goal , " he said .
" we did not want to be eliminated after the first round , and for that we worked very hard .
i think you ca n't fault our work-rate in the game against austria .
" obviously we 're happy to have made it to the quarter-finals , particularly after the difficult match we had against croatia , " he added .
" we had everything to lose and we were certainly favorites to win -lrb- against austria -rrb- .
you could tell that we were not as agile as we should have been because we tensed up , yet our desire to win proved decisive . "
respect , but no fear bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : with players like deco and ronaldo , portugal are a force looking ahead to their quarter-final clash , ballack said he had a lot of respect for portugal , who looked very impressive in their first two matches at the finals .
" but we do not fear them , " he said .
" they are a good side , and it is practically a rematch from the game at the world cup in 2006 .
but we do not have to be scared of them .
i know several portugal players , not just those that i play with .
" all their players are very good individually and they play well as a team as well , " he said .
" they 're very good in attack and not too focused on defense .
they have great players , not least -lrb- cristiano -rrb- ronaldo , who had a great season in england and it will be a very difficult task .
" nobody has to tell us that they are good players .
i am also looking forward to playing against their coach , who will be coaching me at chelsea next season . "
for ballack and his team-mates , the game against austria could well have been a turning point .
the win over austria was certainly a step in the right direction toward the german goal of winning a fourth european title .
but portugal will be a very different proposition to austria .
" both teams want to go far in this competition and portugal are probably favorites , ” ballack said .
“ we 've maybe slipped to a different role and who knows , maybe that will favor us . "
reactions are muted both home and abroad germany reacted more relieved than delighted to the national team 's euro 2008 quarter-final berth as the 1-0 win against austria gave no reason for optimism . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the fans celebrated but more with a sense of relief tens of thousands of germans partied in the nation 's fan zones during the game but post-match celebrations were very subdued - given the poor quality of play in vienna which only saw one glorious moment from the winning free-kick by ballack . " ballack fulfils the minimal goal , " said kicker sports magazine on its web site , naming the germans ' performance " anything but convincing . " the bild daily spoke of " many individual mistakes " as germany stumbled into a quarter-final date with portugal on thursday . german football icon franz beckenbauer struck a similar line in his column in bild . " do we have a chance against cristiano ronaldo and his portuguese with such a performance ?
no , definitely not , " he said .
" our 11 must improve considerably to reach the semi-finals .
the german midfield appeared to be lacking ideas , there was hardly any passing . " german press see no reason the cheer the sueddeutsche zeitung -lrb- sz -rrb- also issued a devastating assessment , fearing a return to the poor " rumble " soccer germany played in the first years of the decade . " on thursday , portugal waits for the uninspired team of coach joachim loew , which appears to be drawing close the rumble soccer era again which seemed to have been overcome , " the sz said . the german media had mixed feelings about portugal .
some pointed out that germany wrapped up its great 2006 world cup campaign with a 3-1 win over portugal in the match for third place .
but also not forgotten was a 3-0 humiliation at euro 2000 . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : loew lost his cool with the official and hickersburger there was also concern whether loew will be able to coach his team from the sideline on thursday in basle , switzerland , as he was sent off -lrb- along with austrian helmsman josef hickersberger -rrb- after a dispute with the fourth match official . the ruling body uefa was expected to deal with the case and issue a ruling later tuesday , with kicker naming a ban " possible . " germany 's performance did also not raise eyebrows abroad . foreign papers mostly unimpressed austria lamented its first-round exit as host , but the kronenzeitung pointed out that only " the individual class of ballack made the difference . " the chelsea midfielder was also singled out elsewhere , with italy 's la gazzetta dello sport speaking of " not much game , a lot of ballack " and britain 's the sun saying : " ball of fame , chelsea ace comes up trumps . " but the guardian did not rule out a german improvement , saying that ballack could become the vital figure for germany in the aim to reach its goal of going very far in the tournament . " germany have one of euro 2008 's more influential players - and that , in itself , should give them hope for the remainder of a competition in which , thus far , they have flickered without truly igniting , " the paper wrote . dw staff / dpa -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the german captain 's goal gave his side the 1-0 victory they needed to advance with croatia from group b into the quarter-finals .
before the game , an austrian newspaper had handed out a newsprint for the game showing a nude ballack with the headline " strip him naked . "
the 31-year-old was visibly relieved after the game .
" we put ourselves into a very difficult situation ahead of the match , " he said .
" the defeat against croatia meant that we could not lose against austria , and that put us under a lot of pressure . "
germany captain silences his doubters bildunterschrift : ballack 's thunderbolt silenced his critics and eliminated austria asked what he had meant to say with his sign after scoring , ballack said that much had been written ahead of the game .
" if you read everything that the austrian press and public said , you would have believed that they had won the world cup three times and that we could hardly kick a ball , " he said .
" that is why i think that my goal silenced them . "
ballack could quite easily have used the gesture , too , to silence his own critics , who have been multiplying since a far-from impressive display by the german captain in germany 's 2-1 loss to croatia in their previous game .
" we wanted to win this game against austria , as we came here with a goal , " he said .
" we did not want to be eliminated after the first round , and for that we worked very hard .
i think you ca n't fault our work-rate in the game against austria .
" obviously we 're happy to have made it to the quarter-finals , particularly after the difficult match we had against croatia , " he added .
" we had everything to lose and we were certainly favorites to win -lrb- against austria -rrb- .
you could tell that we were not as agile as we should have been because we tensed up , yet our desire to win proved decisive . "
respect , but no fear bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : with players like deco and ronaldo , portugal are a force looking ahead to their quarter-final clash , ballack said he had a lot of respect for portugal , who looked very impressive in their first two matches at the finals .
" but we do not fear them , " he said .
" they are a good side , and it is practically a rematch from the game at the world cup in 2006 .
but we do not have to be scared of them .
i know several portugal players , not just those that i play with .
" all their players are very good individually and they play well as a team as well , " he said .
" they 're very good in attack and not too focused on defense .
they have great players , not least -lrb- cristiano -rrb- ronaldo , who had a great season in england and it will be a very difficult task .
" nobody has to tell us that they are good players .
i am also looking forward to playing against their coach , who will be coaching me at chelsea next season . "
for ballack and his team-mates , the game against austria could well have been a turning point .
the win over austria was certainly a step in the right direction toward the german goal of winning a fourth european title .
but portugal will be a very different proposition to austria .
" both teams want to go far in this competition and portugal are probably favorites , ” ballack said .
“ we 've maybe slipped to a different role and who knows , maybe that will favor us . "
reactions are muted both home and abroad germany reacted more relieved than delighted to the national team 's euro 2008 quarter-final berth as the 1-0 win against austria gave no reason for optimism . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the fans celebrated but more with a sense of relief tens of thousands of germans partied in the nation 's fan zones during the game but post-match celebrations were very subdued - given the poor quality of play in vienna which only saw one glorious moment from the winning free-kick by ballack . " ballack fulfils the minimal goal , " said kicker sports magazine on its web site , naming the germans ' performance " anything but convincing . " the bild daily spoke of " many individual mistakes " as germany stumbled into a quarter-final date with portugal on thursday . german football icon franz beckenbauer struck a similar line in his column in bild . " do we have a chance against cristiano ronaldo and his portuguese with such a performance ?
no , definitely not , " he said .
" our 11 must improve considerably to reach the semi-finals .
the german midfield appeared to be lacking ideas , there was hardly any passing . " german press see no reason the cheer the sueddeutsche zeitung -lrb- sz -rrb- also issued a devastating assessment , fearing a return to the poor " rumble " soccer germany played in the first years of the decade . " on thursday , portugal waits for the uninspired team of coach joachim loew , which appears to be drawing close the rumble soccer era again which seemed to have been overcome , " the sz said . the german media had mixed feelings about portugal .
some pointed out that germany wrapped up its great 2006 world cup campaign with a 3-1 win over portugal in the match for third place .
but also not forgotten was a 3-0 humiliation at euro 2000 . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : loew lost his cool with the official and hickersburger there was also concern whether loew will be able to coach his team from the sideline on thursday in basle , switzerland , as he was sent off -lrb- along with austrian helmsman josef hickersberger -rrb- after a dispute with the fourth match official . the ruling body uefa was expected to deal with the case and issue a ruling later tuesday , with kicker naming a ban " possible . " germany 's performance did also not raise eyebrows abroad . foreign papers mostly unimpressed austria lamented its first-round exit as host , but the kronenzeitung pointed out that only " the individual class of ballack made the difference . " the chelsea midfielder was also singled out elsewhere , with italy 's la gazzetta dello sport speaking of " not much game , a lot of ballack " and britain 's the sun saying : " ball of fame , chelsea ace comes up trumps . " but the guardian did not rule out a german improvement , saying that ballack could become the vital figure for germany in the aim to reach its goal of going very far in the tournament . " germany have one of euro 2008 's more influential players - and that , in itself , should give them hope for the remainder of a competition in which , thus far , they have flickered without truly igniting , " the paper wrote . dw staff / dpa -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the german captain 's goal gave his side the 1-0 victory they needed to advance with croatia from group b into the quarter-finals .
before the game , an austrian newspaper had handed out a newsprint for the game showing a nude ballack with the headline " strip him naked . "
the 31-year-old was visibly relieved after the game .
" we put ourselves into a very difficult situation ahead of the match , " he said .
" the defeat against croatia meant that we could not lose against austria , and that put us under a lot of pressure . "
germany captain silences his doubters bildunterschrift : ballack 's thunderbolt silenced his critics and eliminated austria asked what he had meant to say with his sign after scoring , ballack said that much had been written ahead of the game .
" if you read everything that the austrian press and public said , you would have believed that they had won the world cup three times and that we could hardly kick a ball , " he said .
" that is why i think that my goal silenced them . "
ballack could quite easily have used the gesture , too , to silence his own critics , who have been multiplying since a far-from impressive display by the german captain in germany 's 2-1 loss to croatia in their previous game .
" we wanted to win this game against austria , as we came here with a goal , " he said .
" we did not want to be eliminated after the first round , and for that we worked very hard .
i think you ca n't fault our work-rate in the game against austria .
" obviously we 're happy to have made it to the quarter-finals , particularly after the difficult match we had against croatia , " he added .
" we had everything to lose and we were certainly favorites to win -lrb- against austria -rrb- .
you could tell that we were not as agile as we should have been because we tensed up , yet our desire to win proved decisive . "
respect , but no fear bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : with players like deco and ronaldo , portugal are a force looking ahead to their quarter-final clash , ballack said he had a lot of respect for portugal , who looked very impressive in their first two matches at the finals .
" but we do not fear them , " he said .
" they are a good side , and it is practically a rematch from the game at the world cup in 2006 .
but we do not have to be scared of them .
i know several portugal players , not just those that i play with .
" all their players are very good individually and they play well as a team as well , " he said .
" they 're very good in attack and not too focused on defense .
they have great players , not least -lrb- cristiano -rrb- ronaldo , who had a great season in england and it will be a very difficult task .
" nobody has to tell us that they are good players .
i am also looking forward to playing against their coach , who will be coaching me at chelsea next season . "
for ballack and his team-mates , the game against austria could well have been a turning point .
the win over austria was certainly a step in the right direction toward the german goal of winning a fourth european title .
but portugal will be a very different proposition to austria .
" both teams want to go far in this competition and portugal are probably favorites , ” ballack said .
“ we 've maybe slipped to a different role and who knows , maybe that will favor us . "
reactions are muted both home and abroad germany reacted more relieved than delighted to the national team 's euro 2008 quarter-final berth as the 1-0 win against austria gave no reason for optimism . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the fans celebrated but more with a sense of relief tens of thousands of germans partied in the nation 's fan zones during the game but post-match celebrations were very subdued - given the poor quality of play in vienna which only saw one glorious moment from the winning free-kick by ballack . " ballack fulfils the minimal goal , " said kicker sports magazine on its web site , naming the germans ' performance " anything but convincing . " the bild daily spoke of " many individual mistakes " as germany stumbled into a quarter-final date with portugal on thursday . german football icon franz beckenbauer struck a similar line in his column in bild . " do we have a chance against cristiano ronaldo and his portuguese with such a performance ?
no , definitely not , " he said .
" our 11 must improve considerably to reach the semi-finals .
the german midfield appeared to be lacking ideas , there was hardly any passing . " german press see no reason the cheer the sueddeutsche zeitung -lrb- sz -rrb- also issued a devastating assessment , fearing a return to the poor " rumble " soccer germany played in the first years of the decade . " on thursday , portugal waits for the uninspired team of coach joachim loew , which appears to be drawing close the rumble soccer era again which seemed to have been overcome , " the sz said . the german media had mixed feelings about portugal .
some pointed out that germany wrapped up its great 2006 world cup campaign with a 3-1 win over portugal in the match for third place .
but also not forgotten was a 3-0 humiliation at euro 2000 . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : loew lost his cool with the official and hickersburger there was also concern whether loew will be able to coach his team from the sideline on thursday in basle , switzerland , as he was sent off -lrb- along with austrian helmsman josef hickersberger -rrb- after a dispute with the fourth match official . the ruling body uefa was expected to deal with the case and issue a ruling later tuesday , with kicker naming a ban " possible . " germany 's performance did also not raise eyebrows abroad . foreign papers mostly unimpressed austria lamented its first-round exit as host , but the kronenzeitung pointed out that only " the individual class of ballack made the difference . " the chelsea midfielder was also singled out elsewhere , with italy 's la gazzetta dello sport speaking of " not much game , a lot of ballack " and britain 's the sun saying : " ball of fame , chelsea ace comes up trumps . " but the guardian did not rule out a german improvement , saying that ballack could become the vital figure for germany in the aim to reach its goal of going very far in the tournament . " germany have one of euro 2008 's more influential players - and that , in itself , should give them hope for the remainder of a competition in which , thus far , they have flickered without truly igniting , " the paper wrote . dw staff / dpa -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

for the neutral , it would be a great soccer spectacle .
but for some fans , it would be a crisis of loyalties . spanish fans , especially those who follow real madrid , will rejoice that david villa 's last-gasp winner against sweden will almost certainly put off , for the time being , their having to achieve what world champions italy and runners-up france could not .
namely , avoid being turned over by a dutch team hitting peak form .
spain 's successes over russia and the swedes mean luis aragones ' men won group d after the russians defeated greece 1-0 on saturday and ended the greeks reign as european champions .
that means a quarter-final meeting with romania , france - or world champions italy , who controversially knocked the " furia roja " out in the last eight of the 1934 and 1994 world cups .
for many reasons , this allows the spanish faithful to breathe a little easier - at least for now .
if both the dutch and spain keep up their current form , they will put off the potentially juicy clash until later in the tournament and postpone a conflict of interest for spanish fans of the ' oranje ' .
real madrid 's dutchmen making spanish proud bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : robben and van nistelrooy have enjoyed success in spain in a country where club famously comes before country , real fans must feel they are in a win-win situation as their trio wesley sneijder , arjen robben and ruud van nistelrooy have been on fire for holland in two games where they have over-run both the italians and the french .
if and when the dutch and the spanish do meet , given their extensive personnel links , it will be an interesting meeting of soccer minds .
the dutch would have a slight advantage , given their intimate knowledge of the spanish system through playing in la liga .
giovanni van bronckhorst , who netted against the italians along with sneijder and van nistelrooy , spent four years at barcelona , though he has now returned home to feyenoord .
holland have for decades made superb travelers and their ability to indulge in cultural assimilation is second to none .
although they have a solid foundation of home-based players , nine in the squad turning out in the eredivisie , six more ply their trade in the english premiership .
real 's goalscoring trio aside ' only ' four play in spain - the fourth ' mosquetero ' being sevilla defender khalid boulahrouz .
holland stars find home-from-home in la liga but the links with la liga are tried and tested and spain has become almost a second home for a roll call of famous dutch players throughout the decades .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : dutchman frank rijkaard was coach at barcelona all that has changed recently is today real madrid are more orange than barcelona , who has traditionally had the deeper dutch hue with the likes of johan cruyff , fellow recent coaches louis van gaal and frank rijkaard and a long roll call of dutch internationals from johan neeskens to patrick kluivert and marc overmars .
real may of course try to balance things up next season by bringing in a portuguese-speaker in the shape of cristiano ronaldo .
portuguese has regularly been heard in the corridors of the nou camp - but barca 's preference in that regard has historically been for lusophones who hail from brazil .
whatever the domestic ramifications for next year 's la liga contest , one thing is clear on the evidence of euro 2008 to date : the dutch , with their 21st-century variant of total football are unquestionably the latinos of northern europe , with van basten a proponent of flair-fuelled , attacking football from the flanks - a concept foreign to so many teams today .

but what they got was more of the same against a weaker opponent .
now some are turning on yogi . euro 2008 was supposed to be the tournament where the new german brand of power soccer , pioneered by loew and his predecessor juergen klinsmann , resulted in some silverware .
instead , the co-favorites struggled to survive a first-round group that was among the weakest ever in the competition .
germany 's 1-0 win against austria came against a side whose main striker played most of his matches this season for werder bremen 's amateurs - in the bundesliga 's third division .
nonetheless , germany needed a 120 km / h -lrb- 74.5 mph -rrb- free kick from michael ballack to best their much smaller southern neighbors .
after the match , many credited ballack with saving yogi 's hide .
bildunterschrift : one moment of ballack brilliance made up for a dismal performance " the captain personally spared the team and above all the team management the unpleasant discussions that would have followed germany potentially exiting the tournament in vienna , " wrote the on-line version of the frankfurter allgemeine zeitung newspaper .
" ballack was loew 's savior . "
empty words ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : mario gomez and the rest of germany 's attack have been weak after germany 's shock loss to croatia on june 12 , germany 's governing soccer body , the dfb , was quick to assure the press that loew would retain his job , even if the team were to crash out of euro 2008 .
but few people put much stock in those assurances , and some experts are beginning to question the coach , who was sent to grandstands , together with his austrian counterpart , for complaining about the officiating .

but what they got was more of the same against a weaker opponent .
now some are turning on yogi . euro 2008 was supposed to be the tournament where the new german brand of power soccer , pioneered by loew and his predecessor juergen klinsmann , resulted in some silverware .
instead , the co-favorites struggled to survive a first-round group that was among the weakest ever in the competition .
germany 's 1-0 win against austria came against a side whose main striker played most of his matches this season for werder bremen 's amateurs - in the bundesliga 's third division .
nonetheless , germany needed a 120 km / h -lrb- 74.5 mph -rrb- free kick from michael ballack to best their much smaller southern neighbors .
after the match , many credited ballack with saving yogi 's hide .
bildunterschrift : one moment of ballack brilliance made up for a dismal performance " the captain personally spared the team and above all the team management the unpleasant discussions that would have followed germany potentially exiting the tournament in vienna , " wrote the on-line version of the frankfurter allgemeine zeitung newspaper .
" ballack was loew 's savior . "
empty words ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : mario gomez and the rest of germany 's attack have been weak after germany 's shock loss to croatia on june 12 , germany 's governing soccer body , the dfb , was quick to assure the press that loew would retain his job , even if the team were to crash out of euro 2008 .
but few people put much stock in those assurances , and some experts are beginning to question the coach , who was sent to grandstands , together with his austrian counterpart , for complaining about the officiating .
" it fit the quality of the match that it was game over after 40 minutes for the two men responsible for the teams ' strategy and style , " wrote the daily tagesspiegel newspaper .
bloggers have been even harsher .
" you ca n't play more horridly , " wrote one disappointed german fan on a soccer discussion forum .
" but i though it was even worse how loew sat in the stands , relaxed and chewing gum , as though he were on vacation . "
the catch-22 is that poor performances undermine a coach 's credibility with his players , and some pundits are already questioning whether klinsmann 's former assistant has the necessary authority within the team .
" it was difficult to see a shortcoming in having assistant coach hans-dieter flick take over in the second half , " wrote the tagespiegel .
" the way the germans were playing , it did n't seem like they were open to any sort of instructions anyway . "
do or die against portugal bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : loew has also been criticized for sticking with lehmann loew probably does n't need a win against quarterfinal opponents portugal , now one of the tournament favorites , in order to keep his job .
but both fans and the dfb higher-ups will want to see a return to the fluid , short-passing game germany played against their first euro 2008 foes poland .
" loew won his most important game thus far and will be allowed to continue modernizing the national squad , " wrote the financial times germany .
" they 're in bitter need of it . "
and some hope that germany 's underdog status going into that match will remove the pressure that may have kept the team from playing its best in the group stage .
" as ballack himself said with a bit of relief , germany is a clear outsider against portugal , and maybe that was loew 's plan , " wrote the berliner zeitung newspaper .
" if so , it was a stroke of genius . "

" the appointment should be made this week , " a senior un official told reuters on condition of anonymity on tuesday , june 17 .
" the planned arrival is on friday . "
zannier , a career diplomat and former director of the osce 's conflict prevention center in vienna , becomes the seventh special representative of the un secretary-general in kosovo since a nato bombing campaign in 1999 forced serb forces to halt the killing and ethnic cleansing of albanians during a crackdown on guerrillas .

ethnic albanian-majority kosovo 's parliament declared its independence from serbia on february 17 .
it has since been recognized by the united states and most members of the european union .
serbia and russia vehemently oppose kosovo 's independence and the introduction of an eu police and justice mission dubbed eulex to the territory , without the approval of the un security council .
new representative 's powers unclear the appointment of zannier appears to be an attempt at a compromise by the un secretary-general ban ki-moon , who has said that the italian 's appointment would be part of proposals to " reconfigure " the mission .

it had been the eu 's hope to have a 2,200-strong police and justice mission up and running by june 15 , when kosovo 's first state constitution came into being .

" the appointment should be made this week , " a senior un official told reuters on condition of anonymity on tuesday , june 17 .
" the planned arrival is on friday . "
zannier , a career diplomat and former director of the osce 's conflict prevention center in vienna , becomes the seventh special representative of the un secretary-general in kosovo since a nato bombing campaign in 1999 forced serb forces to halt the killing and ethnic cleansing of albanians during a crackdown on guerrillas .
serbia , russia oppose end of un mission bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : kosovo declared independence on feb .
17 german diplomat ruecker was supposed to be the last special representative and would leave once the newly independent state 's constitution took effect on sunday .
but un veto holder russia , which backs serbia in opposing kosovo 's secession , has blocked the withdrawal of the mission , believing that the new state would claim more credibility without its overseers in attendance .
ethnic albanian-majority kosovo 's parliament declared its independence from serbia on february 17 .
it has since been recognized by the united states and most members of the european union .
serbia and russia vehemently oppose kosovo 's independence and the introduction of an eu police and justice mission dubbed eulex to the territory , without the approval of the un security council .
new representative 's powers unclear the appointment of zannier appears to be an attempt at a compromise by the un secretary-general ban ki-moon , who has said that the italian 's appointment would be part of proposals to " reconfigure " the mission .
it cedes certain powers to pristina and for the european union to take over policing and justice oversight in return for a continued un presence .

it had been the eu 's hope to have a 2,200-strong police and justice mission up and running by june 15 , when kosovo 's first state constitution came into being .

" the east german uprising began as a series of strikes and protests at living standards ; it soon turned political , with town halls being stormed amid vocal demands for german reunification . economic disaster the immediate trigger for the unrest was an announcement by the communist government that it would increase working hours for factory employees while simultaneously drastically raising the price of groceries . the backdrop to the uprising was a policy of " expanding socialism according to plan " by east germany 's communists in the early 1950s .
it involved a combination of expropriating farms to create massive industrial-scale farming collectives and stepping up construction of the heavy-industry sector .
that combined with crushing world war ii reparations payments plunged the east german economy into chaos . as austerity measures became the order of the day , the country fell into economic crisis as more and more people left for the relative prosperity of west germany .

what began as an uprising for better wages quickly turned into a protest for freedom , democracy and unity in germany .
the workers called for greater government transparency , a better quality of life , the resignation of the gdr 's government , free elections by secret ballot and reunification . the tense situation escalated further in east berlin , the epicenter of the unrest .
the gdr regime turned to the soviet union for help .
soviet tanks rolled into the unarmed crowd of protesters .
the troops began firing at the workers on friedrichstrasse and at potsdamer platz , killing dozens of people . seen today , the dramatic images of defenseless protesters standing off against massive tanks evoke images of the democracy protests at china 's tiananmen square , which would follow years later . during the days following june 17 , as many as 10,000 protesters and members of the strike committee were arrested . more than 1,500 protesters were given lengthy prison sentences . despite the crackdown , the revolt quietly simmered in east germany for decades to come until the peaceful protests of 1989 .

by the spring of 1953 , close to 30,000 people left east germany every month . workers lay down tools then came the strikes .
during the last days of may and early june , dissatisfied workers began laying down their tools .
but the first massive wave of protest came on june 16 , as thousands of construction workers , emboldened by the death of stalin , protested on berlin 's stalinallee -lrb- today 's karl marx allee -rrb- against wage cuts , forming a long protest march through east berlin . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : there were chaotic scenes in berlin on june 17 as thousands took to the streets the following day , more than a million people went on strike and took to the streets in more than 700 cities and communities .
what began as an uprising for better wages quickly turned into a protest for freedom , democracy and unity in germany .
the workers called for greater government transparency , a better quality of life , the resignation of the gdr 's government , free elections by secret ballot and reunification . the tense situation escalated further in east berlin , the epicenter of the unrest .
the gdr regime turned to the soviet union for help .
soviet tanks rolled into the unarmed crowd of protesters .
the troops began firing at the workers on friedrichstrasse and at potsdamer platz , killing dozens of people . seen today , the dramatic images of defenseless protesters standing off against massive tanks evoke images of the democracy protests at china 's tiananmen square , which would follow years later . during the days following june 17 , as many as 10,000 protesters and members of the strike committee were arrested . more than 1,500 protesters were given lengthy prison sentences . despite the crackdown , the revolt quietly simmered in east germany for decades to come until the peaceful protests of 1989 .
that time around the soviet tanks stayed off the streets and within a year the berlin wall fell and east and west germany were reunited . " major landmark " for many years , the 1953 uprising was ignored by east germany .
in the west , it was a public holiday but largely forgotten by ordinary people . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : an unknown number of people were killed in the uprising that has changed in recent years with many german towns renaming streets after people involved in the uprising , museums organizing special exhibitions on the topic and the publication of a spate of books about the events . five years ago , then german president johannes rau told a special session of parliament in berlin on the 50th anniversary of the uprising that the event was a watershed in european history . " it was a revolt that was courageous , spontaneous and supported by all classes of people is one of the major landmarks of the history of german and european freedom , " he said . dw staff -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de new berlin wall book to settle casualty debate a " book of the berlin wall " to be issued this year is to tell the life stories of all 134 persons killed on the mid-city fortifications operated by the communists from 1961 to 1989 , an historian said saturday , may 17 .

the suits allege the european aircraft manufacturer misled investors . two us law firms have filed a lawsuit against the european aerospace giant , accusing its managers of misleading investors about the company 's finances and its ability to meet delivery deadlines for its a380 jet .
delays with the a380 superjumbo has caused major headaches for eads .
new york-based law firm dreier llp , which filed one lawsuit , said in a statement monday , june 16 that managers and core eads shareholders engaged in " rampant insider trading based on their knowledge of the problems surrounding the a380 . "
eads already knew in 2005 and 2006 that problems were looming and raced to sell their shares , according to the lawsuit .
another lawsuit filed by san diego-based firm , coughlin stoia , alleges eads falsely assured investors that it would overcome technical problems related to the a380 .
an eads spokesman declined to comment on the lawsuits .
french investigators are looking into insider trading charges against more than a dozen of the company 's top executives .
they cashed in on about 20 million euros -lrb- $ 31 million -rrb- of gross profit from the sales just a short time before the company announced the a380 would be delayed .
the announcement caused eads stock to drop more than 30 percent .
the problems with the a 380 , the world 's largest commercial aircraft , provoked a crisis in eads and airbus , and led to former co-chairman noel forgeard being forced to step down .
forgeard is under formal investigation over the alleged insider trading .
he has denied wrongdoing . dw staff -lrb- th -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" we welcome the announcement , " gordon johndroe , white house national security spokesman , said . stephen hadley , president george w. bush 's national security adviser , said in april at the nato summit in bucharest that bush was in favor of france coming back into the integrated command , and generally favored european partners boosting capacities for eu and nato missions . hadley " made it very clear that the united states wants a strong partner in europe , wants a strong eu partner , and that involves both more military capability for those countries , but also partnering nato 's military capability with eu civilian and political capabilities , " johndroe added . a return to nato military command france announced a return to nato on tuesday , 42 years after former president charles de gaulle left the alliance it helped found , angry at what he saw as the anglo-american dominance of the alliance . " i want the alliance to be more european , and how can we have a more european alliance without france , " said sarkozy . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : sarkozy outlined plans for a reintegration into nato 's military wing after 42 years the president announced his country ’ s return while outlining france ’ s defense priorities over the next 15 years , during which , he said , terrorism would be the number one threat . sarkozy said the military must put a new emphasis on security within france 's borders and adapt to modern challenges from terrorism to computer attacks . underscoring the focus on intelligence-gathering , a new national security council will be set up at elysee palace .
sarkozy urged a strong european defence policy and said france would revamp ties with nato . but he insisted that france would always retain control of its own forces and keep independent control of its nuclear deterrent , which would remain the cornerstone of its defence structure .
leaner , more mobile army the plan further shows france maintaining defence spending at about two percent of gross domestic product .

four permanent bases in africa would also be closed as defense aims shift . former nato head and eu foreign policy chief javier solana welcomed the reforms . " i think the armed forces of several countries are very big on paper .

in the 1990s , france sent troops to the balkans .
two years ago , troops went to pakistan to help with disaster relief work following the earthquake . france likewise has a contingent in the nato-led security force in afghanistan ; sarkozy has committed to expanding that , sending some 700 soldiers to the volatile east to help with operations in the war-torn country . still , questions remained about how exactly france would re-enter the fray .
" obviously , it 's up to france exactly how and when it wants to resume its full participation in nato structures , " said appathurai . in france , however , not all were excited about the announcement . several members of sarkozy 's own ruling party have protested what they see as a loss of france ’ s hallmark independence in foreign policy - a betrayal of de gaulle 's legacy . members of the opposition socialist party likewise criticized the move , accusing the president , the most atlanticist french president in recent years , of sucking up to washington . sarkozy hit back at his critics .

" the secretary general welcomes the announcement by french president sarkozy that there are no obstacles to france rejoining the integrated command , " nato spokesman james appathurai said on tuesday , june 17 . the white house likewise embraced the move .
" we welcome the announcement , " gordon johndroe , white house national security spokesman , said . stephen hadley , president george w. bush 's national security adviser , said in april at the nato summit in bucharest that bush was in favor of france coming back into the integrated command , and generally favored european partners boosting capacities for eu and nato missions . hadley " made it very clear that the united states wants a strong partner in europe , wants a strong eu partner , and that involves both more military capability for those countries , but also partnering nato 's military capability with eu civilian and political capabilities , " johndroe added . a return to nato military command france announced a return to nato on tuesday , 42 years after former president charles de gaulle left the alliance it helped found , angry at what he saw as the anglo-american dominance of the alliance . " i want the alliance to be more european , and how can we have a more european alliance without france , " said sarkozy . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : sarkozy outlined plans for a reintegration into nato 's military wing after 42 years the president announced his country ’ s return while outlining france ’ s defense priorities over the next 15 years , during which , he said , terrorism would be the number one threat . sarkozy said the military must put a new emphasis on security within france 's borders and adapt to modern challenges from terrorism to computer attacks . underscoring the focus on intelligence-gathering , a new national security council will be set up at elysee palace .
sarkozy urged a strong european defence policy and said france would revamp ties with nato . but he insisted that france would always retain control of its own forces and keep independent control of its nuclear deterrent , which would remain the cornerstone of its defence structure .
leaner , more mobile army the plan further shows france maintaining defence spending at about two percent of gross domestic product .
that means that from now until 2020 , some 377 billion euros -lrb- $ 579.1 billion -rrb- will be spent on defense -lrb- excluding pensions -rrb- . in order to create a more mobile and better-equipped military , the proposals also call for a cutting back of thousands of troops .
the air force staff , for example , would be cut from 65,000 to 50,000 .
four permanent bases in africa would also be closed as defense aims shift . former nato head and eu foreign policy chief javier solana welcomed the reforms . " i think the armed forces of several countries are very big on paper .
but what is needed are forces that are available , even if there 's no need for millions of soldiers , forces that are available in a real way , with proper equipment , " he said .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the plans foresee the creation of a leaner , more mobile french army despite the country ’ s individual cuts , the new strategy is said to showcase the government ’ s desire to make european defense a priority once france takes over the eu ’ s rotating presidency beginning july 1 .
as part of the plan , sarkozy called for the establishment of a european rapid intervention force of 60,000 soldiers . until recently , the united states and britain have been reluctant to strengthen european defenses , concerned that such a move would prove expensive and duplicate nato capabilities . critics fear loss of french foreign policy independence though france continues to play a role in decision-making bodies , it is not part of the integrated command structure .
french troops have taken part in nato operations over the last several decades .
in the 1990s , france sent troops to the balkans .
two years ago , troops went to pakistan to help with disaster relief work following the earthquake . france likewise has a contingent in the nato-led security force in afghanistan ; sarkozy has committed to expanding that , sending some 700 soldiers to the volatile east to help with operations in the war-torn country . still , questions remained about how exactly france would re-enter the fray .
" obviously , it 's up to france exactly how and when it wants to resume its full participation in nato structures , " said appathurai . in france , however , not all were excited about the announcement . several members of sarkozy 's own ruling party have protested what they see as a loss of france ’ s hallmark independence in foreign policy - a betrayal of de gaulle 's legacy . members of the opposition socialist party likewise criticized the move , accusing the president , the most atlanticist french president in recent years , of sucking up to washington . sarkozy hit back at his critics .
" we can renew our relations with nato without fear for our independence and without running the risk of being unwillingly dragged into a war . " dw staff -lrb- cat -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" the appointment should be made this week , " a senior un official told reuters on condition of anonymity on tuesday , june 17 .
" the planned arrival is on friday . "
zannier , a career diplomat and former director of the osce 's conflict prevention center in vienna , becomes the seventh special representative of the un secretary-general in kosovo since a nato bombing campaign in 1999 forced serb forces to halt the killing and ethnic cleansing of albanians during a crackdown on guerrillas .

but un veto holder russia , which backs serbia in opposing kosovo 's secession , has blocked the withdrawal of the mission , believing that the new state would claim more credibility without its overseers in attendance .
ethnic albanian-majority kosovo 's parliament declared its independence from serbia on february 17 .
it has since been recognized by the united states and most members of the european union .
serbia and russia vehemently oppose kosovo 's independence and the introduction of an eu police and justice mission dubbed eulex to the territory , without the approval of the un security council .

it had been the eu 's hope to have a 2,200-strong police and justice mission up and running by june 15 , when kosovo 's first state constitution came into being .

" the appointment should be made this week , " a senior un official told reuters on condition of anonymity on tuesday , june 17 .
" the planned arrival is on friday . "
zannier , a career diplomat and former director of the osce 's conflict prevention center in vienna , becomes the seventh special representative of the un secretary-general in kosovo since a nato bombing campaign in 1999 forced serb forces to halt the killing and ethnic cleansing of albanians during a crackdown on guerrillas .
serbia , russia oppose end of un mission bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : kosovo declared independence on feb .
17 german diplomat ruecker was supposed to be the last special representative and would leave once the newly independent state 's constitution took effect on sunday .
but un veto holder russia , which backs serbia in opposing kosovo 's secession , has blocked the withdrawal of the mission , believing that the new state would claim more credibility without its overseers in attendance .
ethnic albanian-majority kosovo 's parliament declared its independence from serbia on february 17 .
it has since been recognized by the united states and most members of the european union .
serbia and russia vehemently oppose kosovo 's independence and the introduction of an eu police and justice mission dubbed eulex to the territory , without the approval of the un security council .
new representative 's powers unclear the appointment of zannier appears to be an attempt at a compromise by the un secretary-general ban ki-moon , who has said that the italian 's appointment would be part of proposals to " reconfigure " the mission .
it cedes certain powers to pristina and for the european union to take over policing and justice oversight in return for a continued un presence .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : serb opposition to kosovo has turned violent in recent months however , with serbia and russia still insisting on security council authorization , it is unclear what powers zannier will have and how he will be expected to implement the new un proposals on the ground in kosovo .
it had been the eu 's hope to have a 2,200-strong police and justice mission up and running by june 15 , when kosovo 's first state constitution came into being .
the eu currently has only around 300 staff on the ground , and there is no immediate prospect of it deploying in the north , where hostile serbs say the mission is illegal . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de kosovo -pipe- 17.06.2008 report : italian diplomat to take over un kosovo mission großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany 's joachim ruecker stands down this week to make way for italy 's zannier italian diplomat lamberto zannier will take over as the new head of the un interim mission to kosovo - unmik - when the incumbent joachim ruecker leaves his post later this week , according to a senior un official . " the appointment should be made this week , " a senior un official told reuters on condition of anonymity on tuesday , june 17 .
" the planned arrival is on friday . "
zannier , a career diplomat and former director of the osce 's conflict prevention center in vienna , becomes the seventh special representative of the un secretary-general in kosovo since a nato bombing campaign in 1999 forced serb forces to halt the killing and ethnic cleansing of albanians during a crackdown on guerrillas .
serbia , russia oppose end of un mission bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : kosovo declared independence on feb .
17 german diplomat ruecker was supposed to be the last special representative and would leave once the newly independent state 's constitution took effect on sunday .
but un veto holder russia , which backs serbia in opposing kosovo 's secession , has blocked the withdrawal of the mission , believing that the new state would claim more credibility without its overseers in attendance .
ethnic albanian-majority kosovo 's parliament declared its independence from serbia on february 17 .
it has since been recognized by the united states and most members of the european union .
serbia and russia vehemently oppose kosovo 's independence and the introduction of an eu police and justice mission dubbed eulex to the territory , without the approval of the un security council .
new representative 's powers unclear the appointment of zannier appears to be an attempt at a compromise by the un secretary-general ban ki-moon , who has said that the italian 's appointment would be part of proposals to " reconfigure " the mission .
it cedes certain powers to pristina and for the european union to take over policing and justice oversight in return for a continued un presence .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : serb opposition to kosovo has turned violent in recent months however , with serbia and russia still insisting on security council authorization , it is unclear what powers zannier will have and how he will be expected to implement the new un proposals on the ground in kosovo .
it had been the eu 's hope to have a 2,200-strong police and justice mission up and running by june 15 , when kosovo 's first state constitution came into being .
the eu currently has only around 300 staff on the ground , and there is no immediate prospect of it deploying in the north , where hostile serbs say the mission is illegal . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" the secretary general welcomes the announcement by french president sarkozy that there are no obstacles to france rejoining the integrated command , " nato spokesman james appathurai said on tuesday , june 17 . the white house likewise embraced the move .
" we welcome the announcement , " gordon johndroe , white house national security spokesman , said . stephen hadley , president george w. bush 's national security adviser , said in april at the nato summit in bucharest that bush was in favor of france coming back into the integrated command , and generally favored european partners boosting capacities for eu and nato missions . hadley " made it very clear that the united states wants a strong partner in europe , wants a strong eu partner , and that involves both more military capability for those countries , but also partnering nato 's military capability with eu civilian and political capabilities , " johndroe added . a return to nato military command france announced a return to nato on tuesday , 42 years after former president charles de gaulle left the alliance it helped found , angry at what he saw as the anglo-american dominance of the alliance . " i want the alliance to be more european , and how can we have a more european alliance without france , " said sarkozy . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : sarkozy outlined plans for a reintegration into nato 's military wing after 42 years the president announced his country ’ s return while outlining france ’ s defense priorities over the next 15 years , during which , he said , terrorism would be the number one threat . sarkozy said the military must put a new emphasis on security within france 's borders and adapt to modern challenges from terrorism to computer attacks . underscoring the focus on intelligence-gathering , a new national security council will be set up at elysee palace .
sarkozy urged a strong european defence policy and said france would revamp ties with nato . but he insisted that france would always retain control of its own forces and keep independent control of its nuclear deterrent , which would remain the cornerstone of its defence structure .
leaner , more mobile army the plan further shows france maintaining defence spending at about two percent of gross domestic product .
that means that from now until 2020 , some 377 billion euros -lrb- $ 579.1 billion -rrb- will be spent on defense -lrb- excluding pensions -rrb- . in order to create a more mobile and better-equipped military , the proposals also call for a cutting back of thousands of troops .
the air force staff , for example , would be cut from 65,000 to 50,000 .
four permanent bases in africa would also be closed as defense aims shift . former nato head and eu foreign policy chief javier solana welcomed the reforms . " i think the armed forces of several countries are very big on paper .
but what is needed are forces that are available , even if there 's no need for millions of soldiers , forces that are available in a real way , with proper equipment , " he said .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the plans foresee the creation of a leaner , more mobile french army despite the country ’ s individual cuts , the new strategy is said to showcase the government ’ s desire to make european defense a priority once france takes over the eu ’ s rotating presidency beginning july 1 .
as part of the plan , sarkozy called for the establishment of a european rapid intervention force of 60,000 soldiers . until recently , the united states and britain have been reluctant to strengthen european defenses , concerned that such a move would prove expensive and duplicate nato capabilities . critics fear loss of french foreign policy independence though france continues to play a role in decision-making bodies , it is not part of the integrated command structure .
french troops have taken part in nato operations over the last several decades .
in the 1990s , france sent troops to the balkans .
two years ago , troops went to pakistan to help with disaster relief work following the earthquake . france likewise has a contingent in the nato-led security force in afghanistan ; sarkozy has committed to expanding that , sending some 700 soldiers to the volatile east to help with operations in the war-torn country . still , questions remained about how exactly france would re-enter the fray .
" obviously , it 's up to france exactly how and when it wants to resume its full participation in nato structures , " said appathurai . in france , however , not all were excited about the announcement . several members of sarkozy 's own ruling party have protested what they see as a loss of france ’ s hallmark independence in foreign policy - a betrayal of de gaulle 's legacy . members of the opposition socialist party likewise criticized the move , accusing the president , the most atlanticist french president in recent years , of sucking up to washington . sarkozy hit back at his critics .

the german captain 's goal gave his side the 1-0 victory they needed to advance with croatia from group b into the quarter-finals .
before the game , an austrian newspaper had handed out a newsprint for the game showing a nude ballack with the headline " strip him naked . "
the 31-year-old was visibly relieved after the game .
" we put ourselves into a very difficult situation ahead of the match , " he said .
" the defeat against croatia meant that we could not lose against austria , and that put us under a lot of pressure . "
germany captain silences his doubters bildunterschrift : ballack 's thunderbolt silenced his critics and eliminated austria asked what he had meant to say with his sign after scoring , ballack said that much had been written ahead of the game .
" if you read everything that the austrian press and public said , you would have believed that they had won the world cup three times and that we could hardly kick a ball , " he said .
" that is why i think that my goal silenced them . "
ballack could quite easily have used the gesture , too , to silence his own critics , who have been multiplying since a far-from impressive display by the german captain in germany 's 2-1 loss to croatia in their previous game .
" we wanted to win this game against austria , as we came here with a goal , " he said .
" we did not want to be eliminated after the first round , and for that we worked very hard .
i think you ca n't fault our work-rate in the game against austria .
" obviously we 're happy to have made it to the quarter-finals , particularly after the difficult match we had against croatia , " he added .
" we had everything to lose and we were certainly favorites to win -lrb- against austria -rrb- .
you could tell that we were not as agile as we should have been because we tensed up , yet our desire to win proved decisive . "
respect , but no fear bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : with players like deco and ronaldo , portugal are a force looking ahead to their quarter-final clash , ballack said he had a lot of respect for portugal , who looked very impressive in their first two matches at the finals .
" but we do not fear them , " he said .
" they are a good side , and it is practically a rematch from the game at the world cup in 2006 .
but we do not have to be scared of them .
i know several portugal players , not just those that i play with .
" all their players are very good individually and they play well as a team as well , " he said .
" they 're very good in attack and not too focused on defense .
they have great players , not least -lrb- cristiano -rrb- ronaldo , who had a great season in england and it will be a very difficult task .
" nobody has to tell us that they are good players .
i am also looking forward to playing against their coach , who will be coaching me at chelsea next season . "
for ballack and his team-mates , the game against austria could well have been a turning point .
the win over austria was certainly a step in the right direction toward the german goal of winning a fourth european title .
but portugal will be a very different proposition to austria .
" both teams want to go far in this competition and portugal are probably favorites , ” ballack said .
“ we 've maybe slipped to a different role and who knows , maybe that will favor us . "
reactions are muted both home and abroad germany reacted more relieved than delighted to the national team 's euro 2008 quarter-final berth as the 1-0 win against austria gave no reason for optimism . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the fans celebrated but more with a sense of relief tens of thousands of germans partied in the nation 's fan zones during the game but post-match celebrations were very subdued - given the poor quality of play in vienna which only saw one glorious moment from the winning free-kick by ballack . " ballack fulfils the minimal goal , " said kicker sports magazine on its web site , naming the germans ' performance " anything but convincing . " the bild daily spoke of " many individual mistakes " as germany stumbled into a quarter-final date with portugal on thursday . german football icon franz beckenbauer struck a similar line in his column in bild . " do we have a chance against cristiano ronaldo and his portuguese with such a performance ?
no , definitely not , " he said .
" our 11 must improve considerably to reach the semi-finals .
the german midfield appeared to be lacking ideas , there was hardly any passing . " german press see no reason the cheer the sueddeutsche zeitung -lrb- sz -rrb- also issued a devastating assessment , fearing a return to the poor " rumble " soccer germany played in the first years of the decade . " on thursday , portugal waits for the uninspired team of coach joachim loew , which appears to be drawing close the rumble soccer era again which seemed to have been overcome , " the sz said . the german media had mixed feelings about portugal .
some pointed out that germany wrapped up its great 2006 world cup campaign with a 3-1 win over portugal in the match for third place .
but also not forgotten was a 3-0 humiliation at euro 2000 . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : loew lost his cool with the official and hickersburger there was also concern whether loew will be able to coach his team from the sideline on thursday in basle , switzerland , as he was sent off -lrb- along with austrian helmsman josef hickersberger -rrb- after a dispute with the fourth match official . the ruling body uefa was expected to deal with the case and issue a ruling later tuesday , with kicker naming a ban " possible . " germany 's performance did also not raise eyebrows abroad . foreign papers mostly unimpressed austria lamented its first-round exit as host , but the kronenzeitung pointed out that only " the individual class of ballack made the difference . " the chelsea midfielder was also singled out elsewhere , with italy 's la gazzetta dello sport speaking of " not much game , a lot of ballack " and britain 's the sun saying : " ball of fame , chelsea ace comes up trumps . " but the guardian did not rule out a german improvement , saying that ballack could become the vital figure for germany in the aim to reach its goal of going very far in the tournament . " germany have one of euro 2008 's more influential players - and that , in itself , should give them hope for the remainder of a competition in which , thus far , they have flickered without truly igniting , " the paper wrote . dw staff / dpa -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" we did not want to be eliminated after the first round , and for that we worked very hard .
i think you ca n't fault our work-rate in the game against austria .
" obviously we 're happy to have made it to the quarter-finals , particularly after the difficult match we had against croatia , " he added .
" we had everything to lose and we were certainly favorites to win -lrb- against austria -rrb- .
you could tell that we were not as agile as we should have been because we tensed up , yet our desire to win proved decisive . "
respect , but no fear bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : with players like deco and ronaldo , portugal are a force looking ahead to their quarter-final clash , ballack said he had a lot of respect for portugal , who looked very impressive in their first two matches at the finals .
" but we do not fear them , " he said .
" they are a good side , and it is practically a rematch from the game at the world cup in 2006 .
but we do not have to be scared of them .
i know several portugal players , not just those that i play with .
" all their players are very good individually and they play well as a team as well , " he said .
" they 're very good in attack and not too focused on defense .
they have great players , not least -lrb- cristiano -rrb- ronaldo , who had a great season in england and it will be a very difficult task .
" nobody has to tell us that they are good players .
i am also looking forward to playing against their coach , who will be coaching me at chelsea next season . "
for ballack and his team-mates , the game against austria could well have been a turning point .
the win over austria was certainly a step in the right direction toward the german goal of winning a fourth european title .
but portugal will be a very different proposition to austria .
" both teams want to go far in this competition and portugal are probably favorites , ” ballack said .
“ we 've maybe slipped to a different role and who knows , maybe that will favor us . "
reactions are muted both home and abroad germany reacted more relieved than delighted to the national team 's euro 2008 quarter-final berth as the 1-0 win against austria gave no reason for optimism . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the fans celebrated but more with a sense of relief tens of thousands of germans partied in the nation 's fan zones during the game but post-match celebrations were very subdued - given the poor quality of play in vienna which only saw one glorious moment from the winning free-kick by ballack . " ballack fulfils the minimal goal , " said kicker sports magazine on its web site , naming the germans ' performance " anything but convincing . " the bild daily spoke of " many individual mistakes " as germany stumbled into a quarter-final date with portugal on thursday . german football icon franz beckenbauer struck a similar line in his column in bild . " do we have a chance against cristiano ronaldo and his portuguese with such a performance ?
no , definitely not , " he said .
" our 11 must improve considerably to reach the semi-finals .
the german midfield appeared to be lacking ideas , there was hardly any passing . " german press see no reason the cheer the sueddeutsche zeitung -lrb- sz -rrb- also issued a devastating assessment , fearing a return to the poor " rumble " soccer germany played in the first years of the decade . " on thursday , portugal waits for the uninspired team of coach joachim loew , which appears to be drawing close the rumble soccer era again which seemed to have been overcome , " the sz said . the german media had mixed feelings about portugal .
some pointed out that germany wrapped up its great 2006 world cup campaign with a 3-1 win over portugal in the match for third place .
but also not forgotten was a 3-0 humiliation at euro 2000 . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : loew lost his cool with the official and hickersburger there was also concern whether loew will be able to coach his team from the sideline on thursday in basle , switzerland , as he was sent off -lrb- along with austrian helmsman josef hickersberger -rrb- after a dispute with the fourth match official . the ruling body uefa was expected to deal with the case and issue a ruling later tuesday , with kicker naming a ban " possible . " germany 's performance did also not raise eyebrows abroad . foreign papers mostly unimpressed austria lamented its first-round exit as host , but the kronenzeitung pointed out that only " the individual class of ballack made the difference . " the chelsea midfielder was also singled out elsewhere , with italy 's la gazzetta dello sport speaking of " not much game , a lot of ballack " and britain 's the sun saying : " ball of fame , chelsea ace comes up trumps . " but the guardian did not rule out a german improvement , saying that ballack could become the vital figure for germany in the aim to reach its goal of going very far in the tournament . " germany have one of euro 2008 's more influential players - and that , in itself , should give them hope for the remainder of a competition in which , thus far , they have flickered without truly igniting , " the paper wrote . dw staff / dpa -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the german captain 's goal gave his side the 1-0 victory they needed to advance with croatia from group b into the quarter-finals .
before the game , an austrian newspaper had handed out a newsprint for the game showing a nude ballack with the headline " strip him naked . "
the 31-year-old was visibly relieved after the game .
" we put ourselves into a very difficult situation ahead of the match , " he said .
" the defeat against croatia meant that we could not lose against austria , and that put us under a lot of pressure . "
germany captain silences his doubters bildunterschrift : ballack 's thunderbolt silenced his critics and eliminated austria asked what he had meant to say with his sign after scoring , ballack said that much had been written ahead of the game .
" if you read everything that the austrian press and public said , you would have believed that they had won the world cup three times and that we could hardly kick a ball , " he said .
" that is why i think that my goal silenced them . "
ballack could quite easily have used the gesture , too , to silence his own critics , who have been multiplying since a far-from impressive display by the german captain in germany 's 2-1 loss to croatia in their previous game .
" we wanted to win this game against austria , as we came here with a goal , " he said .
" we did not want to be eliminated after the first round , and for that we worked very hard .
i think you ca n't fault our work-rate in the game against austria .
" obviously we 're happy to have made it to the quarter-finals , particularly after the difficult match we had against croatia , " he added .
" we had everything to lose and we were certainly favorites to win -lrb- against austria -rrb- .
you could tell that we were not as agile as we should have been because we tensed up , yet our desire to win proved decisive . "
respect , but no fear bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : with players like deco and ronaldo , portugal are a force looking ahead to their quarter-final clash , ballack said he had a lot of respect for portugal , who looked very impressive in their first two matches at the finals .
" but we do not fear them , " he said .
" they are a good side , and it is practically a rematch from the game at the world cup in 2006 .
but we do not have to be scared of them .
i know several portugal players , not just those that i play with .
" all their players are very good individually and they play well as a team as well , " he said .
" they 're very good in attack and not too focused on defense .
they have great players , not least -lrb- cristiano -rrb- ronaldo , who had a great season in england and it will be a very difficult task .
" nobody has to tell us that they are good players .
i am also looking forward to playing against their coach , who will be coaching me at chelsea next season . "
for ballack and his team-mates , the game against austria could well have been a turning point .
the win over austria was certainly a step in the right direction toward the german goal of winning a fourth european title .
but portugal will be a very different proposition to austria .
" both teams want to go far in this competition and portugal are probably favorites , ” ballack said .
“ we 've maybe slipped to a different role and who knows , maybe that will favor us . "
reactions are muted both home and abroad germany reacted more relieved than delighted to the national team 's euro 2008 quarter-final berth as the 1-0 win against austria gave no reason for optimism . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the fans celebrated but more with a sense of relief tens of thousands of germans partied in the nation 's fan zones during the game but post-match celebrations were very subdued - given the poor quality of play in vienna which only saw one glorious moment from the winning free-kick by ballack . " ballack fulfils the minimal goal , " said kicker sports magazine on its web site , naming the germans ' performance " anything but convincing . " the bild daily spoke of " many individual mistakes " as germany stumbled into a quarter-final date with portugal on thursday . german football icon franz beckenbauer struck a similar line in his column in bild . " do we have a chance against cristiano ronaldo and his portuguese with such a performance ?
no , definitely not , " he said .
" our 11 must improve considerably to reach the semi-finals .
the german midfield appeared to be lacking ideas , there was hardly any passing . " german press see no reason the cheer the sueddeutsche zeitung -lrb- sz -rrb- also issued a devastating assessment , fearing a return to the poor " rumble " soccer germany played in the first years of the decade . " on thursday , portugal waits for the uninspired team of coach joachim loew , which appears to be drawing close the rumble soccer era again which seemed to have been overcome , " the sz said . the german media had mixed feelings about portugal .
some pointed out that germany wrapped up its great 2006 world cup campaign with a 3-1 win over portugal in the match for third place .
but also not forgotten was a 3-0 humiliation at euro 2000 . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : loew lost his cool with the official and hickersburger there was also concern whether loew will be able to coach his team from the sideline on thursday in basle , switzerland , as he was sent off -lrb- along with austrian helmsman josef hickersberger -rrb- after a dispute with the fourth match official . the ruling body uefa was expected to deal with the case and issue a ruling later tuesday , with kicker naming a ban " possible . " germany 's performance did also not raise eyebrows abroad . foreign papers mostly unimpressed austria lamented its first-round exit as host , but the kronenzeitung pointed out that only " the individual class of ballack made the difference . " the chelsea midfielder was also singled out elsewhere , with italy 's la gazzetta dello sport speaking of " not much game , a lot of ballack " and britain 's the sun saying : " ball of fame , chelsea ace comes up trumps . " but the guardian did not rule out a german improvement , saying that ballack could become the vital figure for germany in the aim to reach its goal of going very far in the tournament . " germany have one of euro 2008 's more influential players - and that , in itself , should give them hope for the remainder of a competition in which , thus far , they have flickered without truly igniting , " the paper wrote . dw staff / dpa -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

but what they got was more of the same against a weaker opponent .
now some are turning on yogi . euro 2008 was supposed to be the tournament where the new german brand of power soccer , pioneered by loew and his predecessor juergen klinsmann , resulted in some silverware .
instead , the co-favorites struggled to survive a first-round group that was among the weakest ever in the competition .
germany 's 1-0 win against austria came against a side whose main striker played most of his matches this season for werder bremen 's amateurs - in the bundesliga 's third division .
nonetheless , germany needed a 120 km / h -lrb- 74.5 mph -rrb- free kick from michael ballack to best their much smaller southern neighbors .
after the match , many credited ballack with saving yogi 's hide .
bildunterschrift : one moment of ballack brilliance made up for a dismal performance " the captain personally spared the team and above all the team management the unpleasant discussions that would have followed germany potentially exiting the tournament in vienna , " wrote the on-line version of the frankfurter allgemeine zeitung newspaper .

for the neutral , it would be a great soccer spectacle .
but for some fans , it would be a crisis of loyalties . spanish fans , especially those who follow real madrid , will rejoice that david villa 's last-gasp winner against sweden will almost certainly put off , for the time being , their having to achieve what world champions italy and runners-up france could not .
namely , avoid being turned over by a dutch team hitting peak form .
spain 's successes over russia and the swedes mean luis aragones ' men won group d after the russians defeated greece 1-0 on saturday and ended the greeks reign as european champions .
that means a quarter-final meeting with romania , france - or world champions italy , who controversially knocked the " furia roja " out in the last eight of the 1934 and 1994 world cups .
for many reasons , this allows the spanish faithful to breathe a little easier - at least for now .
if both the dutch and spain keep up their current form , they will put off the potentially juicy clash until later in the tournament and postpone a conflict of interest for spanish fans of the ' oranje ' .
real madrid 's dutchmen making spanish proud bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : robben and van nistelrooy have enjoyed success in spain in a country where club famously comes before country , real fans must feel they are in a win-win situation as their trio wesley sneijder , arjen robben and ruud van nistelrooy have been on fire for holland in two games where they have over-run both the italians and the french .
if and when the dutch and the spanish do meet , given their extensive personnel links , it will be an interesting meeting of soccer minds .
the dutch would have a slight advantage , given their intimate knowledge of the spanish system through playing in la liga .
giovanni van bronckhorst , who netted against the italians along with sneijder and van nistelrooy , spent four years at barcelona , though he has now returned home to feyenoord .
holland have for decades made superb travelers and their ability to indulge in cultural assimilation is second to none .
although they have a solid foundation of home-based players , nine in the squad turning out in the eredivisie , six more ply their trade in the english premiership .
real 's goalscoring trio aside ' only ' four play in spain - the fourth ' mosquetero ' being sevilla defender khalid boulahrouz .
holland stars find home-from-home in la liga but the links with la liga are tried and tested and spain has become almost a second home for a roll call of famous dutch players throughout the decades .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : dutchman frank rijkaard was coach at barcelona all that has changed recently is today real madrid are more orange than barcelona , who has traditionally had the deeper dutch hue with the likes of johan cruyff , fellow recent coaches louis van gaal and frank rijkaard and a long roll call of dutch internationals from johan neeskens to patrick kluivert and marc overmars .
real may of course try to balance things up next season by bringing in a portuguese-speaker in the shape of cristiano ronaldo .
portuguese has regularly been heard in the corridors of the nou camp - but barca 's preference in that regard has historically been for lusophones who hail from brazil .
whatever the domestic ramifications for next year 's la liga contest , one thing is clear on the evidence of euro 2008 to date : the dutch , with their 21st-century variant of total football are unquestionably the latinos of northern europe , with van basten a proponent of flair-fuelled , attacking football from the flanks - a concept foreign to so many teams today .
possible semi-final clash pits friends and colleagues bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : torres and villa have combined with lethal effect a quarter-final encounter with the swedes - or possibly the russians - would thus prove a fascinating clash of styles before a potential semi pitting holland 's real madrid forward line against real madrid pillars of the spanish defense in the shape of iker casillas and sergio ramos .
meanwhile , the dutch will have their defense tested - perhaps for the first time to such an extent in euro 2008 - by the hot form of valencia-liverpool tandem david villa and fernando torres .
it would make for a fascinating contest at any level bit let 's hope there is much to play for when these two countries meet . dw staff / afp -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

a surging euro and spiralling inflation have begun to affect europe 's biggest economy . economists had forecast a drop in the zew index in june to minus 42.5 points .
tuesday 's report , drawn up by the mannheim-based centre for european economic research , showed a further slide than anticipated , to minus 52.4 points from minus 41.4 points in may . based on the responses of 264 analysts and institutional investors , the zew indicator is considered a preview for the release later this month of germany 's closely watched ifo business confidence index . declining orders , inflation fears driving drop bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : rising food prices contributed to concerns the zew institute cited two major causes for the slip . " on the one hand , repeatedly decreasing incoming orders indicate that germany 's momentum will lose steam in the next six months , " said zew president wolfgang franz during a presentation of the survey . " on the other hand , continuing price increases for energy and food are reducing the purchasing power of consumers , " he added .
" the expectations of the financial market analysts are strongly influenced by the current forecast of a weaker economic momentum in 2009 . " concerns have likewise been mounting about the impact of soaring inflation on both consumers and businesses .
the european union 's statistics office on monday revised the may inflation rate in the 15-member euro zone to a 16-year high of 3.7 percent . fears of an interest rate hike caused concern earlier this month after european central bank chief jean-claude trichet had placed investors on notice .
renewed inflationary pressures , he said , meant that the bank 's 21-head governing council was sizing up a rate hike of up to 25-basis points when it meets in early july . fears of a backsliding economy bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the european central bank warned of an interest rate hike all of this comes against the backdrop of expectations that despite a strong start to the year , the german economy may backslide as 2008 unfolds . " the upswing will lose significant drive in the coming 12 months , " said germany 's chamber of industry and commerce -lrb- dihk -rrb- when it released its latest survey of members on monday . still , despite the more downbeat mood emerging from its survey , the dihk joined other groups in raising its german growth forecast for 2008 to 2.3 percent from a previous estimate of 2.0 percent . dw staff -lrb- cat -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" the secretary general welcomes the announcement by french president sarkozy that there are no obstacles to france rejoining the integrated command , " nato spokesman james appathurai said on tuesday , june 17 . the white house likewise embraced the move .
" we welcome the announcement , " gordon johndroe , white house national security spokesman , said . stephen hadley , president george w. bush 's national security adviser , said in april at the nato summit in bucharest that bush was in favor of france coming back into the integrated command , and generally favored european partners boosting capacities for eu and nato missions . hadley " made it very clear that the united states wants a strong partner in europe , wants a strong eu partner , and that involves both more military capability for those countries , but also partnering nato 's military capability with eu civilian and political capabilities , " johndroe added . a return to nato military command france announced a return to nato on tuesday , 42 years after former president charles de gaulle left the alliance it helped found , angry at what he saw as the anglo-american dominance of the alliance . " i want the alliance to be more european , and how can we have a more european alliance without france , " said sarkozy . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : sarkozy outlined plans for a reintegration into nato 's military wing after 42 years the president announced his country ’ s return while outlining france ’ s defense priorities over the next 15 years , during which , he said , terrorism would be the number one threat . sarkozy said the military must put a new emphasis on security within france 's borders and adapt to modern challenges from terrorism to computer attacks . underscoring the focus on intelligence-gathering , a new national security council will be set up at elysee palace .
sarkozy urged a strong european defence policy and said france would revamp ties with nato . but he insisted that france would always retain control of its own forces and keep independent control of its nuclear deterrent , which would remain the cornerstone of its defence structure .
leaner , more mobile army the plan further shows france maintaining defence spending at about two percent of gross domestic product .
that means that from now until 2020 , some 377 billion euros -lrb- $ 579.1 billion -rrb- will be spent on defense -lrb- excluding pensions -rrb- . in order to create a more mobile and better-equipped military , the proposals also call for a cutting back of thousands of troops .
the air force staff , for example , would be cut from 65,000 to 50,000 .
four permanent bases in africa would also be closed as defense aims shift . former nato head and eu foreign policy chief javier solana welcomed the reforms . " i think the armed forces of several countries are very big on paper .
but what is needed are forces that are available , even if there 's no need for millions of soldiers , forces that are available in a real way , with proper equipment , " he said .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the plans foresee the creation of a leaner , more mobile french army despite the country ’ s individual cuts , the new strategy is said to showcase the government ’ s desire to make european defense a priority once france takes over the eu ’ s rotating presidency beginning july 1 .
as part of the plan , sarkozy called for the establishment of a european rapid intervention force of 60,000 soldiers . until recently , the united states and britain have been reluctant to strengthen european defenses , concerned that such a move would prove expensive and duplicate nato capabilities . critics fear loss of french foreign policy independence though france continues to play a role in decision-making bodies , it is not part of the integrated command structure .
french troops have taken part in nato operations over the last several decades .
in the 1990s , france sent troops to the balkans .
two years ago , troops went to pakistan to help with disaster relief work following the earthquake . france likewise has a contingent in the nato-led security force in afghanistan ; sarkozy has committed to expanding that , sending some 700 soldiers to the volatile east to help with operations in the war-torn country . still , questions remained about how exactly france would re-enter the fray .
" obviously , it 's up to france exactly how and when it wants to resume its full participation in nato structures , " said appathurai . in france , however , not all were excited about the announcement . several members of sarkozy 's own ruling party have protested what they see as a loss of france ’ s hallmark independence in foreign policy - a betrayal of de gaulle 's legacy . members of the opposition socialist party likewise criticized the move , accusing the president , the most atlanticist french president in recent years , of sucking up to washington . sarkozy hit back at his critics .

former us senator sam nunn spoke with deutsche welle about the foreign policy of both presidential candidates .
he also called on the us to decrease its nuclear arsenal and increase its support for the united nations . sam nunn , a former democratic senator , is often tipped for a leadership post should barack obama be elected president of the united states .
nunn , 59 , honed his foreign and military policy expertise as the chair of the senate armed services committee .
since leaving office in 1997 , he has devoted himself to working to reduce the threat from nuclear weapons and currently serves as the ceo of the nuclear threat initiative -lrb- nti -rrb- .
nunn was recently in berlin , where he spoke with deutsche welle .
you have said that germany can play an important role in bringing the united states , nato and russia closer to each other .
what specific measures could this involve ?
first , i think we have to decide and russia has to decide whether we want russia to be part of the europe-atlantic security arc .
if so , then we and russia need to start sitting down and talking about those issues : finding out what their problems are with security , trying to address those problems , giving each other reassurance , having military to military meetings .
now the nato-russian council was set up for that purpose .
it worked for awhile , but it clearly is n't working anymore .
winston churchill once said : " no matter how beautiful your strategy at some point you need to look at the results . "
the results are the trajectory of nato-russia relationships – whether it 's in energy security or overall security or missile defense – is not heading in a very constructive direction .
what role can germany play in improving these ties and negotiations ?
that 's something that germany will have to decide that for itself .
i can only say that these are difficult questions and i believe the german people and the german government – with their close relationship with the united states , their leadership in nato and the european community , their friendship with both eastern europe and russia – that they are in a unique position to begin stimulating both sides to ask these questions and begin to answer them .
i do n't have all the answers but i think i do know what some of the questions are .
how would the foreign policy of an obama 's presidency differ from that of the current us administration ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : nunn would like to see the us reduce its nuclear weapons arsenal i believe both obama and mccain would both move in different directions than this administration .
i 'm very confident on the obama side that he would listen to people in europe , i 'm certain that mccain would do likewise .
i believe both of them would try a more multilateral approach .
i believe obama would reach out and look for new directions of partnership between the united states and europe and i hope also with russia and with other people around the globe .
you have brought up the argument regarding nuclear weapons that it 's hard to convince others to quit smoking when you 're a chain smoker yourself .
does the us need to reduce its nuclear arsenal ?
i think we 've got far too many nuclear weapons .
i think the russians have far too many nuclear weapons .
i think all the nuclear powers need to look at how many they need .
but i also think it 's important to look at the operational status of those weapons .
this means the way you posture your nuclear weapons , whether they 're on quick alert , how rapidly they can be fired , the warning time , the decision time on both sides .
all of that is enormously important and just as important as the numbers .
so what i would like to see is military-to-military , civilian-to-civilian top-level discussions on how we can give each other more warning time .
the president of russia or the president of the united states would have more than a few minutes to decide whether to fire the weapons if they get a warning , which could be a false warning .
i do n't think anybody expects a first strike .
we 've moved away from confrontation .
there 's no more warsaw pact , no more soviet union , no more massive tank armies .
but we have not taken that into account in a significant way in the operational status of our forces .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : iran is watching closely how other countries deal with the nuclear issue if we really are serious about trying to keep countries like iran , north korea and others from acquiring nuclear weapons , then we ought to de-emphasize their importance .
we ought to make it clear to the world that we are not relying on those nuclear weapons for first strike unless we are struck ourselves with nuclear weapons .
as long as we , russia and other nuclear powers give nuclear weapons great prestige and we act as if they are essential for our own defense , it 's enormously difficult to try and convince other countries not to acquire these weapons .
and that 's where we are right now .
does this need for better cooperation between countries mean that the united states should become more involved in the united nations ?
on the nuclear side , certainly we ought to be more involved and we ought to get more behind iaea , the international atomic energy agency , that 's the official arm of the un in dealing with these questions .
this enormously important organization won the noble peace prize two years ago .
they are going to be increasingly important .
they need more funds , they need more help , they need more support .
it 's not just the united states , it 's our friends , germany and others , that need to understand that the iaea is being given a job without sufficient resources today .
so yes , we need to be more supportive in that regard . interview : jan m. schaefer -lrb- th -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

for the neutral , it would be a great soccer spectacle .
but for some fans , it would be a crisis of loyalties . spanish fans , especially those who follow real madrid , will rejoice that david villa 's last-gasp winner against sweden will almost certainly put off , for the time being , their having to achieve what world champions italy and runners-up france could not .
namely , avoid being turned over by a dutch team hitting peak form .
spain 's successes over russia and the swedes mean luis aragones ' men won group d after the russians defeated greece 1-0 on saturday and ended the greeks reign as european champions .
that means a quarter-final meeting with romania , france - or world champions italy , who controversially knocked the " furia roja " out in the last eight of the 1934 and 1994 world cups .
for many reasons , this allows the spanish faithful to breathe a little easier - at least for now .
if both the dutch and spain keep up their current form , they will put off the potentially juicy clash until later in the tournament and postpone a conflict of interest for spanish fans of the ' oranje ' .
real madrid 's dutchmen making spanish proud bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : robben and van nistelrooy have enjoyed success in spain in a country where club famously comes before country , real fans must feel they are in a win-win situation as their trio wesley sneijder , arjen robben and ruud van nistelrooy have been on fire for holland in two games where they have over-run both the italians and the french .
if and when the dutch and the spanish do meet , given their extensive personnel links , it will be an interesting meeting of soccer minds .
the dutch would have a slight advantage , given their intimate knowledge of the spanish system through playing in la liga .
giovanni van bronckhorst , who netted against the italians along with sneijder and van nistelrooy , spent four years at barcelona , though he has now returned home to feyenoord .
holland have for decades made superb travelers and their ability to indulge in cultural assimilation is second to none .
although they have a solid foundation of home-based players , nine in the squad turning out in the eredivisie , six more ply their trade in the english premiership .
real 's goalscoring trio aside ' only ' four play in spain - the fourth ' mosquetero ' being sevilla defender khalid boulahrouz .
holland stars find home-from-home in la liga but the links with la liga are tried and tested and spain has become almost a second home for a roll call of famous dutch players throughout the decades .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : dutchman frank rijkaard was coach at barcelona all that has changed recently is today real madrid are more orange than barcelona , who has traditionally had the deeper dutch hue with the likes of johan cruyff , fellow recent coaches louis van gaal and frank rijkaard and a long roll call of dutch internationals from johan neeskens to patrick kluivert and marc overmars .
real may of course try to balance things up next season by bringing in a portuguese-speaker in the shape of cristiano ronaldo .
portuguese has regularly been heard in the corridors of the nou camp - but barca 's preference in that regard has historically been for lusophones who hail from brazil .
whatever the domestic ramifications for next year 's la liga contest , one thing is clear on the evidence of euro 2008 to date : the dutch , with their 21st-century variant of total football are unquestionably the latinos of northern europe , with van basten a proponent of flair-fuelled , attacking football from the flanks - a concept foreign to so many teams today .

in germany , they had a realistic chance of such a celebration but were left a little disappointed by germany 's performance on monday night . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some germany fans did n't seem too upset by their side 's insipid performance " there is not much to celebrate , because the real test of character starts in the next round when we will face portugal .
i guess we lost the plot when we lost to croatia , it might just be the end of the road because it is going to be a really tough game against portugal , we might just need something special or we kiss good buy to this tournament , " said a germany soccer fan from asia in a neighborhood in the northern part of the western german city of bonn . another germany supporter , originally from ghana , had a different view . " the match was not bad at all , these guys played very well considering what was at stake , i guess they have a chance to go far , " said kwaku tchite , a ghanaian national living in bonn . luck and drama others pointed out the game certainly contained enough drama to make up for the poor quality of the soccer . " i have never seen so much football drama in my life , " said menzi dlamini , a journalist from swaziland currently living in berlin .
dlamini was referring to the referee 's decision to give send off both the germany and austrian soccer coaches to the stands for arguing with the assistant referee . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : austria coach hickersberger , left , and germany 's loew created a stir at the game for sharma sharirriff , who comes from yemen but currently in bonn where is studying medicinal sciences , it all had to do with how the germany team reacted to pressure and tried to absorb it . " i think the team just failed to handle the pressure that comes with such a big game with huge expectations from fans , " sharirriff said .
" this was evident when the germany coach failed to handle the pressure from the austrian coach who was clearly playing mind games . " kumbirai mafunda , a zimbabwean student in berlin , said the german side were lucky to have made it to the quarterfinals . " the germany team could have wrapped up the game in the first half but missed several chances and that proved to be their undoing , " mafunda said .

former us senator sam nunn spoke with deutsche welle about the foreign policy of both presidential candidates .
he also called on the us to decrease its nuclear arsenal and increase its support for the united nations . sam nunn , a former democratic senator , is often tipped for a leadership post should barack obama be elected president of the united states .
nunn , 59 , honed his foreign and military policy expertise as the chair of the senate armed services committee .
since leaving office in 1997 , he has devoted himself to working to reduce the threat from nuclear weapons and currently serves as the ceo of the nuclear threat initiative -lrb- nti -rrb- .
nunn was recently in berlin , where he spoke with deutsche welle .
you have said that germany can play an important role in bringing the united states , nato and russia closer to each other .
what specific measures could this involve ?
first , i think we have to decide and russia has to decide whether we want russia to be part of the europe-atlantic security arc .
if so , then we and russia need to start sitting down and talking about those issues : finding out what their problems are with security , trying to address those problems , giving each other reassurance , having military to military meetings .
now the nato-russian council was set up for that purpose .
it worked for awhile , but it clearly is n't working anymore .
winston churchill once said : " no matter how beautiful your strategy at some point you need to look at the results . "
the results are the trajectory of nato-russia relationships – whether it 's in energy security or overall security or missile defense – is not heading in a very constructive direction .
what role can germany play in improving these ties and negotiations ?
that 's something that germany will have to decide that for itself .
i can only say that these are difficult questions and i believe the german people and the german government – with their close relationship with the united states , their leadership in nato and the european community , their friendship with both eastern europe and russia – that they are in a unique position to begin stimulating both sides to ask these questions and begin to answer them .
i do n't have all the answers but i think i do know what some of the questions are .
how would the foreign policy of an obama 's presidency differ from that of the current us administration ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : nunn would like to see the us reduce its nuclear weapons arsenal i believe both obama and mccain would both move in different directions than this administration .
i 'm very confident on the obama side that he would listen to people in europe , i 'm certain that mccain would do likewise .
i believe both of them would try a more multilateral approach .
i believe obama would reach out and look for new directions of partnership between the united states and europe and i hope also with russia and with other people around the globe .
you have brought up the argument regarding nuclear weapons that it 's hard to convince others to quit smoking when you 're a chain smoker yourself .
does the us need to reduce its nuclear arsenal ?
i think we 've got far too many nuclear weapons .
i think the russians have far too many nuclear weapons .
i think all the nuclear powers need to look at how many they need .
but i also think it 's important to look at the operational status of those weapons .
this means the way you posture your nuclear weapons , whether they 're on quick alert , how rapidly they can be fired , the warning time , the decision time on both sides .
all of that is enormously important and just as important as the numbers .
so what i would like to see is military-to-military , civilian-to-civilian top-level discussions on how we can give each other more warning time .
the president of russia or the president of the united states would have more than a few minutes to decide whether to fire the weapons if they get a warning , which could be a false warning .
i do n't think anybody expects a first strike .
we 've moved away from confrontation .
there 's no more warsaw pact , no more soviet union , no more massive tank armies .
but we have not taken that into account in a significant way in the operational status of our forces .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : iran is watching closely how other countries deal with the nuclear issue if we really are serious about trying to keep countries like iran , north korea and others from acquiring nuclear weapons , then we ought to de-emphasize their importance .
we ought to make it clear to the world that we are not relying on those nuclear weapons for first strike unless we are struck ourselves with nuclear weapons .
as long as we , russia and other nuclear powers give nuclear weapons great prestige and we act as if they are essential for our own defense , it 's enormously difficult to try and convince other countries not to acquire these weapons .
and that 's where we are right now .
does this need for better cooperation between countries mean that the united states should become more involved in the united nations ?
on the nuclear side , certainly we ought to be more involved and we ought to get more behind iaea , the international atomic energy agency , that 's the official arm of the un in dealing with these questions .
this enormously important organization won the noble peace prize two years ago .
they are going to be increasingly important .
they need more funds , they need more help , they need more support .
it 's not just the united states , it 's our friends , germany and others , that need to understand that the iaea is being given a job without sufficient resources today .
so yes , we need to be more supportive in that regard . interview : jan m. schaefer -lrb- th -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the suits allege the european aircraft manufacturer misled investors . two us law firms have filed a lawsuit against the european aerospace giant , accusing its managers of misleading investors about the company 's finances and its ability to meet delivery deadlines for its a380 jet .
delays with the a380 superjumbo has caused major headaches for eads .
new york-based law firm dreier llp , which filed one lawsuit , said in a statement monday , june 16 that managers and core eads shareholders engaged in " rampant insider trading based on their knowledge of the problems surrounding the a380 . "
eads already knew in 2005 and 2006 that problems were looming and raced to sell their shares , according to the lawsuit .
another lawsuit filed by san diego-based firm , coughlin stoia , alleges eads falsely assured investors that it would overcome technical problems related to the a380 .
an eads spokesman declined to comment on the lawsuits .
french investigators are looking into insider trading charges against more than a dozen of the company 's top executives .
they cashed in on about 20 million euros -lrb- $ 31 million -rrb- of gross profit from the sales just a short time before the company announced the a380 would be delayed .
the announcement caused eads stock to drop more than 30 percent .
the problems with the a 380 , the world 's largest commercial aircraft , provoked a crisis in eads and airbus , and led to former co-chairman noel forgeard being forced to step down .
forgeard is under formal investigation over the alleged insider trading .

in germany , they had a realistic chance of such a celebration but were left a little disappointed by germany 's performance on monday night . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some germany fans did n't seem too upset by their side 's insipid performance " there is not much to celebrate , because the real test of character starts in the next round when we will face portugal .
i guess we lost the plot when we lost to croatia , it might just be the end of the road because it is going to be a really tough game against portugal , we might just need something special or we kiss good buy to this tournament , " said a germany soccer fan from asia in a neighborhood in the northern part of the western german city of bonn . another germany supporter , originally from ghana , had a different view .

former us senator sam nunn spoke with deutsche welle about the foreign policy of both presidential candidates .
he also called on the us to decrease its nuclear arsenal and increase its support for the united nations . sam nunn , a former democratic senator , is often tipped for a leadership post should barack obama be elected president of the united states .
nunn , 59 , honed his foreign and military policy expertise as the chair of the senate armed services committee .
since leaving office in 1997 , he has devoted himself to working to reduce the threat from nuclear weapons and currently serves as the ceo of the nuclear threat initiative -lrb- nti -rrb- .
nunn was recently in berlin , where he spoke with deutsche welle .
you have said that germany can play an important role in bringing the united states , nato and russia closer to each other .
what specific measures could this involve ?
first , i think we have to decide and russia has to decide whether we want russia to be part of the europe-atlantic security arc .
if so , then we and russia need to start sitting down and talking about those issues : finding out what their problems are with security , trying to address those problems , giving each other reassurance , having military to military meetings .
now the nato-russian council was set up for that purpose .
it worked for awhile , but it clearly is n't working anymore .
winston churchill once said : " no matter how beautiful your strategy at some point you need to look at the results . "
the results are the trajectory of nato-russia relationships – whether it 's in energy security or overall security or missile defense – is not heading in a very constructive direction .
what role can germany play in improving these ties and negotiations ?
that 's something that germany will have to decide that for itself .
i can only say that these are difficult questions and i believe the german people and the german government – with their close relationship with the united states , their leadership in nato and the european community , their friendship with both eastern europe and russia – that they are in a unique position to begin stimulating both sides to ask these questions and begin to answer them .
i do n't have all the answers but i think i do know what some of the questions are .
how would the foreign policy of an obama 's presidency differ from that of the current us administration ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : nunn would like to see the us reduce its nuclear weapons arsenal i believe both obama and mccain would both move in different directions than this administration .
i 'm very confident on the obama side that he would listen to people in europe , i 'm certain that mccain would do likewise .
i believe both of them would try a more multilateral approach .
i believe obama would reach out and look for new directions of partnership between the united states and europe and i hope also with russia and with other people around the globe .
you have brought up the argument regarding nuclear weapons that it 's hard to convince others to quit smoking when you 're a chain smoker yourself .
does the us need to reduce its nuclear arsenal ?
i think we 've got far too many nuclear weapons .
i think the russians have far too many nuclear weapons .
i think all the nuclear powers need to look at how many they need .
but i also think it 's important to look at the operational status of those weapons .
this means the way you posture your nuclear weapons , whether they 're on quick alert , how rapidly they can be fired , the warning time , the decision time on both sides .
all of that is enormously important and just as important as the numbers .
so what i would like to see is military-to-military , civilian-to-civilian top-level discussions on how we can give each other more warning time .
the president of russia or the president of the united states would have more than a few minutes to decide whether to fire the weapons if they get a warning , which could be a false warning .
i do n't think anybody expects a first strike .
we 've moved away from confrontation .
there 's no more warsaw pact , no more soviet union , no more massive tank armies .
but we have not taken that into account in a significant way in the operational status of our forces .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : iran is watching closely how other countries deal with the nuclear issue if we really are serious about trying to keep countries like iran , north korea and others from acquiring nuclear weapons , then we ought to de-emphasize their importance .
we ought to make it clear to the world that we are not relying on those nuclear weapons for first strike unless we are struck ourselves with nuclear weapons .
as long as we , russia and other nuclear powers give nuclear weapons great prestige and we act as if they are essential for our own defense , it 's enormously difficult to try and convince other countries not to acquire these weapons .
and that 's where we are right now .
does this need for better cooperation between countries mean that the united states should become more involved in the united nations ?
on the nuclear side , certainly we ought to be more involved and we ought to get more behind iaea , the international atomic energy agency , that 's the official arm of the un in dealing with these questions .
this enormously important organization won the noble peace prize two years ago .
they are going to be increasingly important .
they need more funds , they need more help , they need more support .
it 's not just the united states , it 's our friends , germany and others , that need to understand that the iaea is being given a job without sufficient resources today .

bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : iran is watching closely how other countries deal with the nuclear issue if we really are serious about trying to keep countries like iran , north korea and others from acquiring nuclear weapons , then we ought to de-emphasize their importance .
we ought to make it clear to the world that we are not relying on those nuclear weapons for first strike unless we are struck ourselves with nuclear weapons .
as long as we , russia and other nuclear powers give nuclear weapons great prestige and we act as if they are essential for our own defense , it 's enormously difficult to try and convince other countries not to acquire these weapons .
and that 's where we are right now .
does this need for better cooperation between countries mean that the united states should become more involved in the united nations ?
on the nuclear side , certainly we ought to be more involved and we ought to get more behind iaea , the international atomic energy agency , that 's the official arm of the un in dealing with these questions .
this enormously important organization won the noble peace prize two years ago .
they are going to be increasingly important .
they need more funds , they need more help , they need more support .
it 's not just the united states , it 's our friends , germany and others , that need to understand that the iaea is being given a job without sufficient resources today .
so yes , we need to be more supportive in that regard . interview : jan m. schaefer -lrb- th -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" the appointment should be made this week , " a senior un official told reuters on condition of anonymity on tuesday , june 17 .
" the planned arrival is on friday . "
zannier , a career diplomat and former director of the osce 's conflict prevention center in vienna , becomes the seventh special representative of the un secretary-general in kosovo since a nato bombing campaign in 1999 forced serb forces to halt the killing and ethnic cleansing of albanians during a crackdown on guerrillas .
serbia , russia oppose end of un mission bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : kosovo declared independence on feb .
17 german diplomat ruecker was supposed to be the last special representative and would leave once the newly independent state 's constitution took effect on sunday .
but un veto holder russia , which backs serbia in opposing kosovo 's secession , has blocked the withdrawal of the mission , believing that the new state would claim more credibility without its overseers in attendance .
ethnic albanian-majority kosovo 's parliament declared its independence from serbia on february 17 .
it has since been recognized by the united states and most members of the european union .
serbia and russia vehemently oppose kosovo 's independence and the introduction of an eu police and justice mission dubbed eulex to the territory , without the approval of the un security council .
new representative 's powers unclear the appointment of zannier appears to be an attempt at a compromise by the un secretary-general ban ki-moon , who has said that the italian 's appointment would be part of proposals to " reconfigure " the mission .
it cedes certain powers to pristina and for the european union to take over policing and justice oversight in return for a continued un presence .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : serb opposition to kosovo has turned violent in recent months however , with serbia and russia still insisting on security council authorization , it is unclear what powers zannier will have and how he will be expected to implement the new un proposals on the ground in kosovo .
it had been the eu 's hope to have a 2,200-strong police and justice mission up and running by june 15 , when kosovo 's first state constitution came into being .
the eu currently has only around 300 staff on the ground , and there is no immediate prospect of it deploying in the north , where hostile serbs say the mission is illegal . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

former us senator sam nunn spoke with deutsche welle about the foreign policy of both presidential candidates .
he also called on the us to decrease its nuclear arsenal and increase its support for the united nations . sam nunn , a former democratic senator , is often tipped for a leadership post should barack obama be elected president of the united states .
nunn , 59 , honed his foreign and military policy expertise as the chair of the senate armed services committee .
since leaving office in 1997 , he has devoted himself to working to reduce the threat from nuclear weapons and currently serves as the ceo of the nuclear threat initiative -lrb- nti -rrb- .
nunn was recently in berlin , where he spoke with deutsche welle .
you have said that germany can play an important role in bringing the united states , nato and russia closer to each other .
what specific measures could this involve ?
first , i think we have to decide and russia has to decide whether we want russia to be part of the europe-atlantic security arc .
if so , then we and russia need to start sitting down and talking about those issues : finding out what their problems are with security , trying to address those problems , giving each other reassurance , having military to military meetings .
now the nato-russian council was set up for that purpose .
it worked for awhile , but it clearly is n't working anymore .
winston churchill once said : " no matter how beautiful your strategy at some point you need to look at the results . "
the results are the trajectory of nato-russia relationships – whether it 's in energy security or overall security or missile defense – is not heading in a very constructive direction .
what role can germany play in improving these ties and negotiations ?
that 's something that germany will have to decide that for itself .
i can only say that these are difficult questions and i believe the german people and the german government – with their close relationship with the united states , their leadership in nato and the european community , their friendship with both eastern europe and russia – that they are in a unique position to begin stimulating both sides to ask these questions and begin to answer them .
i do n't have all the answers but i think i do know what some of the questions are .
how would the foreign policy of an obama 's presidency differ from that of the current us administration ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : nunn would like to see the us reduce its nuclear weapons arsenal i believe both obama and mccain would both move in different directions than this administration .
i 'm very confident on the obama side that he would listen to people in europe , i 'm certain that mccain would do likewise .
i believe both of them would try a more multilateral approach .
i believe obama would reach out and look for new directions of partnership between the united states and europe and i hope also with russia and with other people around the globe .
you have brought up the argument regarding nuclear weapons that it 's hard to convince others to quit smoking when you 're a chain smoker yourself .
does the us need to reduce its nuclear arsenal ?
i think we 've got far too many nuclear weapons .
i think the russians have far too many nuclear weapons .
i think all the nuclear powers need to look at how many they need .
but i also think it 's important to look at the operational status of those weapons .
this means the way you posture your nuclear weapons , whether they 're on quick alert , how rapidly they can be fired , the warning time , the decision time on both sides .
all of that is enormously important and just as important as the numbers .
so what i would like to see is military-to-military , civilian-to-civilian top-level discussions on how we can give each other more warning time .
the president of russia or the president of the united states would have more than a few minutes to decide whether to fire the weapons if they get a warning , which could be a false warning .
i do n't think anybody expects a first strike .
we 've moved away from confrontation .
there 's no more warsaw pact , no more soviet union , no more massive tank armies .
but we have not taken that into account in a significant way in the operational status of our forces .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : iran is watching closely how other countries deal with the nuclear issue if we really are serious about trying to keep countries like iran , north korea and others from acquiring nuclear weapons , then we ought to de-emphasize their importance .
we ought to make it clear to the world that we are not relying on those nuclear weapons for first strike unless we are struck ourselves with nuclear weapons .
as long as we , russia and other nuclear powers give nuclear weapons great prestige and we act as if they are essential for our own defense , it 's enormously difficult to try and convince other countries not to acquire these weapons .
and that 's where we are right now .
does this need for better cooperation between countries mean that the united states should become more involved in the united nations ?
on the nuclear side , certainly we ought to be more involved and we ought to get more behind iaea , the international atomic energy agency , that 's the official arm of the un in dealing with these questions .
this enormously important organization won the noble peace prize two years ago .
they are going to be increasingly important .
they need more funds , they need more help , they need more support .
it 's not just the united states , it 's our friends , germany and others , that need to understand that the iaea is being given a job without sufficient resources today .

but the scientists said they would like to study the issue longer to make absolutely sure that young children exposed to such electro-magnetic fields did not develop health problems in old age . the bureau , which employs top radiation scientists , advised parents not to let children keep phones permanently in their clothing until such a risk had been ruled out .
large numbers of germans fear mobile phones may be lethal after alarming reports about them in the media .
more than 50 german research projects since 2002 were analyzed for the report .
in some cases , genetic activity in human cells was observed to change under the influence of radiation , but this did not alter the overall conclusion that the phones were safe .

italy , meanwhile , remain positive despite coming under intense pressure . the backdrop to this latest installment of the rivalry between the old foes could not be more different to their last meeting in a major tournament .
back in 2006 , italy overcame france at berlin 's majestic olympic stadium to be crowned champions of the world .
on tuesday at euro 2008 , those two same soccer superpowers roll up their sleeves in a back alley scrap for a route out of group c on the heels of already qualified holland .
wide margin defeats to the dutch -lrb- 3-0 and 4-1 respectively -rrb- and 1-1 and 0-0 draws with romania left italy and france requiring a win and romania to draw or lose to holland .
given their inferior goal difference that is the only way france can make it .
italy would still have a chance if they draw with france , and romania lose , leaving them both with two points .
here the permutations require the services of a rocket scientist , but in a nutshell italy would go through if they produce a score draw with france and romania lose .
the reward is a quarter-final date with group d winners spain in vienna next sunday .
shaky rearguard without vieira 's protection again france keeper gregory coupet , reeling from france 's heaviest defeat in almost three decades against the dutch , summed up the somber mood in les bleus ' camp .
" today we 've got our heads down , " he said at the team 's training headquarters in chatel-saint-denis on sunday , the day after the holland game .
" there 's tiredness , questions being asked . we need time to breathe and to prepare quickly for italy . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : france will be without their captain patrick vieira france , whose famed defense , the traditional bedrock of raymond domenech 's side , was embarrassingly torn apart by holland , will continue to be without talismanic captain patrick vieira who missed the opening two games with a left thigh problem .
domenech has a real tactical conundrum on his hands as he 's already tried 4-4-2 and 4-3-2-1 with different players - while his opposite number roberto donadoni made no fewer than five changes for the azzurri 's second game against romania .
hero buffon accepts fragile lifeline italy would already be down and out if it had n't been for keeper gianluigi buffon 's heroics in saving a late penalty from adrian mutu .
" this is the match of our lives , " said the italian keeper .
" after suffering a defeat such as we did against holland you either roll over or you appeal to your pride and that 's what we did against romania .
like ourselves , france will be surprised only to have mustered one point after two matches .
but it seems that italy are on better form as we have come off a good match . "
bildunterschrift : gianluigi buffon was beaten three times against the dutch both sides know each other well with france coming out on top when they met in the euro 2000 final only for italy to gain handsome compensation in the 2006 world cup .
they were also drawn together in qualifying for this competition .
thierry henry , who was deployed as a lone striker in that game , reflecting on the monumental task lying ahead in zurich , said : " now we know that we have to beat italy and hope for good news from the other match .
it 's ' do-able ' but it 's going to be a knife edge game with the italians .
we still have a possibility of qualifying , we 're not defeated .
" this is not the first time we 've been in this situation and i hope once more we can lift our heads and get out of it .
we 'll try and prepare the best possible for italy , " he added .
donadoni convinced his players are up for it up at their euro headquarters in austria , donadoni said he could sense the determination in his players to pull off a houdini-style escape against les bleus .
" we have to beat france , " the former ac milan winger said .
" it is a crucial match because when you still have a chance to qualify , you have to push yourself to the limit .
i saw already at training ... that the players are determined to prove how good they are against the french .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : italy 's players train for " the match of their lives " " they have a real hunger to prepare in the best possible manner for this challenge , which will dictate whether or not we progress or not , " he added .
" we are ready .
it is the last match of the group stages , we know what is at stake and we will put our heart and soul into winning what is a key match . "
donadoni said statistics and records mean nothing in a game like this .
" it has been said that italy has not managed to beat france in a normal game for 30 years , " donadoni said .
" but the statistics , quite frankly , are n't important .
before last week , it had been 30 years since the netherlands last beat italy and we all know what happened there . "
striking dilemma adds to italian woes as his side have scored just one goal in two games , donadoni admitted he is considering playing sampdoria striker antonio cassano up front alongside bayern munich 's luca toni .
having used udinese 's antonio di natale against the dutch and juventus star alessandro del piero against romania , the azzurri 's forwards have yet to fire in the tournament .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : which of italy 's strikers will be in the pink on tuesday ?
" you will see who i select on the day , " donadoni said .
" cassano reminds me of myself when i was playing , but he plays more forward , while i had other responsibilities .
he does n't help out so much at getting the ball back , which irritates me sometimes as soccer is also about playing when you do n't have the ball . "
donadoni insists all concentration will be in zurich rather than the other group c clash between the dutch and romanians in berne .
" you ca n't afford to think about the other match , those things are out of our control , " said the italian .
" all that worries us is to do the best we can .
after that we may not have our destiny in our own hands , but we just have to get on with the job in hand . " our suitcases are n't packed yet , they are still open .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de kosovo -pipe- 17.06.2008 report : italian diplomat to take over un kosovo mission großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany 's joachim ruecker stands down this week to make way for italy 's zannier italian diplomat lamberto zannier will take over as the new head of the un interim mission to kosovo - unmik - when the incumbent joachim ruecker leaves his post later this week , according to a senior un official . " the appointment should be made this week , " a senior un official told reuters on condition of anonymity on tuesday , june 17 .
" the planned arrival is on friday . "
zannier , a career diplomat and former director of the osce 's conflict prevention center in vienna , becomes the seventh special representative of the un secretary-general in kosovo since a nato bombing campaign in 1999 forced serb forces to halt the killing and ethnic cleansing of albanians during a crackdown on guerrillas .
serbia , russia oppose end of un mission bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : kosovo declared independence on feb .
17 german diplomat ruecker was supposed to be the last special representative and would leave once the newly independent state 's constitution took effect on sunday .
but un veto holder russia , which backs serbia in opposing kosovo 's secession , has blocked the withdrawal of the mission , believing that the new state would claim more credibility without its overseers in attendance .
ethnic albanian-majority kosovo 's parliament declared its independence from serbia on february 17 .
it has since been recognized by the united states and most members of the european union .
serbia and russia vehemently oppose kosovo 's independence and the introduction of an eu police and justice mission dubbed eulex to the territory , without the approval of the un security council .
new representative 's powers unclear the appointment of zannier appears to be an attempt at a compromise by the un secretary-general ban ki-moon , who has said that the italian 's appointment would be part of proposals to " reconfigure " the mission .
it cedes certain powers to pristina and for the european union to take over policing and justice oversight in return for a continued un presence .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : serb opposition to kosovo has turned violent in recent months however , with serbia and russia still insisting on security council authorization , it is unclear what powers zannier will have and how he will be expected to implement the new un proposals on the ground in kosovo .
it had been the eu 's hope to have a 2,200-strong police and justice mission up and running by june 15 , when kosovo 's first state constitution came into being .

" we are n't going to overcome the crisis when we lecture the irish or when we put them in the corner , " juncker said after a meeting of the eu 's 27 foreign ministers on monday , june 16 .
it would be " arrogant " to tell the irish that their votes do n't count because they are from a small country , juncker said in an article in the financial times deutschland newspaper .

some suggested drafting a declaration which would include assurances that ireland could opt out of a number of key areas .
ireland is the only eu country whose constitution requires new eu treaties to be approved via a referendum .

the german captain 's goal gave his side the 1-0 victory they needed to advance with croatia from group b into the quarter-finals .
before the game , an austrian newspaper had handed out a newsprint for the game showing a nude ballack with the headline " strip him naked . "
the 31-year-old was visibly relieved after the game .
" we put ourselves into a very difficult situation ahead of the match , " he said .
" the defeat against croatia meant that we could not lose against austria , and that put us under a lot of pressure . "
germany captain silences his doubters bildunterschrift : ballack 's thunderbolt silenced his critics and eliminated austria asked what he had meant to say with his sign after scoring , ballack said that much had been written ahead of the game .
" if you read everything that the austrian press and public said , you would have believed that they had won the world cup three times and that we could hardly kick a ball , " he said .
" that is why i think that my goal silenced them . "
ballack could quite easily have used the gesture , too , to silence his own critics , who have been multiplying since a far-from impressive display by the german captain in germany 's 2-1 loss to croatia in their previous game .
" we wanted to win this game against austria , as we came here with a goal , " he said .
" we did not want to be eliminated after the first round , and for that we worked very hard .
i think you ca n't fault our work-rate in the game against austria .
" obviously we 're happy to have made it to the quarter-finals , particularly after the difficult match we had against croatia , " he added .
" we had everything to lose and we were certainly favorites to win -lrb- against austria -rrb- .
you could tell that we were not as agile as we should have been because we tensed up , yet our desire to win proved decisive . "
respect , but no fear bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : with players like deco and ronaldo , portugal are a force looking ahead to their quarter-final clash , ballack said he had a lot of respect for portugal , who looked very impressive in their first two matches at the finals .
" but we do not fear them , " he said .
" they are a good side , and it is practically a rematch from the game at the world cup in 2006 .
but we do not have to be scared of them .
i know several portugal players , not just those that i play with .
" all their players are very good individually and they play well as a team as well , " he said .
" they 're very good in attack and not too focused on defense .
they have great players , not least -lrb- cristiano -rrb- ronaldo , who had a great season in england and it will be a very difficult task .
" nobody has to tell us that they are good players .
i am also looking forward to playing against their coach , who will be coaching me at chelsea next season . "
for ballack and his team-mates , the game against austria could well have been a turning point .
the win over austria was certainly a step in the right direction toward the german goal of winning a fourth european title .
but portugal will be a very different proposition to austria .
" both teams want to go far in this competition and portugal are probably favorites , ” ballack said .
“ we 've maybe slipped to a different role and who knows , maybe that will favor us . "
reactions are muted both home and abroad germany reacted more relieved than delighted to the national team 's euro 2008 quarter-final berth as the 1-0 win against austria gave no reason for optimism . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the fans celebrated but more with a sense of relief tens of thousands of germans partied in the nation 's fan zones during the game but post-match celebrations were very subdued - given the poor quality of play in vienna which only saw one glorious moment from the winning free-kick by ballack . " ballack fulfils the minimal goal , " said kicker sports magazine on its web site , naming the germans ' performance " anything but convincing . " the bild daily spoke of " many individual mistakes " as germany stumbled into a quarter-final date with portugal on thursday . german football icon franz beckenbauer struck a similar line in his column in bild . " do we have a chance against cristiano ronaldo and his portuguese with such a performance ?
no , definitely not , " he said .
" our 11 must improve considerably to reach the semi-finals .
the german midfield appeared to be lacking ideas , there was hardly any passing . " german press see no reason the cheer the sueddeutsche zeitung -lrb- sz -rrb- also issued a devastating assessment , fearing a return to the poor " rumble " soccer germany played in the first years of the decade . " on thursday , portugal waits for the uninspired team of coach joachim loew , which appears to be drawing close the rumble soccer era again which seemed to have been overcome , " the sz said . the german media had mixed feelings about portugal .
some pointed out that germany wrapped up its great 2006 world cup campaign with a 3-1 win over portugal in the match for third place .
but also not forgotten was a 3-0 humiliation at euro 2000 . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : loew lost his cool with the official and hickersburger there was also concern whether loew will be able to coach his team from the sideline on thursday in basle , switzerland , as he was sent off -lrb- along with austrian helmsman josef hickersberger -rrb- after a dispute with the fourth match official . the ruling body uefa was expected to deal with the case and issue a ruling later tuesday , with kicker naming a ban " possible . " germany 's performance did also not raise eyebrows abroad . foreign papers mostly unimpressed austria lamented its first-round exit as host , but the kronenzeitung pointed out that only " the individual class of ballack made the difference . " the chelsea midfielder was also singled out elsewhere , with italy 's la gazzetta dello sport speaking of " not much game , a lot of ballack " and britain 's the sun saying : " ball of fame , chelsea ace comes up trumps . " but the guardian did not rule out a german improvement , saying that ballack could become the vital figure for germany in the aim to reach its goal of going very far in the tournament . " germany have one of euro 2008 's more influential players - and that , in itself , should give them hope for the remainder of a competition in which , thus far , they have flickered without truly igniting , " the paper wrote . dw staff / dpa -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the eu executive has commissioned a survey to try and find out what went wrong in ireland , and most ministers concurred on monday that dublin would know best .
" there will not be any attempt from the outside , from member states or from brussels , to influence or push the irish government in some way , " latvia 's riekstins said .

in germany , they had a realistic chance of such a celebration but were left a little disappointed by germany 's performance on monday night . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some germany fans did n't seem too upset by their side 's insipid performance " there is not much to celebrate , because the real test of character starts in the next round when we will face portugal .
i guess we lost the plot when we lost to croatia , it might just be the end of the road because it is going to be a really tough game against portugal , we might just need something special or we kiss good buy to this tournament , " said a germany soccer fan from asia in a neighborhood in the northern part of the western german city of bonn . another germany supporter , originally from ghana , had a different view . " the match was not bad at all , these guys played very well considering what was at stake , i guess they have a chance to go far , " said kwaku tchite , a ghanaian national living in bonn . luck and drama others pointed out the game certainly contained enough drama to make up for the poor quality of the soccer . " i have never seen so much football drama in my life , " said menzi dlamini , a journalist from swaziland currently living in berlin .
dlamini was referring to the referee 's decision to give send off both the germany and austrian soccer coaches to the stands for arguing with the assistant referee . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : austria coach hickersberger , left , and germany 's loew created a stir at the game for sharma sharirriff , who comes from yemen but currently in bonn where is studying medicinal sciences , it all had to do with how the germany team reacted to pressure and tried to absorb it . " i think the team just failed to handle the pressure that comes with such a big game with huge expectations from fans , " sharirriff said .
" this was evident when the germany coach failed to handle the pressure from the austrian coach who was clearly playing mind games . " kumbirai mafunda , a zimbabwean student in berlin , said the german side were lucky to have made it to the quarterfinals . " the germany team could have wrapped up the game in the first half but missed several chances and that proved to be their undoing , " mafunda said .

a surging euro and spiralling inflation have begun to affect europe 's biggest economy . economists had forecast a drop in the zew index in june to minus 42.5 points .
tuesday 's report , drawn up by the mannheim-based centre for european economic research , showed a further slide than anticipated , to minus 52.4 points from minus 41.4 points in may . based on the responses of 264 analysts and institutional investors , the zew indicator is considered a preview for the release later this month of germany 's closely watched ifo business confidence index . declining orders , inflation fears driving drop bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : rising food prices contributed to concerns the zew institute cited two major causes for the slip . " on the one hand , repeatedly decreasing incoming orders indicate that germany 's momentum will lose steam in the next six months , " said zew president wolfgang franz during a presentation of the survey . " on the other hand , continuing price increases for energy and food are reducing the purchasing power of consumers , " he added .
" the expectations of the financial market analysts are strongly influenced by the current forecast of a weaker economic momentum in 2009 . " concerns have likewise been mounting about the impact of soaring inflation on both consumers and businesses .
the european union 's statistics office on monday revised the may inflation rate in the 15-member euro zone to a 16-year high of 3.7 percent . fears of an interest rate hike caused concern earlier this month after european central bank chief jean-claude trichet had placed investors on notice .
renewed inflationary pressures , he said , meant that the bank 's 21-head governing council was sizing up a rate hike of up to 25-basis points when it meets in early july . fears of a backsliding economy bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the european central bank warned of an interest rate hike all of this comes against the backdrop of expectations that despite a strong start to the year , the german economy may backslide as 2008 unfolds . " the upswing will lose significant drive in the coming 12 months , " said germany 's chamber of industry and commerce -lrb- dihk -rrb- when it released its latest survey of members on monday . still , despite the more downbeat mood emerging from its survey , the dihk joined other groups in raising its german growth forecast for 2008 to 2.3 percent from a previous estimate of 2.0 percent . dw staff -lrb- cat -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

but the scientists said they would like to study the issue longer to make absolutely sure that young children exposed to such electro-magnetic fields did not develop health problems in old age . the bureau , which employs top radiation scientists , advised parents not to let children keep phones permanently in their clothing until such a risk had been ruled out .
large numbers of germans fear mobile phones may be lethal after alarming reports about them in the media .
more than 50 german research projects since 2002 were analyzed for the report .

whatever the domestic ramifications for next year 's la liga contest , one thing is clear on the evidence of euro 2008 to date : the dutch , with their 21st-century variant of total football are unquestionably the latinos of northern europe , with van basten a proponent of flair-fuelled , attacking football from the flanks - a concept foreign to so many teams today .
possible semi-final clash pits friends and colleagues bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : torres and villa have combined with lethal effect a quarter-final encounter with the swedes - or possibly the russians - would thus prove a fascinating clash of styles before a potential semi pitting holland 's real madrid forward line against real madrid pillars of the spanish defense in the shape of iker casillas and sergio ramos .
meanwhile , the dutch will have their defense tested - perhaps for the first time to such an extent in euro 2008 - by the hot form of valencia-liverpool tandem david villa and fernando torres .
it would make for a fascinating contest at any level bit let 's hope there is much to play for when these two countries meet . dw staff / afp -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

in germany , they had a realistic chance of such a celebration but were left a little disappointed by germany 's performance on monday night . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some germany fans did n't seem too upset by their side 's insipid performance " there is not much to celebrate , because the real test of character starts in the next round when we will face portugal .
i guess we lost the plot when we lost to croatia , it might just be the end of the road because it is going to be a really tough game against portugal , we might just need something special or we kiss good buy to this tournament , " said a germany soccer fan from asia in a neighborhood in the northern part of the western german city of bonn . another germany supporter , originally from ghana , had a different view . " the match was not bad at all , these guys played very well considering what was at stake , i guess they have a chance to go far , " said kwaku tchite , a ghanaian national living in bonn . luck and drama others pointed out the game certainly contained enough drama to make up for the poor quality of the soccer . " i have never seen so much football drama in my life , " said menzi dlamini , a journalist from swaziland currently living in berlin .
dlamini was referring to the referee 's decision to give send off both the germany and austrian soccer coaches to the stands for arguing with the assistant referee . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : austria coach hickersberger , left , and germany 's loew created a stir at the game for sharma sharirriff , who comes from yemen but currently in bonn where is studying medicinal sciences , it all had to do with how the germany team reacted to pressure and tried to absorb it . " i think the team just failed to handle the pressure that comes with such a big game with huge expectations from fans , " sharirriff said .
" this was evident when the germany coach failed to handle the pressure from the austrian coach who was clearly playing mind games . " kumbirai mafunda , a zimbabwean student in berlin , said the german side were lucky to have made it to the quarterfinals . " the germany team could have wrapped up the game in the first half but missed several chances and that proved to be their undoing , " mafunda said . " in matches like these you do n't miss so many chances and expect to win , they should just count themselves lucky .

a surging euro and spiralling inflation have begun to affect europe 's biggest economy . economists had forecast a drop in the zew index in june to minus 42.5 points .
tuesday 's report , drawn up by the mannheim-based centre for european economic research , showed a further slide than anticipated , to minus 52.4 points from minus 41.4 points in may . based on the responses of 264 analysts and institutional investors , the zew indicator is considered a preview for the release later this month of germany 's closely watched ifo business confidence index . declining orders , inflation fears driving drop bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : rising food prices contributed to concerns the zew institute cited two major causes for the slip . " on the one hand , repeatedly decreasing incoming orders indicate that germany 's momentum will lose steam in the next six months , " said zew president wolfgang franz during a presentation of the survey . " on the other hand , continuing price increases for energy and food are reducing the purchasing power of consumers , " he added .
" the expectations of the financial market analysts are strongly influenced by the current forecast of a weaker economic momentum in 2009 . " concerns have likewise been mounting about the impact of soaring inflation on both consumers and businesses .
the european union 's statistics office on monday revised the may inflation rate in the 15-member euro zone to a 16-year high of 3.7 percent . fears of an interest rate hike caused concern earlier this month after european central bank chief jean-claude trichet had placed investors on notice .
renewed inflationary pressures , he said , meant that the bank 's 21-head governing council was sizing up a rate hike of up to 25-basis points when it meets in early july . fears of a backsliding economy bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the european central bank warned of an interest rate hike all of this comes against the backdrop of expectations that despite a strong start to the year , the german economy may backslide as 2008 unfolds . " the upswing will lose significant drive in the coming 12 months , " said germany 's chamber of industry and commerce -lrb- dihk -rrb- when it released its latest survey of members on monday . still , despite the more downbeat mood emerging from its survey , the dihk joined other groups in raising its german growth forecast for 2008 to 2.3 percent from a previous estimate of 2.0 percent . dw staff -lrb- cat -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" we are n't going to overcome the crisis when we lecture the irish or when we put them in the corner , " juncker said after a meeting of the eu 's 27 foreign ministers on monday , june 16 .
it would be " arrogant " to tell the irish that their votes do n't count because they are from a small country , juncker said in an article in the financial times deutschland newspaper .
small countries do n't like it when big countries lecture them , juncker said in the article , which was published tuesday .
yet it would also be a mistake for europe to leave ireland behind , juncker said .
he particularly criticized german and french leaders who hinted that the ratification could go forward despite the irish " no " vote .
eu grapples with ireland question bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : are the needs of small countries being ignored ?
less than a week ago , a majority of irish rejected the eu treaty , which is designed to make the bloc more efficient and give it a stronger voice in the world .
while there was n't any one issue which sunk the treaty , voters seemed concerned that it would overrule national laws on sensitive issues such as abortion , taxation and military neutrality .
at their first meeting after the vote on monday , foreign ministers discussed whether ireland could be offered concessions which could convince irish voters to pass a new referendum on the lisbon treaty later this year .
some suggested drafting a declaration which would include assurances that ireland could opt out of a number of key areas .
ireland is the only eu country whose constitution requires new eu treaties to be approved via a referendum .
while 18 national parliaments have already said yes to lisbon , the treaty can not come into force until it is ratified by all 27 member states .
germany wants decision this year bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : juncker said big eu countries are being arrogant while most eu ministers wanted to wait before deciding how to proceed , german foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier said that a solution would need to be found " this year . "
steinmeier also suggested that " the danish model from 1992 could be a model in this crisis . "
in 1992 , denmark voted against the maastricht treaty that created the european union out of the european community .
however , a repeat referendum a year later approved the treaty after the danish government won legally-binding opt-outs in such areas as defense , justice and citizenship .
keeping europe together bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : eu foreign ministers want ireland to figure out a plan so far , no one has openly called for the expansion of a two-speed europe , where some countries would move forward with integration while leaving the others out .
this already exists in some areas , such as the common currency -lrb- not all countries use the euro -rrb- and the schengen agreement -lrb- not all countries allow free movement . -rrb-
" it is hard to imagine that a two-speed europe could be created in questions such as decision-making procedures and the institutions , " said latvia 's maris riekstins .
but members were adamant on monday that the lisbon treaty was still viable .
british foreign minister david miliband said that monday 's meeting had left three things clear : the irish vote needs to be respected , the irish government needs some time to decide the next move and europe needs to " stick together . "
eu to ponder what went wrong bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : will the irish vote again ?
and while austria 's ursula plassnik said it would be unfair to corner ireland and force the country to undergo a revote , denmark 's per stig moeller said that since the irish government had signed the treaty , it was now up to ireland to find a solution .
the eu executive has commissioned a survey to try and find out what went wrong in ireland , and most ministers concurred on monday that dublin would know best .
" there will not be any attempt from the outside , from member states or from brussels , to influence or push the irish government in some way , " latvia 's riekstins said .
yet ireland might not be the only stumbling block to the treaty coming intoforce .
the czech republic 's government has referred the treaty text to its constitutional court .

the german captain 's goal gave his side the 1-0 victory they needed to advance with croatia from group b into the quarter-finals .
before the game , an austrian newspaper had handed out a newsprint for the game showing a nude ballack with the headline " strip him naked . "
the 31-year-old was visibly relieved after the game .
" we put ourselves into a very difficult situation ahead of the match , " he said .
" the defeat against croatia meant that we could not lose against austria , and that put us under a lot of pressure . "
germany captain silences his doubters bildunterschrift : ballack 's thunderbolt silenced his critics and eliminated austria asked what he had meant to say with his sign after scoring , ballack said that much had been written ahead of the game .
" if you read everything that the austrian press and public said , you would have believed that they had won the world cup three times and that we could hardly kick a ball , " he said .
" that is why i think that my goal silenced them . "
ballack could quite easily have used the gesture , too , to silence his own critics , who have been multiplying since a far-from impressive display by the german captain in germany 's 2-1 loss to croatia in their previous game .
" we wanted to win this game against austria , as we came here with a goal , " he said .
" we did not want to be eliminated after the first round , and for that we worked very hard .
i think you ca n't fault our work-rate in the game against austria .
" obviously we 're happy to have made it to the quarter-finals , particularly after the difficult match we had against croatia , " he added .
" we had everything to lose and we were certainly favorites to win -lrb- against austria -rrb- .
you could tell that we were not as agile as we should have been because we tensed up , yet our desire to win proved decisive . "
respect , but no fear bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : with players like deco and ronaldo , portugal are a force looking ahead to their quarter-final clash , ballack said he had a lot of respect for portugal , who looked very impressive in their first two matches at the finals .
" but we do not fear them , " he said .
" they are a good side , and it is practically a rematch from the game at the world cup in 2006 .
but we do not have to be scared of them .
i know several portugal players , not just those that i play with .
" all their players are very good individually and they play well as a team as well , " he said .
" they 're very good in attack and not too focused on defense .
they have great players , not least -lrb- cristiano -rrb- ronaldo , who had a great season in england and it will be a very difficult task .
" nobody has to tell us that they are good players .
i am also looking forward to playing against their coach , who will be coaching me at chelsea next season . "
for ballack and his team-mates , the game against austria could well have been a turning point .
the win over austria was certainly a step in the right direction toward the german goal of winning a fourth european title .
but portugal will be a very different proposition to austria .
" both teams want to go far in this competition and portugal are probably favorites , ” ballack said .
“ we 've maybe slipped to a different role and who knows , maybe that will favor us . "
reactions are muted both home and abroad germany reacted more relieved than delighted to the national team 's euro 2008 quarter-final berth as the 1-0 win against austria gave no reason for optimism . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the fans celebrated but more with a sense of relief tens of thousands of germans partied in the nation 's fan zones during the game but post-match celebrations were very subdued - given the poor quality of play in vienna which only saw one glorious moment from the winning free-kick by ballack . " ballack fulfils the minimal goal , " said kicker sports magazine on its web site , naming the germans ' performance " anything but convincing . " the bild daily spoke of " many individual mistakes " as germany stumbled into a quarter-final date with portugal on thursday . german football icon franz beckenbauer struck a similar line in his column in bild . " do we have a chance against cristiano ronaldo and his portuguese with such a performance ?
no , definitely not , " he said .
" our 11 must improve considerably to reach the semi-finals .
the german midfield appeared to be lacking ideas , there was hardly any passing . " german press see no reason the cheer the sueddeutsche zeitung -lrb- sz -rrb- also issued a devastating assessment , fearing a return to the poor " rumble " soccer germany played in the first years of the decade . " on thursday , portugal waits for the uninspired team of coach joachim loew , which appears to be drawing close the rumble soccer era again which seemed to have been overcome , " the sz said . the german media had mixed feelings about portugal .
some pointed out that germany wrapped up its great 2006 world cup campaign with a 3-1 win over portugal in the match for third place .
but also not forgotten was a 3-0 humiliation at euro 2000 . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : loew lost his cool with the official and hickersburger there was also concern whether loew will be able to coach his team from the sideline on thursday in basle , switzerland , as he was sent off -lrb- along with austrian helmsman josef hickersberger -rrb- after a dispute with the fourth match official . the ruling body uefa was expected to deal with the case and issue a ruling later tuesday , with kicker naming a ban " possible . " germany 's performance did also not raise eyebrows abroad . foreign papers mostly unimpressed austria lamented its first-round exit as host , but the kronenzeitung pointed out that only " the individual class of ballack made the difference . " the chelsea midfielder was also singled out elsewhere , with italy 's la gazzetta dello sport speaking of " not much game , a lot of ballack " and britain 's the sun saying : " ball of fame , chelsea ace comes up trumps . " but the guardian did not rule out a german improvement , saying that ballack could become the vital figure for germany in the aim to reach its goal of going very far in the tournament . " germany have one of euro 2008 's more influential players - and that , in itself , should give them hope for the remainder of a competition in which , thus far , they have flickered without truly igniting , " the paper wrote . dw staff / dpa -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" we are n't going to overcome the crisis when we lecture the irish or when we put them in the corner , " juncker said after a meeting of the eu 's 27 foreign ministers on monday , june 16 .
it would be " arrogant " to tell the irish that their votes do n't count because they are from a small country , juncker said in an article in the financial times deutschland newspaper .
small countries do n't like it when big countries lecture them , juncker said in the article , which was published tuesday .
yet it would also be a mistake for europe to leave ireland behind , juncker said .
he particularly criticized german and french leaders who hinted that the ratification could go forward despite the irish " no " vote .
eu grapples with ireland question bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : are the needs of small countries being ignored ?
less than a week ago , a majority of irish rejected the eu treaty , which is designed to make the bloc more efficient and give it a stronger voice in the world .
while there was n't any one issue which sunk the treaty , voters seemed concerned that it would overrule national laws on sensitive issues such as abortion , taxation and military neutrality .
at their first meeting after the vote on monday , foreign ministers discussed whether ireland could be offered concessions which could convince irish voters to pass a new referendum on the lisbon treaty later this year .
some suggested drafting a declaration which would include assurances that ireland could opt out of a number of key areas .
ireland is the only eu country whose constitution requires new eu treaties to be approved via a referendum .
while 18 national parliaments have already said yes to lisbon , the treaty can not come into force until it is ratified by all 27 member states .
germany wants decision this year bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : juncker said big eu countries are being arrogant while most eu ministers wanted to wait before deciding how to proceed , german foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier said that a solution would need to be found " this year . "
steinmeier also suggested that " the danish model from 1992 could be a model in this crisis . "
in 1992 , denmark voted against the maastricht treaty that created the european union out of the european community .
however , a repeat referendum a year later approved the treaty after the danish government won legally-binding opt-outs in such areas as defense , justice and citizenship .
keeping europe together bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : eu foreign ministers want ireland to figure out a plan so far , no one has openly called for the expansion of a two-speed europe , where some countries would move forward with integration while leaving the others out .
this already exists in some areas , such as the common currency -lrb- not all countries use the euro -rrb- and the schengen agreement -lrb- not all countries allow free movement . -rrb-
" it is hard to imagine that a two-speed europe could be created in questions such as decision-making procedures and the institutions , " said latvia 's maris riekstins .
but members were adamant on monday that the lisbon treaty was still viable .
british foreign minister david miliband said that monday 's meeting had left three things clear : the irish vote needs to be respected , the irish government needs some time to decide the next move and europe needs to " stick together . "
eu to ponder what went wrong bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : will the irish vote again ?
and while austria 's ursula plassnik said it would be unfair to corner ireland and force the country to undergo a revote , denmark 's per stig moeller said that since the irish government had signed the treaty , it was now up to ireland to find a solution .
the eu executive has commissioned a survey to try and find out what went wrong in ireland , and most ministers concurred on monday that dublin would know best .
" there will not be any attempt from the outside , from member states or from brussels , to influence or push the irish government in some way , " latvia 's riekstins said .
yet ireland might not be the only stumbling block to the treaty coming intoforce .
the czech republic 's government has referred the treaty text to its constitutional court .

the german captain 's goal gave his side the 1-0 victory they needed to advance with croatia from group b into the quarter-finals .
before the game , an austrian newspaper had handed out a newsprint for the game showing a nude ballack with the headline " strip him naked . "
the 31-year-old was visibly relieved after the game .
" we put ourselves into a very difficult situation ahead of the match , " he said .
" the defeat against croatia meant that we could not lose against austria , and that put us under a lot of pressure . "
germany captain silences his doubters bildunterschrift : ballack 's thunderbolt silenced his critics and eliminated austria asked what he had meant to say with his sign after scoring , ballack said that much had been written ahead of the game .
" if you read everything that the austrian press and public said , you would have believed that they had won the world cup three times and that we could hardly kick a ball , " he said .
" that is why i think that my goal silenced them . "
ballack could quite easily have used the gesture , too , to silence his own critics , who have been multiplying since a far-from impressive display by the german captain in germany 's 2-1 loss to croatia in their previous game .
" we wanted to win this game against austria , as we came here with a goal , " he said .
" we did not want to be eliminated after the first round , and for that we worked very hard .
i think you ca n't fault our work-rate in the game against austria .
" obviously we 're happy to have made it to the quarter-finals , particularly after the difficult match we had against croatia , " he added .
" we had everything to lose and we were certainly favorites to win -lrb- against austria -rrb- .
you could tell that we were not as agile as we should have been because we tensed up , yet our desire to win proved decisive . "
respect , but no fear bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : with players like deco and ronaldo , portugal are a force looking ahead to their quarter-final clash , ballack said he had a lot of respect for portugal , who looked very impressive in their first two matches at the finals .
" but we do not fear them , " he said .
" they are a good side , and it is practically a rematch from the game at the world cup in 2006 .
but we do not have to be scared of them .
i know several portugal players , not just those that i play with .
" all their players are very good individually and they play well as a team as well , " he said .
" they 're very good in attack and not too focused on defense .
they have great players , not least -lrb- cristiano -rrb- ronaldo , who had a great season in england and it will be a very difficult task .
" nobody has to tell us that they are good players .
i am also looking forward to playing against their coach , who will be coaching me at chelsea next season . "
for ballack and his team-mates , the game against austria could well have been a turning point .
the win over austria was certainly a step in the right direction toward the german goal of winning a fourth european title .
but portugal will be a very different proposition to austria .
" both teams want to go far in this competition and portugal are probably favorites , ” ballack said .
“ we 've maybe slipped to a different role and who knows , maybe that will favor us . "
reactions are muted both home and abroad germany reacted more relieved than delighted to the national team 's euro 2008 quarter-final berth as the 1-0 win against austria gave no reason for optimism . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the fans celebrated but more with a sense of relief tens of thousands of germans partied in the nation 's fan zones during the game but post-match celebrations were very subdued - given the poor quality of play in vienna which only saw one glorious moment from the winning free-kick by ballack . " ballack fulfils the minimal goal , " said kicker sports magazine on its web site , naming the germans ' performance " anything but convincing . " the bild daily spoke of " many individual mistakes " as germany stumbled into a quarter-final date with portugal on thursday . german football icon franz beckenbauer struck a similar line in his column in bild . " do we have a chance against cristiano ronaldo and his portuguese with such a performance ?
no , definitely not , " he said .
" our 11 must improve considerably to reach the semi-finals .
the german midfield appeared to be lacking ideas , there was hardly any passing . " german press see no reason the cheer the sueddeutsche zeitung -lrb- sz -rrb- also issued a devastating assessment , fearing a return to the poor " rumble " soccer germany played in the first years of the decade . " on thursday , portugal waits for the uninspired team of coach joachim loew , which appears to be drawing close the rumble soccer era again which seemed to have been overcome , " the sz said . the german media had mixed feelings about portugal .
some pointed out that germany wrapped up its great 2006 world cup campaign with a 3-1 win over portugal in the match for third place .
but also not forgotten was a 3-0 humiliation at euro 2000 . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : loew lost his cool with the official and hickersburger there was also concern whether loew will be able to coach his team from the sideline on thursday in basle , switzerland , as he was sent off -lrb- along with austrian helmsman josef hickersberger -rrb- after a dispute with the fourth match official . the ruling body uefa was expected to deal with the case and issue a ruling later tuesday , with kicker naming a ban " possible . " germany 's performance did also not raise eyebrows abroad . foreign papers mostly unimpressed austria lamented its first-round exit as host , but the kronenzeitung pointed out that only " the individual class of ballack made the difference . " the chelsea midfielder was also singled out elsewhere , with italy 's la gazzetta dello sport speaking of " not much game , a lot of ballack " and britain 's the sun saying : " ball of fame , chelsea ace comes up trumps . " but the guardian did not rule out a german improvement , saying that ballack could become the vital figure for germany in the aim to reach its goal of going very far in the tournament . " germany have one of euro 2008 's more influential players - and that , in itself , should give them hope for the remainder of a competition in which , thus far , they have flickered without truly igniting , " the paper wrote . dw staff / dpa -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

but the scientists said they would like to study the issue longer to make absolutely sure that young children exposed to such electro-magnetic fields did not develop health problems in old age . the bureau , which employs top radiation scientists , advised parents not to let children keep phones permanently in their clothing until such a risk had been ruled out .
large numbers of germans fear mobile phones may be lethal after alarming reports about them in the media .
more than 50 german research projects since 2002 were analyzed for the report .
in some cases , genetic activity in human cells was observed to change under the influence of radiation , but this did not alter the overall conclusion that the phones were safe .
german environment minister sigmar gabriel was due to unveil the study on tuesday . dpa news agency -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

former us senator sam nunn spoke with deutsche welle about the foreign policy of both presidential candidates .
he also called on the us to decrease its nuclear arsenal and increase its support for the united nations . sam nunn , a former democratic senator , is often tipped for a leadership post should barack obama be elected president of the united states .
nunn , 59 , honed his foreign and military policy expertise as the chair of the senate armed services committee .
since leaving office in 1997 , he has devoted himself to working to reduce the threat from nuclear weapons and currently serves as the ceo of the nuclear threat initiative -lrb- nti -rrb- .
nunn was recently in berlin , where he spoke with deutsche welle .
you have said that germany can play an important role in bringing the united states , nato and russia closer to each other .
what specific measures could this involve ?
first , i think we have to decide and russia has to decide whether we want russia to be part of the europe-atlantic security arc .
if so , then we and russia need to start sitting down and talking about those issues : finding out what their problems are with security , trying to address those problems , giving each other reassurance , having military to military meetings .
now the nato-russian council was set up for that purpose .
it worked for awhile , but it clearly is n't working anymore .
winston churchill once said : " no matter how beautiful your strategy at some point you need to look at the results . "
the results are the trajectory of nato-russia relationships – whether it 's in energy security or overall security or missile defense – is not heading in a very constructive direction .
what role can germany play in improving these ties and negotiations ?
that 's something that germany will have to decide that for itself .
i can only say that these are difficult questions and i believe the german people and the german government – with their close relationship with the united states , their leadership in nato and the european community , their friendship with both eastern europe and russia – that they are in a unique position to begin stimulating both sides to ask these questions and begin to answer them .
i do n't have all the answers but i think i do know what some of the questions are .
how would the foreign policy of an obama 's presidency differ from that of the current us administration ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : nunn would like to see the us reduce its nuclear weapons arsenal i believe both obama and mccain would both move in different directions than this administration .
i 'm very confident on the obama side that he would listen to people in europe , i 'm certain that mccain would do likewise .
i believe both of them would try a more multilateral approach .
i believe obama would reach out and look for new directions of partnership between the united states and europe and i hope also with russia and with other people around the globe .
you have brought up the argument regarding nuclear weapons that it 's hard to convince others to quit smoking when you 're a chain smoker yourself .
does the us need to reduce its nuclear arsenal ?
i think we 've got far too many nuclear weapons .
i think the russians have far too many nuclear weapons .
i think all the nuclear powers need to look at how many they need .
but i also think it 's important to look at the operational status of those weapons .
this means the way you posture your nuclear weapons , whether they 're on quick alert , how rapidly they can be fired , the warning time , the decision time on both sides .
all of that is enormously important and just as important as the numbers .
so what i would like to see is military-to-military , civilian-to-civilian top-level discussions on how we can give each other more warning time .
the president of russia or the president of the united states would have more than a few minutes to decide whether to fire the weapons if they get a warning , which could be a false warning .
i do n't think anybody expects a first strike .
we 've moved away from confrontation .
there 's no more warsaw pact , no more soviet union , no more massive tank armies .
but we have not taken that into account in a significant way in the operational status of our forces .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : iran is watching closely how other countries deal with the nuclear issue if we really are serious about trying to keep countries like iran , north korea and others from acquiring nuclear weapons , then we ought to de-emphasize their importance .
we ought to make it clear to the world that we are not relying on those nuclear weapons for first strike unless we are struck ourselves with nuclear weapons .
as long as we , russia and other nuclear powers give nuclear weapons great prestige and we act as if they are essential for our own defense , it 's enormously difficult to try and convince other countries not to acquire these weapons .
and that 's where we are right now .
does this need for better cooperation between countries mean that the united states should become more involved in the united nations ?
on the nuclear side , certainly we ought to be more involved and we ought to get more behind iaea , the international atomic energy agency , that 's the official arm of the un in dealing with these questions .
this enormously important organization won the noble peace prize two years ago .
they are going to be increasingly important .
they need more funds , they need more help , they need more support .
it 's not just the united states , it 's our friends , germany and others , that need to understand that the iaea is being given a job without sufficient resources today .
so yes , we need to be more supportive in that regard . interview : jan m. schaefer -lrb- th -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

it was mr newsom 's 2004 decision to issue marriage licences to gay couples - including ms lyon and ms martin - which began the long drawn-out political and legal battle that led eventually to the california supreme court 's ruling last month .
when we first got together we were n't really thinking about getting married phyllis lyon campaigning couple celebrate " we are very happy and we 're very grateful , " ms lyon said to a small crowd that cheered and threw rose petals at them after the ceremony .

a vote in 2000 approved a law specifying that marriage in california could only be between a man and a woman .
the 2004 marriage ceremonies were a direct challenge to this law , and were ruled illegal by judges .
but civil rights campaigners appealed against the ruling , and their arguments were accepted by the san francisco superior court .
and although the lower court 's ruling was overturned by the california court of appeal in 2006 , this ruling was itself reversed last month by the state 's supreme court .
meanwhile , state legislators approved a law allowing same-sex marriages , but it was vetoed by california governor arnold schwarzenegger , who said that the courts should decide the issue .
' tight election ' opponents of same-sex unions have now gathered enough signatures to put another law outlawing gay marriage before california voters in november .
voters will be asked in a referendum whether the ban should be restored but large numbers of gay couples - from across the us - are expected to get married in california before that time , partly in the hope that voters will be less inclined to vote for the law if it would mean splitting up married couples .
" it 's going to be a very tight election come november , " said jeff kors , executive director of the gay rights group equality california .
" the more people see their friends and family get married , the more they will be comfortable with the idea . "

ceremonies were held in at least five counties after a supreme court ruling overturning a ban on same-sex marriages took effect at 1701 -lrb- 0001 gmt -rrb- .
one of the first couples to exchange vows was veteran gay-rights campaigner del martin , 87 , and phyllis lyon , 83 .

california is the second state after massachusetts to legalise same-sex marriages .
' extraordinary and humbling gift ' san francisco mayor gavin newsom , who has been a prominent advocate of same-sex marriage , officiated at the wedding in city hall of ms martin and ms lyon , who earlier received their licence .
it was mr newsom 's 2004 decision to issue marriage licences to gay couples - including ms lyon and ms martin - which began the long drawn-out political and legal battle that led eventually to the california supreme court 's ruling last month .
when we first got together we were n't really thinking about getting married phyllis lyon campaigning couple celebrate " we are very happy and we 're very grateful , " ms lyon said to a small crowd that cheered and threw rose petals at them after the ceremony .

a vote in 2000 approved a law specifying that marriage in california could only be between a man and a woman .
the 2004 marriage ceremonies were a direct challenge to this law , and were ruled illegal by judges .
but civil rights campaigners appealed against the ruling , and their arguments were accepted by the san francisco superior court .
and although the lower court 's ruling was overturned by the california court of appeal in 2006 , this ruling was itself reversed last month by the state 's supreme court .
meanwhile , state legislators approved a law allowing same-sex marriages , but it was vetoed by california governor arnold schwarzenegger , who said that the courts should decide the issue .
' tight election ' opponents of same-sex unions have now gathered enough signatures to put another law outlawing gay marriage before california voters in november .
voters will be asked in a referendum whether the ban should be restored but large numbers of gay couples - from across the us - are expected to get married in california before that time , partly in the hope that voters will be less inclined to vote for the law if it would mean splitting up married couples .
" it 's going to be a very tight election come november , " said jeff kors , executive director of the gay rights group equality california .
" the more people see their friends and family get married , the more they will be comfortable with the idea . "
public opinion in california appears to be more favourable to gay marriage than was the case when the law banning it was passed in 2000 .

but for john mills , the start of the uk music festival season is all about a £ 4m gamble .
that is how much the gaymer cider company 's managing director has committed to spending over the next three years as his firm tries to make a real success of one of its products .
it is a huge commitment for the shepton mallet-based brewer .
but gaymer is just one of the alcohol companies pegging its hopes on the festival circuit being a way of growing tiny brands into significant market players .
' perfect fit ' the firm launched its " unisex " gaymers original as it tried to piggy-back on the success of rival magners , which saw sales surge after promoting it as a drink to serve from pint-sized bottles and poured over ice . "
it 's a massive opportunity for people to try our products " john mills gaymers cider company and when it came to marketing it , music quickly emerged as " the perfect fit " , mr mills says .
the company 's target market is drinkers aged between 18 and 30 - both men and women .
" the two things they are passionate about are sport and especially music , mainly british , cutting edge music , " mr mills explains .
the upshot is that at several of the summer 's biggest events - from reading and leeds festivals to lovebox and the o2 wireless festival , the only cider that punters will be able to buy on-site will be gaymer 's .
it is also the official cider at glastonbury - held just 10 miles from its factory - being served at most of the site 's 27 bars .
' failure risk ' the so-called " pouring rights " have been locked in until 2010 at several festivals , as well as at mean fiddler and barfly music venues - making a hefty dent in that £ 4m budget .
getting its drinks into the hands of festival-goers is " not cheap " , laughs mr mills .
" but the whole point is to make the brand accessible to our target audience and getting them to try it in an atmosphere that they are comfortable with .
" it 's a massive opportunity for people to try our products , hopefully love it and then , when they go to the pub or the off-licence , with a bit of luck they are going to buy it . "
the efforts are being backed up with advertising and a website , which will include video footage from four small " grassroots " gigs .
these are where established bands play shows in their hometowns to about 200 people , a series culminating with the wombats in a liverpool pub this week .
the firm will not be drawn on how big a growth will be acceptable , but says sales are " rocketing " , though admittedly from a low level .
and it will be how the product performs in the competitive environment - when it is not the only cider available - that will be key .
" it 's long-term commitment and it is not enough to just sell at the festivals , " mr mills concedes .
" if we do n't then go on to really increase sales then it will have failed . "
music association also trying to ride the festival wave is tuborg - arguably best remembered for its tv commercials of the late 1980s rather than its impact on the uk lager market .
festival-goers in europe have been supping the stuff for years - where it has strong links with events including denmark 's roskilde and serbia 's exit festival .
and after a low-key launch last summer , now the brand 's owner , carlsberg , has done deals similar to gaymer to get it served at some of the biggest music events in the uk .
these again include leeds and reading festivals - which observers see as a big coup given they had become synonymous with carlsberg 's rival , carling , which had festival naming rights .
and it is also sponsoring the second stage at the o2 wireless festival - something which head of sponsorship gareth roberts says " really brings home the association with the music " .
carlsberg had long been keen to have a beer that it could tie in with music , mr roberts says . "
it 's a captive audience and that 's what you 're buying with the contract of exclusivity " gareth roberts head of sponsorship , carlsberg " carlsberg lager is very much intertwined with football , while tetley has strong links with rugby , but tuborg targets a different market , so it does not really have an impact on any of our other products . "
distribution overhaul last year the equivalent of about 6 million pints of tuborg was sold .
the aim is to double that in 2008 .
" despite being successful elsewhere , the brand never really got established in the uk , so the festivals give us the base to drive it forward and add sales , " says mr roberts .
" it 's a captive audience and that 's what you 're buying with the contract of exclusivity .
" but what we need to do is not just make it a festival beer but something that , when they leave the festival site , they go in search of .
" we want to make it part of more people 's repertoire of drinks , but for that to happen they need to find it in the pub or supermarket so we have a job to do .
the distribution needs to get better . "
' festival mood ' the festival route to marketing can do wonders for building a brand , says matthew langley , marketing director of brothers cider , which began with a small stall at the glastonbury festival in 1995 and last year sold hundreds of thousands of pints of its pear cider at the event , and others including bestival and the big chill .
" festivals are great for us because you can completely engage with your customers and have a proper conversation with them , " he says .
" so it 's brilliant for brand awareness , far better than putting up a billboard . "
and there is tangible evidence that its impact lasts beyond the festival fence .
" the product reach has exploded since this time last year , " mr langley says .
" and a lot of that is to do with leveraging off the festival which really helps create demand .
" we get inundated with e-mails from customers .
some are individuals ordering a case or two and others are bar owners and traders who want to know where to get our products .
" and as summer draws closer , we 're getting busier , with people ordering on our website saying they want to get into the festival mood . "
" we have not really been a consumer brand and need to develop this " matthew langley , brothers cider " as well as the sales it is also a great story to tell to the supermarkets and off-licences - to show that we have got a latent audience . "
in the past year , brothers ' products have been stocked in several pub chains and supermarkets and , as the firm 's website boasts , it has even popped up behind the bar in the queen vic on eastenders .
this year it is focusing on one-day events and festivals with more specific target audiences - from students at beach break live in cornwall this week to families at guilfest and more regional events such live at loch lomond .
" we can pick up consumers because of the way the festival market in the uk is so fragmented , " mr langley says .
" we have not really been a consumer brand and need to develop this .
we 've got to get beyond being a glastonbury brand . "

" we can pick up consumers because of the way the festival market in the uk is so fragmented , " mr langley says .
" we have not really been a consumer brand and need to develop this .
we 've got to get beyond being a glastonbury brand . "

but for john mills , the start of the uk music festival season is all about a £ 4m gamble .
that is how much the gaymer cider company 's managing director has committed to spending over the next three years as his firm tries to make a real success of one of its products .
it is a huge commitment for the shepton mallet-based brewer .
but gaymer is just one of the alcohol companies pegging its hopes on the festival circuit being a way of growing tiny brands into significant market players .
' perfect fit ' the firm launched its " unisex " gaymers original as it tried to piggy-back on the success of rival magners , which saw sales surge after promoting it as a drink to serve from pint-sized bottles and poured over ice .
it 's a massive opportunity for people to try our products john mills gaymers cider company and when it came to marketing it , music quickly emerged as " the perfect fit " , mr mills says .
the company 's target market is drinkers aged between 18 and 30 - both men and women .
" the two things they are passionate about are sport and especially music , mainly british , cutting edge music , " mr mills explains .
the upshot is that at several of the summer 's biggest events - from reading and leeds festivals to lovebox and the o2 wireless festival , the only cider that punters will be able to buy on-site will be gaymer 's .
it is also the official cider at glastonbury - held just 10 miles from its factory - being served at most of the site 's 27 bars .
tuborg does not want to be known as just a festival beer ' failure risk ' the so-called " pouring rights " have been locked in until 2010 at several festivals , as well as at mean fiddler and barfly music venues - making a hefty dent in that £ 4m budget .
getting its drinks into the hands of festival-goers is " not cheap " , laughs mr mills .
" but the whole point is to make the brand accessible to our target audience and getting them to try it in an atmosphere that they are comfortable with .
" it 's a massive opportunity for people to try our products , hopefully love it and then , when they go to the pub or the off-licence , with a bit of luck they are going to buy it . "
the efforts are being backed up with advertising and a website , which will include video footage from four small " grassroots " gigs .
these are where established bands play shows in their hometowns to about 200 people , a series culminating with the wombats in a liverpool pub this week .
the firm will not be drawn on how big a growth will be acceptable , but says sales are " rocketing " , though admittedly from a low level .
and it will be how the product performs in the competitive environment - when it is not the only cider available - that will be key .
" it 's long-term commitment and it is not enough to just sell at the festivals , " mr mills concedes .
" if we do n't then go on to really increase sales then it will have failed . "
music association also trying to ride the festival wave is tuborg - arguably best remembered for its tv commercials of the late 1980s rather than its impact on the uk lager market .
festival-goers in europe have been supping the stuff for years - where it has strong links with events including denmark 's roskilde and serbia 's exit festival .
gaymers says its grassroots gigs help build its music associations and after a low-key launch last summer , now the brand 's owner , carlsberg , has done deals similar to gaymer to get it served at some of the biggest music events in the uk .
these again include leeds and reading festivals - which observers see as a big coup given they had become synonymous with carlsberg 's rival , carling , which had festival naming rights .
and it is also sponsoring the second stage at the o2 wireless festival - something which head of sponsorship gareth roberts says " really brings home the association with the music " .
carlsberg had long been keen to have a beer that it could tie in with music , mr roberts says .
it 's a captive audience and that 's what you 're buying with the contract of exclusivity gareth roberts head of sponsorship , carlsberg " carlsberg lager is very much intertwined with football , while tetley has strong links with rugby , but tuborg targets a different market , so it does not really have an impact on any of our other products . "
distribution overhaul last year the equivalent of about 6 million pints of tuborg was sold .
the aim is to double that in 2008 .
" despite being successful elsewhere , the brand never really got established in the uk , so the festivals give us the base to drive it forward and add sales , " says mr roberts .
" it 's a captive audience and that 's what you 're buying with the contract of exclusivity .
" but what we need to do is not just make it a festival beer but something that , when they leave the festival site , they go in search of .
" we want to make it part of more people 's repertoire of drinks , but for that to happen they need to find it in the pub or supermarket so we have a job to do .
the distribution needs to get better . "
' festival mood ' the festival route to marketing can do wonders for building a brand , says matthew langley , marketing director of brothers cider , which began with a small stall at the glastonbury festival in 1995 and last year sold hundreds of thousands of pints of its pear cider at the event , and others including bestival and the big chill .
brothers is targeting a wider audience .
" festivals are great for us because you can completely engage with your customers and have a proper conversation with them , " he says .
" so it 's brilliant for brand awareness , far better than putting up a billboard . "
and there is tangible evidence that its impact lasts beyond the festival fence .
" the product reach has exploded since this time last year , " mr langley says .
" and a lot of that is to do with leveraging off the festival which really helps create demand .
" we get inundated with e-mails from customers .
some are individuals ordering a case or two and others are bar owners and traders who want to know where to get our products .
" and as summer draws closer , we 're getting busier , with people ordering on our website saying they want to get into the festival mood . "
we have not really been a consumer brand and need to develop this matthew langley , brothers cider " as well as the sales it is also a great story to tell to the supermarkets and off-licences - to show that we have got a latent audience . "

but for john mills , the start of the uk music festival season is all about a £ 4m gamble .
that is how much the gaymer cider company 's managing director has committed to spending over the next three years as his firm tries to make a real success of one of its products .
it is a huge commitment for the shepton mallet-based brewer .
but gaymer is just one of the alcohol companies pegging its hopes on the festival circuit being a way of growing tiny brands into significant market players .
' perfect fit ' the firm launched its " unisex " gaymers original as it tried to piggy-back on the success of rival magners , which saw sales surge after promoting it as a drink to serve from pint-sized bottles and poured over ice .
it 's a massive opportunity for people to try our products john mills gaymers cider company and when it came to marketing it , music quickly emerged as " the perfect fit " , mr mills says .
the company 's target market is drinkers aged between 18 and 30 - both men and women .
" the two things they are passionate about are sport and especially music , mainly british , cutting edge music , " mr mills explains .
the upshot is that at several of the summer 's biggest events - from reading and leeds festivals to lovebox and the o2 wireless festival , the only cider that punters will be able to buy on-site will be gaymer 's .
it is also the official cider at glastonbury - held just 10 miles from its factory - being served at most of the site 's 27 bars .
tuborg does not want to be known as just a festival beer ' failure risk ' the so-called " pouring rights " have been locked in until 2010 at several festivals , as well as at mean fiddler and barfly music venues - making a hefty dent in that £ 4m budget .
getting its drinks into the hands of festival-goers is " not cheap " , laughs mr mills .
" but the whole point is to make the brand accessible to our target audience and getting them to try it in an atmosphere that they are comfortable with .
" it 's a massive opportunity for people to try our products , hopefully love it and then , when they go to the pub or the off-licence , with a bit of luck they are going to buy it . "
the efforts are being backed up with advertising and a website , which will include video footage from four small " grassroots " gigs .
these are where established bands play shows in their hometowns to about 200 people , a series culminating with the wombats in a liverpool pub this week .
the firm will not be drawn on how big a growth will be acceptable , but says sales are " rocketing " , though admittedly from a low level .
and it will be how the product performs in the competitive environment - when it is not the only cider available - that will be key .
" it 's long-term commitment and it is not enough to just sell at the festivals , " mr mills concedes .
" if we do n't then go on to really increase sales then it will have failed . "
music association also trying to ride the festival wave is tuborg - arguably best remembered for its tv commercials of the late 1980s rather than its impact on the uk lager market .
festival-goers in europe have been supping the stuff for years - where it has strong links with events including denmark 's roskilde and serbia 's exit festival .
gaymers says its grassroots gigs help build its music associations and after a low-key launch last summer , now the brand 's owner , carlsberg , has done deals similar to gaymer to get it served at some of the biggest music events in the uk .
these again include leeds and reading festivals - which observers see as a big coup given they had become synonymous with carlsberg 's rival , carling , which had festival naming rights .
and it is also sponsoring the second stage at the o2 wireless festival - something which head of sponsorship gareth roberts says " really brings home the association with the music " .
carlsberg had long been keen to have a beer that it could tie in with music , mr roberts says .
it 's a captive audience and that 's what you 're buying with the contract of exclusivity gareth roberts head of sponsorship , carlsberg " carlsberg lager is very much intertwined with football , while tetley has strong links with rugby , but tuborg targets a different market , so it does not really have an impact on any of our other products . "
distribution overhaul last year the equivalent of about 6 million pints of tuborg was sold .
the aim is to double that in 2008 .
" despite being successful elsewhere , the brand never really got established in the uk , so the festivals give us the base to drive it forward and add sales , " says mr roberts .
" it 's a captive audience and that 's what you 're buying with the contract of exclusivity .
" but what we need to do is not just make it a festival beer but something that , when they leave the festival site , they go in search of .
" we want to make it part of more people 's repertoire of drinks , but for that to happen they need to find it in the pub or supermarket so we have a job to do .
the distribution needs to get better . "
' festival mood ' the festival route to marketing can do wonders for building a brand , says matthew langley , marketing director of brothers cider , which began with a small stall at the glastonbury festival in 1995 and last year sold hundreds of thousands of pints of its pear cider at the event , and others including bestival and the big chill .
brothers is targeting a wider audience .
" festivals are great for us because you can completely engage with your customers and have a proper conversation with them , " he says .
" so it 's brilliant for brand awareness , far better than putting up a billboard . "
and there is tangible evidence that its impact lasts beyond the festival fence .
" the product reach has exploded since this time last year , " mr langley says .
" and a lot of that is to do with leveraging off the festival which really helps create demand .
" we get inundated with e-mails from customers .
some are individuals ordering a case or two and others are bar owners and traders who want to know where to get our products .
" and as summer draws closer , we 're getting busier , with people ordering on our website saying they want to get into the festival mood . "
we have not really been a consumer brand and need to develop this matthew langley , brothers cider " as well as the sales it is also a great story to tell to the supermarkets and off-licences - to show that we have got a latent audience . "
in the past year , brothers ' products have been stocked in several pub chains and supermarkets and , as the firm 's website boasts , it has even popped up behind the bar in the queen vic on eastenders .
this year it is focusing on one-day events and festivals with more specific target audiences - from students at beach break live in cornwall this week to families at guilfest and more regional events such live at loch lomond .
" we can pick up consumers because of the way the festival market in the uk is so fragmented , " mr langley says .
" we have not really been a consumer brand and need to develop this .
we 've got to get beyond being a glastonbury brand . "

the strike - called by the regional gorkha janmukti morcha -lrb- gjm -rrb- - was halted for a few days last week to allow tourists to leave .
it was also stopped to allow the shopkeepers to stock up on essentials .
the strike resumed late on monday .
the gjm is demanding a separate state and fairer treatment for darjeeling 's nepali-speaking gorkha community .
gjm secretary roshan giri said the strike would now continue " for weeks , perhaps months , if our aspirations are not fulfilled " .
the strike , earlier this month , led to widespread violence between the gorkhas and the bengalis in the foothills of darjeeling .
police had to intervene several times to break up clashes and the army was put on alert .
mainstay the west bengal government has called an all party meeting on tuesday to discuss ways to handle the crisis caused by the agitation for a separate gorkha state in the darjeeling hills .
the gjm has also called an all party meeting in darjeeling , asking other gorkha groups and parties to join their protest activities .
" we will not talk to the bengal government anymore .
we are waiting for a call for talks with the federal government in delhi , " said mr giri .
tea and tourism are the mainstay of darjeeling 's economy .
tourists left darjeeling in a hurry after the sudden call for an indefinite strike by the gjm earlier this month .
tea industry sources say the more than 250 tea estates in darjeeling and its foothills are likely to be affected by the indefinite strike .
this is time for the second flush - or harvest - of tea in the region , which fetches high prices in european markets .
but with movement of vehicles completely stopped , it will be difficult carrying the tea to auction centres in siliguri and calcutta , tea industry sources said .

the strike - called by the regional gorkha janmukti morcha -lrb- gjm -rrb- - was halted for a few days last week to allow tourists to leave .
it was also stopped to allow the shopkeepers to stock up on essentials .
the strike resumed late on monday .
the gjm is demanding a separate state and fairer treatment for darjeeling 's nepali-speaking gorkha community .
gjm secretary roshan giri said the strike would now continue " for weeks , perhaps months , if our aspirations are not fulfilled " .
the strike , earlier this month , led to widespread violence between the gorkhas and the bengalis in the foothills of darjeeling .
police had to intervene several times to break up clashes and the army was put on alert .
mainstay the west bengal government has called an all party meeting on tuesday to discuss ways to handle the crisis caused by the agitation for a separate gorkha state in the darjeeling hills .
the gjm has also called an all party meeting in darjeeling , asking other gorkha groups and parties to join their protest activities .
" we will not talk to the bengal government anymore .
we are waiting for a call for talks with the federal government in delhi , " said mr giri .
tea and tourism are the mainstay of darjeeling 's economy .
tourists left darjeeling in a hurry after the sudden call for an indefinite strike by the gjm earlier this month .
tea industry sources say the more than 250 tea estates in darjeeling and its foothills are likely to be affected by the indefinite strike .
this is time for the second flush - or harvest - of tea in the region , which fetches high prices in european markets .
but with movement of vehicles completely stopped , it will be difficult carrying the tea to auction centres in siliguri and calcutta , tea industry sources said .

adobe 's net income in the three months to may 30 was $ 214.9m -lrb- £ 109m -rrb- , up from $ 152m in the same quarter a year ago .
the company added that sales were flat in the us .
demand ' remains strong ' adobe said it expected revenue in the third quarter to be in a range of $ 855m to $ 885m .
the firm 's chief executive shantanu narayen said that while adobe had so far weathered the us economic slowdown , this could change .
" i 'm not an economist .
all i can do is reflect on what i have seen so far , " he said .
" demand for our products remains strong .
-lrb- but -rrb- we are not immune to a recession . "
however , mr narayen added he expected international sales to continue to be strong , with eastern europe , brazil and china offering opportunities for growth as software piracy declines .

robin tyler and diane olson wanted the world to see them become one of the first same-sex couples to get married legally in california .
in the end , it was televised live on three local networks , and media outnumbered guests at beverly hills city hall .
outside the building , friends and relatives sat on rows of white chairs .
a table had been laid with white cloth and was adorned with flowers , glasses of champagne and a three-tiered cake - rather traditional in its design , with white icing and edible red roses .
at 1701 , ms tyler and ms olson emerged from city hall to cheers - not yet married , but holding the wedding licences they had just been granted .
after years of lodging petitions at this public building , and having them denied , they wanted it to be the venue of their triumph , and the focal point of a very public campaign .
both wore white suits and huge smiles .
around them supporters waved rainbow flags and one held a placard saying simply : " finally . "
around them , however , several protesters with banners carrying different slogans such as : " legalising gay marriage is legalising sin . "
yet theirs was a silent protest , for the most part .
' blasphemy ' this was a traditional jewish ceremony -lrb- in as much as it was traditional at all -rrb- .
the rabbi led the crowd through the service and the blessings .

once , i heard a protester mutter " blasphemy " , quietly , almost to himself .
at 1726 by my watch , the rabbi said : " by the power vested in me by the state of california ...
i pronounce you spouses for life ! "
there were huge cheers and traditional wedding music piped out from the pa system .
the couple looked ecstatic , holding back the tears .
they kissed in front of a bank of tv cameras and were congratulated by their guests and , first of all , by their fearsome lawyer , gloria allred , who had worked with them through all their lawsuits .
it was she who had an argument with one of the protesters later , although it seemed to me to be more for the sake of the cameras than a serious showdown .

voters will be asked in a referendum whether the ban should be restored opponents hope californian voters will overturn the supreme court ruling in november 's election , when they may be asked to vote on gay marriage .
meanwhile california is gearing up for a busy summer of gay weddings , as many of its resident 80,000-plus same-sex couples take advantage of the law change .
in addition , the state is expecting thousands more to come here from other parts of the country - california is the only state now ready to grant wedding licences to couples from different states .

the moved followed concern that homeowners and tenants are being given a raw deal .
the oft study will examine the quality and cost of factors , who manage shared areas such as roofs , stairwells and gardens in tenement buildings .
the report , to be completed later this year , will also look at the options open to residents when things go wrong .
the oft will gather evidence from homeowners and suppliers operating in the sector .
the probe followed evidence submitted by the scottish consumer council which highlighted " potential consumer harm " .
' positive outcomes ' scc chair douglas sinclair said : " the scc has expressed concerns about the current system of scottish property factoring and welcomes the oft 's announcement .
" we look forward to working with the oft as it looks in more detail at this important area for scottish consumers . "
oft senior director of infrastructure heather clayton said : " this study will take a detailed look at scottish property management services , consider how well they are working for homeowners , and take a view on any recommendations which might bring positive outcomes for consumers in scotland . "
there are some 330,000 owner-occupied flats in scotland and a further 85,000 rented from private landlords .
of these , the majority of residents are likely to be in a relationship with a property management company .
average administration charges paid to property managers are in the region of £ 100 per flat per year .
mike dailly , of govan law centre , told a bbc scotland investigation earlier this year that he was dealing with an increasing number of cases where people were being sued for thousands of pounds by factors .
he said much of the debt accrued because factors were charging them for reminders sent at a cost of more than £ 17 every five days .

" this is the biggest release by far of firefox , " says mike schroepfer , vice president of engineering at the non-profit that drives the web browser 's development .
" we could n't have done it without the two million people around the world already running it and the other 20,000 helping give us feedback , working out the bugs and constantly refining it , " he said .
version 3.0 of firefox is set to debut on 17 june and the mozilla foundation aims to try and set a world record for the most downloads in a day when the software is unleashed .
it will have to do well to beat firefox 2.0 - that version racked up 1.6 million downloads on the day it was first released in october 2006 .
mr schroepfer said firefox 3 promised to be faster , easier to use and more secure than rival browsers .
he claims that firefox 3.0 loads webpages three to four times faster than firefox 2.0 and more than seven times faster than microsoft 's internet explorer -lrb- ie -rrb- .
however , with all manner of factors beyond mozilla 's control affecting browsing speed those claims may prove hard to sustain .
alongside the speed improvements goes the " smart location bar " - a feature known as the " awesome bar " internally at mozilla .
mr schroepfer calls this novel feature : " the biggest user experience change ... since tabbed browsing . "
the feature gives the browser 's address bar a mechanism for quickly returning to web pages without bookmarking them , even if a user does n't remember the address .
it can also search " tags " - keywords that users associate with a particular page .
" arms race " security was also high on the development team 's list of improvements for the new version .
mr schroepfer told the bbc : " it 's an arms race between the good guys and the bad guys .
this is not scare tactics or boogie man kind of stuff .
" we have seen a huge uptick in malware attacks because they are financially motivated , " he said .
" this is billions of dollars a year .
there are clear incentives for people to do this because they make money so you need some good guys on your side to block them out . "
included in firefox 3.0 are malicious software spotters that tell users when they are on a website that has been compromised .
a red box will pop up in the middle of the screen warning users of the danger .
mr schroepfer said : " this new type of attack where people are hijacking legitimate websites and using them as mechanisms to try and install software on your machine is truly worrying .
behind the warning system is a list of infected sites that is updated every 30 minutes to keep up with the pace of web attacks .
when firefox 2.0 was launched , said mr schroepfer , its security focus was phishing attacks , where fake websites ask for personal details such as bank account or social security numbers to aid identity theft and give access to a user 's financial accounts .
" i think people adapted and thought phishing is n't working and then they switched to malware attacks , " said mr schropefer .
other features include almost 5000 add-ons to customise a page , making the image on the back button bigger than the forward button because that is the one used more often , and extending how long history stores page information to three months .
since firefox launched in 2004 it has gained a steadily increasing share of the web browsing market .
now , on average , about 15 % of web users browse the web with firefox .
" our goal because we are non profit is n't world domination , " said mr schroepfer .
" it 's just to make sure the internet is open , collaborative , competitive and innovative . "

" this is the biggest release by far of firefox , " says mike schroepfer , vice president of engineering at the non-profit that drives the web browser 's development .
" we could n't have done it without the two million people around the world already running it and the other 20,000 helping give us feedback , working out the bugs and constantly refining it , " he said .
version 3.0 of firefox is set to debut on 17 june and the mozilla foundation aims to try and set a world record for the most downloads in a day when the software is unleashed .
it will have to do well to beat firefox 2.0 - that version racked up 1.6 million downloads on the day it was first released in october 2006 .
mr schroepfer said firefox 3 promised to be faster , easier to use and more secure than rival browsers .
he claims that firefox 3.0 loads webpages three to four times faster than firefox 2.0 and more than seven times faster than microsoft 's internet explorer -lrb- ie -rrb- .
however , with all manner of factors beyond mozilla 's control affecting browsing speed those claims may prove hard to sustain .
alongside the speed improvements goes the " smart location bar " - a feature known as the " awesome bar " internally at mozilla .
schroepfer : " this is the biggest release by far of firefox . "
mr schroepfer calls this novel feature : " the biggest user experience change ... since tabbed browsing . "
the feature gives the browser 's address bar a mechanism for quickly returning to web pages without bookmarking them , even if a user does n't remember the address .
it can also search " tags " - keywords that users associate with a particular page .
" arms race " security was also high on the development team 's list of improvements for the new version .
mr schroepfer told the bbc : " it 's an arms race between the good guys and the bad guys .
this is not scare tactics or boogie man kind of stuff .
" we have seen a huge uptick in malware attacks because they are financially motivated , " he said .
" this is billions of dollars a year .
there are clear incentives for people to do this because they make money so you need some good guys on your side to block them out . "
included in firefox 3.0 are malicious software spotters that tell users when they are on a website that has been compromised .
a red box will pop up in the middle of the screen warning users of the danger .
firefox 3.0 warns when users stray on to a booby-trapped page mr schroepfer said : " this new type of attack where people are hijacking legitimate websites and using them as mechanisms to try and install software on your machine is truly worrying .
behind the warning system is a list of infected sites that is updated every 30 minutes to keep up with the pace of web attacks .
when firefox 2.0 was launched , said mr schroepfer , its security focus was phishing attacks , where fake websites ask for personal details such as bank account or social security numbers to aid identity theft and give access to a user 's financial accounts .
" i think people adapted and thought phishing is n't working and then they switched to malware attacks , " said mr schropefer .
other features include almost 5000 add-ons to customise a page , making the image on the back button bigger than the forward button because that is the one used more often , and extending how long history stores page information to three months .
since firefox launched in 2004 it has gained a steadily increasing share of the web browsing market .
now , on average , about 15 % of web users browse the web with firefox .
" our goal because we are non profit is n't world domination , " said mr schroepfer .
" it 's just to make sure the internet is open , collaborative , competitive and innovative . "

" this is the biggest release by far of firefox , " says mike schroepfer , vice president of engineering at the non-profit that drives the web browser 's development .
" we could n't have done it without the two million people around the world already running it and the other 20,000 helping give us feedback , working out the bugs and constantly refining it , " he said .
version 3.0 of firefox is set to debut on 17 june and the mozilla foundation aims to try and set a world record for the most downloads in a day when the software is unleashed .
it will have to do well to beat firefox 2.0 - that version racked up 1.6 million downloads on the day it was first released in october 2006 .
mr schroepfer said firefox 3 promised to be faster , easier to use and more secure than rival browsers .
he claims that firefox 3.0 loads webpages three to four times faster than firefox 2.0 and more than seven times faster than microsoft 's internet explorer -lrb- ie -rrb- .
however , with all manner of factors beyond mozilla 's control affecting browsing speed those claims may prove hard to sustain .
alongside the speed improvements goes the " smart location bar " - a feature known as the " awesome bar " internally at mozilla .
schroepfer : " this is the biggest release by far of firefox . "
mr schroepfer calls this novel feature : " the biggest user experience change ... since tabbed browsing . "
the feature gives the browser 's address bar a mechanism for quickly returning to web pages without bookmarking them , even if a user does n't remember the address .
it can also search " tags " - keywords that users associate with a particular page .
" arms race " security was also high on the development team 's list of improvements for the new version .
mr schroepfer told the bbc : " it 's an arms race between the good guys and the bad guys .
this is not scare tactics or boogie man kind of stuff .
" we have seen a huge uptick in malware attacks because they are financially motivated , " he said .
" this is billions of dollars a year .
there are clear incentives for people to do this because they make money so you need some good guys on your side to block them out . "
included in firefox 3.0 are malicious software spotters that tell users when they are on a website that has been compromised .
a red box will pop up in the middle of the screen warning users of the danger .
firefox 3.0 warns when users stray on to a booby-trapped page mr schroepfer said : " this new type of attack where people are hijacking legitimate websites and using them as mechanisms to try and install software on your machine is truly worrying .
behind the warning system is a list of infected sites that is updated every 30 minutes to keep up with the pace of web attacks .
when firefox 2.0 was launched , said mr schroepfer , its security focus was phishing attacks , where fake websites ask for personal details such as bank account or social security numbers to aid identity theft and give access to a user 's financial accounts .
" i think people adapted and thought phishing is n't working and then they switched to malware attacks , " said mr schropefer .
other features include almost 5000 add-ons to customise a page , making the image on the back button bigger than the forward button because that is the one used more often , and extending how long history stores page information to three months .
since firefox launched in 2004 it has gained a steadily increasing share of the web browsing market .
now , on average , about 15 % of web users browse the web with firefox .
" our goal because we are non profit is n't world domination , " said mr schroepfer .
" it 's just to make sure the internet is open , collaborative , competitive and innovative . "

" this is the biggest release by far of firefox , " says mike schroepfer , vice president of engineering at the non-profit that drives the web browser 's development .
" we could n't have done it without the two million people around the world already running it and the other 20,000 helping give us feedback , working out the bugs and constantly refining it , " he said .
version 3.0 of firefox is set to debut on 17 june and the mozilla foundation aims to try and set a world record for the most downloads in a day when the software is unleashed .
it will have to do well to beat firefox 2.0 - that version racked up 1.6 million downloads on the day it was first released in october 2006 .
mr schroepfer said firefox 3 promised to be faster , easier to use and more secure than rival browsers .
he claims that firefox 3.0 loads webpages three to four times faster than firefox 2.0 and more than seven times faster than microsoft 's internet explorer -lrb- ie -rrb- .
however , with all manner of factors beyond mozilla 's control affecting browsing speed those claims may prove hard to sustain .
alongside the speed improvements goes the " smart location bar " - a feature known as the " awesome bar " internally at mozilla .
schroepfer : " this is the biggest release by far of firefox . "
mr schroepfer calls this novel feature : " the biggest user experience change ... since tabbed browsing . "
the feature gives the browser 's address bar a mechanism for quickly returning to web pages without bookmarking them , even if a user does n't remember the address .
it can also search " tags " - keywords that users associate with a particular page .
" arms race " security was also high on the development team 's list of improvements for the new version .
mr schroepfer told the bbc : " it 's an arms race between the good guys and the bad guys .
this is not scare tactics or boogie man kind of stuff .
" we have seen a huge uptick in malware attacks because they are financially motivated , " he said .
" this is billions of dollars a year .

by rebecca fordham if someone was killed in front of you would you remember what happened ?
many experts are challenging the view that eyewitnesses recounting what they saw is the best way of tapping their memory .
some think brain scans could be the way forward .
think of a journey you made yesterday .
i 'm sure you remember it .
so can you remember whom you sat next to ?
can you remember what the weather was like ?
who was in front of you in the petrol queue ?
was it a man or a woman ?
find out more ...
law in action is on radio 4 on tuesday , 1600 bst or catch up at radio 4 's listen again site naturally , most of the time we do n't remember these details .
but what if someone got knifed in the petrol station ?
then we become witnesses to a crime .
and our ability to recall these minor details may have a significant role in authenticating our memory of the offence .
some researchers suggest that we should n't need to remember these details .
they are increasingly questioning the way that the police , lawyers and the courts think about memory .
they argue that this conventional model of memory – like a detailed photograph or video film – is fundamentally flawed .
one of the most prominent of these researchers , prof elizabeth loftus of the university of california at irvine , even says that courts should have a new oath for witnesses : " do you swear to tell the truth , the whole truth , or whatever it is you think you remember ? "
memory research now prof martin conway , a cognitive psychologist at leeds university , has drawn up a report for the british psychological society and the law society calling for a major rethink of memory and the law .
he suggests his guidelines will help scientists who specialise in memory research when they testify as expert witnesses to help the courts assess the evidence .
memories are essentially a construct from a variety of sources and experiences , prof conway says .
they are not necessarily a factual account of what happened .
what 's more , a significant proportion of people seem to be highly suggestible and will quite readily change what they remember if given appropriate cues .
in one famous study , dutch researchers questioned people about a 1992 accident in which a cargo plane had crashed into a block of flats near schiphol airport .
ten months later , they conducted a survey asking if people remembered seeing the tv film of the plane hitting the building .
more than half of the respondents said they had .
a later study found that the proportion had gone up to two-thirds .
the problem is , there is no tv film of the accident .
asking the question had itself apparently changed people 's memories .
a similar phenomenon happened with the shooting in london of the suspected terrorist jean charles de menezes at stockwell underground station .
eyewitness errors jean charles de menezes : eyewitnesses claimed to have seen bulky jacket , victim jumping barriers - not correct jennifer thompson : us rape victim identified wrong man with absolute certainty - suspect exonerated by dna evidence initially witnesses claimed that he was wearing bulky clothing and that he had vaulted the ticket barriers as he ran from police .
a police spokesman said on the day that , " his clothing and behaviour added to their suspicions " , and that he ran onto the train after police had issued warnings .
these claims were incorrect .
but people still express surprise when told he was n't wearing a large coat and are confused about how he entered the tube because the inaccurate reports became cemented into individual memories .
so are witnesses consciously or subconsciously having their memories altered ?
there is little data available regarding the extent of suggestive questioning of eyewitnesses .
one british study using actual interviews indicates that approximately one out of every six questions posed to eyewitnesses was in some way suggestive .
the police say they are already aware of the risks and do their utmost to avoid them .
doubtful memory at hendon police training college , in north london , one of the courses trains officers in interviewing eye witnesses .
the officers are shown a video of a dramatised murder and then questioned by a colleague .
one half-remembered a northern accent .
when questioned further , she said she thought the accent was mancunian but she could n't be sure .
the interviewer pressed the would-be witness on the detail despite the original uncertainty .
prof conway argues this sort of detail can mislead and that the interviewing process could turn a doubtful memory into fact .
one technology that could help in future is brain scanning .
neuroimaging has now been developed in which objects unique to a crime scene are shown to witnesses , such as a lampshade or a particular colour .
these would only be recognised if the person had been there .
witnesses ' brains are monitored to see if areas associated with memory light up when they see the objects .
but it will be many years before such evidence is admissible in court .
and many involved in the criminal justice system argue that the courts already have a good record of separating reliable and unreliable memories .
former judge gerald butler qc says jurors can use their commonsense to decipher the evidence and he is wary about introducing a new set of experts into the process .
" i have had a long term concern about the evidence of experts , " he says .
" i have heard so many experts giving evidence one way and then another expert giving evidence the other way .
it 's very difficult to judge the expert and know which one is right and which one is wrong . "

while working in an afghan refugee camp in the 1990 's , i unfortunately , witnessed a shooting of a man with an automatic rifle .
we had a doctor in the vehicle and pulled up to the victims van to see if we could help .
some 30 rounds had hit into / around the victim and i was window to window with him , but from just after the event to this day i have no visual image of the body , only a vivid memory of a bullet hole in the metal at the top of the windscreen .
in this case my mind seems to have ' stored ' that visual file .
why ?
brett tricker , uk i heard a story once about bono from u2 going to visit his wife after she had given birth and a nurse ran up to him pointing and shouting to the sister " this is him !
this is the man who has been stealing all the bed pans . "
once it had been pointed out that he could buy the hospital if he wanted the nurse accepted she may have got it wrong !
dan , monaco any one that has read any of the good doctor robert anton wilson 's books will already be familiar with the problem of memory recall and witness statements / his experiment from the 1960s involved him on stage talking and a coloured man would rush on stage with a banana in hand and pretend to stab him , when the audience got over the shock and realised it was part of the talk , he would get them all to write down what happened .
inevitably there would be a hundred different statements with different stories usually revolving around a black man stabbing the speaker with a huge knife or even shooting him .
to further show the unreliability of memory he would then get everyone to write down everything they saw from entering the theatre to sitting down , and again there would be hundreds of differing accounts of the colour of the theatre , the size and even the colour of the carpet .
memory / false memory and manipulation is a very easy function to manipulate. hagbard celine , brighton i used to be a litigation lawyer and i used to maintain that there were at least six versions of the truth : 1 -rrb- what your client genuinely believed was the truth ; 2 -rrb- what the documents suggested to me was most likely to be the truth ; 3 -rrb- what the client on the other side genuinely believed was the truth ; 4 -rrb- what the documents suggested to the lawyer on the other side was most likely to be the truth ; 5 -rrb- what the judge would decide the truth had been on the basis of everything before him or her ; and , lastly and almost least importantly , 6 -rrb- what the truth actually was !
ronnie mb , west norfolk , uk i was knifed when i was a teenager .
the police asked me to describe the man , which i could -lrb- down to telling them , correctly , that he 'd had a haircut since the photo i picked out in the photo id -rrb- .
however , i thought he was a couple of inches taller than me , when actually he was a couple of inches shorter - i was told later that fear changes your memory , making him seem bigger .
rona moody , pittsburgh , usa i do n't think it 's memory loss .
its the case of bias interpretation of what was seen. there are three things , what i saw , what i think i saw , and what do i want to tell you what i saw. amer , london uk i lost my memory of military operations , whist on active service 40 years ago .
recently , those memories returned with vigour and full detail .
i recalled each action and each word spoken at that time .
it was as thought events had occurred only yesterday .
i think some memories are ingrained and hypnosis may be the key to reveal the true facts of events .
henry macgowan , glasgow , scotland there is a fair bit of research which confirms how inaccurate most people 's memories are , although i can well believe that little of it relates to suggestive questioning by police and other authorities .
as the article notes , people are also very suggestible and like to agree with questioners .
leading questions produce wrong answers .
as well as misremembering what they saw or did n't see , interviewees also get wrong the dates of key events by wrongly referencing them to other events : " it must have been in 19 # # because my son was born that year ... " and the like .
john k , exeter are n't suspects called as witnesses ?
does that mean that in the future suspects might have to be told that they have the right to remain silent and the right not to undergo a brain scan while being shown images related to the crime ?
otherwise -lrb- assuming this technique is reliable -rrb- , they would be incriminating themselves .
doug , as grissom in csi says , witnesses lie .
they get confused .
they 're prejudiced , whether consciously or unconsciously , and they make mistakes .
eye witness evidence is unreliable , and it 's cold hard science that should be relied on in court .
that 's why clear cctv evidence is so important .

law in action is on radio 4 on tuesday , 1600 bst or catch up at radio 4 's listen again site naturally , most of the time we do n't remember these details .
but what if someone got knifed in the petrol station ?
then we become witnesses to a crime .
and our ability to recall these minor details may have a significant role in authenticating our memory of the offence .
some researchers suggest that we should n't need to remember these details .
they are increasingly questioning the way that the police , lawyers and the courts think about memory .
they argue that this conventional model of memory – like a detailed photograph or video film – is fundamentally flawed .
one of the most prominent of these researchers , prof elizabeth loftus of the university of california at irvine , even says that courts should have a new oath for witnesses : " do you swear to tell the truth , the whole truth , or whatever it is you think you remember ? "
memory research now prof martin conway , a cognitive psychologist at leeds university , has drawn up a report for the british psychological society and the law society calling for a major rethink of memory and the law .
he suggests his guidelines will help scientists who specialise in memory research when they testify as expert witnesses to help the courts assess the evidence .
neuroimaging could offer a way forward in court memories are essentially a construct from a variety of sources and experiences , prof conway says .
they are not necessarily a factual account of what happened .
what 's more , a significant proportion of people seem to be highly suggestible and will quite readily change what they remember if given appropriate cues .
in one famous study , dutch researchers questioned people about a 1992 accident in which a cargo plane had crashed into a block of flats near schiphol airport .
ten months later , they conducted a survey asking if people remembered seeing the tv film of the plane hitting the building .
more than half of the respondents said they had .
a later study found that the proportion had gone up to two-thirds .
the problem is , there is no tv film of the accident .
asking the question had itself apparently changed people 's memories .
a similar phenomenon happened with the shooting in london of the suspected terrorist jean charles de menezes at stockwell underground station .
eyewitness errors jean charles de menezes : eyewitnesses claimed to have seen bulky jacket , victim jumping barriers - not correct jennifer thompson : us rape victim identified wrong man with absolute certainty - suspect exonerated by dna evidence initially witnesses claimed that he was wearing bulky clothing and that he had vaulted the ticket barriers as he ran from police .
a police spokesman said on the day that , " his clothing and behaviour added to their suspicions " , and that he ran onto the train after police had issued warnings .
these claims were incorrect .
but people still express surprise when told he was n't wearing a large coat and are confused about how he entered the tube because the inaccurate reports became cemented into individual memories .
so are witnesses consciously or subconsciously having their memories altered ?
there is little data available regarding the extent of suggestive questioning of eyewitnesses .
one british study using actual interviews indicates that approximately one out of every six questions posed to eyewitnesses was in some way suggestive .
the police say they are already aware of the risks and do their utmost to avoid them .
doubtful memory at hendon police training college , in north london , one of the courses trains officers in interviewing eye witnesses .
the officers are shown a video of a dramatised murder and then questioned by a colleague .
one half-remembered a northern accent .
when questioned further , she said she thought the accent was mancunian but she could n't be sure .
the interviewer pressed the would-be witness on the detail despite the original uncertainty .
our faculties are often impaired by the nature of the scene we are witnessing prof conway argues this sort of detail can mislead and that the interviewing process could turn a doubtful memory into fact .
one technology that could help in future is brain scanning .
neuroimaging has now been developed in which objects unique to a crime scene are shown to witnesses , such as a lampshade or a particular colour .
these would only be recognised if the person had been there .
witnesses ' brains are monitored to see if areas associated with memory light up when they see the objects .
but it will be many years before such evidence is admissible in court .
and many involved in the criminal justice system argue that the courts already have a good record of separating reliable and unreliable memories .
former judge gerald butler qc says jurors can use their commonsense to decipher the evidence and he is wary about introducing a new set of experts into the process .
" i have had a long term concern about the evidence of experts , " he says .
" i have heard so many experts giving evidence one way and then another expert giving evidence the other way .
it 's very difficult to judge the expert and know which one is right and which one is wrong . "

while working in an afghan refugee camp in the 1990 's , i unfortunately , witnessed a shooting of a man with an automatic rifle .
we had a doctor in the vehicle and pulled up to the victims van to see if we could help .
some 30 rounds had hit into / around the victim and i was window to window with him , but from just after the event to this day i have no visual image of the body , only a vivid memory of a bullet hole in the metal at the top of the windscreen .
in this case my mind seems to have ' stored ' that visual file .
why ?
brett tricker , uk i heard a story once about bono from u2 going to visit his wife after she had given birth and a nurse ran up to him pointing and shouting to the sister " this is him !
this is the man who has been stealing all the bed pans . "
once it had been pointed out that he could buy the hospital if he wanted the nurse accepted she may have got it wrong !
dan , monaco any one that has read any of the good doctor robert anton wilson 's books will already be familiar with the problem of memory recall and witness statements / his experiment from the 1960s involved him on stage talking and a coloured man would rush on stage with a banana in hand and pretend to stab him , when the audience got over the shock and realised it was part of the talk , he would get them all to write down what happened .
inevitably there would be a hundred different statements with different stories usually revolving around a black man stabbing the speaker with a huge knife or even shooting him .
to further show the unreliability of memory he would then get everyone to write down everything they saw from entering the theatre to sitting down , and again there would be hundreds of differing accounts of the colour of the theatre , the size and even the colour of the carpet .
memory / false memory and manipulation is a very easy function to manipulate. hagbard celine , brighton i used to be a litigation lawyer and i used to maintain that there were at least six versions of the truth : 1 -rrb- what your client genuinely believed was the truth ; 2 -rrb- what the documents suggested to me was most likely to be the truth ; 3 -rrb- what the client on the other side genuinely believed was the truth ; 4 -rrb- what the documents suggested to the lawyer on the other side was most likely to be the truth ; 5 -rrb- what the judge would decide the truth had been on the basis of everything before him or her ; and , lastly and almost least importantly , 6 -rrb- what the truth actually was !
ronnie mb , west norfolk , uk i was knifed when i was a teenager .
the police asked me to describe the man , which i could -lrb- down to telling them , correctly , that he 'd had a haircut since the photo i picked out in the photo id -rrb- .
however , i thought he was a couple of inches taller than me , when actually he was a couple of inches shorter - i was told later that fear changes your memory , making him seem bigger .
rona moody , pittsburgh , usa i do n't think it 's memory loss .
its the case of bias interpretation of what was seen. there are three things , what i saw , what i think i saw , and what do i want to tell you what i saw. amer , london uk i lost my memory of military operations , whist on active service 40 years ago .
recently , those memories returned with vigour and full detail .
i recalled each action and each word spoken at that time .
it was as thought events had occurred only yesterday .
i think some memories are ingrained and hypnosis may be the key to reveal the true facts of events .
henry macgowan , glasgow , scotland there is a fair bit of research which confirms how inaccurate most people 's memories are , although i can well believe that little of it relates to suggestive questioning by police and other authorities .
as the article notes , people are also very suggestible and like to agree with questioners .
leading questions produce wrong answers .
as well as misremembering what they saw or did n't see , interviewees also get wrong the dates of key events by wrongly referencing them to other events : " it must have been in 19 # # because my son was born that year ... " and the like .

many experts are challenging the view that eyewitnesses recounting what they saw is the best way of tapping their memory .
some think brain scans could be the way forward .

law in action is on radio 4 on tuesday , 1600 bst or catch up at radio 4 's listen again site naturally , most of the time we do n't remember these details .
but what if someone got knifed in the petrol station ?
then we become witnesses to a crime .
and our ability to recall these minor details may have a significant role in authenticating our memory of the offence .
some researchers suggest that we should n't need to remember these details .
they are increasingly questioning the way that the police , lawyers and the courts think about memory .
they argue that this conventional model of memory – like a detailed photograph or video film – is fundamentally flawed .
one of the most prominent of these researchers , prof elizabeth loftus of the university of california at irvine , even says that courts should have a new oath for witnesses : " do you swear to tell the truth , the whole truth , or whatever it is you think you remember ? "
memory research now prof martin conway , a cognitive psychologist at leeds university , has drawn up a report for the british psychological society and the law society calling for a major rethink of memory and the law .
he suggests his guidelines will help scientists who specialise in memory research when they testify as expert witnesses to help the courts assess the evidence .
neuroimaging could offer a way forward in court memories are essentially a construct from a variety of sources and experiences , prof conway says .
they are not necessarily a factual account of what happened .
what 's more , a significant proportion of people seem to be highly suggestible and will quite readily change what they remember if given appropriate cues .
in one famous study , dutch researchers questioned people about a 1992 accident in which a cargo plane had crashed into a block of flats near schiphol airport .
ten months later , they conducted a survey asking if people remembered seeing the tv film of the plane hitting the building .
more than half of the respondents said they had .
a later study found that the proportion had gone up to two-thirds .
the problem is , there is no tv film of the accident .
asking the question had itself apparently changed people 's memories .
a similar phenomenon happened with the shooting in london of the suspected terrorist jean charles de menezes at stockwell underground station .
eyewitness errors jean charles de menezes : eyewitnesses claimed to have seen bulky jacket , victim jumping barriers - not correct jennifer thompson : us rape victim identified wrong man with absolute certainty - suspect exonerated by dna evidence initially witnesses claimed that he was wearing bulky clothing and that he had vaulted the ticket barriers as he ran from police .

eyewitnesses were badly wrong about the shooting of jean charles de menezes by rebecca fordham if someone was killed in front of you would you remember what happened ?
many experts are challenging the view that eyewitnesses recounting what they saw is the best way of tapping their memory .
some think brain scans could be the way forward .
think of a journey you made yesterday .
i 'm sure you remember it .
so can you remember whom you sat next to ?
can you remember what the weather was like ?
who was in front of you in the petrol queue ?
was it a man or a woman ?
find out more ...
law in action is on radio 4 on tuesday , 1600 bst or catch up at radio 4 's listen again site naturally , most of the time we do n't remember these details .
but what if someone got knifed in the petrol station ?
then we become witnesses to a crime .
and our ability to recall these minor details may have a significant role in authenticating our memory of the offence .
some researchers suggest that we should n't need to remember these details .
they are increasingly questioning the way that the police , lawyers and the courts think about memory .
they argue that this conventional model of memory – like a detailed photograph or video film – is fundamentally flawed .
one of the most prominent of these researchers , prof elizabeth loftus of the university of california at irvine , even says that courts should have a new oath for witnesses : " do you swear to tell the truth , the whole truth , or whatever it is you think you remember ? "
memory research now prof martin conway , a cognitive psychologist at leeds university , has drawn up a report for the british psychological society and the law society calling for a major rethink of memory and the law .
he suggests his guidelines will help scientists who specialise in memory research when they testify as expert witnesses to help the courts assess the evidence .
neuroimaging could offer a way forward in court memories are essentially a construct from a variety of sources and experiences , prof conway says .
they are not necessarily a factual account of what happened .
what 's more , a significant proportion of people seem to be highly suggestible and will quite readily change what they remember if given appropriate cues .
in one famous study , dutch researchers questioned people about a 1992 accident in which a cargo plane had crashed into a block of flats near schiphol airport .
ten months later , they conducted a survey asking if people remembered seeing the tv film of the plane hitting the building .
more than half of the respondents said they had .
a later study found that the proportion had gone up to two-thirds .
the problem is , there is no tv film of the accident .
asking the question had itself apparently changed people 's memories .
a similar phenomenon happened with the shooting in london of the suspected terrorist jean charles de menezes at stockwell underground station .
eyewitness errors jean charles de menezes : eyewitnesses claimed to have seen bulky jacket , victim jumping barriers - not correct jennifer thompson : us rape victim identified wrong man with absolute certainty - suspect exonerated by dna evidence initially witnesses claimed that he was wearing bulky clothing and that he had vaulted the ticket barriers as he ran from police .
a police spokesman said on the day that , " his clothing and behaviour added to their suspicions " , and that he ran onto the train after police had issued warnings .
these claims were incorrect .
but people still express surprise when told he was n't wearing a large coat and are confused about how he entered the tube because the inaccurate reports became cemented into individual memories .
so are witnesses consciously or subconsciously having their memories altered ?
there is little data available regarding the extent of suggestive questioning of eyewitnesses .
one british study using actual interviews indicates that approximately one out of every six questions posed to eyewitnesses was in some way suggestive .
the police say they are already aware of the risks and do their utmost to avoid them .
doubtful memory at hendon police training college , in north london , one of the courses trains officers in interviewing eye witnesses .
the officers are shown a video of a dramatised murder and then questioned by a colleague .
one half-remembered a northern accent .
when questioned further , she said she thought the accent was mancunian but she could n't be sure .
the interviewer pressed the would-be witness on the detail despite the original uncertainty .
our faculties are often impaired by the nature of the scene we are witnessing prof conway argues this sort of detail can mislead and that the interviewing process could turn a doubtful memory into fact .
one technology that could help in future is brain scanning .
neuroimaging has now been developed in which objects unique to a crime scene are shown to witnesses , such as a lampshade or a particular colour .
these would only be recognised if the person had been there .
witnesses ' brains are monitored to see if areas associated with memory light up when they see the objects .
but it will be many years before such evidence is admissible in court .
and many involved in the criminal justice system argue that the courts already have a good record of separating reliable and unreliable memories .
former judge gerald butler qc says jurors can use their commonsense to decipher the evidence and he is wary about introducing a new set of experts into the process .
" i have had a long term concern about the evidence of experts , " he says .
" i have heard so many experts giving evidence one way and then another expert giving evidence the other way .
it 's very difficult to judge the expert and know which one is right and which one is wrong . "
send us your comments using the form below .
while working in an afghan refugee camp in the 1990 's , i unfortunately , witnessed a shooting of a man with an automatic rifle .
we had a doctor in the vehicle and pulled up to the victims van to see if we could help .
some 30 rounds had hit into / around the victim and i was window to window with him , but from just after the event to this day i have no visual image of the body , only a vivid memory of a bullet hole in the metal at the top of the windscreen .
in this case my mind seems to have ' stored ' that visual file .
why ?
brett tricker , uk i heard a story once about bono from u2 going to visit his wife after she had given birth and a nurse ran up to him pointing and shouting to the sister " this is him !
this is the man who has been stealing all the bed pans . "
once it had been pointed out that he could buy the hospital if he wanted the nurse accepted she may have got it wrong !
dan , monaco any one that has read any of the good doctor robert anton wilson 's books will already be familiar with the problem of memory recall and witness statements / his experiment from the 1960s involved him on stage talking and a coloured man would rush on stage with a banana in hand and pretend to stab him , when the audience got over the shock and realised it was part of the talk , he would get them all to write down what happened .
inevitably there would be a hundred different statements with different stories usually revolving around a black man stabbing the speaker with a huge knife or even shooting him .
to further show the unreliability of memory he would then get everyone to write down everything they saw from entering the theatre to sitting down , and again there would be hundreds of differing accounts of the colour of the theatre , the size and even the colour of the carpet .
memory / false memory and manipulation is a very easy function to manipulate. hagbard celine , brighton i used to be a litigation lawyer and i used to maintain that there were at least six versions of the truth : 1 -rrb- what your client genuinely believed was the truth ; 2 -rrb- what the documents suggested to me was most likely to be the truth ; 3 -rrb- what the client on the other side genuinely believed was the truth ; 4 -rrb- what the documents suggested to the lawyer on the other side was most likely to be the truth ; 5 -rrb- what the judge would decide the truth had been on the basis of everything before him or her ; and , lastly and almost least importantly , 6 -rrb- what the truth actually was !
ronnie mb , west norfolk , uk i was knifed when i was a teenager .
the police asked me to describe the man , which i could -lrb- down to telling them , correctly , that he 'd had a haircut since the photo i picked out in the photo id -rrb- .
however , i thought he was a couple of inches taller than me , when actually he was a couple of inches shorter - i was told later that fear changes your memory , making him seem bigger .
rona moody , pittsburgh , usa i do n't think it 's memory loss .
its the case of bias interpretation of what was seen. there are three things , what i saw , what i think i saw , and what do i want to tell you what i saw. amer , london uk i lost my memory of military operations , whist on active service 40 years ago .
recently , those memories returned with vigour and full detail .
i recalled each action and each word spoken at that time .
it was as thought events had occurred only yesterday .
i think some memories are ingrained and hypnosis may be the key to reveal the true facts of events .
henry macgowan , glasgow , scotland there is a fair bit of research which confirms how inaccurate most people 's memories are , although i can well believe that little of it relates to suggestive questioning by police and other authorities .
as the article notes , people are also very suggestible and like to agree with questioners .
leading questions produce wrong answers .
as well as misremembering what they saw or did n't see , interviewees also get wrong the dates of key events by wrongly referencing them to other events : " it must have been in 19 # # because my son was born that year ... " and the like .
john k , exeter are n't suspects called as witnesses ?
does that mean that in the future suspects might have to be told that they have the right to remain silent and the right not to undergo a brain scan while being shown images related to the crime ?
otherwise -lrb- assuming this technique is reliable -rrb- , they would be incriminating themselves .
doug , as grissom in csi says , witnesses lie .
they get confused .
they 're prejudiced , whether consciously or unconsciously , and they make mistakes .
eye witness evidence is unreliable , and it 's cold hard science that should be relied on in court .
that 's why clear cctv evidence is so important .

more than half the flats at the women 's aid refuge in londonderry have been occupied by women aged over 70 .
after suffering decades of domestic abuse some women seek help to leave .
a 75-year-old woman told support worker jo cochrane , " she was sorry she had n't done this 20 or 30 years earlier but in her mind ' there was nowhere ' to go . "
" they experience the same categories of abuse , the difference is the length of time they have suffered so the impact is more severe , " she said .
marie brown , area manager for foyle women 's aid , said the woman can suffer a range of abuse from financial , physical , verbal , sexual and emotional .
" one woman talked about saving water , she was n't allowed to eat meat or watch tv , " she said .
" it was violence when she was younger , then with time it escalated into something else . "
there are often a variety of reasons why people can find it hard to leave domestic abuse , ms cochrane said these can often revolve around guilt .
" maybe they have failing physical health , and in many cases grown-up families and children who may or may not support her , she will have to deal with feelings around that , " she said .
when the pensioners do seek help in the refuge they can be an inspiration for the other women .
" the woman in her mid-70s was by far the oldest in the room , she said to the younger women ' now you 're out , stay out ' she said .
" she 'd taken the decision to leave now because she had reached her significant birthday in her 70s , ' i have 10 years left , i want them to be peaceful ' , she told me . "
ms cochrane said stories like this were not as rare as might be expected .
" the average age of women coming into the rose house refuge is 54 , there have been many women over 50 and 60 who have left their homes and come in for help , " she said women 's aid runs a 24-hour helpline for victims of domestic violence - 0800 917 1414 .

more than half the flats at the women 's aid refuge in londonderry have been occupied by women aged over 70 .
after suffering decades of domestic abuse some women seek help to leave .
a 75-year-old woman told support worker jo cochrane , " she was sorry she had n't done this 20 or 30 years earlier but in her mind ' there was nowhere ' to go . "
" they experience the same categories of abuse , the difference is the length of time they have suffered so the impact is more severe , " she said .
marie brown , area manager for foyle women 's aid , said the woman can suffer a range of abuse from financial , physical , verbal , sexual and emotional .
" one woman talked about saving water , she was n't allowed to eat meat or watch tv , " she said .
" it was violence when she was younger , then with time it escalated into something else . "
there are often a variety of reasons why people can find it hard to leave domestic abuse , ms cochrane said these can often revolve around guilt .
" maybe they have failing physical health , and in many cases grown-up families and children who may or may not support her , she will have to deal with feelings around that , " she said .
when the pensioners do seek help in the refuge they can be an inspiration for the other women .
" the woman in her mid-70s was by far the oldest in the room , she said to the younger women ' now you 're out , stay out ' she said .
" she 'd taken the decision to leave now because she had reached her significant birthday in her 70s , ' i have 10 years left , i want them to be peaceful ' , she told me . "

the world society for the protection of animals -lrb- wspa -rrb- found that a quarter of last year 's catch was traded for profit through a private food company .
international whaling commission -lrb- iwc -rrb- rules allow hunting where there is a nutritional and cultural need .
the iwc annual meeting gets underway next week in santiago , chile .
wspa campaigners are presenting their report this week to a preliminary meeting of the organisation 's committee on aboriginal -lrb- or subsistence -rrb- whaling . "
if people were n't able to buy it frozen , then the waste would be very high " tonnes berthelsen arctic green food " greenland has been on the slippery slope towards commercial whaling for years , and now , demonstrably , they 've crossed the line , " said wspa 's marine mammals manager claire bass .
" the iwc has heard anecdotally about these processing operations , but this is the first time it 's been quantified , so we 're expecting it to be explosive , " she told bbc news vows renewed quotas for the five communities claiming a need for subsistence hunting were renewed at last year 's iwc meeting in anchorage , alaska .
at the time , some delegates queried greenland 's plans to expand its hunt to include bowhead and humpback whales - two species it had not previously targeted - and noted allegations that whalemeat regularly changed hands for money .
the legalities of whaling under the global moratorium on commercial whaling , hunting is conducted in three ways : objection - a country formally objects to the iwc moratorium , declaring itself exempt .
example : norway scientific - a nation issues unilateral ' scientific permits ' ; any iwc member can do this .
example : japan aboriginal - iwc grants permits to indigenous groups for subsistence food .
example : alaskan inupiat iwc rules do not explicitly prohibit commercial trade , but they specify that permits are granted only " to satisfy aboriginal subsistence need " .
delegates eventually voted to allow the bowhead quota , but rejected the request for humpbacks .
denmark , which speaks for greenland in the iwc , is bidding for humpbacks again this year .
over the last 12 months , wspa visited markets and harbours around greenland .
investigators posed as a documentary film crew reporting on local traditions and culture .
they concluded that at least a quarter of the whalemeat landed around the coasts was traded through a single company , arctic green food , with supermarkets the principal destination .
the company advertises packets of whalemeat for sale within greenland on its website .
products include steak , mince , salted blubber , and cuts from the fins and tails of minke whales , as well as unspecified meat from fin whales .
tonnes berthelsen , managing director of arctic green food , told bbc news his company traded meat from about 40 whales each year .
" we 're selling it frozen ; and if we did n't sell it like that , if people were n't able to buy it frozen , then the waste would be very high . "
but whereas the iwc says that " the meat and products are to be used exclusively for local consumption " , wspa points out that because the meat is sold in supermarkets , anyone can buy and consume it , even foreign nationals , raising the question of whether there is a genuine nutritional and cultural need .
broken record wspa is one of the few groups to campaign against subsistence whaling .
cultural claim to whale hunting the majority of conservation organisations support it as providing a sustainable resource to communities that need the meat .
there was a tacit agreement among anti-whaling ngos not to oppose the renewal of subsistence quotas at last year 's iwc meeting , an agreement that wspa did not support on animal welfare grounds .
" the record of these hunts is really bad , " said ms bass .
" only one in five whales dies within a minute .
these are the worst whale hunts in the world on welfare grounds . "
records submitted to the iwc show that in 2006 , fin whales took on average 35 minutes to die , with one taking nearly six hours .
norway 's overtly commercial hunters , by contrast , kill the majority of their prey within one minute .
the iwc 's various committees are coming to the end of their series of meetings in santiago before the full organisation convenes on monday .
its week-long meeting is likely to be dominated by south american proposals for a whale sanctuary in the south atlantic , and by discussions on whether pro- and anti-whaling blocs can find a path towards eventual compromise .

the world society for the protection of animals -lrb- wspa -rrb- found that a quarter of last year 's catch was traded for profit through a private food company .
international whaling commission -lrb- iwc -rrb- rules allow hunting where there is a nutritional and cultural need .
the iwc annual meeting gets underway next week in santiago , chile .
wspa campaigners are presenting their report this week to a preliminary meeting of the organisation 's committee on aboriginal -lrb- or subsistence -rrb- whaling .
if people were n't able to buy it frozen , then the waste would be very high tonnes berthelsen arctic green food " greenland has been on the slippery slope towards commercial whaling for years , and now , demonstrably , they 've crossed the line , " said wspa 's marine mammals manager claire bass .
" the iwc has heard anecdotally about these processing operations , but this is the first time it 's been quantified , so we 're expecting it to be explosive , " she told bbc news vows renewed quotas for the five communities claiming a need for subsistence hunting were renewed at last year 's iwc meeting in anchorage , alaska .
at the time , some delegates queried greenland 's plans to expand its hunt to include bowhead and humpback whales - two species it had not previously targeted - and noted allegations that whalemeat regularly changed hands for money .
the legalities of whaling under the global moratorium on commercial whaling , hunting is conducted in three ways : objection - a country formally objects to the iwc moratorium , declaring itself exempt .
example : norway scientific - a nation issues unilateral ' scientific permits ' ; any iwc member can do this .
example : japan aboriginal - iwc grants permits to indigenous groups for subsistence food .
example : alaskan inupiat iwc rules do not explicitly prohibit commercial trade , but they specify that permits are granted only " to satisfy aboriginal subsistence need " .
delegates eventually voted to allow the bowhead quota , but rejected the request for humpbacks .
denmark , which speaks for greenland in the iwc , is bidding for humpbacks again this year .
over the last 12 months , wspa visited markets and harbours around greenland .
investigators posed as a documentary film crew reporting on local traditions and culture .
they concluded that at least a quarter of the whalemeat landed around the coasts was traded through a single company , arctic green food , with supermarkets the principal destination .
the company advertises packets of whalemeat for sale within greenland on its website .
products include steak , mince , salted blubber , and cuts from the fins and tails of minke whales , as well as unspecified meat from fin whales .
tonnes berthelsen , managing director of arctic green food , told bbc news his company traded meat from about 40 whales each year .
" we 're selling it frozen ; and if we did n't sell it like that , if people were n't able to buy it frozen , then the waste would be very high . "
but whereas the iwc says that " the meat and products are to be used exclusively for local consumption " , wspa points out that because the meat is sold in supermarkets , anyone can buy and consume it , even foreign nationals , raising the question of whether there is a genuine nutritional and cultural need .
broken record wspa is one of the few groups to campaign against subsistence whaling .
cultural claim to whale hunting the majority of conservation organisations support it as providing a sustainable resource to communities that need the meat .
there was a tacit agreement among anti-whaling ngos not to oppose the renewal of subsistence quotas at last year 's iwc meeting , an agreement that wspa did not support on animal welfare grounds .
" the record of these hunts is really bad , " said ms bass .
" only one in five whales dies within a minute .
these are the worst whale hunts in the world on welfare grounds . "
records submitted to the iwc show that in 2006 , fin whales took on average 35 minutes to die , with one taking nearly six hours .
norway 's overtly commercial hunters , by contrast , kill the majority of their prey within one minute .
the iwc 's various committees are coming to the end of their series of meetings in santiago before the full organisation convenes on monday .
its week-long meeting is likely to be dominated by south american proposals for a whale sanctuary in the south atlantic , and by discussions on whether pro- and anti-whaling blocs can find a path towards eventual compromise .

the national cancer intelligence network -lrb- ncin -rrb- looked at data from 2005 , and found death rates in the north were around 20 % higher .
cancer deaths were lowest in the south and midlands .
experts believe higher smoking rates in the north could be the major factor - but not the only one - behind the stark north-south divide .
report findings highest death rate for cervical cancer - almost five women in every 100,000 - was in merseyside and cheshire in contrast , in the mount vernon cancer network , covering hertforshire , south bedfordshire and parts of buckinghamshire , the cervical cancer death rate was just one in 100,000 surrey , west sussex and hampshire recorded the highest level of testicular cancer - almost 11 men in every 100,000 north east london recorded the lowest rate of both testicular and prostate cancer merseyside and cheshire also recorded the highest death rate for oesophageal cancer - 17 people in every 100,000 .
the lowest death rate for the disease was recorded in west london cases of stomach cancer in the north of england were double those in the west and north of london lung cancer , which is overwhelmingly associated with tobacco smoking , is the biggest cause of cancer death in men across england .
the figures show that 68 per 100,000 men in the north of england cancer network died from lung cancer in 2005 , compared with the england average of 51 .
in contrast , the surrey , west sussex and hampshire cancer network had the lowest rate of deaths from lung cancer , with around 36 men in every 100,000 dying from the disease .
among men , the most commonly diagnosed form of the disease was prostate cancer , with an average of 97 men per 100,000 being diagnosed in 2005 .
however , there was no clear regional difference in the pattern of diagnosis .
experts believe that greater awareness of prostate cancer may be partly responsible for the increase in diagnoses .
breast cancer in women , breast cancer was the most commonly diagnosed cancer in every cancer network , with rates higher in the south .
the highest rate of fatal cases was reported in dorset , with almost 52 women in every 100,000 dying from the disease .
it is thought that breast cancer rates may be higher in the south because affluent women tend to delay having children .
however , rates of lung cancer in women were higher in the north .
researcher professor david forman , from the university of leeds , said : " these figures show us that some of the past trends are n't changing - cancer death rates remain higher in the north than the rest of england .
" smoking is responsible for nearly nine in ten cases of lung cancer .
more people in the north smoke , and this explains why lung cancer rates are so much higher .
" there are also higher levels of deprivation in the north , which could contribute to cancer risk through other means - we know that deprivation is linked to later diagnosis , which can affect mortality . "
a department of health spokeswoman said tackling health inequalities was a top priority of the government 's cancer reform strategy , and a national cancer equality initative had been set up to address the issue .
local targets would be established to cut cancer deaths in every cancer network area by 2012 .
the ncin is a new project that will bring together up to 22 million nhs cancer records from the 30 cancer networks in england to create the world 's largest patient-based cancer data .
it will initially focus on england but with a view to include information from across wales , scotland and northern ireland .
professor sir alex markham , ncin chair , said : " data like this are vitally important if we are to work out why there are variations across the country in the chances of getting and dying from cancer , and how to tackle this . "

the national cancer intelligence network -lrb- ncin -rrb- looked at data from 2005 , and found death rates in the north were around 20 % higher .
cancer deaths were lowest in the south and midlands .
experts believe higher smoking rates in the north could be the major factor - but not the only one - behind the stark north-south divide .
report findings highest death rate for cervical cancer - almost five women in every 100,000 - was in merseyside and cheshire in contrast , in the mount vernon cancer network , covering hertforshire , south bedfordshire and parts of buckinghamshire , the cervical cancer death rate was just one in 100,000 surrey , west sussex and hampshire recorded the highest level of testicular cancer - almost 11 men in every 100,000 north east london recorded the lowest rate of both testicular and prostate cancer merseyside and cheshire also recorded the highest death rate for oesophageal cancer - 17 people in every 100,000 .
the lowest death rate for the disease was recorded in west london cases of stomach cancer in the north of england were double those in the west and north of london lung cancer , which is overwhelmingly associated with tobacco smoking , is the biggest cause of cancer death in men across england .
the figures show that 68 per 100,000 men in the north of england cancer network died from lung cancer in 2005 , compared with the england average of 51 .
in contrast , the surrey , west sussex and hampshire cancer network had the lowest rate of deaths from lung cancer , with around 36 men in every 100,000 dying from the disease .
among men , the most commonly diagnosed form of the disease was prostate cancer , with an average of 97 men per 100,000 being diagnosed in 2005 .
however , there was no clear regional difference in the pattern of diagnosis .
experts believe that greater awareness of prostate cancer may be partly responsible for the increase in diagnoses .
breast cancer in women , breast cancer was the most commonly diagnosed cancer in every cancer network , with rates higher in the south .
the highest rate of fatal cases was reported in dorset , with almost 52 women in every 100,000 dying from the disease .
it is thought that breast cancer rates may be higher in the south because affluent women tend to delay having children .
however , rates of lung cancer in women were higher in the north .
