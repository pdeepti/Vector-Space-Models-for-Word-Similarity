the case relates to the killing of 203 civilians near civitella , a town in italy 's central apennine mountain region , on june 29 , 1944 .
the rome-based court 's ruling came following a hearing in which a lawyer representing germany , augusto dossena , stated that his client was exempt from such payments under agreements signed by the rome and berlin governments in 1947 and 1961 .
" germany does not question the responsibility of its soldiers and officers who tarnished themselves with ferocious war crimes , " said dossena , who , according to the ansa news agency , also explained that berlin has made past payments amounting to 800,000 euros -lrb- $ 1.07 million -rrb- in connection with the civitella massacre .
but dossena said ordering germany to pay damages would violate international agreements and pave the way for thousands of people to seek war crime compensation on an individual basis . dpa news agency -lrb- th -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

engineers and health care workers are in high demand . in a bid to attract high-skilled workers from developing countries , the european union will push forward a blue card scheme , an eu official told reuters news agency .
the blue card , which will be good for up to four years , will speed up the application process and make it easier for workers to bring families , get housing and acquire long-term resident status .
the eu hopes that the coordinated system for allocating work permits will allow the eu to compete with other western countries for educated migrants such as technology workers and hospital staff .
as europe grows older , the shortage of skilled professionals is expected to increase .
currently , skilled workers make up less than 2 percent of migrants in the eu .
that 's compared with 10 percent of migrants in australia , 7.3 percent in canada and 3.2 percent in the united states , according to eu data .
restrictions on placement the blue card would allow an immigrant to work in one eu country .
after the first 18 months , the worker could then move to another country , but would still have to apply for a new blue card within a month of arrival .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany , like other eu countries , is short on engineers some say that these limitations , insisted on by countries such as germany , will make the scheme less attractive as the card will not allow blue card job seekers to move freely within the eu .
" it is clearly a step in the right direction but i do n't expect it to be a big success because if you compare it to the united states , a similar title gives access to the whole us market , " jakob von weizsaecker , a german labor market specialist with the brussels-based bruegel economic policy think tank told reuters .
eu ministers are expected to endorse the blue card scheme before the end of 2008 and it will then come into force by mid-2010 .
new eu countries such as the czech republic insisted on the delay , since their own citizens are not yet allowed to work in all eu countries . dw staff -lrb- th -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

22 .
she said she wants the summit to lift the country out of its learning rut . prize-winning economist and education researcher ludger woessmann , of the ifo institute in munich , argued that a radical change toward increased competition is the best way to offer a broader array of students a more even shot at education .
he added that fairness dictates that university students help pay their own way . dw-world : is this education summit a serious effort toward policy change , or more of a political gambit on the part of angela merkel ? ludger woessmann : initially , chancellor merkel raised a lot of expectations , and i think she honestly wanted to achieve something at the summit .
but it is becoming more obvious that there wo n't be any huge results that come out of it .
it 's a big disappointment . why do you say that ? at first she said that education is the key precondition to equality in our social market economy , and that she would make education her priority .
the fact is that in germany , more than in almost any other western country , education is tied to social background .
so fixing education is the key to allowing everyone to accept and participate in the social market economy . now it seems the heads of the -lrb- individual german states -rrb- have called her back to reality .
according to the constitution , the federal government has basically no say at all in education topics .
it is the business of the states .
and they are just playing political games to make sure the federal government does n't get any influence . what kind of influence should the federal government have ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german education is free - and classes are full i think it would be important to have a federal school evaluation system , as a first step to see how each state has performed .
it would make them accountable for what they do , and would create huge incentives to do better , to try harder .
it would put politicians under pressure to perform . basically there are two problems that need to be dealt with : one is that we do a pretty mediocre job on international comparative tests like pisa -lrb- an international , triennial study that compares the high-school students ' abilities - eds -rrb- .
the other problem is that education results are so strongly tied to family background . so how should the government - federal or state - deal with these problems ? i think more autonomy for individual schools is needed .
at the moment public schools have no autonomy in choosing their own staff .
teachers are largely assigned by central bureaucracies .
and there is clear evidence that that holds back the quality of education . more generally , i think something that would lead the way forward would be to create more choice and competition between schools by setting private schools on the same funding level as public schools . you mean switching to a system that the us would call charter schools ? not really .
charter schools in the us are just public schools that have more autonomy .
i am talking here about , maybe , church-run schools .
you have to remember that we do n't have the separation of church and state that the us has in terms of accepting funding . what we have seen empirically is that school systems perform best when schools are financed by the states , using little private funding , but operated largely by private initiatives . the model is a system like the netherlands , where three-quarters of students go to schools that are not operated by the state , but mostly by churches and other charities .
these schools benefit the low income children the most .
it gives them the opportunity to attend privately operated schools regardless of how much money the parents have . they are rare , but there are a few private schools in germany . right - and that is the problem .
because what we see in international comparisons is that systematically , students perform better in countries that build more on private school operations .
not private funding , but operations . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : woessmann eyes education 's economic impact in the netherlands ... the schools are all funded in the same way , and they get exactly the same amount of money per student as the public school gets .
that creates choice for parents .
it makes schools start to compete with each other in a way that helps students . and what do you see as a remedy for the problem of socio-economic bias ? one thing is clear that the early tracking of students into different types of schools at such an early age - right now they are tracked at age 10 , in the fourth grade - decreases the quality of performance in germany .
we can systematically see that this tracking does nothing to improve performance .
it just makes outcomes more strongly dependent on family background . we should delay the tracking , and reduce the tracking into just two levels , if at all .
but this is such a politically charged topic in germany that they wo n't even dare to discuss it at the summit . the subject of educational tracking is a real political hot potato and has been for years .
what are the chances it is changed ? it has been debated since the 70s .
and it divides people along party lines .
it is one of those things where the federalist structure of germany makes any big , sweeping change impossible . is there anything you think will , in fact , be dealt with at the summit ? well , the final thing that research tells us would actually increase opportunity and performance in general is to put more focus on early childhood education .
it is something germany has slowly moved into , and will probably be discussed at the summit .
but i don ’ t expect there will be any big news . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : low-income kids often get a worse start in germany right now , germany focuses on providing child care instead of early education per se - there is hardly any educational content in the preschool programs .
but more and more people are becoming aware of how important it is to introduce learning and educational goals at an early age .
it would help people who do n't have an educational environment at home . a recent oecd study shows low rates of university attendance in germany compared with elsewhere in europe .
what is behind that ? part of it is definitely due to this problem of early tracking .
it makes sure that a lot of very bright children from low socioeconomic backgrounds do not go into the " gymnasium , " the one track that leads straight to university . another is that we have a very strong vocational education system .
historically , more than half the students in each grade would go into the apprenticeship track . but a lot of people have not realized that the world has changed .
the vocational system is n't as safe and lucrative as it once was , because of globalization .
a lot of the medium-skilled jobs are outsourced into eastern europe or asia . german universities used to be free of charge , but recently some states introduced tuition fees .
some people are arguing that this makes it hard for low-income students to study .
what do you think ? i think that in general it makes a lot of sense to have students pay at least some fees for the university .
at the moment we make parents pay more for their child 's preschool than for a university degree .
this is kind of ridiculous - it is both inefficient and unfair . it is inefficient in the sense that the earlier you invest public money , the higher the returns will be .
so you can actually change the whole track of children 's if you make sure that early on they get a better education . it is unfair because in the current system , you make the state pay for a university education , which at the moment is much more open to children from rich families than from low-income families .
so in a sense , by funding the system with taxes , you are making low-income people pay for the university education of children of rich families . i think what is strongly needed , and what has really been missing , is to accompany these tuition fees - and we are talking about 500 euros per semester , or 1,000 euros per year -lrb- $ 650 or $ 1,300 -rrb- , which is nothing compared to the us or the uk - by easy , income-contingent loans at the same time .
so people could pay back the loans later on , if and when they are successful in the labor market . interview : jennifer abramsohn send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

she said she wants the summit to lift the country out of its learning rut . prize-winning economist and education researcher ludger woessmann , of the ifo institute in munich , argued that a radical change toward increased competition is the best way to offer a broader array of students a more even shot at education .
he added that fairness dictates that university students help pay their own way . dw-world : is this education summit a serious effort toward policy change , or more of a political gambit on the part of angela merkel ? ludger woessmann : initially , chancellor merkel raised a lot of expectations , and i think she honestly wanted to achieve something at the summit .

now the question is : can the two bury the hatchet ? ballack 's broadside came in a newspaper interview , when he was asked about loew 's decision not to play veteran midfielder torsten frings in germany 's recent world cup qualifiers against russia and wales .
" respect and loyalty are the least one can expect as a veteran national player , " the germany captain told the frankfurter allgemeine zeitung .

at the head of his list was former national goalkeeper ollie kahn , who was demoted by loew 's predecessor , juergen klinsmann .

ballack even defended striker kevin kuranyi , whom loew booted out of the squad entirely after kuranyi abandoned the team in response to not being nominated .
" -lsb- kuranyi -rsb- saw that it was going to be very difficult for him , even though he plays year in , year out in the champions league and has been a regular starter for a top bundesliga club for quite some time , " ballack said .

" and i 'm disappointed that he 's trying to affect personnel decisions in this way . "
loew said he had been up front with veteran players about their chances in the national side and insisted that it was up to him as coach to decide who played and who did n't .

now the question is : can the two bury the hatchet ? ballack 's broadside came in a newspaper interview , when he was asked about loew 's decision not to play veteran midfielder torsten frings in germany 's recent world cup qualifiers against russia and wales .
" respect and loyalty are the least one can expect as a veteran national player , " the germany captain told the frankfurter allgemeine zeitung .

the case relates to the killing of 203 civilians near civitella , a town in italy 's central apennine mountain region , on june 29 , 1944 .
the rome-based court 's ruling came following a hearing in which a lawyer representing germany , augusto dossena , stated that his client was exempt from such payments under agreements signed by the rome and berlin governments in 1947 and 1961 .
" germany does not question the responsibility of its soldiers and officers who tarnished themselves with ferocious war crimes , " said dossena , who , according to the ansa news agency , also explained that berlin has made past payments amounting to 800,000 euros -lrb- $ 1.07 million -rrb- in connection with the civitella massacre .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de terrorism -pipe- 22.10.2008 terrorist video highlights threat from fringe islamic converts großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " germany should expect attacks " as long as its soldiers are in afghanistan , breininger said german police said they 've discovered a video by a german convert to radical islamism saying he 's ready to wage jihad in afghanistan .
how typical - and how threatening - are converts like eric breininger ? officials from germany 's federal office of criminal investigation -lrb- bka -rrb- confirmed on wednesday , oct.22 , that the six minute video of breininger , who is wanted as a suspected member of a terrorist group , was indeed genuine .
" we assume that came from the international jihad union -lrb- iju -rrb- , " a bka spokesperson told the dpa news agency .
the iju is a radical islamist organization that originated in uzbekistan and has been linked with attempted terrorist acts in germany four weeks ago , the bka launched a public search for breiniger after rumors surfaced that he was in the balkans and on his way back to germany . but they withdrew the warning over the weekend .
also on wednesday , oct 22 , the police also arrested the younger brother of one of three men accused of planning attacks last year on us citizens and interests using chemical-filled drums , the 21-year-old turk , named only as burhan y. , was arrested at langen south of frankfurt and is a suspected helper for the banned iju .
" germany should expect attacks " in the video , the 21-year-old breininger discussed his whereabouts and motivation .
" i am located in afghanistan and am not personally planning an attack on germany , " breininger said in the video , before adding : " we declare war on every country that fights alongside america against muslims . "
but breininger also said that as long as german soldiers are in afghanistan and uzbekistan , “ germany should expect attacks , " without giving any further details .
shown in the video wearing a turban and carrying a kalashnikov , breininger hinted that he may be preparing to sacrifice his life for his cause .
" if allah wishes , he will call me to him as a jidhadi , " he said .
so how did a young man from a suburban town in southern germany become a fanatic apparently willing to die for his religious beliefs in afghanistan ?
fateful turn bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a poster published by germany 's federal office of criminal investigation shows eric breininger according to various reports in the german media , breininger 's parents divorced when he was an adolescent , and he reportedly started using hashish and alcohol at a relatively early age .
he was prone to getting into fights and had trouble with the police .
in late 2006 , breininger got a job for a package-delivery company , where he met a pakistani who got him interested in radical islam .
a short time later , he also became friends with a radical islamic convert named daniel schneider .
breininger began calling himself abdul ghaffar el almani , avoiding his old friends and burning his cds .
he swore off drugs and alcohol .
he married in a mosque , and his wife eva p. wore a veil .
the marriage was short-lived .
" he wanted me to clean and cook and said he was looking for another woman , " eva p. later said in a television interview .
in june 2007 , breininger sold off most of his belongings on ebay , saying he wanted to go abroad and learn arabic , and moved in with schneider .
in september , schneider , who had relocated to the western german region of sauerland , was arrested along with two other suspected islamists for allegedly trying to make car bombs and planning attacks on us targets in germany .
breininger disappeared before police could detain him .
police suspect breininger has since received training in a terrorist camp , possibly in pakistan .
both german and american military forces in afghanistan are reported to have distributed pictures of him , warning that he is a potential suicide attacker .
how big a danger ?
the breininger case raises the question of how great a threat german converts to islam pose .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : police arrested a suspected member of the so-called " sauerland terror group " last year " converts can be more easily radicalized , " kai hirschmann of germany 's institute for terrorism research and study told a internet news site around the time of scheider 's arrest .
" as ' novices ' they try to be more religious than even the religious leaders , " hirschmann added .
" that often makes them especially fanatical and also especially dangerous . "
other experts , however , disagree with that assessment .
" you ca n't say that conversion to islam carries an explicit tendency toward becoming a radical , " stefan reichmuth , professor of islamic studies at the university of bochum told dw-world.de. estimates of the number of german converts to islam range between 15,000 and 80,000 .
but germany 's muslim league says that , of them , only about 25 fit the description of being radical or dangerously fanatic .
germany , which opposed the 2003 us-led invasion of iraq and has more than 3,000 troops in afghanistan under nato command , has tightened security and surveillance in response to the threat of attacks by islamic extremists .
the closest germany came to an attack was in july 2006 when suitcases containing homemade bombs were placed on two regional trains passing through cologne 's busy main train station .
they failed to detonate .
the september 11 , 2001 attacks on the united states were planned by an al-qaeda cell in the northern german city of hamburg led by mohammed atta , one of the hijackers of the planes involved in the attacks . dw staff -lrb- jc -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the iju is a radical islamist organization that originated in uzbekistan and has been linked with attempted terrorist acts in germany four weeks ago , the bka launched a public search for breiniger after rumors surfaced that he was in the balkans and on his way back to germany . but they withdrew the warning over the weekend .
also on wednesday , oct 22 , the police also arrested the younger brother of one of three men accused of planning attacks last year on us citizens and interests using chemical-filled drums , the 21-year-old turk , named only as burhan y. , was arrested at langen south of frankfurt and is a suspected helper for the banned iju .
" germany should expect attacks " in the video , the 21-year-old breininger discussed his whereabouts and motivation .
" i am located in afghanistan and am not personally planning an attack on germany , " breininger said in the video , before adding : " we declare war on every country that fights alongside america against muslims . "
but breininger also said that as long as german soldiers are in afghanistan and uzbekistan , “ germany should expect attacks , " without giving any further details .
shown in the video wearing a turban and carrying a kalashnikov , breininger hinted that he may be preparing to sacrifice his life for his cause .
" if allah wishes , he will call me to him as a jidhadi , " he said .
so how did a young man from a suburban town in southern germany become a fanatic apparently willing to die for his religious beliefs in afghanistan ?
fateful turn bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a poster published by germany 's federal office of criminal investigation shows eric breininger according to various reports in the german media , breininger 's parents divorced when he was an adolescent , and he reportedly started using hashish and alcohol at a relatively early age .
he was prone to getting into fights and had trouble with the police .
in late 2006 , breininger got a job for a package-delivery company , where he met a pakistani who got him interested in radical islam .
a short time later , he also became friends with a radical islamic convert named daniel schneider .
breininger began calling himself abdul ghaffar el almani , avoiding his old friends and burning his cds .
he swore off drugs and alcohol .
he married in a mosque , and his wife eva p. wore a veil .
the marriage was short-lived .
" he wanted me to clean and cook and said he was looking for another woman , " eva p. later said in a television interview .
in june 2007 , breininger sold off most of his belongings on ebay , saying he wanted to go abroad and learn arabic , and moved in with schneider .
in september , schneider , who had relocated to the western german region of sauerland , was arrested along with two other suspected islamists for allegedly trying to make car bombs and planning attacks on us targets in germany .
breininger disappeared before police could detain him .
police suspect breininger has since received training in a terrorist camp , possibly in pakistan .
both german and american military forces in afghanistan are reported to have distributed pictures of him , warning that he is a potential suicide attacker .
how big a danger ?
the breininger case raises the question of how great a threat german converts to islam pose .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : police arrested a suspected member of the so-called " sauerland terror group " last year " converts can be more easily radicalized , " kai hirschmann of germany 's institute for terrorism research and study told a internet news site around the time of scheider 's arrest .
" as ' novices ' they try to be more religious than even the religious leaders , " hirschmann added .
" that often makes them especially fanatical and also especially dangerous . "
other experts , however , disagree with that assessment .
" you ca n't say that conversion to islam carries an explicit tendency toward becoming a radical , " stefan reichmuth , professor of islamic studies at the university of bochum told dw-world.de. estimates of the number of german converts to islam range between 15,000 and 80,000 .
but germany 's muslim league says that , of them , only about 25 fit the description of being radical or dangerously fanatic .
germany , which opposed the 2003 us-led invasion of iraq and has more than 3,000 troops in afghanistan under nato command , has tightened security and surveillance in response to the threat of attacks by islamic extremists .
the closest germany came to an attack was in july 2006 when suitcases containing homemade bombs were placed on two regional trains passing through cologne 's busy main train station .
they failed to detonate .

now the question is : can the two bury the hatchet ? ballack 's broadside came in a newspaper interview , when he was asked about loew 's decision not to play veteran midfielder torsten frings in germany 's recent world cup qualifiers against russia and wales .
" respect and loyalty are the least one can expect as a veteran national player , " the germany captain told the frankfurter allgemeine zeitung .
ballack went on to name other examples of players he felt were squeezed out of the team without being given a fair chance .
at the head of his list was former national goalkeeper ollie kahn , who was demoted by loew 's predecessor , juergen klinsmann .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : frings has recently had an unwelcome new role in loew 's squad " a competition with jens lehmann was proclaimed that , to my eyes , he could n't win , " ballack said .
" the same was true with -lsb- defender -rsb- christian woerns who , in contrast to christoph metzelder , stayed true to one team and was n't sitting on the bench . "
ballack even defended striker kevin kuranyi , whom loew booted out of the squad entirely after kuranyi abandoned the team in response to not being nominated .
" -lsb- kuranyi -rsb- saw that it was going to be very difficult for him , even though he plays year in , year out in the champions league and has been a regular starter for a top bundesliga club for quite some time , " ballack said .
" those are important criteria for the national team , " the germany captain added .
" where will we end up if things like that no longer count ? "
surprise and disappointment bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the hero of germany 's recent win over wales was 24-year-old piotr trochowski loew seemed to be taken off guard by the verbal blasts from his most important player and representative on the pitch .
" i 'm fundamentally surprised that he chose to go public like this , " loew told the daily bild newspaper .
" and i 'm disappointed that he 's trying to affect personnel decisions in this way . "
loew said he had been up front with veteran players about their chances in the national side and insisted that it was up to him as coach to decide who played and who did n't .
loew stressed that he still wants ballack as team captain and would try to work through their differences .
but the coach admitted he did n't know precisely how or when to approach his angry star .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : kuranyi has almost certainly played his last match for loew " i want to think about the form in which i 'll talk to michael , " loew said .
" on principle i do n't tolerate interference .
but there will be a discussion .
not a few days from now , but very soon . "
the outcome of that chat may determine whether ballack is nominated for germany 's upcoming friendly against england .
" all our players know the rules concerning public criticism , " loew said .
bosses back loew bildunterschrift : ballack also feuded with germany team manager oliver bierhoff at euro 2008 germany 's football functionaries were quick to back the coach .
" this constant complaining ! " said german soccer association vice-president and soccer legend frank beckenbauer in a television interview .
" they 've become a pack of wimps - unbelievable !
they should shut their mouths and play soccer . "
german soccer association president theo zwanziger seconded those sentiments .
" i 'm disappointed by michael ballack 's behavior , " zwanziger said .
" this has created a difficult and complicated situation . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ballack will likely only see a yellow card for his latest ourburst zwanziger also stressed that germany under loew was headed in the right direction .
" the development of our national team over the past few years has been absolutely positive so i do n't understand at all why there should be criticism of joachim loew coming from the team via the media , " zwanziger said .
but while germany could thrive without players like frings and kuranyi , there is little question that the national side needs ballack , its on-the-field leader and most technically gifted player .
so loew may have no other choice but to forgive , or simply ignore , ballack 's attacks . dw staff -lrb- jc -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

how typical - and how threatening - are converts like eric breininger ? officials from germany 's federal office of criminal investigation -lrb- bka -rrb- confirmed on wednesday , oct.22 , that the six minute video of breininger , who is wanted as a suspected member of a terrorist group , was indeed genuine .
" we assume that came from the international jihad union -lrb- iju -rrb- , " a bka spokesperson told the dpa news agency .
the iju is a radical islamist organization that originated in uzbekistan and has been linked with attempted terrorist acts in germany four weeks ago , the bka launched a public search for breiniger after rumors surfaced that he was in the balkans and on his way back to germany . but they withdrew the warning over the weekend .
also on wednesday , oct 22 , the police also arrested the younger brother of one of three men accused of planning attacks last year on us citizens and interests using chemical-filled drums , the 21-year-old turk , named only as burhan y. , was arrested at langen south of frankfurt and is a suspected helper for the banned iju .
" germany should expect attacks " in the video , the 21-year-old breininger discussed his whereabouts and motivation .
" i am located in afghanistan and am not personally planning an attack on germany , " breininger said in the video , before adding : " we declare war on every country that fights alongside america against muslims . "
but breininger also said that as long as german soldiers are in afghanistan and uzbekistan , “ germany should expect attacks , " without giving any further details .
shown in the video wearing a turban and carrying a kalashnikov , breininger hinted that he may be preparing to sacrifice his life for his cause .
" if allah wishes , he will call me to him as a jidhadi , " he said .
so how did a young man from a suburban town in southern germany become a fanatic apparently willing to die for his religious beliefs in afghanistan ?
fateful turn bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a poster published by germany 's federal office of criminal investigation shows eric breininger according to various reports in the german media , breininger 's parents divorced when he was an adolescent , and he reportedly started using hashish and alcohol at a relatively early age .
he was prone to getting into fights and had trouble with the police .
in late 2006 , breininger got a job for a package-delivery company , where he met a pakistani who got him interested in radical islam .
a short time later , he also became friends with a radical islamic convert named daniel schneider .
breininger began calling himself abdul ghaffar el almani , avoiding his old friends and burning his cds .
he swore off drugs and alcohol .
he married in a mosque , and his wife eva p. wore a veil .
the marriage was short-lived .
" he wanted me to clean and cook and said he was looking for another woman , " eva p. later said in a television interview .
in june 2007 , breininger sold off most of his belongings on ebay , saying he wanted to go abroad and learn arabic , and moved in with schneider .
in september , schneider , who had relocated to the western german region of sauerland , was arrested along with two other suspected islamists for allegedly trying to make car bombs and planning attacks on us targets in germany .
breininger disappeared before police could detain him .
police suspect breininger has since received training in a terrorist camp , possibly in pakistan .
both german and american military forces in afghanistan are reported to have distributed pictures of him , warning that he is a potential suicide attacker .
how big a danger ?
the breininger case raises the question of how great a threat german converts to islam pose .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : police arrested a suspected member of the so-called " sauerland terror group " last year " converts can be more easily radicalized , " kai hirschmann of germany 's institute for terrorism research and study told a internet news site around the time of scheider 's arrest .
" as ' novices ' they try to be more religious than even the religious leaders , " hirschmann added .
" that often makes them especially fanatical and also especially dangerous . "
other experts , however , disagree with that assessment .
" you ca n't say that conversion to islam carries an explicit tendency toward becoming a radical , " stefan reichmuth , professor of islamic studies at the university of bochum told dw-world.de. estimates of the number of german converts to islam range between 15,000 and 80,000 .
but germany 's muslim league says that , of them , only about 25 fit the description of being radical or dangerously fanatic .
germany , which opposed the 2003 us-led invasion of iraq and has more than 3,000 troops in afghanistan under nato command , has tightened security and surveillance in response to the threat of attacks by islamic extremists .
the closest germany came to an attack was in july 2006 when suitcases containing homemade bombs were placed on two regional trains passing through cologne 's busy main train station .
they failed to detonate .
the september 11 , 2001 attacks on the united states were planned by an al-qaeda cell in the northern german city of hamburg led by mohammed atta , one of the hijackers of the planes involved in the attacks . dw staff -lrb- jc -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the case relates to the killing of 203 civilians near civitella , a town in italy 's central apennine mountain region , on june 29 , 1944 .
the rome-based court 's ruling came following a hearing in which a lawyer representing germany , augusto dossena , stated that his client was exempt from such payments under agreements signed by the rome and berlin governments in 1947 and 1961 .
" germany does not question the responsibility of its soldiers and officers who tarnished themselves with ferocious war crimes , " said dossena , who , according to the ansa news agency , also explained that berlin has made past payments amounting to 800,000 euros -lrb- $ 1.07 million -rrb- in connection with the civitella massacre .

" germany should expect attacks " in the video , the 21-year-old breininger discussed his whereabouts and motivation .
" i am located in afghanistan and am not personally planning an attack on germany , " breininger said in the video , before adding : " we declare war on every country that fights alongside america against muslims . "
but breininger also said that as long as german soldiers are in afghanistan and uzbekistan , “ germany should expect attacks , " without giving any further details .
shown in the video wearing a turban and carrying a kalashnikov , breininger hinted that he may be preparing to sacrifice his life for his cause .
" if allah wishes , he will call me to him as a jidhadi , " he said .
so how did a young man from a suburban town in southern germany become a fanatic apparently willing to die for his religious beliefs in afghanistan ?
fateful turn bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a poster published by germany 's federal office of criminal investigation shows eric breininger according to various reports in the german media , breininger 's parents divorced when he was an adolescent , and he reportedly started using hashish and alcohol at a relatively early age .
he was prone to getting into fights and had trouble with the police .
in late 2006 , breininger got a job for a package-delivery company , where he met a pakistani who got him interested in radical islam .
a short time later , he also became friends with a radical islamic convert named daniel schneider .
breininger began calling himself abdul ghaffar el almani , avoiding his old friends and burning his cds .
he swore off drugs and alcohol .
he married in a mosque , and his wife eva p. wore a veil .
the marriage was short-lived .
" he wanted me to clean and cook and said he was looking for another woman , " eva p. later said in a television interview .
in june 2007 , breininger sold off most of his belongings on ebay , saying he wanted to go abroad and learn arabic , and moved in with schneider .
in september , schneider , who had relocated to the western german region of sauerland , was arrested along with two other suspected islamists for allegedly trying to make car bombs and planning attacks on us targets in germany .
breininger disappeared before police could detain him .
police suspect breininger has since received training in a terrorist camp , possibly in pakistan .
both german and american military forces in afghanistan are reported to have distributed pictures of him , warning that he is a potential suicide attacker .
how big a danger ?
the breininger case raises the question of how great a threat german converts to islam pose .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : police arrested a suspected member of the so-called " sauerland terror group " last year " converts can be more easily radicalized , " kai hirschmann of germany 's institute for terrorism research and study told a internet news site around the time of scheider 's arrest .
" as ' novices ' they try to be more religious than even the religious leaders , " hirschmann added .
" that often makes them especially fanatical and also especially dangerous . "
other experts , however , disagree with that assessment .
" you ca n't say that conversion to islam carries an explicit tendency toward becoming a radical , " stefan reichmuth , professor of islamic studies at the university of bochum told dw-world.de. estimates of the number of german converts to islam range between 15,000 and 80,000 .
but germany 's muslim league says that , of them , only about 25 fit the description of being radical or dangerously fanatic .
germany , which opposed the 2003 us-led invasion of iraq and has more than 3,000 troops in afghanistan under nato command , has tightened security and surveillance in response to the threat of attacks by islamic extremists .
the closest germany came to an attack was in july 2006 when suitcases containing homemade bombs were placed on two regional trains passing through cologne 's busy main train station .
they failed to detonate .
the september 11 , 2001 attacks on the united states were planned by an al-qaeda cell in the northern german city of hamburg led by mohammed atta , one of the hijackers of the planes involved in the attacks . dw staff -lrb- jc -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the board met in munich on tuesday , oct .
21 , and decided to " apply for stabilization measures , " said bavaria 's state finance minister , erwin huber , who heads bayernlb 's governing board .
huber , 62 , announced on wedesday that he is stepping down as finance minister because of the bayernlb debacle .
the southern regional bank is jointly owned by the state of bavaria and regional savings banks .
the bank ran into trouble more than a year ago due to its heavy investment in asset-backed securities .
these securities lost much of their value when the us market for high-risk mortgages collapsed in 2007 .
as the bank was recovering from this loss , it was hit a second time when interbank loans dried up in mid-september .
in addition , german regional bank westlb is reportedly also eyeing the government bank rescue plan . separately , german police led by prosecutors searched the offices of the federally owned kfw bank wednesday .
this action was part of an investigation into the transfer of 319 million euros to us bank lehman brothers , the day after the financial crisis triggered the new york-based financial house 's collapsed .
deal comes with strings attached bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german banks are still trying to find their balance germany 's federal government approved a 500-billion-euro federal rescue package on friday .
germany 's rescue package was similar to measures taken by governments across europe .
on monday , the cabinet finalized the conditions banks must follow if they want to make use of the rescue package .
those conditions include bayernlb limiting executive pay to 500,000 euros .
it will also send any dividend payments to the state .
and the government will get the right to review any lending practices seen as risky .
the bank also has to promise to continue making loans to small- and medium-sized companies .
bayernlb is germany 's second biggest regional bank .
it posted 770 million euros in losses during the first three months of 2008 .
that forced shareholders to come up with 4.8 billion euros in loan guarantees .
the state link allowed regional banks to offer lower credit rates .
when the european commission cut back on that privilege in 2005 , the banks began engaging in risky investments as a way to keep making money .
other banks holding off bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the government has thrown banks a lifeline but the era of the landesbank could be coming to a close , merck finck analyst konrad becker told afp news agency .
" their business model does not work any more , " becker said .
" the era when each state had its own bank is over . "
other landesbanken have not said whether they will also ask for a bailout .
an hsh nordbank spokesman said on tuesday that no decision had been made .
a spokesman for the landesbank berlin said that there were currently no plans to take the rescue package .
other banks were similarly uncommitted , according to afp .
less that one in four germans expressed trust in domestic banks , according to a survey for the frankfurter allgemeine zeitung .
only 52 percent of germans said they trusted the bank in which they had their account . dw staff -lrb- th -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

at the head of his list was former national goalkeeper ollie kahn , who was demoted by loew 's predecessor , juergen klinsmann .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : frings has recently had an unwelcome new role in loew 's squad " a competition with jens lehmann was proclaimed that , to my eyes , he could n't win , " ballack said .
" the same was true with -lsb- defender -rsb- christian woerns who , in contrast to christoph metzelder , stayed true to one team and was n't sitting on the bench . "
ballack even defended striker kevin kuranyi , whom loew booted out of the squad entirely after kuranyi abandoned the team in response to not being nominated .
" -lsb- kuranyi -rsb- saw that it was going to be very difficult for him , even though he plays year in , year out in the champions league and has been a regular starter for a top bundesliga club for quite some time , " ballack said .
" those are important criteria for the national team , " the germany captain added .
" where will we end up if things like that no longer count ? "
surprise and disappointment bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the hero of germany 's recent win over wales was 24-year-old piotr trochowski loew seemed to be taken off guard by the verbal blasts from his most important player and representative on the pitch .
" i 'm fundamentally surprised that he chose to go public like this , " loew told the daily bild newspaper .
" and i 'm disappointed that he 's trying to affect personnel decisions in this way . "
loew said he had been up front with veteran players about their chances in the national side and insisted that it was up to him as coach to decide who played and who did n't .
loew stressed that he still wants ballack as team captain and would try to work through their differences .
but the coach admitted he did n't know precisely how or when to approach his angry star .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : kuranyi has almost certainly played his last match for loew " i want to think about the form in which i 'll talk to michael , " loew said .
" on principle i do n't tolerate interference .
but there will be a discussion .
not a few days from now , but very soon . "
the outcome of that chat may determine whether ballack is nominated for germany 's upcoming friendly against england .
" all our players know the rules concerning public criticism , " loew said .
bosses back loew bildunterschrift : ballack also feuded with germany team manager oliver bierhoff at euro 2008 germany 's football functionaries were quick to back the coach .
" this constant complaining ! " said german soccer association vice-president and soccer legend frank beckenbauer in a television interview .
" they 've become a pack of wimps - unbelievable !
they should shut their mouths and play soccer . "
german soccer association president theo zwanziger seconded those sentiments .
" i 'm disappointed by michael ballack 's behavior , " zwanziger said .
" this has created a difficult and complicated situation . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ballack will likely only see a yellow card for his latest ourburst zwanziger also stressed that germany under loew was headed in the right direction .
" the development of our national team over the past few years has been absolutely positive so i do n't understand at all why there should be criticism of joachim loew coming from the team via the media , " zwanziger said .
but while germany could thrive without players like frings and kuranyi , there is little question that the national side needs ballack , its on-the-field leader and most technically gifted player .
so loew may have no other choice but to forgive , or simply ignore , ballack 's attacks . dw staff -lrb- jc -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

germany 's federal government and the premiers of the country 's 16 states agreed at a one-day education summit in dresden to hugely boost spending on education and research to 10 percent of gross domestic production -lrb- gdp -rrb- by 2015 .
" we recognise that people are the biggest resource we have , " merkel said at a news conference after the " education summit " .
" prosperity for all means education for everyone , " she said .
but a dispute remained over who was to pay : the 16 states or berlin .
long-term unemployment was worst in sections of the population which had not completed schooling , merkel said .
annual oecd reports have criticized german schools for failing the children of the poor and ethnic minorities , even though higher-status children are well educated .
german universities have been criticized for making entry too difficult .
raising education spending to 7 per cent of gdp and research spending to 3 per cent would mean annual increases of between 25 billion and 60 billion euros -lrb- at least $ 32 billion -rrb- , experts said .
the federal government has only limited authority over education , with the states reluctant to give up their powers . dpa news agency -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

22 .
she said she wants the summit to lift the country out of its learning rut . prize-winning economist and education researcher ludger woessmann , of the ifo institute in munich , argued that a radical change toward increased competition is the best way to offer a broader array of students a more even shot at education .
he added that fairness dictates that university students help pay their own way . dw-world : is this education summit a serious effort toward policy change , or more of a political gambit on the part of angela merkel ? ludger woessmann : initially , chancellor merkel raised a lot of expectations , and i think she honestly wanted to achieve something at the summit .
but it is becoming more obvious that there wo n't be any huge results that come out of it .
it 's a big disappointment . why do you say that ? at first she said that education is the key precondition to equality in our social market economy , and that she would make education her priority .
the fact is that in germany , more than in almost any other western country , education is tied to social background .
so fixing education is the key to allowing everyone to accept and participate in the social market economy . now it seems the heads of the -lrb- individual german states -rrb- have called her back to reality .
according to the constitution , the federal government has basically no say at all in education topics .
it is the business of the states .
and they are just playing political games to make sure the federal government does n't get any influence . what kind of influence should the federal government have ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german education is free - and classes are full i think it would be important to have a federal school evaluation system , as a first step to see how each state has performed .
it would make them accountable for what they do , and would create huge incentives to do better , to try harder .
it would put politicians under pressure to perform . basically there are two problems that need to be dealt with : one is that we do a pretty mediocre job on international comparative tests like pisa -lrb- an international , triennial study that compares the high-school students ' abilities - eds -rrb- .
the other problem is that education results are so strongly tied to family background . so how should the government - federal or state - deal with these problems ? i think more autonomy for individual schools is needed .
at the moment public schools have no autonomy in choosing their own staff .
teachers are largely assigned by central bureaucracies .
and there is clear evidence that that holds back the quality of education . more generally , i think something that would lead the way forward would be to create more choice and competition between schools by setting private schools on the same funding level as public schools . you mean switching to a system that the us would call charter schools ? not really .
charter schools in the us are just public schools that have more autonomy .
i am talking here about , maybe , church-run schools .
you have to remember that we do n't have the separation of church and state that the us has in terms of accepting funding . what we have seen empirically is that school systems perform best when schools are financed by the states , using little private funding , but operated largely by private initiatives . the model is a system like the netherlands , where three-quarters of students go to schools that are not operated by the state , but mostly by churches and other charities .
these schools benefit the low income children the most .
it gives them the opportunity to attend privately operated schools regardless of how much money the parents have . they are rare , but there are a few private schools in germany . right - and that is the problem .
because what we see in international comparisons is that systematically , students perform better in countries that build more on private school operations .
not private funding , but operations . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : woessmann eyes education 's economic impact in the netherlands ... the schools are all funded in the same way , and they get exactly the same amount of money per student as the public school gets .
that creates choice for parents .
it makes schools start to compete with each other in a way that helps students . and what do you see as a remedy for the problem of socio-economic bias ? one thing is clear that the early tracking of students into different types of schools at such an early age - right now they are tracked at age 10 , in the fourth grade - decreases the quality of performance in germany .
we can systematically see that this tracking does nothing to improve performance .
it just makes outcomes more strongly dependent on family background . we should delay the tracking , and reduce the tracking into just two levels , if at all .
but this is such a politically charged topic in germany that they wo n't even dare to discuss it at the summit . the subject of educational tracking is a real political hot potato and has been for years .
what are the chances it is changed ? it has been debated since the 70s .
and it divides people along party lines .
it is one of those things where the federalist structure of germany makes any big , sweeping change impossible . is there anything you think will , in fact , be dealt with at the summit ? well , the final thing that research tells us would actually increase opportunity and performance in general is to put more focus on early childhood education .
it is something germany has slowly moved into , and will probably be discussed at the summit .
but i don ’ t expect there will be any big news . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : low-income kids often get a worse start in germany right now , germany focuses on providing child care instead of early education per se - there is hardly any educational content in the preschool programs .
but more and more people are becoming aware of how important it is to introduce learning and educational goals at an early age .
it would help people who do n't have an educational environment at home . a recent oecd study shows low rates of university attendance in germany compared with elsewhere in europe .
what is behind that ? part of it is definitely due to this problem of early tracking .
it makes sure that a lot of very bright children from low socioeconomic backgrounds do not go into the " gymnasium , " the one track that leads straight to university . another is that we have a very strong vocational education system .
historically , more than half the students in each grade would go into the apprenticeship track . but a lot of people have not realized that the world has changed .
the vocational system is n't as safe and lucrative as it once was , because of globalization .
a lot of the medium-skilled jobs are outsourced into eastern europe or asia . german universities used to be free of charge , but recently some states introduced tuition fees .
some people are arguing that this makes it hard for low-income students to study .
what do you think ? i think that in general it makes a lot of sense to have students pay at least some fees for the university .
at the moment we make parents pay more for their child 's preschool than for a university degree .
this is kind of ridiculous - it is both inefficient and unfair . it is inefficient in the sense that the earlier you invest public money , the higher the returns will be .
so you can actually change the whole track of children 's if you make sure that early on they get a better education . it is unfair because in the current system , you make the state pay for a university education , which at the moment is much more open to children from rich families than from low-income families .
so in a sense , by funding the system with taxes , you are making low-income people pay for the university education of children of rich families . i think what is strongly needed , and what has really been missing , is to accompany these tuition fees - and we are talking about 500 euros per semester , or 1,000 euros per year -lrb- $ 650 or $ 1,300 -rrb- , which is nothing compared to the us or the uk - by easy , income-contingent loans at the same time .
so people could pay back the loans later on , if and when they are successful in the labor market . interview : jennifer abramsohn send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the board met in munich on tuesday , oct .
21 , and decided to " apply for stabilization measures , " said bavaria 's state finance minister , erwin huber , who heads bayernlb 's governing board .
huber , 62 , announced on wedesday that he is stepping down as finance minister because of the bayernlb debacle .
the southern regional bank is jointly owned by the state of bavaria and regional savings banks .
the bank ran into trouble more than a year ago due to its heavy investment in asset-backed securities .
these securities lost much of their value when the us market for high-risk mortgages collapsed in 2007 .

22 .
she said she wants the summit to lift the country out of its learning rut . prize-winning economist and education researcher ludger woessmann , of the ifo institute in munich , argued that a radical change toward increased competition is the best way to offer a broader array of students a more even shot at education .
he added that fairness dictates that university students help pay their own way . dw-world : is this education summit a serious effort toward policy change , or more of a political gambit on the part of angela merkel ? ludger woessmann : initially , chancellor merkel raised a lot of expectations , and i think she honestly wanted to achieve something at the summit .
but it is becoming more obvious that there wo n't be any huge results that come out of it .
it 's a big disappointment . why do you say that ? at first she said that education is the key precondition to equality in our social market economy , and that she would make education her priority .
the fact is that in germany , more than in almost any other western country , education is tied to social background .
so fixing education is the key to allowing everyone to accept and participate in the social market economy . now it seems the heads of the -lrb- individual german states -rrb- have called her back to reality .
according to the constitution , the federal government has basically no say at all in education topics .
it is the business of the states .
and they are just playing political games to make sure the federal government does n't get any influence . what kind of influence should the federal government have ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german education is free - and classes are full i think it would be important to have a federal school evaluation system , as a first step to see how each state has performed .
it would make them accountable for what they do , and would create huge incentives to do better , to try harder .
it would put politicians under pressure to perform . basically there are two problems that need to be dealt with : one is that we do a pretty mediocre job on international comparative tests like pisa -lrb- an international , triennial study that compares the high-school students ' abilities - eds -rrb- .
the other problem is that education results are so strongly tied to family background . so how should the government - federal or state - deal with these problems ? i think more autonomy for individual schools is needed .
at the moment public schools have no autonomy in choosing their own staff .
teachers are largely assigned by central bureaucracies .
and there is clear evidence that that holds back the quality of education . more generally , i think something that would lead the way forward would be to create more choice and competition between schools by setting private schools on the same funding level as public schools . you mean switching to a system that the us would call charter schools ? not really .
charter schools in the us are just public schools that have more autonomy .
i am talking here about , maybe , church-run schools .
you have to remember that we do n't have the separation of church and state that the us has in terms of accepting funding . what we have seen empirically is that school systems perform best when schools are financed by the states , using little private funding , but operated largely by private initiatives . the model is a system like the netherlands , where three-quarters of students go to schools that are not operated by the state , but mostly by churches and other charities .
these schools benefit the low income children the most .
it gives them the opportunity to attend privately operated schools regardless of how much money the parents have . they are rare , but there are a few private schools in germany . right - and that is the problem .
because what we see in international comparisons is that systematically , students perform better in countries that build more on private school operations .
not private funding , but operations . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : woessmann eyes education 's economic impact in the netherlands ... the schools are all funded in the same way , and they get exactly the same amount of money per student as the public school gets .
that creates choice for parents .
it makes schools start to compete with each other in a way that helps students . and what do you see as a remedy for the problem of socio-economic bias ? one thing is clear that the early tracking of students into different types of schools at such an early age - right now they are tracked at age 10 , in the fourth grade - decreases the quality of performance in germany .
we can systematically see that this tracking does nothing to improve performance .
it just makes outcomes more strongly dependent on family background . we should delay the tracking , and reduce the tracking into just two levels , if at all .
but this is such a politically charged topic in germany that they wo n't even dare to discuss it at the summit . the subject of educational tracking is a real political hot potato and has been for years .
what are the chances it is changed ? it has been debated since the 70s .
and it divides people along party lines .
it is one of those things where the federalist structure of germany makes any big , sweeping change impossible . is there anything you think will , in fact , be dealt with at the summit ? well , the final thing that research tells us would actually increase opportunity and performance in general is to put more focus on early childhood education .
it is something germany has slowly moved into , and will probably be discussed at the summit .
but i don ’ t expect there will be any big news . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : low-income kids often get a worse start in germany right now , germany focuses on providing child care instead of early education per se - there is hardly any educational content in the preschool programs .
but more and more people are becoming aware of how important it is to introduce learning and educational goals at an early age .
it would help people who do n't have an educational environment at home . a recent oecd study shows low rates of university attendance in germany compared with elsewhere in europe .
what is behind that ? part of it is definitely due to this problem of early tracking .
it makes sure that a lot of very bright children from low socioeconomic backgrounds do not go into the " gymnasium , " the one track that leads straight to university . another is that we have a very strong vocational education system .
historically , more than half the students in each grade would go into the apprenticeship track . but a lot of people have not realized that the world has changed .
the vocational system is n't as safe and lucrative as it once was , because of globalization .
a lot of the medium-skilled jobs are outsourced into eastern europe or asia . german universities used to be free of charge , but recently some states introduced tuition fees .
some people are arguing that this makes it hard for low-income students to study .
what do you think ? i think that in general it makes a lot of sense to have students pay at least some fees for the university .
at the moment we make parents pay more for their child 's preschool than for a university degree .
this is kind of ridiculous - it is both inefficient and unfair . it is inefficient in the sense that the earlier you invest public money , the higher the returns will be .
so you can actually change the whole track of children 's if you make sure that early on they get a better education . it is unfair because in the current system , you make the state pay for a university education , which at the moment is much more open to children from rich families than from low-income families .
so in a sense , by funding the system with taxes , you are making low-income people pay for the university education of children of rich families . i think what is strongly needed , and what has really been missing , is to accompany these tuition fees - and we are talking about 500 euros per semester , or 1,000 euros per year -lrb- $ 650 or $ 1,300 -rrb- , which is nothing compared to the us or the uk - by easy , income-contingent loans at the same time .
so people could pay back the loans later on , if and when they are successful in the labor market . interview : jennifer abramsohn send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

22 .
she said she wants the summit to lift the country out of its learning rut . prize-winning economist and education researcher ludger woessmann , of the ifo institute in munich , argued that a radical change toward increased competition is the best way to offer a broader array of students a more even shot at education .
he added that fairness dictates that university students help pay their own way . dw-world : is this education summit a serious effort toward policy change , or more of a political gambit on the part of angela merkel ? ludger woessmann : initially , chancellor merkel raised a lot of expectations , and i think she honestly wanted to achieve something at the summit .
but it is becoming more obvious that there wo n't be any huge results that come out of it .
it 's a big disappointment . why do you say that ? at first she said that education is the key precondition to equality in our social market economy , and that she would make education her priority .
the fact is that in germany , more than in almost any other western country , education is tied to social background .
so fixing education is the key to allowing everyone to accept and participate in the social market economy . now it seems the heads of the -lrb- individual german states -rrb- have called her back to reality .
according to the constitution , the federal government has basically no say at all in education topics .
it is the business of the states .
and they are just playing political games to make sure the federal government does n't get any influence . what kind of influence should the federal government have ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german education is free - and classes are full i think it would be important to have a federal school evaluation system , as a first step to see how each state has performed .
it would make them accountable for what they do , and would create huge incentives to do better , to try harder .
it would put politicians under pressure to perform . basically there are two problems that need to be dealt with : one is that we do a pretty mediocre job on international comparative tests like pisa -lrb- an international , triennial study that compares the high-school students ' abilities - eds -rrb- .
the other problem is that education results are so strongly tied to family background . so how should the government - federal or state - deal with these problems ? i think more autonomy for individual schools is needed .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de georgia -pipe- 22.10.2008 international donors pledge 3.5 billion euros to georgia großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the funds will help rebuild ordinary people 's homes in georgia international donors meeting in brussels on wednesday pledged 3.5 billion euros -lrb- $ 4.5 billion -rrb- to help georgia recover from its war with russia , the eu commission announced wednesday . the higher-than-expected sum , which included 2.8 billion euros of public funding , was described by eu external relations commissioner benita ferrero-waldner as impressive " especially in difficult times . " the total far exceeded the $ 3.2 billion that the world bank had estimated georgia would need to rebuild its infrastructure , settle its refugees and get its economy back on track . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : georgian premier lado gurgenidze was satisfied with the conference 's result georgian prime minister lado gurgenidze , who attended the one-day donor conference in brussels , told reporters afterwards that his country was " deeply moved and humbled by the demonstration of solidarity that we have received . " " $ 4.5 billion far exceeds the expectations that we had ... at a time like this to show such support is something that no georgian will ever forget , " gurgenidze said . us the biggest donor the united states , which pledged a billion dollars over three years , was the biggest donor at the meeting of 67 nations and major financial institutions , followed by substantial donations from the european commission and japan . eu commission chief jose manuel barroso said the global community had a " moral imperative " to help conflict-hit georiga as he spoke of the commission 's pledge of 500 million euros over three years for reconstruction . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ferrero-waldner , right , with france 's foreign minister kouchner at the donor conference japan pledged $ 200 million in aid over three years , while the international monetary fund has promised a 750-million-euro financial package . germany 's deputy foreign minister gernot erler announced 33.7 million euros while sweden , according to a japanese aide , pledged 40 million euros .
france offered seven million euros . the funds are to be used exclusively for civilian purposes such as rebuilding transport and energy infrastructure .

engineers and health care workers are in high demand . in a bid to attract high-skilled workers from developing countries , the european union will push forward a blue card scheme , an eu official told reuters news agency .
the blue card , which will be good for up to four years , will speed up the application process and make it easier for workers to bring families , get housing and acquire long-term resident status .
the eu hopes that the coordinated system for allocating work permits will allow the eu to compete with other western countries for educated migrants such as technology workers and hospital staff .
as europe grows older , the shortage of skilled professionals is expected to increase .
currently , skilled workers make up less than 2 percent of migrants in the eu .
that 's compared with 10 percent of migrants in australia , 7.3 percent in canada and 3.2 percent in the united states , according to eu data .
restrictions on placement the blue card would allow an immigrant to work in one eu country .
after the first 18 months , the worker could then move to another country , but would still have to apply for a new blue card within a month of arrival .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany , like other eu countries , is short on engineers some say that these limitations , insisted on by countries such as germany , will make the scheme less attractive as the card will not allow blue card job seekers to move freely within the eu .
" it is clearly a step in the right direction but i do n't expect it to be a big success because if you compare it to the united states , a similar title gives access to the whole us market , " jakob von weizsaecker , a german labor market specialist with the brussels-based bruegel economic policy think tank told reuters .
eu ministers are expected to endorse the blue card scheme before the end of 2008 and it will then come into force by mid-2010 .
new eu countries such as the czech republic insisted on the delay , since their own citizens are not yet allowed to work in all eu countries . dw staff -lrb- th -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

now the question is : can the two bury the hatchet ? ballack 's broadside came in a newspaper interview , when he was asked about loew 's decision not to play veteran midfielder torsten frings in germany 's recent world cup qualifiers against russia and wales .
" respect and loyalty are the least one can expect as a veteran national player , " the germany captain told the frankfurter allgemeine zeitung .
ballack went on to name other examples of players he felt were squeezed out of the team without being given a fair chance .
at the head of his list was former national goalkeeper ollie kahn , who was demoted by loew 's predecessor , juergen klinsmann .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : frings has recently had an unwelcome new role in loew 's squad " a competition with jens lehmann was proclaimed that , to my eyes , he could n't win , " ballack said .

now the question is : can the two bury the hatchet ? ballack 's broadside came in a newspaper interview , when he was asked about loew 's decision not to play veteran midfielder torsten frings in germany 's recent world cup qualifiers against russia and wales .
" respect and loyalty are the least one can expect as a veteran national player , " the germany captain told the frankfurter allgemeine zeitung .
ballack went on to name other examples of players he felt were squeezed out of the team without being given a fair chance .
at the head of his list was former national goalkeeper ollie kahn , who was demoted by loew 's predecessor , juergen klinsmann .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : frings has recently had an unwelcome new role in loew 's squad " a competition with jens lehmann was proclaimed that , to my eyes , he could n't win , " ballack said .

engineers and health care workers are in high demand . in a bid to attract high-skilled workers from developing countries , the european union will push forward a blue card scheme , an eu official told reuters news agency .
the blue card , which will be good for up to four years , will speed up the application process and make it easier for workers to bring families , get housing and acquire long-term resident status .
the eu hopes that the coordinated system for allocating work permits will allow the eu to compete with other western countries for educated migrants such as technology workers and hospital staff .
as europe grows older , the shortage of skilled professionals is expected to increase .
currently , skilled workers make up less than 2 percent of migrants in the eu .
that 's compared with 10 percent of migrants in australia , 7.3 percent in canada and 3.2 percent in the united states , according to eu data .
restrictions on placement the blue card would allow an immigrant to work in one eu country .
after the first 18 months , the worker could then move to another country , but would still have to apply for a new blue card within a month of arrival .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany , like other eu countries , is short on engineers some say that these limitations , insisted on by countries such as germany , will make the scheme less attractive as the card will not allow blue card job seekers to move freely within the eu .

eu ministers are expected to endorse the blue card scheme before the end of 2008 and it will then come into force by mid-2010 .

germany 's federal government and the premiers of the country 's 16 states agreed at a one-day education summit in dresden to hugely boost spending on education and research to 10 percent of gross domestic production -lrb- gdp -rrb- by 2015 .
" we recognise that people are the biggest resource we have , " merkel said at a news conference after the " education summit " .
" prosperity for all means education for everyone , " she said .
but a dispute remained over who was to pay : the 16 states or berlin .
long-term unemployment was worst in sections of the population which had not completed schooling , merkel said .
annual oecd reports have criticized german schools for failing the children of the poor and ethnic minorities , even though higher-status children are well educated .
german universities have been criticized for making entry too difficult .
raising education spending to 7 per cent of gdp and research spending to 3 per cent would mean annual increases of between 25 billion and 60 billion euros -lrb- at least $ 32 billion -rrb- , experts said .
the federal government has only limited authority over education , with the states reluctant to give up their powers . dpa news agency -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?
dw-world.de private schools could rescue ailing german system , expert says a german expert on education and economics said he has little hope that wednesday 's summit between chancellor angela merkel and state education ministers will bring about change - even though it is sorely needed .
-lrb- 22.10.2008 -rrb- german education spending below other nations : oecd report germany is falling behind in producing qualified university graduates because average public spending on higher education is well behind most other western nations , a new report said this week .

how typical - and how threatening - are converts like eric breininger ? officials from germany 's federal office of criminal investigation -lrb- bka -rrb- confirmed on wednesday , oct.22 , that the six minute video of breininger , who is wanted as a suspected member of a terrorist group , was indeed genuine .
" we assume that came from the international jihad union -lrb- iju -rrb- , " a bka spokesperson told the dpa news agency .
the iju is a radical islamist organization that originated in uzbekistan and has been linked with attempted terrorist acts in germany four weeks ago , the bka launched a public search for breiniger after rumors surfaced that he was in the balkans and on his way back to germany . but they withdrew the warning over the weekend .
also on wednesday , oct 22 , the police also arrested the younger brother of one of three men accused of planning attacks last year on us citizens and interests using chemical-filled drums , the 21-year-old turk , named only as burhan y. , was arrested at langen south of frankfurt and is a suspected helper for the banned iju .
" germany should expect attacks " in the video , the 21-year-old breininger discussed his whereabouts and motivation .
" i am located in afghanistan and am not personally planning an attack on germany , " breininger said in the video , before adding : " we declare war on every country that fights alongside america against muslims . "
but breininger also said that as long as german soldiers are in afghanistan and uzbekistan , “ germany should expect attacks , " without giving any further details .
shown in the video wearing a turban and carrying a kalashnikov , breininger hinted that he may be preparing to sacrifice his life for his cause .
" if allah wishes , he will call me to him as a jidhadi , " he said .
so how did a young man from a suburban town in southern germany become a fanatic apparently willing to die for his religious beliefs in afghanistan ?
fateful turn bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a poster published by germany 's federal office of criminal investigation shows eric breininger according to various reports in the german media , breininger 's parents divorced when he was an adolescent , and he reportedly started using hashish and alcohol at a relatively early age .
he was prone to getting into fights and had trouble with the police .
in late 2006 , breininger got a job for a package-delivery company , where he met a pakistani who got him interested in radical islam .
a short time later , he also became friends with a radical islamic convert named daniel schneider .
breininger began calling himself abdul ghaffar el almani , avoiding his old friends and burning his cds .
he swore off drugs and alcohol .
he married in a mosque , and his wife eva p. wore a veil .
the marriage was short-lived .
" he wanted me to clean and cook and said he was looking for another woman , " eva p. later said in a television interview .
in june 2007 , breininger sold off most of his belongings on ebay , saying he wanted to go abroad and learn arabic , and moved in with schneider .
in september , schneider , who had relocated to the western german region of sauerland , was arrested along with two other suspected islamists for allegedly trying to make car bombs and planning attacks on us targets in germany .
breininger disappeared before police could detain him .
police suspect breininger has since received training in a terrorist camp , possibly in pakistan .
both german and american military forces in afghanistan are reported to have distributed pictures of him , warning that he is a potential suicide attacker .
how big a danger ?
the breininger case raises the question of how great a threat german converts to islam pose .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : police arrested a suspected member of the so-called " sauerland terror group " last year " converts can be more easily radicalized , " kai hirschmann of germany 's institute for terrorism research and study told a internet news site around the time of scheider 's arrest .
" as ' novices ' they try to be more religious than even the religious leaders , " hirschmann added .
" that often makes them especially fanatical and also especially dangerous . "
other experts , however , disagree with that assessment .
" you ca n't say that conversion to islam carries an explicit tendency toward becoming a radical , " stefan reichmuth , professor of islamic studies at the university of bochum told dw-world.de. estimates of the number of german converts to islam range between 15,000 and 80,000 .
but germany 's muslim league says that , of them , only about 25 fit the description of being radical or dangerously fanatic .
germany , which opposed the 2003 us-led invasion of iraq and has more than 3,000 troops in afghanistan under nato command , has tightened security and surveillance in response to the threat of attacks by islamic extremists .
the closest germany came to an attack was in july 2006 when suitcases containing homemade bombs were placed on two regional trains passing through cologne 's busy main train station .
they failed to detonate .
the september 11 , 2001 attacks on the united states were planned by an al-qaeda cell in the northern german city of hamburg led by mohammed atta , one of the hijackers of the planes involved in the attacks . dw staff -lrb- jc -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

engineers and health care workers are in high demand . in a bid to attract high-skilled workers from developing countries , the european union will push forward a blue card scheme , an eu official told reuters news agency .
the blue card , which will be good for up to four years , will speed up the application process and make it easier for workers to bring families , get housing and acquire long-term resident status .
the eu hopes that the coordinated system for allocating work permits will allow the eu to compete with other western countries for educated migrants such as technology workers and hospital staff .
as europe grows older , the shortage of skilled professionals is expected to increase .
currently , skilled workers make up less than 2 percent of migrants in the eu .
that 's compared with 10 percent of migrants in australia , 7.3 percent in canada and 3.2 percent in the united states , according to eu data .
restrictions on placement the blue card would allow an immigrant to work in one eu country .
after the first 18 months , the worker could then move to another country , but would still have to apply for a new blue card within a month of arrival .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany , like other eu countries , is short on engineers some say that these limitations , insisted on by countries such as germany , will make the scheme less attractive as the card will not allow blue card job seekers to move freely within the eu .
" it is clearly a step in the right direction but i do n't expect it to be a big success because if you compare it to the united states , a similar title gives access to the whole us market , " jakob von weizsaecker , a german labor market specialist with the brussels-based bruegel economic policy think tank told reuters .
eu ministers are expected to endorse the blue card scheme before the end of 2008 and it will then come into force by mid-2010 .
new eu countries such as the czech republic insisted on the delay , since their own citizens are not yet allowed to work in all eu countries . dw staff -lrb- th -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" rwe will participate in projects outside germany .
it depends on financing and on what partner we find .
but i think that three to five -lrb- projects -rrb- are in the pipeline , " chief executive juergen grossmann told the daily sueddeutsche zeitung newspaper .
essen-based rwe was one of " a small handful of power suppliers in europe with competence in nuclear plants , " he said .
grossmann did not give any indications where these projects would be built .
nuclear powerhouse rwe has been operating nuclear stations in germany since the 1960s .
nuclear power , which accounts for 30 percent of all power in germany , is currently being phased out .
rwe 's biblis plant will be allowed to operate until 2012 and its newest plant in emsland will have to go offline in about 2020 .
rwe , along with its subsidiaries , provides electricity to more than 20 million people and gas to 10 million .
most of its customers are in europe .
earlier this month , bulgaria chose rwe as the winning bidder for 49-percent stake in the belene power company , which will finance and run a four-billion-euro -lrb- $ 5.1-billion -rrb- nuclear plant near the northern town of belene . dw staff -lrb- th -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" those are important criteria for the national team , " the germany captain added .
" where will we end up if things like that no longer count ? "
surprise and disappointment bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the hero of germany 's recent win over wales was 24-year-old piotr trochowski loew seemed to be taken off guard by the verbal blasts from his most important player and representative on the pitch .
" i 'm fundamentally surprised that he chose to go public like this , " loew told the daily bild newspaper .
" and i 'm disappointed that he 's trying to affect personnel decisions in this way . "
loew said he had been up front with veteran players about their chances in the national side and insisted that it was up to him as coach to decide who played and who did n't .
loew stressed that he still wants ballack as team captain and would try to work through their differences .
but the coach admitted he did n't know precisely how or when to approach his angry star .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : kuranyi has almost certainly played his last match for loew " i want to think about the form in which i 'll talk to michael , " loew said .
" on principle i do n't tolerate interference .
but there will be a discussion .
not a few days from now , but very soon . "
the outcome of that chat may determine whether ballack is nominated for germany 's upcoming friendly against england .
" all our players know the rules concerning public criticism , " loew said .
bosses back loew bildunterschrift : ballack also feuded with germany team manager oliver bierhoff at euro 2008 germany 's football functionaries were quick to back the coach .
" this constant complaining ! " said german soccer association vice-president and soccer legend frank beckenbauer in a television interview .
" they 've become a pack of wimps - unbelievable !
they should shut their mouths and play soccer . "
german soccer association president theo zwanziger seconded those sentiments .
" i 'm disappointed by michael ballack 's behavior , " zwanziger said .
" this has created a difficult and complicated situation . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ballack will likely only see a yellow card for his latest ourburst zwanziger also stressed that germany under loew was headed in the right direction .
" the development of our national team over the past few years has been absolutely positive so i do n't understand at all why there should be criticism of joachim loew coming from the team via the media , " zwanziger said .
but while germany could thrive without players like frings and kuranyi , there is little question that the national side needs ballack , its on-the-field leader and most technically gifted player .

the case relates to the killing of 203 civilians near civitella , a town in italy 's central apennine mountain region , on june 29 , 1944 .
the rome-based court 's ruling came following a hearing in which a lawyer representing germany , augusto dossena , stated that his client was exempt from such payments under agreements signed by the rome and berlin governments in 1947 and 1961 .
" germany does not question the responsibility of its soldiers and officers who tarnished themselves with ferocious war crimes , " said dossena , who , according to the ansa news agency , also explained that berlin has made past payments amounting to 800,000 euros -lrb- $ 1.07 million -rrb- in connection with the civitella massacre .

" rwe will participate in projects outside germany .
it depends on financing and on what partner we find .
but i think that three to five -lrb- projects -rrb- are in the pipeline , " chief executive juergen grossmann told the daily sueddeutsche zeitung newspaper .
essen-based rwe was one of " a small handful of power suppliers in europe with competence in nuclear plants , " he said .
grossmann did not give any indications where these projects would be built .
nuclear powerhouse rwe has been operating nuclear stations in germany since the 1960s .
nuclear power , which accounts for 30 percent of all power in germany , is currently being phased out .
rwe 's biblis plant will be allowed to operate until 2012 and its newest plant in emsland will have to go offline in about 2020 .
rwe , along with its subsidiaries , provides electricity to more than 20 million people and gas to 10 million .
most of its customers are in europe .
earlier this month , bulgaria chose rwe as the winning bidder for 49-percent stake in the belene power company , which will finance and run a four-billion-euro -lrb- $ 5.1-billion -rrb- nuclear plant near the northern town of belene . dw staff -lrb- th -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the board met in munich on tuesday , oct .
21 , and decided to " apply for stabilization measures , " said bavaria 's state finance minister , erwin huber , who heads bayernlb 's governing board .
huber , 62 , announced on wedesday that he is stepping down as finance minister because of the bayernlb debacle .
the southern regional bank is jointly owned by the state of bavaria and regional savings banks .
the bank ran into trouble more than a year ago due to its heavy investment in asset-backed securities .
these securities lost much of their value when the us market for high-risk mortgages collapsed in 2007 .
as the bank was recovering from this loss , it was hit a second time when interbank loans dried up in mid-september .
in addition , german regional bank westlb is reportedly also eyeing the government bank rescue plan . separately , german police led by prosecutors searched the offices of the federally owned kfw bank wednesday .
this action was part of an investigation into the transfer of 319 million euros to us bank lehman brothers , the day after the financial crisis triggered the new york-based financial house 's collapsed .
deal comes with strings attached bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german banks are still trying to find their balance germany 's federal government approved a 500-billion-euro federal rescue package on friday .
germany 's rescue package was similar to measures taken by governments across europe .
on monday , the cabinet finalized the conditions banks must follow if they want to make use of the rescue package .
those conditions include bayernlb limiting executive pay to 500,000 euros .
it will also send any dividend payments to the state .
and the government will get the right to review any lending practices seen as risky .
the bank also has to promise to continue making loans to small- and medium-sized companies .
bayernlb is germany 's second biggest regional bank .
it posted 770 million euros in losses during the first three months of 2008 .
that forced shareholders to come up with 4.8 billion euros in loan guarantees .
the state link allowed regional banks to offer lower credit rates .
when the european commission cut back on that privilege in 2005 , the banks began engaging in risky investments as a way to keep making money .
other banks holding off bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the government has thrown banks a lifeline but the era of the landesbank could be coming to a close , merck finck analyst konrad becker told afp news agency .
" their business model does not work any more , " becker said .
" the era when each state had its own bank is over . "
other landesbanken have not said whether they will also ask for a bailout .
an hsh nordbank spokesman said on tuesday that no decision had been made .
a spokesman for the landesbank berlin said that there were currently no plans to take the rescue package .
other banks were similarly uncommitted , according to afp .
less that one in four germans expressed trust in domestic banks , according to a survey for the frankfurter allgemeine zeitung .

this action was part of an investigation into the transfer of 319 million euros to us bank lehman brothers , the day after the financial crisis triggered the new york-based financial house 's collapsed .
deal comes with strings attached bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german banks are still trying to find their balance germany 's federal government approved a 500-billion-euro federal rescue package on friday .
germany 's rescue package was similar to measures taken by governments across europe .
on monday , the cabinet finalized the conditions banks must follow if they want to make use of the rescue package .
those conditions include bayernlb limiting executive pay to 500,000 euros .
it will also send any dividend payments to the state .
and the government will get the right to review any lending practices seen as risky .
the bank also has to promise to continue making loans to small- and medium-sized companies .
bayernlb is germany 's second biggest regional bank .
it posted 770 million euros in losses during the first three months of 2008 .
that forced shareholders to come up with 4.8 billion euros in loan guarantees .
the state link allowed regional banks to offer lower credit rates .
when the european commission cut back on that privilege in 2005 , the banks began engaging in risky investments as a way to keep making money .
other banks holding off bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the government has thrown banks a lifeline but the era of the landesbank could be coming to a close , merck finck analyst konrad becker told afp news agency .
" their business model does not work any more , " becker said .
" the era when each state had its own bank is over . "
other landesbanken have not said whether they will also ask for a bailout .
an hsh nordbank spokesman said on tuesday that no decision had been made .
a spokesman for the landesbank berlin said that there were currently no plans to take the rescue package .
other banks were similarly uncommitted , according to afp .
less that one in four germans expressed trust in domestic banks , according to a survey for the frankfurter allgemeine zeitung .
only 52 percent of germans said they trusted the bank in which they had their account . dw staff -lrb- th -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

22 .
she said she wants the summit to lift the country out of its learning rut . prize-winning economist and education researcher ludger woessmann , of the ifo institute in munich , argued that a radical change toward increased competition is the best way to offer a broader array of students a more even shot at education .
he added that fairness dictates that university students help pay their own way . dw-world : is this education summit a serious effort toward policy change , or more of a political gambit on the part of angela merkel ? ludger woessmann : initially , chancellor merkel raised a lot of expectations , and i think she honestly wanted to achieve something at the summit .
but it is becoming more obvious that there wo n't be any huge results that come out of it .
it 's a big disappointment . why do you say that ? at first she said that education is the key precondition to equality in our social market economy , and that she would make education her priority .
the fact is that in germany , more than in almost any other western country , education is tied to social background .
so fixing education is the key to allowing everyone to accept and participate in the social market economy . now it seems the heads of the -lrb- individual german states -rrb- have called her back to reality .
according to the constitution , the federal government has basically no say at all in education topics .
it is the business of the states .
and they are just playing political games to make sure the federal government does n't get any influence . what kind of influence should the federal government have ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german education is free - and classes are full i think it would be important to have a federal school evaluation system , as a first step to see how each state has performed .
it would make them accountable for what they do , and would create huge incentives to do better , to try harder .
it would put politicians under pressure to perform . basically there are two problems that need to be dealt with : one is that we do a pretty mediocre job on international comparative tests like pisa -lrb- an international , triennial study that compares the high-school students ' abilities - eds -rrb- .
the other problem is that education results are so strongly tied to family background . so how should the government - federal or state - deal with these problems ? i think more autonomy for individual schools is needed .
at the moment public schools have no autonomy in choosing their own staff .
teachers are largely assigned by central bureaucracies .
and there is clear evidence that that holds back the quality of education . more generally , i think something that would lead the way forward would be to create more choice and competition between schools by setting private schools on the same funding level as public schools . you mean switching to a system that the us would call charter schools ? not really .
charter schools in the us are just public schools that have more autonomy .
i am talking here about , maybe , church-run schools .
you have to remember that we do n't have the separation of church and state that the us has in terms of accepting funding . what we have seen empirically is that school systems perform best when schools are financed by the states , using little private funding , but operated largely by private initiatives . the model is a system like the netherlands , where three-quarters of students go to schools that are not operated by the state , but mostly by churches and other charities .
these schools benefit the low income children the most .
it gives them the opportunity to attend privately operated schools regardless of how much money the parents have . they are rare , but there are a few private schools in germany . right - and that is the problem .
because what we see in international comparisons is that systematically , students perform better in countries that build more on private school operations .
not private funding , but operations . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : woessmann eyes education 's economic impact in the netherlands ... the schools are all funded in the same way , and they get exactly the same amount of money per student as the public school gets .
that creates choice for parents .
it makes schools start to compete with each other in a way that helps students . and what do you see as a remedy for the problem of socio-economic bias ? one thing is clear that the early tracking of students into different types of schools at such an early age - right now they are tracked at age 10 , in the fourth grade - decreases the quality of performance in germany .
we can systematically see that this tracking does nothing to improve performance .
it just makes outcomes more strongly dependent on family background . we should delay the tracking , and reduce the tracking into just two levels , if at all .
but this is such a politically charged topic in germany that they wo n't even dare to discuss it at the summit . the subject of educational tracking is a real political hot potato and has been for years .
what are the chances it is changed ? it has been debated since the 70s .
and it divides people along party lines .
it is one of those things where the federalist structure of germany makes any big , sweeping change impossible . is there anything you think will , in fact , be dealt with at the summit ? well , the final thing that research tells us would actually increase opportunity and performance in general is to put more focus on early childhood education .
it is something germany has slowly moved into , and will probably be discussed at the summit .
but i don ’ t expect there will be any big news . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : low-income kids often get a worse start in germany right now , germany focuses on providing child care instead of early education per se - there is hardly any educational content in the preschool programs .
but more and more people are becoming aware of how important it is to introduce learning and educational goals at an early age .
it would help people who do n't have an educational environment at home . a recent oecd study shows low rates of university attendance in germany compared with elsewhere in europe .
what is behind that ? part of it is definitely due to this problem of early tracking .
it makes sure that a lot of very bright children from low socioeconomic backgrounds do not go into the " gymnasium , " the one track that leads straight to university . another is that we have a very strong vocational education system .
historically , more than half the students in each grade would go into the apprenticeship track . but a lot of people have not realized that the world has changed .
the vocational system is n't as safe and lucrative as it once was , because of globalization .
a lot of the medium-skilled jobs are outsourced into eastern europe or asia . german universities used to be free of charge , but recently some states introduced tuition fees .
some people are arguing that this makes it hard for low-income students to study .
what do you think ? i think that in general it makes a lot of sense to have students pay at least some fees for the university .
at the moment we make parents pay more for their child 's preschool than for a university degree .
this is kind of ridiculous - it is both inefficient and unfair . it is inefficient in the sense that the earlier you invest public money , the higher the returns will be .
so you can actually change the whole track of children 's if you make sure that early on they get a better education . it is unfair because in the current system , you make the state pay for a university education , which at the moment is much more open to children from rich families than from low-income families .
so in a sense , by funding the system with taxes , you are making low-income people pay for the university education of children of rich families . i think what is strongly needed , and what has really been missing , is to accompany these tuition fees - and we are talking about 500 euros per semester , or 1,000 euros per year -lrb- $ 650 or $ 1,300 -rrb- , which is nothing compared to the us or the uk - by easy , income-contingent loans at the same time .
so people could pay back the loans later on , if and when they are successful in the labor market . interview : jennifer abramsohn send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

but i don ’ t expect there will be any big news . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : low-income kids often get a worse start in germany right now , germany focuses on providing child care instead of early education per se - there is hardly any educational content in the preschool programs .
but more and more people are becoming aware of how important it is to introduce learning and educational goals at an early age .
it would help people who do n't have an educational environment at home . a recent oecd study shows low rates of university attendance in germany compared with elsewhere in europe .
what is behind that ? part of it is definitely due to this problem of early tracking .
it makes sure that a lot of very bright children from low socioeconomic backgrounds do not go into the " gymnasium , " the one track that leads straight to university . another is that we have a very strong vocational education system .
historically , more than half the students in each grade would go into the apprenticeship track . but a lot of people have not realized that the world has changed .
the vocational system is n't as safe and lucrative as it once was , because of globalization .
a lot of the medium-skilled jobs are outsourced into eastern europe or asia . german universities used to be free of charge , but recently some states introduced tuition fees .
some people are arguing that this makes it hard for low-income students to study .
what do you think ? i think that in general it makes a lot of sense to have students pay at least some fees for the university .
at the moment we make parents pay more for their child 's preschool than for a university degree .
this is kind of ridiculous - it is both inefficient and unfair . it is inefficient in the sense that the earlier you invest public money , the higher the returns will be .
so you can actually change the whole track of children 's if you make sure that early on they get a better education . it is unfair because in the current system , you make the state pay for a university education , which at the moment is much more open to children from rich families than from low-income families .
so in a sense , by funding the system with taxes , you are making low-income people pay for the university education of children of rich families . i think what is strongly needed , and what has really been missing , is to accompany these tuition fees - and we are talking about 500 euros per semester , or 1,000 euros per year -lrb- $ 650 or $ 1,300 -rrb- , which is nothing compared to the us or the uk - by easy , income-contingent loans at the same time .
so people could pay back the loans later on , if and when they are successful in the labor market . interview : jennifer abramsohn send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the board met in munich on tuesday , oct .
21 , and decided to " apply for stabilization measures , " said bavaria 's state finance minister , erwin huber , who heads bayernlb 's governing board .
huber , 62 , announced on wedesday that he is stepping down as finance minister because of the bayernlb debacle .
the southern regional bank is jointly owned by the state of bavaria and regional savings banks .
the bank ran into trouble more than a year ago due to its heavy investment in asset-backed securities .
these securities lost much of their value when the us market for high-risk mortgages collapsed in 2007 .
as the bank was recovering from this loss , it was hit a second time when interbank loans dried up in mid-september .
in addition , german regional bank westlb is reportedly also eyeing the government bank rescue plan . separately , german police led by prosecutors searched the offices of the federally owned kfw bank wednesday .
this action was part of an investigation into the transfer of 319 million euros to us bank lehman brothers , the day after the financial crisis triggered the new york-based financial house 's collapsed .
deal comes with strings attached bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german banks are still trying to find their balance germany 's federal government approved a 500-billion-euro federal rescue package on friday .
germany 's rescue package was similar to measures taken by governments across europe .
on monday , the cabinet finalized the conditions banks must follow if they want to make use of the rescue package .
those conditions include bayernlb limiting executive pay to 500,000 euros .
it will also send any dividend payments to the state .
and the government will get the right to review any lending practices seen as risky .
the bank also has to promise to continue making loans to small- and medium-sized companies .
bayernlb is germany 's second biggest regional bank .
it posted 770 million euros in losses during the first three months of 2008 .
that forced shareholders to come up with 4.8 billion euros in loan guarantees .
the state link allowed regional banks to offer lower credit rates .
when the european commission cut back on that privilege in 2005 , the banks began engaging in risky investments as a way to keep making money .
other banks holding off bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the government has thrown banks a lifeline but the era of the landesbank could be coming to a close , merck finck analyst konrad becker told afp news agency .
" their business model does not work any more , " becker said .
" the era when each state had its own bank is over . "
other landesbanken have not said whether they will also ask for a bailout .
an hsh nordbank spokesman said on tuesday that no decision had been made .
a spokesman for the landesbank berlin said that there were currently no plans to take the rescue package .
other banks were similarly uncommitted , according to afp .
less that one in four germans expressed trust in domestic banks , according to a survey for the frankfurter allgemeine zeitung .
only 52 percent of germans said they trusted the bank in which they had their account . dw staff -lrb- th -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" rwe will participate in projects outside germany .
it depends on financing and on what partner we find .
but i think that three to five -lrb- projects -rrb- are in the pipeline , " chief executive juergen grossmann told the daily sueddeutsche zeitung newspaper .
essen-based rwe was one of " a small handful of power suppliers in europe with competence in nuclear plants , " he said .
grossmann did not give any indications where these projects would be built .
nuclear powerhouse rwe has been operating nuclear stations in germany since the 1960s .
nuclear power , which accounts for 30 percent of all power in germany , is currently being phased out .
rwe 's biblis plant will be allowed to operate until 2012 and its newest plant in emsland will have to go offline in about 2020 .
rwe , along with its subsidiaries , provides electricity to more than 20 million people and gas to 10 million .
most of its customers are in europe .
earlier this month , bulgaria chose rwe as the winning bidder for 49-percent stake in the belene power company , which will finance and run a four-billion-euro -lrb- $ 5.1-billion -rrb- nuclear plant near the northern town of belene . dw staff -lrb- th -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

now the question is : can the two bury the hatchet ? ballack 's broadside came in a newspaper interview , when he was asked about loew 's decision not to play veteran midfielder torsten frings in germany 's recent world cup qualifiers against russia and wales .
" respect and loyalty are the least one can expect as a veteran national player , " the germany captain told the frankfurter allgemeine zeitung .
ballack went on to name other examples of players he felt were squeezed out of the team without being given a fair chance .
at the head of his list was former national goalkeeper ollie kahn , who was demoted by loew 's predecessor , juergen klinsmann .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : frings has recently had an unwelcome new role in loew 's squad " a competition with jens lehmann was proclaimed that , to my eyes , he could n't win , " ballack said .
" the same was true with -lsb- defender -rsb- christian woerns who , in contrast to christoph metzelder , stayed true to one team and was n't sitting on the bench . "
ballack even defended striker kevin kuranyi , whom loew booted out of the squad entirely after kuranyi abandoned the team in response to not being nominated .
" -lsb- kuranyi -rsb- saw that it was going to be very difficult for him , even though he plays year in , year out in the champions league and has been a regular starter for a top bundesliga club for quite some time , " ballack said .
" those are important criteria for the national team , " the germany captain added .
" where will we end up if things like that no longer count ? "
surprise and disappointment bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the hero of germany 's recent win over wales was 24-year-old piotr trochowski loew seemed to be taken off guard by the verbal blasts from his most important player and representative on the pitch .
" i 'm fundamentally surprised that he chose to go public like this , " loew told the daily bild newspaper .
" and i 'm disappointed that he 's trying to affect personnel decisions in this way . "
loew said he had been up front with veteran players about their chances in the national side and insisted that it was up to him as coach to decide who played and who did n't .
loew stressed that he still wants ballack as team captain and would try to work through their differences .
but the coach admitted he did n't know precisely how or when to approach his angry star .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : kuranyi has almost certainly played his last match for loew " i want to think about the form in which i 'll talk to michael , " loew said .
" on principle i do n't tolerate interference .
but there will be a discussion .
not a few days from now , but very soon . "
the outcome of that chat may determine whether ballack is nominated for germany 's upcoming friendly against england .
" all our players know the rules concerning public criticism , " loew said .
bosses back loew bildunterschrift : ballack also feuded with germany team manager oliver bierhoff at euro 2008 germany 's football functionaries were quick to back the coach .
" this constant complaining ! " said german soccer association vice-president and soccer legend frank beckenbauer in a television interview .
" they 've become a pack of wimps - unbelievable !
they should shut their mouths and play soccer . "
german soccer association president theo zwanziger seconded those sentiments .
" i 'm disappointed by michael ballack 's behavior , " zwanziger said .
" this has created a difficult and complicated situation . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ballack will likely only see a yellow card for his latest ourburst zwanziger also stressed that germany under loew was headed in the right direction .
" the development of our national team over the past few years has been absolutely positive so i do n't understand at all why there should be criticism of joachim loew coming from the team via the media , " zwanziger said .
but while germany could thrive without players like frings and kuranyi , there is little question that the national side needs ballack , its on-the-field leader and most technically gifted player .
so loew may have no other choice but to forgive , or simply ignore , ballack 's attacks . dw staff -lrb- jc -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" the total far exceeded the $ 3.2 billion that the world bank had estimated georgia would need to rebuild its infrastructure , settle its refugees and get its economy back on track . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : georgian premier lado gurgenidze was satisfied with the conference 's result georgian prime minister lado gurgenidze , who attended the one-day donor conference in brussels , told reporters afterwards that his country was " deeply moved and humbled by the demonstration of solidarity that we have received . " " $ 4.5 billion far exceeds the expectations that we had ... at a time like this to show such support is something that no georgian will ever forget , " gurgenidze said . us the biggest donor the united states , which pledged a billion dollars over three years , was the biggest donor at the meeting of 67 nations and major financial institutions , followed by substantial donations from the european commission and japan . eu commission chief jose manuel barroso said the global community had a " moral imperative " to help conflict-hit georiga as he spoke of the commission 's pledge of 500 million euros over three years for reconstruction . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ferrero-waldner , right , with france 's foreign minister kouchner at the donor conference japan pledged $ 200 million in aid over three years , while the international monetary fund has promised a 750-million-euro financial package . germany 's deputy foreign minister gernot erler announced 33.7 million euros while sweden , according to a japanese aide , pledged 40 million euros .
france offered seven million euros . the funds are to be used exclusively for civilian purposes such as rebuilding transport and energy infrastructure .
the hope is to restore economic growth in georgia to pre-conflict levels of more than 10 percent by 2010 . continuing tensions russia launched military attacks against georgia in early august , after tbilisi used military force against ethnic russian separatists in south ossetia . russian prime minister vladimir putin later told an american television network that he suspected washington of encouraging the georgian offensive , which coincided with the democratic primary , in an attempt to influence the course of us national elections . washington denied the charge .
russia has since recognized the independence of abkhazia and south ossetia .
the west , as well as tbilisi , has staunchly insisted that they remain part of georgia . little hope for the displaced although funds donated could , theoretically , also be directed toward abkhazia and south ossetia , there is little chance of that happening while the two breakaway regions are under de facto russia control . fighting between the various sides in the conflict left some 65,000 people displaced , among them around 30,000 ethnic georgians forced to leave the breakaway regions . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : refugees have little chance at present of going home but the european commission has said the prospects of such people ever returning to their homes are extremely bleak . meanwhile , the georgian government has welcomed financial assistance to compensate for war damage suffered by its citizenry and to revive the country 's economy . georgian foreign minister eka tkeshelashvili earlier told the afp news agency that aid money would be spent " so that georgia is back on track as the economic success story that we used to be prior to the war .

how typical - and how threatening - are converts like eric breininger ? officials from germany 's federal office of criminal investigation -lrb- bka -rrb- confirmed on wednesday , oct.22 , that the six minute video of breininger , who is wanted as a suspected member of a terrorist group , was indeed genuine .
" we assume that came from the international jihad union -lrb- iju -rrb- , " a bka spokesperson told the dpa news agency .
the iju is a radical islamist organization that originated in uzbekistan and has been linked with attempted terrorist acts in germany four weeks ago , the bka launched a public search for breiniger after rumors surfaced that he was in the balkans and on his way back to germany . but they withdrew the warning over the weekend .
also on wednesday , oct 22 , the police also arrested the younger brother of one of three men accused of planning attacks last year on us citizens and interests using chemical-filled drums , the 21-year-old turk , named only as burhan y. , was arrested at langen south of frankfurt and is a suspected helper for the banned iju .
" germany should expect attacks " in the video , the 21-year-old breininger discussed his whereabouts and motivation .
" i am located in afghanistan and am not personally planning an attack on germany , " breininger said in the video , before adding : " we declare war on every country that fights alongside america against muslims . "
but breininger also said that as long as german soldiers are in afghanistan and uzbekistan , “ germany should expect attacks , " without giving any further details .
shown in the video wearing a turban and carrying a kalashnikov , breininger hinted that he may be preparing to sacrifice his life for his cause .
" if allah wishes , he will call me to him as a jidhadi , " he said .
so how did a young man from a suburban town in southern germany become a fanatic apparently willing to die for his religious beliefs in afghanistan ?

he was prone to getting into fights and had trouble with the police .
in late 2006 , breininger got a job for a package-delivery company , where he met a pakistani who got him interested in radical islam .
a short time later , he also became friends with a radical islamic convert named daniel schneider .
breininger began calling himself abdul ghaffar el almani , avoiding his old friends and burning his cds .
he swore off drugs and alcohol .
he married in a mosque , and his wife eva p. wore a veil .
the marriage was short-lived .
" he wanted me to clean and cook and said he was looking for another woman , " eva p. later said in a television interview .
in june 2007 , breininger sold off most of his belongings on ebay , saying he wanted to go abroad and learn arabic , and moved in with schneider .
in september , schneider , who had relocated to the western german region of sauerland , was arrested along with two other suspected islamists for allegedly trying to make car bombs and planning attacks on us targets in germany .
breininger disappeared before police could detain him .
police suspect breininger has since received training in a terrorist camp , possibly in pakistan .

" as ' novices ' they try to be more religious than even the religious leaders , " hirschmann added .
" that often makes them especially fanatical and also especially dangerous . "
other experts , however , disagree with that assessment .
" you ca n't say that conversion to islam carries an explicit tendency toward becoming a radical , " stefan reichmuth , professor of islamic studies at the university of bochum told dw-world.de. estimates of the number of german converts to islam range between 15,000 and 80,000 .
but germany 's muslim league says that , of them , only about 25 fit the description of being radical or dangerously fanatic .
germany , which opposed the 2003 us-led invasion of iraq and has more than 3,000 troops in afghanistan under nato command , has tightened security and surveillance in response to the threat of attacks by islamic extremists .
the closest germany came to an attack was in july 2006 when suitcases containing homemade bombs were placed on two regional trains passing through cologne 's busy main train station .

how typical - and how threatening - are converts like eric breininger ? officials from germany 's federal office of criminal investigation -lrb- bka -rrb- confirmed on wednesday , oct.22 , that the six minute video of breininger , who is wanted as a suspected member of a terrorist group , was indeed genuine .
" we assume that came from the international jihad union -lrb- iju -rrb- , " a bka spokesperson told the dpa news agency .
the iju is a radical islamist organization that originated in uzbekistan and has been linked with attempted terrorist acts in germany four weeks ago , the bka launched a public search for breiniger after rumors surfaced that he was in the balkans and on his way back to germany . but they withdrew the warning over the weekend .
also on wednesday , oct 22 , the police also arrested the younger brother of one of three men accused of planning attacks last year on us citizens and interests using chemical-filled drums , the 21-year-old turk , named only as burhan y. , was arrested at langen south of frankfurt and is a suspected helper for the banned iju .
" germany should expect attacks " in the video , the 21-year-old breininger discussed his whereabouts and motivation .
" i am located in afghanistan and am not personally planning an attack on germany , " breininger said in the video , before adding : " we declare war on every country that fights alongside america against muslims . "
but breininger also said that as long as german soldiers are in afghanistan and uzbekistan , “ germany should expect attacks , " without giving any further details .
shown in the video wearing a turban and carrying a kalashnikov , breininger hinted that he may be preparing to sacrifice his life for his cause .
" if allah wishes , he will call me to him as a jidhadi , " he said .
so how did a young man from a suburban town in southern germany become a fanatic apparently willing to die for his religious beliefs in afghanistan ?
fateful turn bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a poster published by germany 's federal office of criminal investigation shows eric breininger according to various reports in the german media , breininger 's parents divorced when he was an adolescent , and he reportedly started using hashish and alcohol at a relatively early age .
he was prone to getting into fights and had trouble with the police .
in late 2006 , breininger got a job for a package-delivery company , where he met a pakistani who got him interested in radical islam .
a short time later , he also became friends with a radical islamic convert named daniel schneider .
breininger began calling himself abdul ghaffar el almani , avoiding his old friends and burning his cds .
he swore off drugs and alcohol .
he married in a mosque , and his wife eva p. wore a veil .
the marriage was short-lived .
" he wanted me to clean and cook and said he was looking for another woman , " eva p. later said in a television interview .
in june 2007 , breininger sold off most of his belongings on ebay , saying he wanted to go abroad and learn arabic , and moved in with schneider .
in september , schneider , who had relocated to the western german region of sauerland , was arrested along with two other suspected islamists for allegedly trying to make car bombs and planning attacks on us targets in germany .
breininger disappeared before police could detain him .
police suspect breininger has since received training in a terrorist camp , possibly in pakistan .
both german and american military forces in afghanistan are reported to have distributed pictures of him , warning that he is a potential suicide attacker .

22 .
she said she wants the summit to lift the country out of its learning rut . prize-winning economist and education researcher ludger woessmann , of the ifo institute in munich , argued that a radical change toward increased competition is the best way to offer a broader array of students a more even shot at education .
he added that fairness dictates that university students help pay their own way . dw-world : is this education summit a serious effort toward policy change , or more of a political gambit on the part of angela merkel ? ludger woessmann : initially , chancellor merkel raised a lot of expectations , and i think she honestly wanted to achieve something at the summit .
but it is becoming more obvious that there wo n't be any huge results that come out of it .
it 's a big disappointment . why do you say that ? at first she said that education is the key precondition to equality in our social market economy , and that she would make education her priority .
the fact is that in germany , more than in almost any other western country , education is tied to social background .
so fixing education is the key to allowing everyone to accept and participate in the social market economy . now it seems the heads of the -lrb- individual german states -rrb- have called her back to reality .
according to the constitution , the federal government has basically no say at all in education topics .
it is the business of the states .
and they are just playing political games to make sure the federal government does n't get any influence . what kind of influence should the federal government have ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german education is free - and classes are full i think it would be important to have a federal school evaluation system , as a first step to see how each state has performed .
it would make them accountable for what they do , and would create huge incentives to do better , to try harder .
it would put politicians under pressure to perform . basically there are two problems that need to be dealt with : one is that we do a pretty mediocre job on international comparative tests like pisa -lrb- an international , triennial study that compares the high-school students ' abilities - eds -rrb- .
the other problem is that education results are so strongly tied to family background . so how should the government - federal or state - deal with these problems ? i think more autonomy for individual schools is needed .
at the moment public schools have no autonomy in choosing their own staff .
teachers are largely assigned by central bureaucracies .
and there is clear evidence that that holds back the quality of education . more generally , i think something that would lead the way forward would be to create more choice and competition between schools by setting private schools on the same funding level as public schools . you mean switching to a system that the us would call charter schools ? not really .
charter schools in the us are just public schools that have more autonomy .
i am talking here about , maybe , church-run schools .
you have to remember that we do n't have the separation of church and state that the us has in terms of accepting funding . what we have seen empirically is that school systems perform best when schools are financed by the states , using little private funding , but operated largely by private initiatives . the model is a system like the netherlands , where three-quarters of students go to schools that are not operated by the state , but mostly by churches and other charities .
these schools benefit the low income children the most .
it gives them the opportunity to attend privately operated schools regardless of how much money the parents have . they are rare , but there are a few private schools in germany . right - and that is the problem .
because what we see in international comparisons is that systematically , students perform better in countries that build more on private school operations .
not private funding , but operations . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : woessmann eyes education 's economic impact in the netherlands ... the schools are all funded in the same way , and they get exactly the same amount of money per student as the public school gets .
that creates choice for parents .
it makes schools start to compete with each other in a way that helps students . and what do you see as a remedy for the problem of socio-economic bias ? one thing is clear that the early tracking of students into different types of schools at such an early age - right now they are tracked at age 10 , in the fourth grade - decreases the quality of performance in germany .
we can systematically see that this tracking does nothing to improve performance .
it just makes outcomes more strongly dependent on family background . we should delay the tracking , and reduce the tracking into just two levels , if at all .
but this is such a politically charged topic in germany that they wo n't even dare to discuss it at the summit . the subject of educational tracking is a real political hot potato and has been for years .
what are the chances it is changed ? it has been debated since the 70s .
and it divides people along party lines .
it is one of those things where the federalist structure of germany makes any big , sweeping change impossible . is there anything you think will , in fact , be dealt with at the summit ? well , the final thing that research tells us would actually increase opportunity and performance in general is to put more focus on early childhood education .
it is something germany has slowly moved into , and will probably be discussed at the summit .
but i don ’ t expect there will be any big news . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : low-income kids often get a worse start in germany right now , germany focuses on providing child care instead of early education per se - there is hardly any educational content in the preschool programs .
but more and more people are becoming aware of how important it is to introduce learning and educational goals at an early age .
it would help people who do n't have an educational environment at home . a recent oecd study shows low rates of university attendance in germany compared with elsewhere in europe .
what is behind that ? part of it is definitely due to this problem of early tracking .
it makes sure that a lot of very bright children from low socioeconomic backgrounds do not go into the " gymnasium , " the one track that leads straight to university . another is that we have a very strong vocational education system .
historically , more than half the students in each grade would go into the apprenticeship track . but a lot of people have not realized that the world has changed .
the vocational system is n't as safe and lucrative as it once was , because of globalization .
a lot of the medium-skilled jobs are outsourced into eastern europe or asia . german universities used to be free of charge , but recently some states introduced tuition fees .
some people are arguing that this makes it hard for low-income students to study .
what do you think ? i think that in general it makes a lot of sense to have students pay at least some fees for the university .
at the moment we make parents pay more for their child 's preschool than for a university degree .
this is kind of ridiculous - it is both inefficient and unfair . it is inefficient in the sense that the earlier you invest public money , the higher the returns will be .
so you can actually change the whole track of children 's if you make sure that early on they get a better education . it is unfair because in the current system , you make the state pay for a university education , which at the moment is much more open to children from rich families than from low-income families .
so in a sense , by funding the system with taxes , you are making low-income people pay for the university education of children of rich families . i think what is strongly needed , and what has really been missing , is to accompany these tuition fees - and we are talking about 500 euros per semester , or 1,000 euros per year -lrb- $ 650 or $ 1,300 -rrb- , which is nothing compared to the us or the uk - by easy , income-contingent loans at the same time .
so people could pay back the loans later on , if and when they are successful in the labor market . interview : jennifer abramsohn send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

he added that fairness dictates that university students help pay their own way . dw-world : is this education summit a serious effort toward policy change , or more of a political gambit on the part of angela merkel ? ludger woessmann : initially , chancellor merkel raised a lot of expectations , and i think she honestly wanted to achieve something at the summit .
but it is becoming more obvious that there wo n't be any huge results that come out of it .
it 's a big disappointment . why do you say that ? at first she said that education is the key precondition to equality in our social market economy , and that she would make education her priority .
the fact is that in germany , more than in almost any other western country , education is tied to social background .
so fixing education is the key to allowing everyone to accept and participate in the social market economy . now it seems the heads of the -lrb- individual german states -rrb- have called her back to reality .
according to the constitution , the federal government has basically no say at all in education topics .
it is the business of the states .
and they are just playing political games to make sure the federal government does n't get any influence . what kind of influence should the federal government have ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german education is free - and classes are full i think it would be important to have a federal school evaluation system , as a first step to see how each state has performed .
it would make them accountable for what they do , and would create huge incentives to do better , to try harder .
it would put politicians under pressure to perform . basically there are two problems that need to be dealt with : one is that we do a pretty mediocre job on international comparative tests like pisa -lrb- an international , triennial study that compares the high-school students ' abilities - eds -rrb- .
the other problem is that education results are so strongly tied to family background . so how should the government - federal or state - deal with these problems ? i think more autonomy for individual schools is needed .
at the moment public schools have no autonomy in choosing their own staff .
teachers are largely assigned by central bureaucracies .
and there is clear evidence that that holds back the quality of education . more generally , i think something that would lead the way forward would be to create more choice and competition between schools by setting private schools on the same funding level as public schools . you mean switching to a system that the us would call charter schools ? not really .
charter schools in the us are just public schools that have more autonomy .
i am talking here about , maybe , church-run schools .
you have to remember that we do n't have the separation of church and state that the us has in terms of accepting funding . what we have seen empirically is that school systems perform best when schools are financed by the states , using little private funding , but operated largely by private initiatives . the model is a system like the netherlands , where three-quarters of students go to schools that are not operated by the state , but mostly by churches and other charities .
these schools benefit the low income children the most .
it gives them the opportunity to attend privately operated schools regardless of how much money the parents have . they are rare , but there are a few private schools in germany . right - and that is the problem .
because what we see in international comparisons is that systematically , students perform better in countries that build more on private school operations .
not private funding , but operations . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : woessmann eyes education 's economic impact in the netherlands ... the schools are all funded in the same way , and they get exactly the same amount of money per student as the public school gets .
that creates choice for parents .
it makes schools start to compete with each other in a way that helps students . and what do you see as a remedy for the problem of socio-economic bias ? one thing is clear that the early tracking of students into different types of schools at such an early age - right now they are tracked at age 10 , in the fourth grade - decreases the quality of performance in germany .
we can systematically see that this tracking does nothing to improve performance .
it just makes outcomes more strongly dependent on family background . we should delay the tracking , and reduce the tracking into just two levels , if at all .
but this is such a politically charged topic in germany that they wo n't even dare to discuss it at the summit . the subject of educational tracking is a real political hot potato and has been for years .
what are the chances it is changed ? it has been debated since the 70s .
and it divides people along party lines .
it is one of those things where the federalist structure of germany makes any big , sweeping change impossible . is there anything you think will , in fact , be dealt with at the summit ? well , the final thing that research tells us would actually increase opportunity and performance in general is to put more focus on early childhood education .
it is something germany has slowly moved into , and will probably be discussed at the summit .
but i don ’ t expect there will be any big news . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : low-income kids often get a worse start in germany right now , germany focuses on providing child care instead of early education per se - there is hardly any educational content in the preschool programs .
but more and more people are becoming aware of how important it is to introduce learning and educational goals at an early age .
it would help people who do n't have an educational environment at home . a recent oecd study shows low rates of university attendance in germany compared with elsewhere in europe .
what is behind that ? part of it is definitely due to this problem of early tracking .
it makes sure that a lot of very bright children from low socioeconomic backgrounds do not go into the " gymnasium , " the one track that leads straight to university . another is that we have a very strong vocational education system .
historically , more than half the students in each grade would go into the apprenticeship track . but a lot of people have not realized that the world has changed .
the vocational system is n't as safe and lucrative as it once was , because of globalization .
a lot of the medium-skilled jobs are outsourced into eastern europe or asia . german universities used to be free of charge , but recently some states introduced tuition fees .
some people are arguing that this makes it hard for low-income students to study .
what do you think ? i think that in general it makes a lot of sense to have students pay at least some fees for the university .
at the moment we make parents pay more for their child 's preschool than for a university degree .
this is kind of ridiculous - it is both inefficient and unfair . it is inefficient in the sense that the earlier you invest public money , the higher the returns will be .
so you can actually change the whole track of children 's if you make sure that early on they get a better education . it is unfair because in the current system , you make the state pay for a university education , which at the moment is much more open to children from rich families than from low-income families .
so in a sense , by funding the system with taxes , you are making low-income people pay for the university education of children of rich families . i think what is strongly needed , and what has really been missing , is to accompany these tuition fees - and we are talking about 500 euros per semester , or 1,000 euros per year -lrb- $ 650 or $ 1,300 -rrb- , which is nothing compared to the us or the uk - by easy , income-contingent loans at the same time .
so people could pay back the loans later on , if and when they are successful in the labor market . interview : jennifer abramsohn send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

22 .
she said she wants the summit to lift the country out of its learning rut . prize-winning economist and education researcher ludger woessmann , of the ifo institute in munich , argued that a radical change toward increased competition is the best way to offer a broader array of students a more even shot at education .
he added that fairness dictates that university students help pay their own way . dw-world : is this education summit a serious effort toward policy change , or more of a political gambit on the part of angela merkel ? ludger woessmann : initially , chancellor merkel raised a lot of expectations , and i think she honestly wanted to achieve something at the summit .
but it is becoming more obvious that there wo n't be any huge results that come out of it .
it 's a big disappointment . why do you say that ? at first she said that education is the key precondition to equality in our social market economy , and that she would make education her priority .
the fact is that in germany , more than in almost any other western country , education is tied to social background .
so fixing education is the key to allowing everyone to accept and participate in the social market economy . now it seems the heads of the -lrb- individual german states -rrb- have called her back to reality .
according to the constitution , the federal government has basically no say at all in education topics .
it is the business of the states .
and they are just playing political games to make sure the federal government does n't get any influence . what kind of influence should the federal government have ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german education is free - and classes are full i think it would be important to have a federal school evaluation system , as a first step to see how each state has performed .
it would make them accountable for what they do , and would create huge incentives to do better , to try harder .
it would put politicians under pressure to perform . basically there are two problems that need to be dealt with : one is that we do a pretty mediocre job on international comparative tests like pisa -lrb- an international , triennial study that compares the high-school students ' abilities - eds -rrb- .
the other problem is that education results are so strongly tied to family background . so how should the government - federal or state - deal with these problems ? i think more autonomy for individual schools is needed .
at the moment public schools have no autonomy in choosing their own staff .
teachers are largely assigned by central bureaucracies .
and there is clear evidence that that holds back the quality of education . more generally , i think something that would lead the way forward would be to create more choice and competition between schools by setting private schools on the same funding level as public schools . you mean switching to a system that the us would call charter schools ? not really .
charter schools in the us are just public schools that have more autonomy .
i am talking here about , maybe , church-run schools .
you have to remember that we do n't have the separation of church and state that the us has in terms of accepting funding . what we have seen empirically is that school systems perform best when schools are financed by the states , using little private funding , but operated largely by private initiatives . the model is a system like the netherlands , where three-quarters of students go to schools that are not operated by the state , but mostly by churches and other charities .
these schools benefit the low income children the most .
it gives them the opportunity to attend privately operated schools regardless of how much money the parents have . they are rare , but there are a few private schools in germany . right - and that is the problem .
because what we see in international comparisons is that systematically , students perform better in countries that build more on private school operations .
not private funding , but operations . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : woessmann eyes education 's economic impact in the netherlands ... the schools are all funded in the same way , and they get exactly the same amount of money per student as the public school gets .
that creates choice for parents .
it makes schools start to compete with each other in a way that helps students . and what do you see as a remedy for the problem of socio-economic bias ? one thing is clear that the early tracking of students into different types of schools at such an early age - right now they are tracked at age 10 , in the fourth grade - decreases the quality of performance in germany .
we can systematically see that this tracking does nothing to improve performance .
it just makes outcomes more strongly dependent on family background . we should delay the tracking , and reduce the tracking into just two levels , if at all .
but this is such a politically charged topic in germany that they wo n't even dare to discuss it at the summit . the subject of educational tracking is a real political hot potato and has been for years .
what are the chances it is changed ? it has been debated since the 70s .
and it divides people along party lines .
it is one of those things where the federalist structure of germany makes any big , sweeping change impossible . is there anything you think will , in fact , be dealt with at the summit ? well , the final thing that research tells us would actually increase opportunity and performance in general is to put more focus on early childhood education .
it is something germany has slowly moved into , and will probably be discussed at the summit .
but i don ’ t expect there will be any big news . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : low-income kids often get a worse start in germany right now , germany focuses on providing child care instead of early education per se - there is hardly any educational content in the preschool programs .
but more and more people are becoming aware of how important it is to introduce learning and educational goals at an early age .
it would help people who do n't have an educational environment at home . a recent oecd study shows low rates of university attendance in germany compared with elsewhere in europe .
what is behind that ? part of it is definitely due to this problem of early tracking .
it makes sure that a lot of very bright children from low socioeconomic backgrounds do not go into the " gymnasium , " the one track that leads straight to university . another is that we have a very strong vocational education system .
historically , more than half the students in each grade would go into the apprenticeship track . but a lot of people have not realized that the world has changed .
the vocational system is n't as safe and lucrative as it once was , because of globalization .
a lot of the medium-skilled jobs are outsourced into eastern europe or asia . german universities used to be free of charge , but recently some states introduced tuition fees .
some people are arguing that this makes it hard for low-income students to study .
what do you think ? i think that in general it makes a lot of sense to have students pay at least some fees for the university .
at the moment we make parents pay more for their child 's preschool than for a university degree .
this is kind of ridiculous - it is both inefficient and unfair . it is inefficient in the sense that the earlier you invest public money , the higher the returns will be .
so you can actually change the whole track of children 's if you make sure that early on they get a better education . it is unfair because in the current system , you make the state pay for a university education , which at the moment is much more open to children from rich families than from low-income families .
so in a sense , by funding the system with taxes , you are making low-income people pay for the university education of children of rich families . i think what is strongly needed , and what has really been missing , is to accompany these tuition fees - and we are talking about 500 euros per semester , or 1,000 euros per year -lrb- $ 650 or $ 1,300 -rrb- , which is nothing compared to the us or the uk - by easy , income-contingent loans at the same time .
so people could pay back the loans later on , if and when they are successful in the labor market . interview : jennifer abramsohn send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the case relates to the killing of 203 civilians near civitella , a town in italy 's central apennine mountain region , on june 29 , 1944 .
the rome-based court 's ruling came following a hearing in which a lawyer representing germany , augusto dossena , stated that his client was exempt from such payments under agreements signed by the rome and berlin governments in 1947 and 1961 .

engineers and health care workers are in high demand . in a bid to attract high-skilled workers from developing countries , the european union will push forward a blue card scheme , an eu official told reuters news agency .
the blue card , which will be good for up to four years , will speed up the application process and make it easier for workers to bring families , get housing and acquire long-term resident status .
the eu hopes that the coordinated system for allocating work permits will allow the eu to compete with other western countries for educated migrants such as technology workers and hospital staff .
as europe grows older , the shortage of skilled professionals is expected to increase .
currently , skilled workers make up less than 2 percent of migrants in the eu .
that 's compared with 10 percent of migrants in australia , 7.3 percent in canada and 3.2 percent in the united states , according to eu data .
restrictions on placement the blue card would allow an immigrant to work in one eu country .
after the first 18 months , the worker could then move to another country , but would still have to apply for a new blue card within a month of arrival .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany , like other eu countries , is short on engineers some say that these limitations , insisted on by countries such as germany , will make the scheme less attractive as the card will not allow blue card job seekers to move freely within the eu .
" it is clearly a step in the right direction but i do n't expect it to be a big success because if you compare it to the united states , a similar title gives access to the whole us market , " jakob von weizsaecker , a german labor market specialist with the brussels-based bruegel economic policy think tank told reuters .
eu ministers are expected to endorse the blue card scheme before the end of 2008 and it will then come into force by mid-2010 .
new eu countries such as the czech republic insisted on the delay , since their own citizens are not yet allowed to work in all eu countries . dw staff -lrb- th -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the board met in munich on tuesday , oct .
21 , and decided to " apply for stabilization measures , " said bavaria 's state finance minister , erwin huber , who heads bayernlb 's governing board .
huber , 62 , announced on wedesday that he is stepping down as finance minister because of the bayernlb debacle .
the southern regional bank is jointly owned by the state of bavaria and regional savings banks .
the bank ran into trouble more than a year ago due to its heavy investment in asset-backed securities .
these securities lost much of their value when the us market for high-risk mortgages collapsed in 2007 .
as the bank was recovering from this loss , it was hit a second time when interbank loans dried up in mid-september .
in addition , german regional bank westlb is reportedly also eyeing the government bank rescue plan . separately , german police led by prosecutors searched the offices of the federally owned kfw bank wednesday .

germany 's rescue package was similar to measures taken by governments across europe .

those conditions include bayernlb limiting executive pay to 500,000 euros .
it will also send any dividend payments to the state .
and the government will get the right to review any lending practices seen as risky .
the bank also has to promise to continue making loans to small- and medium-sized companies .
bayernlb is germany 's second biggest regional bank .
it posted 770 million euros in losses during the first three months of 2008 .
that forced shareholders to come up with 4.8 billion euros in loan guarantees .
the state link allowed regional banks to offer lower credit rates .
when the european commission cut back on that privilege in 2005 , the banks began engaging in risky investments as a way to keep making money .

" rwe will participate in projects outside germany .
it depends on financing and on what partner we find .
but i think that three to five -lrb- projects -rrb- are in the pipeline , " chief executive juergen grossmann told the daily sueddeutsche zeitung newspaper .
essen-based rwe was one of " a small handful of power suppliers in europe with competence in nuclear plants , " he said .
grossmann did not give any indications where these projects would be built .
nuclear powerhouse rwe has been operating nuclear stations in germany since the 1960s .
nuclear power , which accounts for 30 percent of all power in germany , is currently being phased out .
rwe 's biblis plant will be allowed to operate until 2012 and its newest plant in emsland will have to go offline in about 2020 .
rwe , along with its subsidiaries , provides electricity to more than 20 million people and gas to 10 million .
most of its customers are in europe .
earlier this month , bulgaria chose rwe as the winning bidder for 49-percent stake in the belene power company , which will finance and run a four-billion-euro -lrb- $ 5.1-billion -rrb- nuclear plant near the northern town of belene . dw staff -lrb- th -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

now the question is : can the two bury the hatchet ? ballack 's broadside came in a newspaper interview , when he was asked about loew 's decision not to play veteran midfielder torsten frings in germany 's recent world cup qualifiers against russia and wales .
" respect and loyalty are the least one can expect as a veteran national player , " the germany captain told the frankfurter allgemeine zeitung .
ballack went on to name other examples of players he felt were squeezed out of the team without being given a fair chance .
at the head of his list was former national goalkeeper ollie kahn , who was demoted by loew 's predecessor , juergen klinsmann .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : frings has recently had an unwelcome new role in loew 's squad " a competition with jens lehmann was proclaimed that , to my eyes , he could n't win , " ballack said .
" the same was true with -lsb- defender -rsb- christian woerns who , in contrast to christoph metzelder , stayed true to one team and was n't sitting on the bench . "
ballack even defended striker kevin kuranyi , whom loew booted out of the squad entirely after kuranyi abandoned the team in response to not being nominated .
" -lsb- kuranyi -rsb- saw that it was going to be very difficult for him , even though he plays year in , year out in the champions league and has been a regular starter for a top bundesliga club for quite some time , " ballack said .
" those are important criteria for the national team , " the germany captain added .
" where will we end up if things like that no longer count ? "
surprise and disappointment bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the hero of germany 's recent win over wales was 24-year-old piotr trochowski loew seemed to be taken off guard by the verbal blasts from his most important player and representative on the pitch .
" i 'm fundamentally surprised that he chose to go public like this , " loew told the daily bild newspaper .
" and i 'm disappointed that he 's trying to affect personnel decisions in this way . "
loew said he had been up front with veteran players about their chances in the national side and insisted that it was up to him as coach to decide who played and who did n't .
loew stressed that he still wants ballack as team captain and would try to work through their differences .
but the coach admitted he did n't know precisely how or when to approach his angry star .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : kuranyi has almost certainly played his last match for loew " i want to think about the form in which i 'll talk to michael , " loew said .
" on principle i do n't tolerate interference .
but there will be a discussion .
not a few days from now , but very soon . "
the outcome of that chat may determine whether ballack is nominated for germany 's upcoming friendly against england .
" all our players know the rules concerning public criticism , " loew said .
bosses back loew bildunterschrift : ballack also feuded with germany team manager oliver bierhoff at euro 2008 germany 's football functionaries were quick to back the coach .
" this constant complaining ! " said german soccer association vice-president and soccer legend frank beckenbauer in a television interview .
" they 've become a pack of wimps - unbelievable !
they should shut their mouths and play soccer . "
german soccer association president theo zwanziger seconded those sentiments .

" the development of our national team over the past few years has been absolutely positive so i do n't understand at all why there should be criticism of joachim loew coming from the team via the media , " zwanziger said .
but while germany could thrive without players like frings and kuranyi , there is little question that the national side needs ballack , its on-the-field leader and most technically gifted player .

now the question is : can the two bury the hatchet ? ballack 's broadside came in a newspaper interview , when he was asked about loew 's decision not to play veteran midfielder torsten frings in germany 's recent world cup qualifiers against russia and wales .
" respect and loyalty are the least one can expect as a veteran national player , " the germany captain told the frankfurter allgemeine zeitung .
ballack went on to name other examples of players he felt were squeezed out of the team without being given a fair chance .
at the head of his list was former national goalkeeper ollie kahn , who was demoted by loew 's predecessor , juergen klinsmann .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : frings has recently had an unwelcome new role in loew 's squad " a competition with jens lehmann was proclaimed that , to my eyes , he could n't win , " ballack said .
" the same was true with -lsb- defender -rsb- christian woerns who , in contrast to christoph metzelder , stayed true to one team and was n't sitting on the bench . "
ballack even defended striker kevin kuranyi , whom loew booted out of the squad entirely after kuranyi abandoned the team in response to not being nominated .
" -lsb- kuranyi -rsb- saw that it was going to be very difficult for him , even though he plays year in , year out in the champions league and has been a regular starter for a top bundesliga club for quite some time , " ballack said .
" those are important criteria for the national team , " the germany captain added .
" where will we end up if things like that no longer count ? "
surprise and disappointment bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the hero of germany 's recent win over wales was 24-year-old piotr trochowski loew seemed to be taken off guard by the verbal blasts from his most important player and representative on the pitch .
" i 'm fundamentally surprised that he chose to go public like this , " loew told the daily bild newspaper .
" and i 'm disappointed that he 's trying to affect personnel decisions in this way . "
loew said he had been up front with veteran players about their chances in the national side and insisted that it was up to him as coach to decide who played and who did n't .
loew stressed that he still wants ballack as team captain and would try to work through their differences .
but the coach admitted he did n't know precisely how or when to approach his angry star .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : kuranyi has almost certainly played his last match for loew " i want to think about the form in which i 'll talk to michael , " loew said .
" on principle i do n't tolerate interference .
but there will be a discussion .
not a few days from now , but very soon . "
the outcome of that chat may determine whether ballack is nominated for germany 's upcoming friendly against england .
" all our players know the rules concerning public criticism , " loew said .
bosses back loew bildunterschrift : ballack also feuded with germany team manager oliver bierhoff at euro 2008 germany 's football functionaries were quick to back the coach .
" this constant complaining ! " said german soccer association vice-president and soccer legend frank beckenbauer in a television interview .
" they 've become a pack of wimps - unbelievable !
they should shut their mouths and play soccer . "
german soccer association president theo zwanziger seconded those sentiments .
" i 'm disappointed by michael ballack 's behavior , " zwanziger said .
" this has created a difficult and complicated situation . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ballack will likely only see a yellow card for his latest ourburst zwanziger also stressed that germany under loew was headed in the right direction .
" the development of our national team over the past few years has been absolutely positive so i do n't understand at all why there should be criticism of joachim loew coming from the team via the media , " zwanziger said .
but while germany could thrive without players like frings and kuranyi , there is little question that the national side needs ballack , its on-the-field leader and most technically gifted player .
so loew may have no other choice but to forgive , or simply ignore , ballack 's attacks . dw staff -lrb- jc -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

22 .
she said she wants the summit to lift the country out of its learning rut . prize-winning economist and education researcher ludger woessmann , of the ifo institute in munich , argued that a radical change toward increased competition is the best way to offer a broader array of students a more even shot at education .
he added that fairness dictates that university students help pay their own way . dw-world : is this education summit a serious effort toward policy change , or more of a political gambit on the part of angela merkel ? ludger woessmann : initially , chancellor merkel raised a lot of expectations , and i think she honestly wanted to achieve something at the summit .
but it is becoming more obvious that there wo n't be any huge results that come out of it .
it 's a big disappointment . why do you say that ? at first she said that education is the key precondition to equality in our social market economy , and that she would make education her priority .
the fact is that in germany , more than in almost any other western country , education is tied to social background .
so fixing education is the key to allowing everyone to accept and participate in the social market economy . now it seems the heads of the -lrb- individual german states -rrb- have called her back to reality .
according to the constitution , the federal government has basically no say at all in education topics .
it is the business of the states .
and they are just playing political games to make sure the federal government does n't get any influence . what kind of influence should the federal government have ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german education is free - and classes are full i think it would be important to have a federal school evaluation system , as a first step to see how each state has performed .
it would make them accountable for what they do , and would create huge incentives to do better , to try harder .
it would put politicians under pressure to perform . basically there are two problems that need to be dealt with : one is that we do a pretty mediocre job on international comparative tests like pisa -lrb- an international , triennial study that compares the high-school students ' abilities - eds -rrb- .
the other problem is that education results are so strongly tied to family background . so how should the government - federal or state - deal with these problems ? i think more autonomy for individual schools is needed .
at the moment public schools have no autonomy in choosing their own staff .
teachers are largely assigned by central bureaucracies .
and there is clear evidence that that holds back the quality of education . more generally , i think something that would lead the way forward would be to create more choice and competition between schools by setting private schools on the same funding level as public schools . you mean switching to a system that the us would call charter schools ? not really .
charter schools in the us are just public schools that have more autonomy .
i am talking here about , maybe , church-run schools .
you have to remember that we do n't have the separation of church and state that the us has in terms of accepting funding . what we have seen empirically is that school systems perform best when schools are financed by the states , using little private funding , but operated largely by private initiatives . the model is a system like the netherlands , where three-quarters of students go to schools that are not operated by the state , but mostly by churches and other charities .
these schools benefit the low income children the most .
it gives them the opportunity to attend privately operated schools regardless of how much money the parents have . they are rare , but there are a few private schools in germany . right - and that is the problem .
because what we see in international comparisons is that systematically , students perform better in countries that build more on private school operations .
not private funding , but operations . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : woessmann eyes education 's economic impact in the netherlands ... the schools are all funded in the same way , and they get exactly the same amount of money per student as the public school gets .
that creates choice for parents .
it makes schools start to compete with each other in a way that helps students . and what do you see as a remedy for the problem of socio-economic bias ? one thing is clear that the early tracking of students into different types of schools at such an early age - right now they are tracked at age 10 , in the fourth grade - decreases the quality of performance in germany .
we can systematically see that this tracking does nothing to improve performance .
it just makes outcomes more strongly dependent on family background . we should delay the tracking , and reduce the tracking into just two levels , if at all .
but this is such a politically charged topic in germany that they wo n't even dare to discuss it at the summit . the subject of educational tracking is a real political hot potato and has been for years .
what are the chances it is changed ? it has been debated since the 70s .
and it divides people along party lines .
it is one of those things where the federalist structure of germany makes any big , sweeping change impossible . is there anything you think will , in fact , be dealt with at the summit ? well , the final thing that research tells us would actually increase opportunity and performance in general is to put more focus on early childhood education .
it is something germany has slowly moved into , and will probably be discussed at the summit .
but i don ’ t expect there will be any big news . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : low-income kids often get a worse start in germany right now , germany focuses on providing child care instead of early education per se - there is hardly any educational content in the preschool programs .
but more and more people are becoming aware of how important it is to introduce learning and educational goals at an early age .
it would help people who do n't have an educational environment at home . a recent oecd study shows low rates of university attendance in germany compared with elsewhere in europe .
what is behind that ? part of it is definitely due to this problem of early tracking .
it makes sure that a lot of very bright children from low socioeconomic backgrounds do not go into the " gymnasium , " the one track that leads straight to university . another is that we have a very strong vocational education system .
historically , more than half the students in each grade would go into the apprenticeship track . but a lot of people have not realized that the world has changed .
the vocational system is n't as safe and lucrative as it once was , because of globalization .
a lot of the medium-skilled jobs are outsourced into eastern europe or asia . german universities used to be free of charge , but recently some states introduced tuition fees .
some people are arguing that this makes it hard for low-income students to study .
what do you think ? i think that in general it makes a lot of sense to have students pay at least some fees for the university .
at the moment we make parents pay more for their child 's preschool than for a university degree .
this is kind of ridiculous - it is both inefficient and unfair . it is inefficient in the sense that the earlier you invest public money , the higher the returns will be .
so you can actually change the whole track of children 's if you make sure that early on they get a better education . it is unfair because in the current system , you make the state pay for a university education , which at the moment is much more open to children from rich families than from low-income families .
so in a sense , by funding the system with taxes , you are making low-income people pay for the university education of children of rich families . i think what is strongly needed , and what has really been missing , is to accompany these tuition fees - and we are talking about 500 euros per semester , or 1,000 euros per year -lrb- $ 650 or $ 1,300 -rrb- , which is nothing compared to the us or the uk - by easy , income-contingent loans at the same time .
so people could pay back the loans later on , if and when they are successful in the labor market . interview : jennifer abramsohn send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

so fixing education is the key to allowing everyone to accept and participate in the social market economy . now it seems the heads of the -lrb- individual german states -rrb- have called her back to reality .
according to the constitution , the federal government has basically no say at all in education topics .
it is the business of the states .
and they are just playing political games to make sure the federal government does n't get any influence . what kind of influence should the federal government have ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german education is free - and classes are full i think it would be important to have a federal school evaluation system , as a first step to see how each state has performed .
it would make them accountable for what they do , and would create huge incentives to do better , to try harder .
it would put politicians under pressure to perform . basically there are two problems that need to be dealt with : one is that we do a pretty mediocre job on international comparative tests like pisa -lrb- an international , triennial study that compares the high-school students ' abilities - eds -rrb- .
the other problem is that education results are so strongly tied to family background . so how should the government - federal or state - deal with these problems ? i think more autonomy for individual schools is needed .
at the moment public schools have no autonomy in choosing their own staff .
teachers are largely assigned by central bureaucracies .
and there is clear evidence that that holds back the quality of education . more generally , i think something that would lead the way forward would be to create more choice and competition between schools by setting private schools on the same funding level as public schools . you mean switching to a system that the us would call charter schools ? not really .
charter schools in the us are just public schools that have more autonomy .
i am talking here about , maybe , church-run schools .
you have to remember that we do n't have the separation of church and state that the us has in terms of accepting funding . what we have seen empirically is that school systems perform best when schools are financed by the states , using little private funding , but operated largely by private initiatives . the model is a system like the netherlands , where three-quarters of students go to schools that are not operated by the state , but mostly by churches and other charities .
these schools benefit the low income children the most .
it gives them the opportunity to attend privately operated schools regardless of how much money the parents have . they are rare , but there are a few private schools in germany . right - and that is the problem .
because what we see in international comparisons is that systematically , students perform better in countries that build more on private school operations .
not private funding , but operations . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : woessmann eyes education 's economic impact in the netherlands ... the schools are all funded in the same way , and they get exactly the same amount of money per student as the public school gets .
that creates choice for parents .
it makes schools start to compete with each other in a way that helps students . and what do you see as a remedy for the problem of socio-economic bias ? one thing is clear that the early tracking of students into different types of schools at such an early age - right now they are tracked at age 10 , in the fourth grade - decreases the quality of performance in germany .
we can systematically see that this tracking does nothing to improve performance .
it just makes outcomes more strongly dependent on family background . we should delay the tracking , and reduce the tracking into just two levels , if at all .
but this is such a politically charged topic in germany that they wo n't even dare to discuss it at the summit . the subject of educational tracking is a real political hot potato and has been for years .
what are the chances it is changed ? it has been debated since the 70s .
and it divides people along party lines .
it is one of those things where the federalist structure of germany makes any big , sweeping change impossible . is there anything you think will , in fact , be dealt with at the summit ? well , the final thing that research tells us would actually increase opportunity and performance in general is to put more focus on early childhood education .
it is something germany has slowly moved into , and will probably be discussed at the summit .
but i don ’ t expect there will be any big news . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : low-income kids often get a worse start in germany right now , germany focuses on providing child care instead of early education per se - there is hardly any educational content in the preschool programs .
but more and more people are becoming aware of how important it is to introduce learning and educational goals at an early age .
it would help people who do n't have an educational environment at home . a recent oecd study shows low rates of university attendance in germany compared with elsewhere in europe .
what is behind that ? part of it is definitely due to this problem of early tracking .
it makes sure that a lot of very bright children from low socioeconomic backgrounds do not go into the " gymnasium , " the one track that leads straight to university . another is that we have a very strong vocational education system .
historically , more than half the students in each grade would go into the apprenticeship track . but a lot of people have not realized that the world has changed .
the vocational system is n't as safe and lucrative as it once was , because of globalization .
a lot of the medium-skilled jobs are outsourced into eastern europe or asia . german universities used to be free of charge , but recently some states introduced tuition fees .
some people are arguing that this makes it hard for low-income students to study .
what do you think ? i think that in general it makes a lot of sense to have students pay at least some fees for the university .
at the moment we make parents pay more for their child 's preschool than for a university degree .
this is kind of ridiculous - it is both inefficient and unfair . it is inefficient in the sense that the earlier you invest public money , the higher the returns will be .
so you can actually change the whole track of children 's if you make sure that early on they get a better education . it is unfair because in the current system , you make the state pay for a university education , which at the moment is much more open to children from rich families than from low-income families .
so in a sense , by funding the system with taxes , you are making low-income people pay for the university education of children of rich families . i think what is strongly needed , and what has really been missing , is to accompany these tuition fees - and we are talking about 500 euros per semester , or 1,000 euros per year -lrb- $ 650 or $ 1,300 -rrb- , which is nothing compared to the us or the uk - by easy , income-contingent loans at the same time .
so people could pay back the loans later on , if and when they are successful in the labor market . interview : jennifer abramsohn send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the case relates to the killing of 203 civilians near civitella , a town in italy 's central apennine mountain region , on june 29 , 1944 .
the rome-based court 's ruling came following a hearing in which a lawyer representing germany , augusto dossena , stated that his client was exempt from such payments under agreements signed by the rome and berlin governments in 1947 and 1961 .
" germany does not question the responsibility of its soldiers and officers who tarnished themselves with ferocious war crimes , " said dossena , who , according to the ansa news agency , also explained that berlin has made past payments amounting to 800,000 euros -lrb- $ 1.07 million -rrb- in connection with the civitella massacre .

the case relates to the killing of 203 civilians near civitella , a town in italy 's central apennine mountain region , on june 29 , 1944 .
the rome-based court 's ruling came following a hearing in which a lawyer representing germany , augusto dossena , stated that his client was exempt from such payments under agreements signed by the rome and berlin governments in 1947 and 1961 .
" germany does not question the responsibility of its soldiers and officers who tarnished themselves with ferocious war crimes , " said dossena , who , according to the ansa news agency , also explained that berlin has made past payments amounting to 800,000 euros -lrb- $ 1.07 million -rrb- in connection with the civitella massacre .
but dossena said ordering germany to pay damages would violate international agreements and pave the way for thousands of people to seek war crime compensation on an individual basis . dpa news agency -lrb- th -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the board met in munich on tuesday , oct .
21 , and decided to " apply for stabilization measures , " said bavaria 's state finance minister , erwin huber , who heads bayernlb 's governing board .
huber , 62 , announced on wedesday that he is stepping down as finance minister because of the bayernlb debacle .
the southern regional bank is jointly owned by the state of bavaria and regional savings banks .
the bank ran into trouble more than a year ago due to its heavy investment in asset-backed securities .
these securities lost much of their value when the us market for high-risk mortgages collapsed in 2007 .
as the bank was recovering from this loss , it was hit a second time when interbank loans dried up in mid-september .
in addition , german regional bank westlb is reportedly also eyeing the government bank rescue plan . separately , german police led by prosecutors searched the offices of the federally owned kfw bank wednesday .
this action was part of an investigation into the transfer of 319 million euros to us bank lehman brothers , the day after the financial crisis triggered the new york-based financial house 's collapsed .
deal comes with strings attached bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german banks are still trying to find their balance germany 's federal government approved a 500-billion-euro federal rescue package on friday .
germany 's rescue package was similar to measures taken by governments across europe .
on monday , the cabinet finalized the conditions banks must follow if they want to make use of the rescue package .
those conditions include bayernlb limiting executive pay to 500,000 euros .
it will also send any dividend payments to the state .
and the government will get the right to review any lending practices seen as risky .
the bank also has to promise to continue making loans to small- and medium-sized companies .
bayernlb is germany 's second biggest regional bank .
it posted 770 million euros in losses during the first three months of 2008 .
that forced shareholders to come up with 4.8 billion euros in loan guarantees .
the state link allowed regional banks to offer lower credit rates .
when the european commission cut back on that privilege in 2005 , the banks began engaging in risky investments as a way to keep making money .
other banks holding off bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the government has thrown banks a lifeline but the era of the landesbank could be coming to a close , merck finck analyst konrad becker told afp news agency .
" their business model does not work any more , " becker said .
" the era when each state had its own bank is over . "
other landesbanken have not said whether they will also ask for a bailout .
an hsh nordbank spokesman said on tuesday that no decision had been made .
a spokesman for the landesbank berlin said that there were currently no plans to take the rescue package .
other banks were similarly uncommitted , according to afp .

now the question is : can the two bury the hatchet ? ballack 's broadside came in a newspaper interview , when he was asked about loew 's decision not to play veteran midfielder torsten frings in germany 's recent world cup qualifiers against russia and wales .
" respect and loyalty are the least one can expect as a veteran national player , " the germany captain told the frankfurter allgemeine zeitung .
ballack went on to name other examples of players he felt were squeezed out of the team without being given a fair chance .
at the head of his list was former national goalkeeper ollie kahn , who was demoted by loew 's predecessor , juergen klinsmann .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : frings has recently had an unwelcome new role in loew 's squad " a competition with jens lehmann was proclaimed that , to my eyes , he could n't win , " ballack said .
" the same was true with -lsb- defender -rsb- christian woerns who , in contrast to christoph metzelder , stayed true to one team and was n't sitting on the bench . "
ballack even defended striker kevin kuranyi , whom loew booted out of the squad entirely after kuranyi abandoned the team in response to not being nominated .
" -lsb- kuranyi -rsb- saw that it was going to be very difficult for him , even though he plays year in , year out in the champions league and has been a regular starter for a top bundesliga club for quite some time , " ballack said .
" those are important criteria for the national team , " the germany captain added .
" where will we end up if things like that no longer count ? "
surprise and disappointment bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the hero of germany 's recent win over wales was 24-year-old piotr trochowski loew seemed to be taken off guard by the verbal blasts from his most important player and representative on the pitch .
" i 'm fundamentally surprised that he chose to go public like this , " loew told the daily bild newspaper .
" and i 'm disappointed that he 's trying to affect personnel decisions in this way . "
loew said he had been up front with veteran players about their chances in the national side and insisted that it was up to him as coach to decide who played and who did n't .
loew stressed that he still wants ballack as team captain and would try to work through their differences .
but the coach admitted he did n't know precisely how or when to approach his angry star .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : kuranyi has almost certainly played his last match for loew " i want to think about the form in which i 'll talk to michael , " loew said .
" on principle i do n't tolerate interference .
but there will be a discussion .
not a few days from now , but very soon . "
the outcome of that chat may determine whether ballack is nominated for germany 's upcoming friendly against england .
" all our players know the rules concerning public criticism , " loew said .
bosses back loew bildunterschrift : ballack also feuded with germany team manager oliver bierhoff at euro 2008 germany 's football functionaries were quick to back the coach .
" this constant complaining ! " said german soccer association vice-president and soccer legend frank beckenbauer in a television interview .
" they 've become a pack of wimps - unbelievable !
they should shut their mouths and play soccer . "
german soccer association president theo zwanziger seconded those sentiments .
" i 'm disappointed by michael ballack 's behavior , " zwanziger said .
" this has created a difficult and complicated situation . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ballack will likely only see a yellow card for his latest ourburst zwanziger also stressed that germany under loew was headed in the right direction .
" the development of our national team over the past few years has been absolutely positive so i do n't understand at all why there should be criticism of joachim loew coming from the team via the media , " zwanziger said .
but while germany could thrive without players like frings and kuranyi , there is little question that the national side needs ballack , its on-the-field leader and most technically gifted player .
so loew may have no other choice but to forgive , or simply ignore , ballack 's attacks . dw staff -lrb- jc -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de immigration -pipe- 22.10.2008 europe agrees to blue card for skilled migrants großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the blue card would be a ticket to the eu job market european union officials agreed to develop a so-called blue card , a fast-track work visa they hope will attract skilled migrant workers from devleoping countries .
engineers and health care workers are in high demand . in a bid to attract high-skilled workers from developing countries , the european union will push forward a blue card scheme , an eu official told reuters news agency .
the blue card , which will be good for up to four years , will speed up the application process and make it easier for workers to bring families , get housing and acquire long-term resident status .
the eu hopes that the coordinated system for allocating work permits will allow the eu to compete with other western countries for educated migrants such as technology workers and hospital staff .
as europe grows older , the shortage of skilled professionals is expected to increase .
currently , skilled workers make up less than 2 percent of migrants in the eu .
that 's compared with 10 percent of migrants in australia , 7.3 percent in canada and 3.2 percent in the united states , according to eu data .
restrictions on placement the blue card would allow an immigrant to work in one eu country .
after the first 18 months , the worker could then move to another country , but would still have to apply for a new blue card within a month of arrival .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany , like other eu countries , is short on engineers some say that these limitations , insisted on by countries such as germany , will make the scheme less attractive as the card will not allow blue card job seekers to move freely within the eu .
" it is clearly a step in the right direction but i do n't expect it to be a big success because if you compare it to the united states , a similar title gives access to the whole us market , " jakob von weizsaecker , a german labor market specialist with the brussels-based bruegel economic policy think tank told reuters .

germany 's federal government and the premiers of the country 's 16 states agreed at a one-day education summit in dresden to hugely boost spending on education and research to 10 percent of gross domestic production -lrb- gdp -rrb- by 2015 .
" we recognise that people are the biggest resource we have , " merkel said at a news conference after the " education summit " .
" prosperity for all means education for everyone , " she said .
but a dispute remained over who was to pay : the 16 states or berlin .
long-term unemployment was worst in sections of the population which had not completed schooling , merkel said .
annual oecd reports have criticized german schools for failing the children of the poor and ethnic minorities , even though higher-status children are well educated .
german universities have been criticized for making entry too difficult .
raising education spending to 7 per cent of gdp and research spending to 3 per cent would mean annual increases of between 25 billion and 60 billion euros -lrb- at least $ 32 billion -rrb- , experts said .
the federal government has only limited authority over education , with the states reluctant to give up their powers . dpa news agency -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?
dw-world.de private schools could rescue ailing german system , expert says a german expert on education and economics said he has little hope that wednesday 's summit between chancellor angela merkel and state education ministers will bring about change - even though it is sorely needed .
-lrb- 22.10.2008 -rrb- german education spending below other nations : oecd report germany is falling behind in producing qualified university graduates because average public spending on higher education is well behind most other western nations , a new report said this week .

how typical - and how threatening - are converts like eric breininger ? officials from germany 's federal office of criminal investigation -lrb- bka -rrb- confirmed on wednesday , oct.22 , that the six minute video of breininger , who is wanted as a suspected member of a terrorist group , was indeed genuine .
" we assume that came from the international jihad union -lrb- iju -rrb- , " a bka spokesperson told the dpa news agency .
the iju is a radical islamist organization that originated in uzbekistan and has been linked with attempted terrorist acts in germany four weeks ago , the bka launched a public search for breiniger after rumors surfaced that he was in the balkans and on his way back to germany . but they withdrew the warning over the weekend .
also on wednesday , oct 22 , the police also arrested the younger brother of one of three men accused of planning attacks last year on us citizens and interests using chemical-filled drums , the 21-year-old turk , named only as burhan y. , was arrested at langen south of frankfurt and is a suspected helper for the banned iju .
" germany should expect attacks " in the video , the 21-year-old breininger discussed his whereabouts and motivation .
" i am located in afghanistan and am not personally planning an attack on germany , " breininger said in the video , before adding : " we declare war on every country that fights alongside america against muslims . "
but breininger also said that as long as german soldiers are in afghanistan and uzbekistan , “ germany should expect attacks , " without giving any further details .
shown in the video wearing a turban and carrying a kalashnikov , breininger hinted that he may be preparing to sacrifice his life for his cause .
" if allah wishes , he will call me to him as a jidhadi , " he said .
so how did a young man from a suburban town in southern germany become a fanatic apparently willing to die for his religious beliefs in afghanistan ?
fateful turn bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a poster published by germany 's federal office of criminal investigation shows eric breininger according to various reports in the german media , breininger 's parents divorced when he was an adolescent , and he reportedly started using hashish and alcohol at a relatively early age .
he was prone to getting into fights and had trouble with the police .
in late 2006 , breininger got a job for a package-delivery company , where he met a pakistani who got him interested in radical islam .
a short time later , he also became friends with a radical islamic convert named daniel schneider .
breininger began calling himself abdul ghaffar el almani , avoiding his old friends and burning his cds .
he swore off drugs and alcohol .
he married in a mosque , and his wife eva p. wore a veil .
the marriage was short-lived .
" he wanted me to clean and cook and said he was looking for another woman , " eva p. later said in a television interview .
in june 2007 , breininger sold off most of his belongings on ebay , saying he wanted to go abroad and learn arabic , and moved in with schneider .
in september , schneider , who had relocated to the western german region of sauerland , was arrested along with two other suspected islamists for allegedly trying to make car bombs and planning attacks on us targets in germany .
breininger disappeared before police could detain him .
police suspect breininger has since received training in a terrorist camp , possibly in pakistan .
both german and american military forces in afghanistan are reported to have distributed pictures of him , warning that he is a potential suicide attacker .
how big a danger ?
the breininger case raises the question of how great a threat german converts to islam pose .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : police arrested a suspected member of the so-called " sauerland terror group " last year " converts can be more easily radicalized , " kai hirschmann of germany 's institute for terrorism research and study told a internet news site around the time of scheider 's arrest .
" as ' novices ' they try to be more religious than even the religious leaders , " hirschmann added .
" that often makes them especially fanatical and also especially dangerous . "
other experts , however , disagree with that assessment .
" you ca n't say that conversion to islam carries an explicit tendency toward becoming a radical , " stefan reichmuth , professor of islamic studies at the university of bochum told dw-world.de. estimates of the number of german converts to islam range between 15,000 and 80,000 .
but germany 's muslim league says that , of them , only about 25 fit the description of being radical or dangerously fanatic .
germany , which opposed the 2003 us-led invasion of iraq and has more than 3,000 troops in afghanistan under nato command , has tightened security and surveillance in response to the threat of attacks by islamic extremists .
the closest germany came to an attack was in july 2006 when suitcases containing homemade bombs were placed on two regional trains passing through cologne 's busy main train station .
they failed to detonate .
the september 11 , 2001 attacks on the united states were planned by an al-qaeda cell in the northern german city of hamburg led by mohammed atta , one of the hijackers of the planes involved in the attacks . dw staff -lrb- jc -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

but breininger also said that as long as german soldiers are in afghanistan and uzbekistan , “ germany should expect attacks , " without giving any further details .
shown in the video wearing a turban and carrying a kalashnikov , breininger hinted that he may be preparing to sacrifice his life for his cause .
" if allah wishes , he will call me to him as a jidhadi , " he said .
so how did a young man from a suburban town in southern germany become a fanatic apparently willing to die for his religious beliefs in afghanistan ?
fateful turn bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a poster published by germany 's federal office of criminal investigation shows eric breininger according to various reports in the german media , breininger 's parents divorced when he was an adolescent , and he reportedly started using hashish and alcohol at a relatively early age .
he was prone to getting into fights and had trouble with the police .
in late 2006 , breininger got a job for a package-delivery company , where he met a pakistani who got him interested in radical islam .
a short time later , he also became friends with a radical islamic convert named daniel schneider .
breininger began calling himself abdul ghaffar el almani , avoiding his old friends and burning his cds .
he swore off drugs and alcohol .
he married in a mosque , and his wife eva p. wore a veil .
the marriage was short-lived .
" he wanted me to clean and cook and said he was looking for another woman , " eva p. later said in a television interview .
in june 2007 , breininger sold off most of his belongings on ebay , saying he wanted to go abroad and learn arabic , and moved in with schneider .
in september , schneider , who had relocated to the western german region of sauerland , was arrested along with two other suspected islamists for allegedly trying to make car bombs and planning attacks on us targets in germany .
breininger disappeared before police could detain him .
police suspect breininger has since received training in a terrorist camp , possibly in pakistan .
both german and american military forces in afghanistan are reported to have distributed pictures of him , warning that he is a potential suicide attacker .
how big a danger ?
the breininger case raises the question of how great a threat german converts to islam pose .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : police arrested a suspected member of the so-called " sauerland terror group " last year " converts can be more easily radicalized , " kai hirschmann of germany 's institute for terrorism research and study told a internet news site around the time of scheider 's arrest .
" as ' novices ' they try to be more religious than even the religious leaders , " hirschmann added .
" that often makes them especially fanatical and also especially dangerous . "
other experts , however , disagree with that assessment .
" you ca n't say that conversion to islam carries an explicit tendency toward becoming a radical , " stefan reichmuth , professor of islamic studies at the university of bochum told dw-world.de. estimates of the number of german converts to islam range between 15,000 and 80,000 .
but germany 's muslim league says that , of them , only about 25 fit the description of being radical or dangerously fanatic .
germany , which opposed the 2003 us-led invasion of iraq and has more than 3,000 troops in afghanistan under nato command , has tightened security and surveillance in response to the threat of attacks by islamic extremists .
the closest germany came to an attack was in july 2006 when suitcases containing homemade bombs were placed on two regional trains passing through cologne 's busy main train station .
they failed to detonate .

" the total far exceeded the $ 3.2 billion that the world bank had estimated georgia would need to rebuild its infrastructure , settle its refugees and get its economy back on track . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : georgian premier lado gurgenidze was satisfied with the conference 's result georgian prime minister lado gurgenidze , who attended the one-day donor conference in brussels , told reporters afterwards that his country was " deeply moved and humbled by the demonstration of solidarity that we have received . " " $ 4.5 billion far exceeds the expectations that we had ... at a time like this to show such support is something that no georgian will ever forget , " gurgenidze said . us the biggest donor the united states , which pledged a billion dollars over three years , was the biggest donor at the meeting of 67 nations and major financial institutions , followed by substantial donations from the european commission and japan . eu commission chief jose manuel barroso said the global community had a " moral imperative " to help conflict-hit georiga as he spoke of the commission 's pledge of 500 million euros over three years for reconstruction . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ferrero-waldner , right , with france 's foreign minister kouchner at the donor conference japan pledged $ 200 million in aid over three years , while the international monetary fund has promised a 750-million-euro financial package . germany 's deputy foreign minister gernot erler announced 33.7 million euros while sweden , according to a japanese aide , pledged 40 million euros .
france offered seven million euros . the funds are to be used exclusively for civilian purposes such as rebuilding transport and energy infrastructure .
the hope is to restore economic growth in georgia to pre-conflict levels of more than 10 percent by 2010 . continuing tensions russia launched military attacks against georgia in early august , after tbilisi used military force against ethnic russian separatists in south ossetia . russian prime minister vladimir putin later told an american television network that he suspected washington of encouraging the georgian offensive , which coincided with the democratic primary , in an attempt to influence the course of us national elections . washington denied the charge .
russia has since recognized the independence of abkhazia and south ossetia .
the west , as well as tbilisi , has staunchly insisted that they remain part of georgia . little hope for the displaced although funds donated could , theoretically , also be directed toward abkhazia and south ossetia , there is little chance of that happening while the two breakaway regions are under de facto russia control . fighting between the various sides in the conflict left some 65,000 people displaced , among them around 30,000 ethnic georgians forced to leave the breakaway regions . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : refugees have little chance at present of going home but the european commission has said the prospects of such people ever returning to their homes are extremely bleak . meanwhile , the georgian government has welcomed financial assistance to compensate for war damage suffered by its citizenry and to revive the country 's economy . georgian foreign minister eka tkeshelashvili earlier told the afp news agency that aid money would be spent " so that georgia is back on track as the economic success story that we used to be prior to the war .

22 .
she said she wants the summit to lift the country out of its learning rut . prize-winning economist and education researcher ludger woessmann , of the ifo institute in munich , argued that a radical change toward increased competition is the best way to offer a broader array of students a more even shot at education .
he added that fairness dictates that university students help pay their own way . dw-world : is this education summit a serious effort toward policy change , or more of a political gambit on the part of angela merkel ? ludger woessmann : initially , chancellor merkel raised a lot of expectations , and i think she honestly wanted to achieve something at the summit .
but it is becoming more obvious that there wo n't be any huge results that come out of it .
it 's a big disappointment . why do you say that ? at first she said that education is the key precondition to equality in our social market economy , and that she would make education her priority .
the fact is that in germany , more than in almost any other western country , education is tied to social background .
so fixing education is the key to allowing everyone to accept and participate in the social market economy . now it seems the heads of the -lrb- individual german states -rrb- have called her back to reality .
according to the constitution , the federal government has basically no say at all in education topics .
it is the business of the states .
and they are just playing political games to make sure the federal government does n't get any influence . what kind of influence should the federal government have ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german education is free - and classes are full i think it would be important to have a federal school evaluation system , as a first step to see how each state has performed .
it would make them accountable for what they do , and would create huge incentives to do better , to try harder .
it would put politicians under pressure to perform . basically there are two problems that need to be dealt with : one is that we do a pretty mediocre job on international comparative tests like pisa -lrb- an international , triennial study that compares the high-school students ' abilities - eds -rrb- .
the other problem is that education results are so strongly tied to family background . so how should the government - federal or state - deal with these problems ? i think more autonomy for individual schools is needed .
at the moment public schools have no autonomy in choosing their own staff .
teachers are largely assigned by central bureaucracies .
and there is clear evidence that that holds back the quality of education . more generally , i think something that would lead the way forward would be to create more choice and competition between schools by setting private schools on the same funding level as public schools . you mean switching to a system that the us would call charter schools ? not really .
charter schools in the us are just public schools that have more autonomy .
i am talking here about , maybe , church-run schools .
you have to remember that we do n't have the separation of church and state that the us has in terms of accepting funding . what we have seen empirically is that school systems perform best when schools are financed by the states , using little private funding , but operated largely by private initiatives . the model is a system like the netherlands , where three-quarters of students go to schools that are not operated by the state , but mostly by churches and other charities .
these schools benefit the low income children the most .
it gives them the opportunity to attend privately operated schools regardless of how much money the parents have . they are rare , but there are a few private schools in germany . right - and that is the problem .
because what we see in international comparisons is that systematically , students perform better in countries that build more on private school operations .
not private funding , but operations . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : woessmann eyes education 's economic impact in the netherlands ... the schools are all funded in the same way , and they get exactly the same amount of money per student as the public school gets .
that creates choice for parents .
it makes schools start to compete with each other in a way that helps students . and what do you see as a remedy for the problem of socio-economic bias ? one thing is clear that the early tracking of students into different types of schools at such an early age - right now they are tracked at age 10 , in the fourth grade - decreases the quality of performance in germany .
we can systematically see that this tracking does nothing to improve performance .
it just makes outcomes more strongly dependent on family background . we should delay the tracking , and reduce the tracking into just two levels , if at all .
but this is such a politically charged topic in germany that they wo n't even dare to discuss it at the summit . the subject of educational tracking is a real political hot potato and has been for years .
what are the chances it is changed ? it has been debated since the 70s .
and it divides people along party lines .
it is one of those things where the federalist structure of germany makes any big , sweeping change impossible . is there anything you think will , in fact , be dealt with at the summit ? well , the final thing that research tells us would actually increase opportunity and performance in general is to put more focus on early childhood education .
it is something germany has slowly moved into , and will probably be discussed at the summit .
but i don ’ t expect there will be any big news . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : low-income kids often get a worse start in germany right now , germany focuses on providing child care instead of early education per se - there is hardly any educational content in the preschool programs .
but more and more people are becoming aware of how important it is to introduce learning and educational goals at an early age .
it would help people who do n't have an educational environment at home . a recent oecd study shows low rates of university attendance in germany compared with elsewhere in europe .
what is behind that ? part of it is definitely due to this problem of early tracking .
it makes sure that a lot of very bright children from low socioeconomic backgrounds do not go into the " gymnasium , " the one track that leads straight to university . another is that we have a very strong vocational education system .
historically , more than half the students in each grade would go into the apprenticeship track . but a lot of people have not realized that the world has changed .
the vocational system is n't as safe and lucrative as it once was , because of globalization .
a lot of the medium-skilled jobs are outsourced into eastern europe or asia . german universities used to be free of charge , but recently some states introduced tuition fees .
some people are arguing that this makes it hard for low-income students to study .
what do you think ? i think that in general it makes a lot of sense to have students pay at least some fees for the university .
at the moment we make parents pay more for their child 's preschool than for a university degree .
this is kind of ridiculous - it is both inefficient and unfair . it is inefficient in the sense that the earlier you invest public money , the higher the returns will be .
so you can actually change the whole track of children 's if you make sure that early on they get a better education . it is unfair because in the current system , you make the state pay for a university education , which at the moment is much more open to children from rich families than from low-income families .
so in a sense , by funding the system with taxes , you are making low-income people pay for the university education of children of rich families . i think what is strongly needed , and what has really been missing , is to accompany these tuition fees - and we are talking about 500 euros per semester , or 1,000 euros per year -lrb- $ 650 or $ 1,300 -rrb- , which is nothing compared to the us or the uk - by easy , income-contingent loans at the same time .
so people could pay back the loans later on , if and when they are successful in the labor market . interview : jennifer abramsohn send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

teachers are largely assigned by central bureaucracies .
and there is clear evidence that that holds back the quality of education . more generally , i think something that would lead the way forward would be to create more choice and competition between schools by setting private schools on the same funding level as public schools . you mean switching to a system that the us would call charter schools ? not really .
charter schools in the us are just public schools that have more autonomy .
i am talking here about , maybe , church-run schools .
you have to remember that we do n't have the separation of church and state that the us has in terms of accepting funding . what we have seen empirically is that school systems perform best when schools are financed by the states , using little private funding , but operated largely by private initiatives . the model is a system like the netherlands , where three-quarters of students go to schools that are not operated by the state , but mostly by churches and other charities .
these schools benefit the low income children the most .
it gives them the opportunity to attend privately operated schools regardless of how much money the parents have . they are rare , but there are a few private schools in germany . right - and that is the problem .
because what we see in international comparisons is that systematically , students perform better in countries that build more on private school operations .
not private funding , but operations . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : woessmann eyes education 's economic impact in the netherlands ... the schools are all funded in the same way , and they get exactly the same amount of money per student as the public school gets .
that creates choice for parents .
it makes schools start to compete with each other in a way that helps students . and what do you see as a remedy for the problem of socio-economic bias ? one thing is clear that the early tracking of students into different types of schools at such an early age - right now they are tracked at age 10 , in the fourth grade - decreases the quality of performance in germany .
we can systematically see that this tracking does nothing to improve performance .
it just makes outcomes more strongly dependent on family background . we should delay the tracking , and reduce the tracking into just two levels , if at all .
but this is such a politically charged topic in germany that they wo n't even dare to discuss it at the summit . the subject of educational tracking is a real political hot potato and has been for years .
what are the chances it is changed ? it has been debated since the 70s .
and it divides people along party lines .
it is one of those things where the federalist structure of germany makes any big , sweeping change impossible . is there anything you think will , in fact , be dealt with at the summit ? well , the final thing that research tells us would actually increase opportunity and performance in general is to put more focus on early childhood education .
it is something germany has slowly moved into , and will probably be discussed at the summit .
but i don ’ t expect there will be any big news . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : low-income kids often get a worse start in germany right now , germany focuses on providing child care instead of early education per se - there is hardly any educational content in the preschool programs .
but more and more people are becoming aware of how important it is to introduce learning and educational goals at an early age .
it would help people who do n't have an educational environment at home . a recent oecd study shows low rates of university attendance in germany compared with elsewhere in europe .
what is behind that ? part of it is definitely due to this problem of early tracking .
it makes sure that a lot of very bright children from low socioeconomic backgrounds do not go into the " gymnasium , " the one track that leads straight to university . another is that we have a very strong vocational education system .
historically , more than half the students in each grade would go into the apprenticeship track . but a lot of people have not realized that the world has changed .
the vocational system is n't as safe and lucrative as it once was , because of globalization .
a lot of the medium-skilled jobs are outsourced into eastern europe or asia . german universities used to be free of charge , but recently some states introduced tuition fees .
some people are arguing that this makes it hard for low-income students to study .
what do you think ? i think that in general it makes a lot of sense to have students pay at least some fees for the university .
at the moment we make parents pay more for their child 's preschool than for a university degree .
this is kind of ridiculous - it is both inefficient and unfair . it is inefficient in the sense that the earlier you invest public money , the higher the returns will be .
so you can actually change the whole track of children 's if you make sure that early on they get a better education . it is unfair because in the current system , you make the state pay for a university education , which at the moment is much more open to children from rich families than from low-income families .
so in a sense , by funding the system with taxes , you are making low-income people pay for the university education of children of rich families . i think what is strongly needed , and what has really been missing , is to accompany these tuition fees - and we are talking about 500 euros per semester , or 1,000 euros per year -lrb- $ 650 or $ 1,300 -rrb- , which is nothing compared to the us or the uk - by easy , income-contingent loans at the same time .
so people could pay back the loans later on , if and when they are successful in the labor market . interview : jennifer abramsohn send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

22 .
she said she wants the summit to lift the country out of its learning rut . prize-winning economist and education researcher ludger woessmann , of the ifo institute in munich , argued that a radical change toward increased competition is the best way to offer a broader array of students a more even shot at education .
he added that fairness dictates that university students help pay their own way . dw-world : is this education summit a serious effort toward policy change , or more of a political gambit on the part of angela merkel ? ludger woessmann : initially , chancellor merkel raised a lot of expectations , and i think she honestly wanted to achieve something at the summit .
but it is becoming more obvious that there wo n't be any huge results that come out of it .
it 's a big disappointment . why do you say that ? at first she said that education is the key precondition to equality in our social market economy , and that she would make education her priority .
the fact is that in germany , more than in almost any other western country , education is tied to social background .
so fixing education is the key to allowing everyone to accept and participate in the social market economy . now it seems the heads of the -lrb- individual german states -rrb- have called her back to reality .
according to the constitution , the federal government has basically no say at all in education topics .
it is the business of the states .
and they are just playing political games to make sure the federal government does n't get any influence . what kind of influence should the federal government have ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german education is free - and classes are full i think it would be important to have a federal school evaluation system , as a first step to see how each state has performed .
it would make them accountable for what they do , and would create huge incentives to do better , to try harder .
it would put politicians under pressure to perform . basically there are two problems that need to be dealt with : one is that we do a pretty mediocre job on international comparative tests like pisa -lrb- an international , triennial study that compares the high-school students ' abilities - eds -rrb- .
the other problem is that education results are so strongly tied to family background . so how should the government - federal or state - deal with these problems ? i think more autonomy for individual schools is needed .
at the moment public schools have no autonomy in choosing their own staff .
teachers are largely assigned by central bureaucracies .

the board met in munich on tuesday , oct .
21 , and decided to " apply for stabilization measures , " said bavaria 's state finance minister , erwin huber , who heads bayernlb 's governing board .
huber , 62 , announced on wedesday that he is stepping down as finance minister because of the bayernlb debacle .
the southern regional bank is jointly owned by the state of bavaria and regional savings banks .
the bank ran into trouble more than a year ago due to its heavy investment in asset-backed securities .
these securities lost much of their value when the us market for high-risk mortgages collapsed in 2007 .
as the bank was recovering from this loss , it was hit a second time when interbank loans dried up in mid-september .
in addition , german regional bank westlb is reportedly also eyeing the government bank rescue plan . separately , german police led by prosecutors searched the offices of the federally owned kfw bank wednesday .

those conditions include bayernlb limiting executive pay to 500,000 euros .
it will also send any dividend payments to the state .

the board met in munich on tuesday , oct .
21 , and decided to " apply for stabilization measures , " said bavaria 's state finance minister , erwin huber , who heads bayernlb 's governing board .
huber , 62 , announced on wedesday that he is stepping down as finance minister because of the bayernlb debacle .
the southern regional bank is jointly owned by the state of bavaria and regional savings banks .
the bank ran into trouble more than a year ago due to its heavy investment in asset-backed securities .
these securities lost much of their value when the us market for high-risk mortgages collapsed in 2007 .
as the bank was recovering from this loss , it was hit a second time when interbank loans dried up in mid-september .
in addition , german regional bank westlb is reportedly also eyeing the government bank rescue plan . separately , german police led by prosecutors searched the offices of the federally owned kfw bank wednesday .
this action was part of an investigation into the transfer of 319 million euros to us bank lehman brothers , the day after the financial crisis triggered the new york-based financial house 's collapsed .
deal comes with strings attached bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german banks are still trying to find their balance germany 's federal government approved a 500-billion-euro federal rescue package on friday .
germany 's rescue package was similar to measures taken by governments across europe .

those conditions include bayernlb limiting executive pay to 500,000 euros .
it will also send any dividend payments to the state .
and the government will get the right to review any lending practices seen as risky .
the bank also has to promise to continue making loans to small- and medium-sized companies .
bayernlb is germany 's second biggest regional bank .
it posted 770 million euros in losses during the first three months of 2008 .
that forced shareholders to come up with 4.8 billion euros in loan guarantees .
the state link allowed regional banks to offer lower credit rates .
when the european commission cut back on that privilege in 2005 , the banks began engaging in risky investments as a way to keep making money .
other banks holding off bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the government has thrown banks a lifeline but the era of the landesbank could be coming to a close , merck finck analyst konrad becker told afp news agency .

" the era when each state had its own bank is over . "
other landesbanken have not said whether they will also ask for a bailout .
an hsh nordbank spokesman said on tuesday that no decision had been made .
a spokesman for the landesbank berlin said that there were currently no plans to take the rescue package .

22 .
she said she wants the summit to lift the country out of its learning rut . prize-winning economist and education researcher ludger woessmann , of the ifo institute in munich , argued that a radical change toward increased competition is the best way to offer a broader array of students a more even shot at education .
he added that fairness dictates that university students help pay their own way . dw-world : is this education summit a serious effort toward policy change , or more of a political gambit on the part of angela merkel ? ludger woessmann : initially , chancellor merkel raised a lot of expectations , and i think she honestly wanted to achieve something at the summit .
but it is becoming more obvious that there wo n't be any huge results that come out of it .
it 's a big disappointment . why do you say that ? at first she said that education is the key precondition to equality in our social market economy , and that she would make education her priority .
the fact is that in germany , more than in almost any other western country , education is tied to social background .
so fixing education is the key to allowing everyone to accept and participate in the social market economy . now it seems the heads of the -lrb- individual german states -rrb- have called her back to reality .
according to the constitution , the federal government has basically no say at all in education topics .
it is the business of the states .
and they are just playing political games to make sure the federal government does n't get any influence . what kind of influence should the federal government have ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german education is free - and classes are full i think it would be important to have a federal school evaluation system , as a first step to see how each state has performed .
it would make them accountable for what they do , and would create huge incentives to do better , to try harder .
it would put politicians under pressure to perform . basically there are two problems that need to be dealt with : one is that we do a pretty mediocre job on international comparative tests like pisa -lrb- an international , triennial study that compares the high-school students ' abilities - eds -rrb- .
the other problem is that education results are so strongly tied to family background . so how should the government - federal or state - deal with these problems ? i think more autonomy for individual schools is needed .
at the moment public schools have no autonomy in choosing their own staff .
teachers are largely assigned by central bureaucracies .
and there is clear evidence that that holds back the quality of education . more generally , i think something that would lead the way forward would be to create more choice and competition between schools by setting private schools on the same funding level as public schools . you mean switching to a system that the us would call charter schools ? not really .
charter schools in the us are just public schools that have more autonomy .
i am talking here about , maybe , church-run schools .
you have to remember that we do n't have the separation of church and state that the us has in terms of accepting funding . what we have seen empirically is that school systems perform best when schools are financed by the states , using little private funding , but operated largely by private initiatives . the model is a system like the netherlands , where three-quarters of students go to schools that are not operated by the state , but mostly by churches and other charities .
these schools benefit the low income children the most .
it gives them the opportunity to attend privately operated schools regardless of how much money the parents have . they are rare , but there are a few private schools in germany . right - and that is the problem .
because what we see in international comparisons is that systematically , students perform better in countries that build more on private school operations .
not private funding , but operations . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : woessmann eyes education 's economic impact in the netherlands ... the schools are all funded in the same way , and they get exactly the same amount of money per student as the public school gets .
that creates choice for parents .
it makes schools start to compete with each other in a way that helps students . and what do you see as a remedy for the problem of socio-economic bias ? one thing is clear that the early tracking of students into different types of schools at such an early age - right now they are tracked at age 10 , in the fourth grade - decreases the quality of performance in germany .
we can systematically see that this tracking does nothing to improve performance .
it just makes outcomes more strongly dependent on family background . we should delay the tracking , and reduce the tracking into just two levels , if at all .
but this is such a politically charged topic in germany that they wo n't even dare to discuss it at the summit . the subject of educational tracking is a real political hot potato and has been for years .
what are the chances it is changed ? it has been debated since the 70s .
and it divides people along party lines .
it is one of those things where the federalist structure of germany makes any big , sweeping change impossible . is there anything you think will , in fact , be dealt with at the summit ? well , the final thing that research tells us would actually increase opportunity and performance in general is to put more focus on early childhood education .
it is something germany has slowly moved into , and will probably be discussed at the summit .
but i don ’ t expect there will be any big news . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : low-income kids often get a worse start in germany right now , germany focuses on providing child care instead of early education per se - there is hardly any educational content in the preschool programs .
but more and more people are becoming aware of how important it is to introduce learning and educational goals at an early age .
it would help people who do n't have an educational environment at home . a recent oecd study shows low rates of university attendance in germany compared with elsewhere in europe .
what is behind that ? part of it is definitely due to this problem of early tracking .
it makes sure that a lot of very bright children from low socioeconomic backgrounds do not go into the " gymnasium , " the one track that leads straight to university . another is that we have a very strong vocational education system .
historically , more than half the students in each grade would go into the apprenticeship track . but a lot of people have not realized that the world has changed .
the vocational system is n't as safe and lucrative as it once was , because of globalization .
a lot of the medium-skilled jobs are outsourced into eastern europe or asia . german universities used to be free of charge , but recently some states introduced tuition fees .
some people are arguing that this makes it hard for low-income students to study .
what do you think ? i think that in general it makes a lot of sense to have students pay at least some fees for the university .
at the moment we make parents pay more for their child 's preschool than for a university degree .
this is kind of ridiculous - it is both inefficient and unfair . it is inefficient in the sense that the earlier you invest public money , the higher the returns will be .
so you can actually change the whole track of children 's if you make sure that early on they get a better education . it is unfair because in the current system , you make the state pay for a university education , which at the moment is much more open to children from rich families than from low-income families .
so in a sense , by funding the system with taxes , you are making low-income people pay for the university education of children of rich families . i think what is strongly needed , and what has really been missing , is to accompany these tuition fees - and we are talking about 500 euros per semester , or 1,000 euros per year -lrb- $ 650 or $ 1,300 -rrb- , which is nothing compared to the us or the uk - by easy , income-contingent loans at the same time .
so people could pay back the loans later on , if and when they are successful in the labor market . interview : jennifer abramsohn send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" rwe will participate in projects outside germany .
it depends on financing and on what partner we find .
but i think that three to five -lrb- projects -rrb- are in the pipeline , " chief executive juergen grossmann told the daily sueddeutsche zeitung newspaper .
essen-based rwe was one of " a small handful of power suppliers in europe with competence in nuclear plants , " he said .
grossmann did not give any indications where these projects would be built .
nuclear powerhouse rwe has been operating nuclear stations in germany since the 1960s .
nuclear power , which accounts for 30 percent of all power in germany , is currently being phased out .
rwe 's biblis plant will be allowed to operate until 2012 and its newest plant in emsland will have to go offline in about 2020 .
rwe , along with its subsidiaries , provides electricity to more than 20 million people and gas to 10 million .
most of its customers are in europe .
earlier this month , bulgaria chose rwe as the winning bidder for 49-percent stake in the belene power company , which will finance and run a four-billion-euro -lrb- $ 5.1-billion -rrb- nuclear plant near the northern town of belene . dw staff -lrb- th -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

22 .
she said she wants the summit to lift the country out of its learning rut . prize-winning economist and education researcher ludger woessmann , of the ifo institute in munich , argued that a radical change toward increased competition is the best way to offer a broader array of students a more even shot at education .
he added that fairness dictates that university students help pay their own way . dw-world : is this education summit a serious effort toward policy change , or more of a political gambit on the part of angela merkel ? ludger woessmann : initially , chancellor merkel raised a lot of expectations , and i think she honestly wanted to achieve something at the summit .
but it is becoming more obvious that there wo n't be any huge results that come out of it .
it 's a big disappointment . why do you say that ? at first she said that education is the key precondition to equality in our social market economy , and that she would make education her priority .
the fact is that in germany , more than in almost any other western country , education is tied to social background .
so fixing education is the key to allowing everyone to accept and participate in the social market economy . now it seems the heads of the -lrb- individual german states -rrb- have called her back to reality .
according to the constitution , the federal government has basically no say at all in education topics .
it is the business of the states .
and they are just playing political games to make sure the federal government does n't get any influence . what kind of influence should the federal government have ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german education is free - and classes are full i think it would be important to have a federal school evaluation system , as a first step to see how each state has performed .
it would make them accountable for what they do , and would create huge incentives to do better , to try harder .
it would put politicians under pressure to perform . basically there are two problems that need to be dealt with : one is that we do a pretty mediocre job on international comparative tests like pisa -lrb- an international , triennial study that compares the high-school students ' abilities - eds -rrb- .
the other problem is that education results are so strongly tied to family background . so how should the government - federal or state - deal with these problems ? i think more autonomy for individual schools is needed .
at the moment public schools have no autonomy in choosing their own staff .
teachers are largely assigned by central bureaucracies .
and there is clear evidence that that holds back the quality of education . more generally , i think something that would lead the way forward would be to create more choice and competition between schools by setting private schools on the same funding level as public schools . you mean switching to a system that the us would call charter schools ? not really .
charter schools in the us are just public schools that have more autonomy .
i am talking here about , maybe , church-run schools .
you have to remember that we do n't have the separation of church and state that the us has in terms of accepting funding . what we have seen empirically is that school systems perform best when schools are financed by the states , using little private funding , but operated largely by private initiatives . the model is a system like the netherlands , where three-quarters of students go to schools that are not operated by the state , but mostly by churches and other charities .
these schools benefit the low income children the most .
it gives them the opportunity to attend privately operated schools regardless of how much money the parents have . they are rare , but there are a few private schools in germany . right - and that is the problem .
because what we see in international comparisons is that systematically , students perform better in countries that build more on private school operations .
not private funding , but operations . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : woessmann eyes education 's economic impact in the netherlands ... the schools are all funded in the same way , and they get exactly the same amount of money per student as the public school gets .
that creates choice for parents .
it makes schools start to compete with each other in a way that helps students . and what do you see as a remedy for the problem of socio-economic bias ? one thing is clear that the early tracking of students into different types of schools at such an early age - right now they are tracked at age 10 , in the fourth grade - decreases the quality of performance in germany .
we can systematically see that this tracking does nothing to improve performance .
it just makes outcomes more strongly dependent on family background . we should delay the tracking , and reduce the tracking into just two levels , if at all .
but this is such a politically charged topic in germany that they wo n't even dare to discuss it at the summit . the subject of educational tracking is a real political hot potato and has been for years .
what are the chances it is changed ? it has been debated since the 70s .
and it divides people along party lines .
it is one of those things where the federalist structure of germany makes any big , sweeping change impossible . is there anything you think will , in fact , be dealt with at the summit ? well , the final thing that research tells us would actually increase opportunity and performance in general is to put more focus on early childhood education .
it is something germany has slowly moved into , and will probably be discussed at the summit .
but i don ’ t expect there will be any big news . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : low-income kids often get a worse start in germany right now , germany focuses on providing child care instead of early education per se - there is hardly any educational content in the preschool programs .
but more and more people are becoming aware of how important it is to introduce learning and educational goals at an early age .
it would help people who do n't have an educational environment at home . a recent oecd study shows low rates of university attendance in germany compared with elsewhere in europe .
what is behind that ? part of it is definitely due to this problem of early tracking .
it makes sure that a lot of very bright children from low socioeconomic backgrounds do not go into the " gymnasium , " the one track that leads straight to university . another is that we have a very strong vocational education system .
historically , more than half the students in each grade would go into the apprenticeship track . but a lot of people have not realized that the world has changed .
the vocational system is n't as safe and lucrative as it once was , because of globalization .
a lot of the medium-skilled jobs are outsourced into eastern europe or asia . german universities used to be free of charge , but recently some states introduced tuition fees .
some people are arguing that this makes it hard for low-income students to study .
what do you think ? i think that in general it makes a lot of sense to have students pay at least some fees for the university .
at the moment we make parents pay more for their child 's preschool than for a university degree .
this is kind of ridiculous - it is both inefficient and unfair . it is inefficient in the sense that the earlier you invest public money , the higher the returns will be .
so you can actually change the whole track of children 's if you make sure that early on they get a better education . it is unfair because in the current system , you make the state pay for a university education , which at the moment is much more open to children from rich families than from low-income families .
so in a sense , by funding the system with taxes , you are making low-income people pay for the university education of children of rich families . i think what is strongly needed , and what has really been missing , is to accompany these tuition fees - and we are talking about 500 euros per semester , or 1,000 euros per year -lrb- $ 650 or $ 1,300 -rrb- , which is nothing compared to the us or the uk - by easy , income-contingent loans at the same time .
so people could pay back the loans later on , if and when they are successful in the labor market . interview : jennifer abramsohn send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

but more and more people are becoming aware of how important it is to introduce learning and educational goals at an early age .
it would help people who do n't have an educational environment at home . a recent oecd study shows low rates of university attendance in germany compared with elsewhere in europe .
what is behind that ? part of it is definitely due to this problem of early tracking .
it makes sure that a lot of very bright children from low socioeconomic backgrounds do not go into the " gymnasium , " the one track that leads straight to university . another is that we have a very strong vocational education system .
historically , more than half the students in each grade would go into the apprenticeship track . but a lot of people have not realized that the world has changed .
the vocational system is n't as safe and lucrative as it once was , because of globalization .
a lot of the medium-skilled jobs are outsourced into eastern europe or asia . german universities used to be free of charge , but recently some states introduced tuition fees .
some people are arguing that this makes it hard for low-income students to study .
what do you think ? i think that in general it makes a lot of sense to have students pay at least some fees for the university .
at the moment we make parents pay more for their child 's preschool than for a university degree .
this is kind of ridiculous - it is both inefficient and unfair . it is inefficient in the sense that the earlier you invest public money , the higher the returns will be .
so you can actually change the whole track of children 's if you make sure that early on they get a better education . it is unfair because in the current system , you make the state pay for a university education , which at the moment is much more open to children from rich families than from low-income families .
so in a sense , by funding the system with taxes , you are making low-income people pay for the university education of children of rich families . i think what is strongly needed , and what has really been missing , is to accompany these tuition fees - and we are talking about 500 euros per semester , or 1,000 euros per year -lrb- $ 650 or $ 1,300 -rrb- , which is nothing compared to the us or the uk - by easy , income-contingent loans at the same time .

22 .
she said she wants the summit to lift the country out of its learning rut . prize-winning economist and education researcher ludger woessmann , of the ifo institute in munich , argued that a radical change toward increased competition is the best way to offer a broader array of students a more even shot at education .
he added that fairness dictates that university students help pay their own way . dw-world : is this education summit a serious effort toward policy change , or more of a political gambit on the part of angela merkel ? ludger woessmann : initially , chancellor merkel raised a lot of expectations , and i think she honestly wanted to achieve something at the summit .
but it is becoming more obvious that there wo n't be any huge results that come out of it .
it 's a big disappointment . why do you say that ? at first she said that education is the key precondition to equality in our social market economy , and that she would make education her priority .
the fact is that in germany , more than in almost any other western country , education is tied to social background .
so fixing education is the key to allowing everyone to accept and participate in the social market economy . now it seems the heads of the -lrb- individual german states -rrb- have called her back to reality .
according to the constitution , the federal government has basically no say at all in education topics .
it is the business of the states .
and they are just playing political games to make sure the federal government does n't get any influence . what kind of influence should the federal government have ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german education is free - and classes are full i think it would be important to have a federal school evaluation system , as a first step to see how each state has performed .
it would make them accountable for what they do , and would create huge incentives to do better , to try harder .
it would put politicians under pressure to perform . basically there are two problems that need to be dealt with : one is that we do a pretty mediocre job on international comparative tests like pisa -lrb- an international , triennial study that compares the high-school students ' abilities - eds -rrb- .
the other problem is that education results are so strongly tied to family background . so how should the government - federal or state - deal with these problems ? i think more autonomy for individual schools is needed .
at the moment public schools have no autonomy in choosing their own staff .
teachers are largely assigned by central bureaucracies .
and there is clear evidence that that holds back the quality of education . more generally , i think something that would lead the way forward would be to create more choice and competition between schools by setting private schools on the same funding level as public schools . you mean switching to a system that the us would call charter schools ? not really .
charter schools in the us are just public schools that have more autonomy .
i am talking here about , maybe , church-run schools .
you have to remember that we do n't have the separation of church and state that the us has in terms of accepting funding . what we have seen empirically is that school systems perform best when schools are financed by the states , using little private funding , but operated largely by private initiatives . the model is a system like the netherlands , where three-quarters of students go to schools that are not operated by the state , but mostly by churches and other charities .
these schools benefit the low income children the most .
it gives them the opportunity to attend privately operated schools regardless of how much money the parents have . they are rare , but there are a few private schools in germany . right - and that is the problem .
because what we see in international comparisons is that systematically , students perform better in countries that build more on private school operations .
not private funding , but operations . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : woessmann eyes education 's economic impact in the netherlands ... the schools are all funded in the same way , and they get exactly the same amount of money per student as the public school gets .
that creates choice for parents .
it makes schools start to compete with each other in a way that helps students . and what do you see as a remedy for the problem of socio-economic bias ? one thing is clear that the early tracking of students into different types of schools at such an early age - right now they are tracked at age 10 , in the fourth grade - decreases the quality of performance in germany .
we can systematically see that this tracking does nothing to improve performance .
it just makes outcomes more strongly dependent on family background . we should delay the tracking , and reduce the tracking into just two levels , if at all .
but this is such a politically charged topic in germany that they wo n't even dare to discuss it at the summit . the subject of educational tracking is a real political hot potato and has been for years .
what are the chances it is changed ? it has been debated since the 70s .
and it divides people along party lines .
it is one of those things where the federalist structure of germany makes any big , sweeping change impossible . is there anything you think will , in fact , be dealt with at the summit ? well , the final thing that research tells us would actually increase opportunity and performance in general is to put more focus on early childhood education .
it is something germany has slowly moved into , and will probably be discussed at the summit .
but i don ’ t expect there will be any big news . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : low-income kids often get a worse start in germany right now , germany focuses on providing child care instead of early education per se - there is hardly any educational content in the preschool programs .
but more and more people are becoming aware of how important it is to introduce learning and educational goals at an early age .

now the question is : can the two bury the hatchet ? ballack 's broadside came in a newspaper interview , when he was asked about loew 's decision not to play veteran midfielder torsten frings in germany 's recent world cup qualifiers against russia and wales .
" respect and loyalty are the least one can expect as a veteran national player , " the germany captain told the frankfurter allgemeine zeitung .
ballack went on to name other examples of players he felt were squeezed out of the team without being given a fair chance .
at the head of his list was former national goalkeeper ollie kahn , who was demoted by loew 's predecessor , juergen klinsmann .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : frings has recently had an unwelcome new role in loew 's squad " a competition with jens lehmann was proclaimed that , to my eyes , he could n't win , " ballack said .
" the same was true with -lsb- defender -rsb- christian woerns who , in contrast to christoph metzelder , stayed true to one team and was n't sitting on the bench . "
ballack even defended striker kevin kuranyi , whom loew booted out of the squad entirely after kuranyi abandoned the team in response to not being nominated .
" -lsb- kuranyi -rsb- saw that it was going to be very difficult for him , even though he plays year in , year out in the champions league and has been a regular starter for a top bundesliga club for quite some time , " ballack said .
" those are important criteria for the national team , " the germany captain added .
" where will we end up if things like that no longer count ? "

" i 'm fundamentally surprised that he chose to go public like this , " loew told the daily bild newspaper .
" and i 'm disappointed that he 's trying to affect personnel decisions in this way . "
loew said he had been up front with veteran players about their chances in the national side and insisted that it was up to him as coach to decide who played and who did n't .
loew stressed that he still wants ballack as team captain and would try to work through their differences .
but the coach admitted he did n't know precisely how or when to approach his angry star .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : kuranyi has almost certainly played his last match for loew " i want to think about the form in which i 'll talk to michael , " loew said .
" on principle i do n't tolerate interference .
but there will be a discussion .
not a few days from now , but very soon . "
the outcome of that chat may determine whether ballack is nominated for germany 's upcoming friendly against england .
" all our players know the rules concerning public criticism , " loew said .
bosses back loew bildunterschrift : ballack also feuded with germany team manager oliver bierhoff at euro 2008 germany 's football functionaries were quick to back the coach .
" this constant complaining ! " said german soccer association vice-president and soccer legend frank beckenbauer in a television interview .
" they 've become a pack of wimps - unbelievable !
they should shut their mouths and play soccer . "
german soccer association president theo zwanziger seconded those sentiments .
" i 'm disappointed by michael ballack 's behavior , " zwanziger said .
" this has created a difficult and complicated situation . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ballack will likely only see a yellow card for his latest ourburst zwanziger also stressed that germany under loew was headed in the right direction .
" the development of our national team over the past few years has been absolutely positive so i do n't understand at all why there should be criticism of joachim loew coming from the team via the media , " zwanziger said .
but while germany could thrive without players like frings and kuranyi , there is little question that the national side needs ballack , its on-the-field leader and most technically gifted player .

how typical - and how threatening - are converts like eric breininger ? officials from germany 's federal office of criminal investigation -lrb- bka -rrb- confirmed on wednesday , oct.22 , that the six minute video of breininger , who is wanted as a suspected member of a terrorist group , was indeed genuine .
" we assume that came from the international jihad union -lrb- iju -rrb- , " a bka spokesperson told the dpa news agency .
the iju is a radical islamist organization that originated in uzbekistan and has been linked with attempted terrorist acts in germany four weeks ago , the bka launched a public search for breiniger after rumors surfaced that he was in the balkans and on his way back to germany . but they withdrew the warning over the weekend .
also on wednesday , oct 22 , the police also arrested the younger brother of one of three men accused of planning attacks last year on us citizens and interests using chemical-filled drums , the 21-year-old turk , named only as burhan y. , was arrested at langen south of frankfurt and is a suspected helper for the banned iju .
" germany should expect attacks " in the video , the 21-year-old breininger discussed his whereabouts and motivation .
" i am located in afghanistan and am not personally planning an attack on germany , " breininger said in the video , before adding : " we declare war on every country that fights alongside america against muslims . "
but breininger also said that as long as german soldiers are in afghanistan and uzbekistan , “ germany should expect attacks , " without giving any further details .
shown in the video wearing a turban and carrying a kalashnikov , breininger hinted that he may be preparing to sacrifice his life for his cause .
" if allah wishes , he will call me to him as a jidhadi , " he said .
so how did a young man from a suburban town in southern germany become a fanatic apparently willing to die for his religious beliefs in afghanistan ?
fateful turn bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a poster published by germany 's federal office of criminal investigation shows eric breininger according to various reports in the german media , breininger 's parents divorced when he was an adolescent , and he reportedly started using hashish and alcohol at a relatively early age .
he was prone to getting into fights and had trouble with the police .
in late 2006 , breininger got a job for a package-delivery company , where he met a pakistani who got him interested in radical islam .
a short time later , he also became friends with a radical islamic convert named daniel schneider .
breininger began calling himself abdul ghaffar el almani , avoiding his old friends and burning his cds .
he swore off drugs and alcohol .
he married in a mosque , and his wife eva p. wore a veil .
the marriage was short-lived .
" he wanted me to clean and cook and said he was looking for another woman , " eva p. later said in a television interview .
in june 2007 , breininger sold off most of his belongings on ebay , saying he wanted to go abroad and learn arabic , and moved in with schneider .
in september , schneider , who had relocated to the western german region of sauerland , was arrested along with two other suspected islamists for allegedly trying to make car bombs and planning attacks on us targets in germany .
breininger disappeared before police could detain him .
police suspect breininger has since received training in a terrorist camp , possibly in pakistan .
both german and american military forces in afghanistan are reported to have distributed pictures of him , warning that he is a potential suicide attacker .
how big a danger ?
the breininger case raises the question of how great a threat german converts to islam pose .

" as ' novices ' they try to be more religious than even the religious leaders , " hirschmann added .
" that often makes them especially fanatical and also especially dangerous . "
other experts , however , disagree with that assessment .
" you ca n't say that conversion to islam carries an explicit tendency toward becoming a radical , " stefan reichmuth , professor of islamic studies at the university of bochum told dw-world.de. estimates of the number of german converts to islam range between 15,000 and 80,000 .
but germany 's muslim league says that , of them , only about 25 fit the description of being radical or dangerously fanatic .
germany , which opposed the 2003 us-led invasion of iraq and has more than 3,000 troops in afghanistan under nato command , has tightened security and surveillance in response to the threat of attacks by islamic extremists .
the closest germany came to an attack was in july 2006 when suitcases containing homemade bombs were placed on two regional trains passing through cologne 's busy main train station .
they failed to detonate .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de national team -pipe- 22.10.2008 battle between generations breaks out between ballack , loew großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : these two fellas need to have a serious talk a serious feud is brewing in the german national team , after captain michael ballack accused coach joachim loew of lacking respect for veteran players .
now the question is : can the two bury the hatchet ? ballack 's broadside came in a newspaper interview , when he was asked about loew 's decision not to play veteran midfielder torsten frings in germany 's recent world cup qualifiers against russia and wales .
" respect and loyalty are the least one can expect as a veteran national player , " the germany captain told the frankfurter allgemeine zeitung .
ballack went on to name other examples of players he felt were squeezed out of the team without being given a fair chance .
at the head of his list was former national goalkeeper ollie kahn , who was demoted by loew 's predecessor , juergen klinsmann .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : frings has recently had an unwelcome new role in loew 's squad " a competition with jens lehmann was proclaimed that , to my eyes , he could n't win , " ballack said .
" the same was true with -lsb- defender -rsb- christian woerns who , in contrast to christoph metzelder , stayed true to one team and was n't sitting on the bench . "
ballack even defended striker kevin kuranyi , whom loew booted out of the squad entirely after kuranyi abandoned the team in response to not being nominated .
" -lsb- kuranyi -rsb- saw that it was going to be very difficult for him , even though he plays year in , year out in the champions league and has been a regular starter for a top bundesliga club for quite some time , " ballack said .
" those are important criteria for the national team , " the germany captain added .
" where will we end up if things like that no longer count ? "
surprise and disappointment bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the hero of germany 's recent win over wales was 24-year-old piotr trochowski loew seemed to be taken off guard by the verbal blasts from his most important player and representative on the pitch .
" i 'm fundamentally surprised that he chose to go public like this , " loew told the daily bild newspaper .
" and i 'm disappointed that he 's trying to affect personnel decisions in this way . "
loew said he had been up front with veteran players about their chances in the national side and insisted that it was up to him as coach to decide who played and who did n't .
loew stressed that he still wants ballack as team captain and would try to work through their differences .
but the coach admitted he did n't know precisely how or when to approach his angry star .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : kuranyi has almost certainly played his last match for loew " i want to think about the form in which i 'll talk to michael , " loew said .
" on principle i do n't tolerate interference .
but there will be a discussion .
not a few days from now , but very soon . "
the outcome of that chat may determine whether ballack is nominated for germany 's upcoming friendly against england .
" all our players know the rules concerning public criticism , " loew said .
bosses back loew bildunterschrift : ballack also feuded with germany team manager oliver bierhoff at euro 2008 germany 's football functionaries were quick to back the coach .
" this constant complaining ! " said german soccer association vice-president and soccer legend frank beckenbauer in a television interview .
" they 've become a pack of wimps - unbelievable !

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de terrorism -pipe- 22.10.2008 terrorist video highlights threat from fringe islamic converts großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " germany should expect attacks " as long as its soldiers are in afghanistan , breininger said german police said they 've discovered a video by a german convert to radical islamism saying he 's ready to wage jihad in afghanistan .
how typical - and how threatening - are converts like eric breininger ? officials from germany 's federal office of criminal investigation -lrb- bka -rrb- confirmed on wednesday , oct.22 , that the six minute video of breininger , who is wanted as a suspected member of a terrorist group , was indeed genuine .
" we assume that came from the international jihad union -lrb- iju -rrb- , " a bka spokesperson told the dpa news agency .
the iju is a radical islamist organization that originated in uzbekistan and has been linked with attempted terrorist acts in germany four weeks ago , the bka launched a public search for breiniger after rumors surfaced that he was in the balkans and on his way back to germany . but they withdrew the warning over the weekend .
also on wednesday , oct 22 , the police also arrested the younger brother of one of three men accused of planning attacks last year on us citizens and interests using chemical-filled drums , the 21-year-old turk , named only as burhan y. , was arrested at langen south of frankfurt and is a suspected helper for the banned iju .
" germany should expect attacks " in the video , the 21-year-old breininger discussed his whereabouts and motivation .
" i am located in afghanistan and am not personally planning an attack on germany , " breininger said in the video , before adding : " we declare war on every country that fights alongside america against muslims . "
but breininger also said that as long as german soldiers are in afghanistan and uzbekistan , “ germany should expect attacks , " without giving any further details .
shown in the video wearing a turban and carrying a kalashnikov , breininger hinted that he may be preparing to sacrifice his life for his cause .
" if allah wishes , he will call me to him as a jidhadi , " he said .
so how did a young man from a suburban town in southern germany become a fanatic apparently willing to die for his religious beliefs in afghanistan ?
fateful turn bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a poster published by germany 's federal office of criminal investigation shows eric breininger according to various reports in the german media , breininger 's parents divorced when he was an adolescent , and he reportedly started using hashish and alcohol at a relatively early age .
he was prone to getting into fights and had trouble with the police .
in late 2006 , breininger got a job for a package-delivery company , where he met a pakistani who got him interested in radical islam .
a short time later , he also became friends with a radical islamic convert named daniel schneider .
breininger began calling himself abdul ghaffar el almani , avoiding his old friends and burning his cds .
he swore off drugs and alcohol .
he married in a mosque , and his wife eva p. wore a veil .
the marriage was short-lived .
" he wanted me to clean and cook and said he was looking for another woman , " eva p. later said in a television interview .
in june 2007 , breininger sold off most of his belongings on ebay , saying he wanted to go abroad and learn arabic , and moved in with schneider .
in september , schneider , who had relocated to the western german region of sauerland , was arrested along with two other suspected islamists for allegedly trying to make car bombs and planning attacks on us targets in germany .
breininger disappeared before police could detain him .
police suspect breininger has since received training in a terrorist camp , possibly in pakistan .
both german and american military forces in afghanistan are reported to have distributed pictures of him , warning that he is a potential suicide attacker .
how big a danger ?
the breininger case raises the question of how great a threat german converts to islam pose .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : police arrested a suspected member of the so-called " sauerland terror group " last year " converts can be more easily radicalized , " kai hirschmann of germany 's institute for terrorism research and study told a internet news site around the time of scheider 's arrest .
" as ' novices ' they try to be more religious than even the religious leaders , " hirschmann added .
" that often makes them especially fanatical and also especially dangerous . "
other experts , however , disagree with that assessment .
" you ca n't say that conversion to islam carries an explicit tendency toward becoming a radical , " stefan reichmuth , professor of islamic studies at the university of bochum told dw-world.de. estimates of the number of german converts to islam range between 15,000 and 80,000 .
but germany 's muslim league says that , of them , only about 25 fit the description of being radical or dangerously fanatic .
germany , which opposed the 2003 us-led invasion of iraq and has more than 3,000 troops in afghanistan under nato command , has tightened security and surveillance in response to the threat of attacks by islamic extremists .
the closest germany came to an attack was in july 2006 when suitcases containing homemade bombs were placed on two regional trains passing through cologne 's busy main train station .
they failed to detonate .
the september 11 , 2001 attacks on the united states were planned by an al-qaeda cell in the northern german city of hamburg led by mohammed atta , one of the hijackers of the planes involved in the attacks . dw staff -lrb- jc -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?
dw-world.de politicians warn of increased terror threat in germany politicians in germany warned saturday of the dangers posed by islamists , following the arrest of two terrorist suspects and a police search for two others .

among the remedies is more trust in america 's laws and allies .
-lrb- 11.09.2008 -rrb- terror case throws spotlight on german converts to islam two of the men held in connection with a plot to bomb us military installations and other targets in germany are converts to islam .
it has raised the question of whether converts are more likely to become radicalized .

how typical - and how threatening - are converts like eric breininger ? officials from germany 's federal office of criminal investigation -lrb- bka -rrb- confirmed on wednesday , oct.22 , that the six minute video of breininger , who is wanted as a suspected member of a terrorist group , was indeed genuine .
" we assume that came from the international jihad union -lrb- iju -rrb- , " a bka spokesperson told the dpa news agency .
the iju is a radical islamist organization that originated in uzbekistan and has been linked with attempted terrorist acts in germany four weeks ago , the bka launched a public search for breiniger after rumors surfaced that he was in the balkans and on his way back to germany . but they withdrew the warning over the weekend .
also on wednesday , oct 22 , the police also arrested the younger brother of one of three men accused of planning attacks last year on us citizens and interests using chemical-filled drums , the 21-year-old turk , named only as burhan y. , was arrested at langen south of frankfurt and is a suspected helper for the banned iju .
" germany should expect attacks " in the video , the 21-year-old breininger discussed his whereabouts and motivation .
" i am located in afghanistan and am not personally planning an attack on germany , " breininger said in the video , before adding : " we declare war on every country that fights alongside america against muslims . "
but breininger also said that as long as german soldiers are in afghanistan and uzbekistan , “ germany should expect attacks , " without giving any further details .
shown in the video wearing a turban and carrying a kalashnikov , breininger hinted that he may be preparing to sacrifice his life for his cause .
" if allah wishes , he will call me to him as a jidhadi , " he said .
so how did a young man from a suburban town in southern germany become a fanatic apparently willing to die for his religious beliefs in afghanistan ?
fateful turn bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a poster published by germany 's federal office of criminal investigation shows eric breininger according to various reports in the german media , breininger 's parents divorced when he was an adolescent , and he reportedly started using hashish and alcohol at a relatively early age .
he was prone to getting into fights and had trouble with the police .
in late 2006 , breininger got a job for a package-delivery company , where he met a pakistani who got him interested in radical islam .
a short time later , he also became friends with a radical islamic convert named daniel schneider .
breininger began calling himself abdul ghaffar el almani , avoiding his old friends and burning his cds .
he swore off drugs and alcohol .
he married in a mosque , and his wife eva p. wore a veil .
the marriage was short-lived .
" he wanted me to clean and cook and said he was looking for another woman , " eva p. later said in a television interview .
in june 2007 , breininger sold off most of his belongings on ebay , saying he wanted to go abroad and learn arabic , and moved in with schneider .
in september , schneider , who had relocated to the western german region of sauerland , was arrested along with two other suspected islamists for allegedly trying to make car bombs and planning attacks on us targets in germany .
breininger disappeared before police could detain him .
police suspect breininger has since received training in a terrorist camp , possibly in pakistan .
both german and american military forces in afghanistan are reported to have distributed pictures of him , warning that he is a potential suicide attacker .
how big a danger ?
the breininger case raises the question of how great a threat german converts to islam pose .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : police arrested a suspected member of the so-called " sauerland terror group " last year " converts can be more easily radicalized , " kai hirschmann of germany 's institute for terrorism research and study told a internet news site around the time of scheider 's arrest .
" as ' novices ' they try to be more religious than even the religious leaders , " hirschmann added .
" that often makes them especially fanatical and also especially dangerous . "
other experts , however , disagree with that assessment .
" you ca n't say that conversion to islam carries an explicit tendency toward becoming a radical , " stefan reichmuth , professor of islamic studies at the university of bochum told dw-world.de. estimates of the number of german converts to islam range between 15,000 and 80,000 .
but germany 's muslim league says that , of them , only about 25 fit the description of being radical or dangerously fanatic .
germany , which opposed the 2003 us-led invasion of iraq and has more than 3,000 troops in afghanistan under nato command , has tightened security and surveillance in response to the threat of attacks by islamic extremists .
the closest germany came to an attack was in july 2006 when suitcases containing homemade bombs were placed on two regional trains passing through cologne 's busy main train station .
they failed to detonate .
the september 11 , 2001 attacks on the united states were planned by an al-qaeda cell in the northern german city of hamburg led by mohammed atta , one of the hijackers of the planes involved in the attacks . dw staff -lrb- jc -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

engineers and health care workers are in high demand . in a bid to attract high-skilled workers from developing countries , the european union will push forward a blue card scheme , an eu official told reuters news agency .
the blue card , which will be good for up to four years , will speed up the application process and make it easier for workers to bring families , get housing and acquire long-term resident status .
the eu hopes that the coordinated system for allocating work permits will allow the eu to compete with other western countries for educated migrants such as technology workers and hospital staff .
as europe grows older , the shortage of skilled professionals is expected to increase .
currently , skilled workers make up less than 2 percent of migrants in the eu .
that 's compared with 10 percent of migrants in australia , 7.3 percent in canada and 3.2 percent in the united states , according to eu data .
restrictions on placement the blue card would allow an immigrant to work in one eu country .
after the first 18 months , the worker could then move to another country , but would still have to apply for a new blue card within a month of arrival .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany , like other eu countries , is short on engineers some say that these limitations , insisted on by countries such as germany , will make the scheme less attractive as the card will not allow blue card job seekers to move freely within the eu .

eu ministers are expected to endorse the blue card scheme before the end of 2008 and it will then come into force by mid-2010 .

" the total far exceeded the $ 3.2 billion that the world bank had estimated georgia would need to rebuild its infrastructure , settle its refugees and get its economy back on track . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : georgian premier lado gurgenidze was satisfied with the conference 's result georgian prime minister lado gurgenidze , who attended the one-day donor conference in brussels , told reporters afterwards that his country was " deeply moved and humbled by the demonstration of solidarity that we have received . " " $ 4.5 billion far exceeds the expectations that we had ... at a time like this to show such support is something that no georgian will ever forget , " gurgenidze said . us the biggest donor the united states , which pledged a billion dollars over three years , was the biggest donor at the meeting of 67 nations and major financial institutions , followed by substantial donations from the european commission and japan . eu commission chief jose manuel barroso said the global community had a " moral imperative " to help conflict-hit georiga as he spoke of the commission 's pledge of 500 million euros over three years for reconstruction . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ferrero-waldner , right , with france 's foreign minister kouchner at the donor conference japan pledged $ 200 million in aid over three years , while the international monetary fund has promised a 750-million-euro financial package . germany 's deputy foreign minister gernot erler announced 33.7 million euros while sweden , according to a japanese aide , pledged 40 million euros .
france offered seven million euros . the funds are to be used exclusively for civilian purposes such as rebuilding transport and energy infrastructure .
the hope is to restore economic growth in georgia to pre-conflict levels of more than 10 percent by 2010 . continuing tensions russia launched military attacks against georgia in early august , after tbilisi used military force against ethnic russian separatists in south ossetia . russian prime minister vladimir putin later told an american television network that he suspected washington of encouraging the georgian offensive , which coincided with the democratic primary , in an attempt to influence the course of us national elections . washington denied the charge .
russia has since recognized the independence of abkhazia and south ossetia .
the west , as well as tbilisi , has staunchly insisted that they remain part of georgia . little hope for the displaced although funds donated could , theoretically , also be directed toward abkhazia and south ossetia , there is little chance of that happening while the two breakaway regions are under de facto russia control . fighting between the various sides in the conflict left some 65,000 people displaced , among them around 30,000 ethnic georgians forced to leave the breakaway regions . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : refugees have little chance at present of going home but the european commission has said the prospects of such people ever returning to their homes are extremely bleak . meanwhile , the georgian government has welcomed financial assistance to compensate for war damage suffered by its citizenry and to revive the country 's economy . georgian foreign minister eka tkeshelashvili earlier told the afp news agency that aid money would be spent " so that georgia is back on track as the economic success story that we used to be prior to the war .

the case relates to the killing of 203 civilians near civitella , a town in italy 's central apennine mountain region , on june 29 , 1944 .
the rome-based court 's ruling came following a hearing in which a lawyer representing germany , augusto dossena , stated that his client was exempt from such payments under agreements signed by the rome and berlin governments in 1947 and 1961 .
" germany does not question the responsibility of its soldiers and officers who tarnished themselves with ferocious war crimes , " said dossena , who , according to the ansa news agency , also explained that berlin has made past payments amounting to 800,000 euros -lrb- $ 1.07 million -rrb- in connection with the civitella massacre .
but dossena said ordering germany to pay damages would violate international agreements and pave the way for thousands of people to seek war crime compensation on an individual basis . dpa news agency -lrb- th -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the case relates to the killing of 203 civilians near civitella , a town in italy 's central apennine mountain region , on june 29 , 1944 .

" germany does not question the responsibility of its soldiers and officers who tarnished themselves with ferocious war crimes , " said dossena , who , according to the ansa news agency , also explained that berlin has made past payments amounting to 800,000 euros -lrb- $ 1.07 million -rrb- in connection with the civitella massacre .

" the total far exceeded the $ 3.2 billion that the world bank had estimated georgia would need to rebuild its infrastructure , settle its refugees and get its economy back on track . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : georgian premier lado gurgenidze was satisfied with the conference 's result georgian prime minister lado gurgenidze , who attended the one-day donor conference in brussels , told reporters afterwards that his country was " deeply moved and humbled by the demonstration of solidarity that we have received . " " $ 4.5 billion far exceeds the expectations that we had ... at a time like this to show such support is something that no georgian will ever forget , " gurgenidze said . us the biggest donor the united states , which pledged a billion dollars over three years , was the biggest donor at the meeting of 67 nations and major financial institutions , followed by substantial donations from the european commission and japan . eu commission chief jose manuel barroso said the global community had a " moral imperative " to help conflict-hit georiga as he spoke of the commission 's pledge of 500 million euros over three years for reconstruction . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ferrero-waldner , right , with france 's foreign minister kouchner at the donor conference japan pledged $ 200 million in aid over three years , while the international monetary fund has promised a 750-million-euro financial package . germany 's deputy foreign minister gernot erler announced 33.7 million euros while sweden , according to a japanese aide , pledged 40 million euros .
france offered seven million euros . the funds are to be used exclusively for civilian purposes such as rebuilding transport and energy infrastructure .
the hope is to restore economic growth in georgia to pre-conflict levels of more than 10 percent by 2010 . continuing tensions russia launched military attacks against georgia in early august , after tbilisi used military force against ethnic russian separatists in south ossetia . russian prime minister vladimir putin later told an american television network that he suspected washington of encouraging the georgian offensive , which coincided with the democratic primary , in an attempt to influence the course of us national elections . washington denied the charge .
russia has since recognized the independence of abkhazia and south ossetia .
the west , as well as tbilisi , has staunchly insisted that they remain part of georgia . little hope for the displaced although funds donated could , theoretically , also be directed toward abkhazia and south ossetia , there is little chance of that happening while the two breakaway regions are under de facto russia control . fighting between the various sides in the conflict left some 65,000 people displaced , among them around 30,000 ethnic georgians forced to leave the breakaway regions . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : refugees have little chance at present of going home but the european commission has said the prospects of such people ever returning to their homes are extremely bleak . meanwhile , the georgian government has welcomed financial assistance to compensate for war damage suffered by its citizenry and to revive the country 's economy . georgian foreign minister eka tkeshelashvili earlier told the afp news agency that aid money would be spent " so that georgia is back on track as the economic success story that we used to be prior to the war .

now the question is : can the two bury the hatchet ? ballack 's broadside came in a newspaper interview , when he was asked about loew 's decision not to play veteran midfielder torsten frings in germany 's recent world cup qualifiers against russia and wales .
" respect and loyalty are the least one can expect as a veteran national player , " the germany captain told the frankfurter allgemeine zeitung .
ballack went on to name other examples of players he felt were squeezed out of the team without being given a fair chance .
at the head of his list was former national goalkeeper ollie kahn , who was demoted by loew 's predecessor , juergen klinsmann .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : frings has recently had an unwelcome new role in loew 's squad " a competition with jens lehmann was proclaimed that , to my eyes , he could n't win , " ballack said .
" the same was true with -lsb- defender -rsb- christian woerns who , in contrast to christoph metzelder , stayed true to one team and was n't sitting on the bench . "
ballack even defended striker kevin kuranyi , whom loew booted out of the squad entirely after kuranyi abandoned the team in response to not being nominated .
" -lsb- kuranyi -rsb- saw that it was going to be very difficult for him , even though he plays year in , year out in the champions league and has been a regular starter for a top bundesliga club for quite some time , " ballack said .
" those are important criteria for the national team , " the germany captain added .
" where will we end up if things like that no longer count ? "
surprise and disappointment bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the hero of germany 's recent win over wales was 24-year-old piotr trochowski loew seemed to be taken off guard by the verbal blasts from his most important player and representative on the pitch .
" i 'm fundamentally surprised that he chose to go public like this , " loew told the daily bild newspaper .
" and i 'm disappointed that he 's trying to affect personnel decisions in this way . "

now the question is : can the two bury the hatchet ? ballack 's broadside came in a newspaper interview , when he was asked about loew 's decision not to play veteran midfielder torsten frings in germany 's recent world cup qualifiers against russia and wales .
" respect and loyalty are the least one can expect as a veteran national player , " the germany captain told the frankfurter allgemeine zeitung .
ballack went on to name other examples of players he felt were squeezed out of the team without being given a fair chance .
at the head of his list was former national goalkeeper ollie kahn , who was demoted by loew 's predecessor , juergen klinsmann .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : frings has recently had an unwelcome new role in loew 's squad " a competition with jens lehmann was proclaimed that , to my eyes , he could n't win , " ballack said .
" the same was true with -lsb- defender -rsb- christian woerns who , in contrast to christoph metzelder , stayed true to one team and was n't sitting on the bench . "
ballack even defended striker kevin kuranyi , whom loew booted out of the squad entirely after kuranyi abandoned the team in response to not being nominated .
" -lsb- kuranyi -rsb- saw that it was going to be very difficult for him , even though he plays year in , year out in the champions league and has been a regular starter for a top bundesliga club for quite some time , " ballack said .
" those are important criteria for the national team , " the germany captain added .
" where will we end up if things like that no longer count ? "
surprise and disappointment bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the hero of germany 's recent win over wales was 24-year-old piotr trochowski loew seemed to be taken off guard by the verbal blasts from his most important player and representative on the pitch .
" i 'm fundamentally surprised that he chose to go public like this , " loew told the daily bild newspaper .
" and i 'm disappointed that he 's trying to affect personnel decisions in this way . "
loew said he had been up front with veteran players about their chances in the national side and insisted that it was up to him as coach to decide who played and who did n't .
loew stressed that he still wants ballack as team captain and would try to work through their differences .
but the coach admitted he did n't know precisely how or when to approach his angry star .

engineers and health care workers are in high demand . in a bid to attract high-skilled workers from developing countries , the european union will push forward a blue card scheme , an eu official told reuters news agency .
the blue card , which will be good for up to four years , will speed up the application process and make it easier for workers to bring families , get housing and acquire long-term resident status .
the eu hopes that the coordinated system for allocating work permits will allow the eu to compete with other western countries for educated migrants such as technology workers and hospital staff .
as europe grows older , the shortage of skilled professionals is expected to increase .
currently , skilled workers make up less than 2 percent of migrants in the eu .
that 's compared with 10 percent of migrants in australia , 7.3 percent in canada and 3.2 percent in the united states , according to eu data .
restrictions on placement the blue card would allow an immigrant to work in one eu country .
after the first 18 months , the worker could then move to another country , but would still have to apply for a new blue card within a month of arrival .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany , like other eu countries , is short on engineers some say that these limitations , insisted on by countries such as germany , will make the scheme less attractive as the card will not allow blue card job seekers to move freely within the eu .

eu ministers are expected to endorse the blue card scheme before the end of 2008 and it will then come into force by mid-2010 .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de terrorism -pipe- 22.10.2008 terrorist video highlights threat from fringe islamic converts großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " germany should expect attacks " as long as its soldiers are in afghanistan , breininger said german police said they 've discovered a video by a german convert to radical islamism saying he 's ready to wage jihad in afghanistan .
how typical - and how threatening - are converts like eric breininger ? officials from germany 's federal office of criminal investigation -lrb- bka -rrb- confirmed on wednesday , oct.22 , that the six minute video of breininger , who is wanted as a suspected member of a terrorist group , was indeed genuine .
" we assume that came from the international jihad union -lrb- iju -rrb- , " a bka spokesperson told the dpa news agency .
the iju is a radical islamist organization that originated in uzbekistan and has been linked with attempted terrorist acts in germany four weeks ago , the bka launched a public search for breiniger after rumors surfaced that he was in the balkans and on his way back to germany . but they withdrew the warning over the weekend .
also on wednesday , oct 22 , the police also arrested the younger brother of one of three men accused of planning attacks last year on us citizens and interests using chemical-filled drums , the 21-year-old turk , named only as burhan y. , was arrested at langen south of frankfurt and is a suspected helper for the banned iju .
" germany should expect attacks " in the video , the 21-year-old breininger discussed his whereabouts and motivation .
" i am located in afghanistan and am not personally planning an attack on germany , " breininger said in the video , before adding : " we declare war on every country that fights alongside america against muslims . "
but breininger also said that as long as german soldiers are in afghanistan and uzbekistan , “ germany should expect attacks , " without giving any further details .
shown in the video wearing a turban and carrying a kalashnikov , breininger hinted that he may be preparing to sacrifice his life for his cause .
" if allah wishes , he will call me to him as a jidhadi , " he said .
so how did a young man from a suburban town in southern germany become a fanatic apparently willing to die for his religious beliefs in afghanistan ?
fateful turn bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a poster published by germany 's federal office of criminal investigation shows eric breininger according to various reports in the german media , breininger 's parents divorced when he was an adolescent , and he reportedly started using hashish and alcohol at a relatively early age .
he was prone to getting into fights and had trouble with the police .
in late 2006 , breininger got a job for a package-delivery company , where he met a pakistani who got him interested in radical islam .
a short time later , he also became friends with a radical islamic convert named daniel schneider .
breininger began calling himself abdul ghaffar el almani , avoiding his old friends and burning his cds .
he swore off drugs and alcohol .
he married in a mosque , and his wife eva p. wore a veil .
the marriage was short-lived .
" he wanted me to clean and cook and said he was looking for another woman , " eva p. later said in a television interview .
in june 2007 , breininger sold off most of his belongings on ebay , saying he wanted to go abroad and learn arabic , and moved in with schneider .
in september , schneider , who had relocated to the western german region of sauerland , was arrested along with two other suspected islamists for allegedly trying to make car bombs and planning attacks on us targets in germany .
breininger disappeared before police could detain him .
police suspect breininger has since received training in a terrorist camp , possibly in pakistan .
both german and american military forces in afghanistan are reported to have distributed pictures of him , warning that he is a potential suicide attacker .
how big a danger ?
the breininger case raises the question of how great a threat german converts to islam pose .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : police arrested a suspected member of the so-called " sauerland terror group " last year " converts can be more easily radicalized , " kai hirschmann of germany 's institute for terrorism research and study told a internet news site around the time of scheider 's arrest .
" as ' novices ' they try to be more religious than even the religious leaders , " hirschmann added .
" that often makes them especially fanatical and also especially dangerous . "
other experts , however , disagree with that assessment .
" you ca n't say that conversion to islam carries an explicit tendency toward becoming a radical , " stefan reichmuth , professor of islamic studies at the university of bochum told dw-world.de. estimates of the number of german converts to islam range between 15,000 and 80,000 .
but germany 's muslim league says that , of them , only about 25 fit the description of being radical or dangerously fanatic .
germany , which opposed the 2003 us-led invasion of iraq and has more than 3,000 troops in afghanistan under nato command , has tightened security and surveillance in response to the threat of attacks by islamic extremists .
the closest germany came to an attack was in july 2006 when suitcases containing homemade bombs were placed on two regional trains passing through cologne 's busy main train station .
they failed to detonate .
the september 11 , 2001 attacks on the united states were planned by an al-qaeda cell in the northern german city of hamburg led by mohammed atta , one of the hijackers of the planes involved in the attacks . dw staff -lrb- jc -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de education -pipe- 22.10.2008 private schools could rescue ailing german system , expert says großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel 's plans for an " education republic " is still far off , one expert said a german expert on education and economics said he has little hope that wednesday 's summit between chancellor angela merkel and state education ministers will bring about change - even though it is sorely needed . merkel has called a meeting in dresden with education ministers from germany 's 16 states , on wednesday , oct .
22 .
she said she wants the summit to lift the country out of its learning rut . prize-winning economist and education researcher ludger woessmann , of the ifo institute in munich , argued that a radical change toward increased competition is the best way to offer a broader array of students a more even shot at education .
he added that fairness dictates that university students help pay their own way . dw-world : is this education summit a serious effort toward policy change , or more of a political gambit on the part of angela merkel ? ludger woessmann : initially , chancellor merkel raised a lot of expectations , and i think she honestly wanted to achieve something at the summit .
but it is becoming more obvious that there wo n't be any huge results that come out of it .
it 's a big disappointment . why do you say that ? at first she said that education is the key precondition to equality in our social market economy , and that she would make education her priority .
the fact is that in germany , more than in almost any other western country , education is tied to social background .
so fixing education is the key to allowing everyone to accept and participate in the social market economy . now it seems the heads of the -lrb- individual german states -rrb- have called her back to reality .
according to the constitution , the federal government has basically no say at all in education topics .
it is the business of the states .
and they are just playing political games to make sure the federal government does n't get any influence . what kind of influence should the federal government have ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german education is free - and classes are full i think it would be important to have a federal school evaluation system , as a first step to see how each state has performed .
it would make them accountable for what they do , and would create huge incentives to do better , to try harder .
it would put politicians under pressure to perform . basically there are two problems that need to be dealt with : one is that we do a pretty mediocre job on international comparative tests like pisa -lrb- an international , triennial study that compares the high-school students ' abilities - eds -rrb- .
the other problem is that education results are so strongly tied to family background . so how should the government - federal or state - deal with these problems ? i think more autonomy for individual schools is needed .
at the moment public schools have no autonomy in choosing their own staff .
teachers are largely assigned by central bureaucracies .
and there is clear evidence that that holds back the quality of education . more generally , i think something that would lead the way forward would be to create more choice and competition between schools by setting private schools on the same funding level as public schools . you mean switching to a system that the us would call charter schools ? not really .
charter schools in the us are just public schools that have more autonomy .
i am talking here about , maybe , church-run schools .
you have to remember that we do n't have the separation of church and state that the us has in terms of accepting funding . what we have seen empirically is that school systems perform best when schools are financed by the states , using little private funding , but operated largely by private initiatives . the model is a system like the netherlands , where three-quarters of students go to schools that are not operated by the state , but mostly by churches and other charities .
these schools benefit the low income children the most .
it gives them the opportunity to attend privately operated schools regardless of how much money the parents have . they are rare , but there are a few private schools in germany . right - and that is the problem .
because what we see in international comparisons is that systematically , students perform better in countries that build more on private school operations .
not private funding , but operations . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : woessmann eyes education 's economic impact in the netherlands ... the schools are all funded in the same way , and they get exactly the same amount of money per student as the public school gets .
that creates choice for parents .
it makes schools start to compete with each other in a way that helps students . and what do you see as a remedy for the problem of socio-economic bias ? one thing is clear that the early tracking of students into different types of schools at such an early age - right now they are tracked at age 10 , in the fourth grade - decreases the quality of performance in germany .
we can systematically see that this tracking does nothing to improve performance .
it just makes outcomes more strongly dependent on family background . we should delay the tracking , and reduce the tracking into just two levels , if at all .
but this is such a politically charged topic in germany that they wo n't even dare to discuss it at the summit . the subject of educational tracking is a real political hot potato and has been for years .
what are the chances it is changed ? it has been debated since the 70s .
and it divides people along party lines .
it is one of those things where the federalist structure of germany makes any big , sweeping change impossible . is there anything you think will , in fact , be dealt with at the summit ? well , the final thing that research tells us would actually increase opportunity and performance in general is to put more focus on early childhood education .
it is something germany has slowly moved into , and will probably be discussed at the summit .
but i don ’ t expect there will be any big news . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : low-income kids often get a worse start in germany right now , germany focuses on providing child care instead of early education per se - there is hardly any educational content in the preschool programs .
but more and more people are becoming aware of how important it is to introduce learning and educational goals at an early age .
it would help people who do n't have an educational environment at home . a recent oecd study shows low rates of university attendance in germany compared with elsewhere in europe .
what is behind that ? part of it is definitely due to this problem of early tracking .
it makes sure that a lot of very bright children from low socioeconomic backgrounds do not go into the " gymnasium , " the one track that leads straight to university . another is that we have a very strong vocational education system .
historically , more than half the students in each grade would go into the apprenticeship track . but a lot of people have not realized that the world has changed .
the vocational system is n't as safe and lucrative as it once was , because of globalization .
a lot of the medium-skilled jobs are outsourced into eastern europe or asia . german universities used to be free of charge , but recently some states introduced tuition fees .
some people are arguing that this makes it hard for low-income students to study .
what do you think ? i think that in general it makes a lot of sense to have students pay at least some fees for the university .
at the moment we make parents pay more for their child 's preschool than for a university degree .
this is kind of ridiculous - it is both inefficient and unfair . it is inefficient in the sense that the earlier you invest public money , the higher the returns will be .
so you can actually change the whole track of children 's if you make sure that early on they get a better education . it is unfair because in the current system , you make the state pay for a university education , which at the moment is much more open to children from rich families than from low-income families .
so in a sense , by funding the system with taxes , you are making low-income people pay for the university education of children of rich families . i think what is strongly needed , and what has really been missing , is to accompany these tuition fees - and we are talking about 500 euros per semester , or 1,000 euros per year -lrb- $ 650 or $ 1,300 -rrb- , which is nothing compared to the us or the uk - by easy , income-contingent loans at the same time .
so people could pay back the loans later on , if and when they are successful in the labor market . interview : jennifer abramsohn send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the board met in munich on tuesday , oct .
21 , and decided to " apply for stabilization measures , " said bavaria 's state finance minister , erwin huber , who heads bayernlb 's governing board .
huber , 62 , announced on wedesday that he is stepping down as finance minister because of the bayernlb debacle .
the southern regional bank is jointly owned by the state of bavaria and regional savings banks .
the bank ran into trouble more than a year ago due to its heavy investment in asset-backed securities .
these securities lost much of their value when the us market for high-risk mortgages collapsed in 2007 .
as the bank was recovering from this loss , it was hit a second time when interbank loans dried up in mid-september .
in addition , german regional bank westlb is reportedly also eyeing the government bank rescue plan . separately , german police led by prosecutors searched the offices of the federally owned kfw bank wednesday .
this action was part of an investigation into the transfer of 319 million euros to us bank lehman brothers , the day after the financial crisis triggered the new york-based financial house 's collapsed .
deal comes with strings attached bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german banks are still trying to find their balance germany 's federal government approved a 500-billion-euro federal rescue package on friday .
germany 's rescue package was similar to measures taken by governments across europe .
on monday , the cabinet finalized the conditions banks must follow if they want to make use of the rescue package .
those conditions include bayernlb limiting executive pay to 500,000 euros .
it will also send any dividend payments to the state .
and the government will get the right to review any lending practices seen as risky .
the bank also has to promise to continue making loans to small- and medium-sized companies .
bayernlb is germany 's second biggest regional bank .
it posted 770 million euros in losses during the first three months of 2008 .
that forced shareholders to come up with 4.8 billion euros in loan guarantees .
the state link allowed regional banks to offer lower credit rates .
when the european commission cut back on that privilege in 2005 , the banks began engaging in risky investments as a way to keep making money .
other banks holding off bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the government has thrown banks a lifeline but the era of the landesbank could be coming to a close , merck finck analyst konrad becker told afp news agency .
" their business model does not work any more , " becker said .
" the era when each state had its own bank is over . "
other landesbanken have not said whether they will also ask for a bailout .
an hsh nordbank spokesman said on tuesday that no decision had been made .
a spokesman for the landesbank berlin said that there were currently no plans to take the rescue package .
other banks were similarly uncommitted , according to afp .
less that one in four germans expressed trust in domestic banks , according to a survey for the frankfurter allgemeine zeitung .
only 52 percent of germans said they trusted the bank in which they had their account . dw staff -lrb- th -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" germany does not question the responsibility of its soldiers and officers who tarnished themselves with ferocious war crimes , " said dossena , who , according to the ansa news agency , also explained that berlin has made past payments amounting to 800,000 euros -lrb- $ 1.07 million -rrb- in connection with the civitella massacre .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de education -pipe- 22.10.2008 private schools could rescue ailing german system , expert says großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel 's plans for an " education republic " is still far off , one expert said a german expert on education and economics said he has little hope that wednesday 's summit between chancellor angela merkel and state education ministers will bring about change - even though it is sorely needed . merkel has called a meeting in dresden with education ministers from germany 's 16 states , on wednesday , oct .
22 .
she said she wants the summit to lift the country out of its learning rut . prize-winning economist and education researcher ludger woessmann , of the ifo institute in munich , argued that a radical change toward increased competition is the best way to offer a broader array of students a more even shot at education .
he added that fairness dictates that university students help pay their own way . dw-world : is this education summit a serious effort toward policy change , or more of a political gambit on the part of angela merkel ? ludger woessmann : initially , chancellor merkel raised a lot of expectations , and i think she honestly wanted to achieve something at the summit .
but it is becoming more obvious that there wo n't be any huge results that come out of it .
it 's a big disappointment . why do you say that ? at first she said that education is the key precondition to equality in our social market economy , and that she would make education her priority .
the fact is that in germany , more than in almost any other western country , education is tied to social background .
so fixing education is the key to allowing everyone to accept and participate in the social market economy . now it seems the heads of the -lrb- individual german states -rrb- have called her back to reality .
according to the constitution , the federal government has basically no say at all in education topics .
it is the business of the states .
and they are just playing political games to make sure the federal government does n't get any influence . what kind of influence should the federal government have ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german education is free - and classes are full i think it would be important to have a federal school evaluation system , as a first step to see how each state has performed .
it would make them accountable for what they do , and would create huge incentives to do better , to try harder .
it would put politicians under pressure to perform . basically there are two problems that need to be dealt with : one is that we do a pretty mediocre job on international comparative tests like pisa -lrb- an international , triennial study that compares the high-school students ' abilities - eds -rrb- .
the other problem is that education results are so strongly tied to family background . so how should the government - federal or state - deal with these problems ? i think more autonomy for individual schools is needed .
at the moment public schools have no autonomy in choosing their own staff .
teachers are largely assigned by central bureaucracies .
and there is clear evidence that that holds back the quality of education . more generally , i think something that would lead the way forward would be to create more choice and competition between schools by setting private schools on the same funding level as public schools . you mean switching to a system that the us would call charter schools ? not really .
charter schools in the us are just public schools that have more autonomy .
i am talking here about , maybe , church-run schools .
you have to remember that we do n't have the separation of church and state that the us has in terms of accepting funding . what we have seen empirically is that school systems perform best when schools are financed by the states , using little private funding , but operated largely by private initiatives . the model is a system like the netherlands , where three-quarters of students go to schools that are not operated by the state , but mostly by churches and other charities .
these schools benefit the low income children the most .
it gives them the opportunity to attend privately operated schools regardless of how much money the parents have . they are rare , but there are a few private schools in germany . right - and that is the problem .
because what we see in international comparisons is that systematically , students perform better in countries that build more on private school operations .
not private funding , but operations . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : woessmann eyes education 's economic impact in the netherlands ... the schools are all funded in the same way , and they get exactly the same amount of money per student as the public school gets .
that creates choice for parents .
it makes schools start to compete with each other in a way that helps students . and what do you see as a remedy for the problem of socio-economic bias ? one thing is clear that the early tracking of students into different types of schools at such an early age - right now they are tracked at age 10 , in the fourth grade - decreases the quality of performance in germany .
we can systematically see that this tracking does nothing to improve performance .
it just makes outcomes more strongly dependent on family background . we should delay the tracking , and reduce the tracking into just two levels , if at all .
but this is such a politically charged topic in germany that they wo n't even dare to discuss it at the summit . the subject of educational tracking is a real political hot potato and has been for years .
what are the chances it is changed ? it has been debated since the 70s .
and it divides people along party lines .
it is one of those things where the federalist structure of germany makes any big , sweeping change impossible . is there anything you think will , in fact , be dealt with at the summit ? well , the final thing that research tells us would actually increase opportunity and performance in general is to put more focus on early childhood education .
it is something germany has slowly moved into , and will probably be discussed at the summit .
but i don ’ t expect there will be any big news . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : low-income kids often get a worse start in germany right now , germany focuses on providing child care instead of early education per se - there is hardly any educational content in the preschool programs .
but more and more people are becoming aware of how important it is to introduce learning and educational goals at an early age .
it would help people who do n't have an educational environment at home . a recent oecd study shows low rates of university attendance in germany compared with elsewhere in europe .
what is behind that ? part of it is definitely due to this problem of early tracking .
it makes sure that a lot of very bright children from low socioeconomic backgrounds do not go into the " gymnasium , " the one track that leads straight to university . another is that we have a very strong vocational education system .

22 .
she said she wants the summit to lift the country out of its learning rut . prize-winning economist and education researcher ludger woessmann , of the ifo institute in munich , argued that a radical change toward increased competition is the best way to offer a broader array of students a more even shot at education .
he added that fairness dictates that university students help pay their own way . dw-world : is this education summit a serious effort toward policy change , or more of a political gambit on the part of angela merkel ? ludger woessmann : initially , chancellor merkel raised a lot of expectations , and i think she honestly wanted to achieve something at the summit .
but it is becoming more obvious that there wo n't be any huge results that come out of it .
it 's a big disappointment . why do you say that ? at first she said that education is the key precondition to equality in our social market economy , and that she would make education her priority .
the fact is that in germany , more than in almost any other western country , education is tied to social background .
so fixing education is the key to allowing everyone to accept and participate in the social market economy . now it seems the heads of the -lrb- individual german states -rrb- have called her back to reality .
according to the constitution , the federal government has basically no say at all in education topics .
it is the business of the states .
and they are just playing political games to make sure the federal government does n't get any influence . what kind of influence should the federal government have ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german education is free - and classes are full i think it would be important to have a federal school evaluation system , as a first step to see how each state has performed .
it would make them accountable for what they do , and would create huge incentives to do better , to try harder .
it would put politicians under pressure to perform . basically there are two problems that need to be dealt with : one is that we do a pretty mediocre job on international comparative tests like pisa -lrb- an international , triennial study that compares the high-school students ' abilities - eds -rrb- .
the other problem is that education results are so strongly tied to family background . so how should the government - federal or state - deal with these problems ? i think more autonomy for individual schools is needed .
at the moment public schools have no autonomy in choosing their own staff .
teachers are largely assigned by central bureaucracies .
and there is clear evidence that that holds back the quality of education . more generally , i think something that would lead the way forward would be to create more choice and competition between schools by setting private schools on the same funding level as public schools . you mean switching to a system that the us would call charter schools ? not really .
charter schools in the us are just public schools that have more autonomy .
i am talking here about , maybe , church-run schools .
you have to remember that we do n't have the separation of church and state that the us has in terms of accepting funding . what we have seen empirically is that school systems perform best when schools are financed by the states , using little private funding , but operated largely by private initiatives . the model is a system like the netherlands , where three-quarters of students go to schools that are not operated by the state , but mostly by churches and other charities .
these schools benefit the low income children the most .
it gives them the opportunity to attend privately operated schools regardless of how much money the parents have . they are rare , but there are a few private schools in germany . right - and that is the problem .
because what we see in international comparisons is that systematically , students perform better in countries that build more on private school operations .
not private funding , but operations . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : woessmann eyes education 's economic impact in the netherlands ... the schools are all funded in the same way , and they get exactly the same amount of money per student as the public school gets .
that creates choice for parents .
it makes schools start to compete with each other in a way that helps students . and what do you see as a remedy for the problem of socio-economic bias ? one thing is clear that the early tracking of students into different types of schools at such an early age - right now they are tracked at age 10 , in the fourth grade - decreases the quality of performance in germany .
we can systematically see that this tracking does nothing to improve performance .
it just makes outcomes more strongly dependent on family background . we should delay the tracking , and reduce the tracking into just two levels , if at all .
but this is such a politically charged topic in germany that they wo n't even dare to discuss it at the summit . the subject of educational tracking is a real political hot potato and has been for years .
what are the chances it is changed ? it has been debated since the 70s .
and it divides people along party lines .
it is one of those things where the federalist structure of germany makes any big , sweeping change impossible . is there anything you think will , in fact , be dealt with at the summit ? well , the final thing that research tells us would actually increase opportunity and performance in general is to put more focus on early childhood education .
it is something germany has slowly moved into , and will probably be discussed at the summit .
but i don ’ t expect there will be any big news . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : low-income kids often get a worse start in germany right now , germany focuses on providing child care instead of early education per se - there is hardly any educational content in the preschool programs .
but more and more people are becoming aware of how important it is to introduce learning and educational goals at an early age .
it would help people who do n't have an educational environment at home . a recent oecd study shows low rates of university attendance in germany compared with elsewhere in europe .
what is behind that ? part of it is definitely due to this problem of early tracking .
it makes sure that a lot of very bright children from low socioeconomic backgrounds do not go into the " gymnasium , " the one track that leads straight to university . another is that we have a very strong vocational education system .
historically , more than half the students in each grade would go into the apprenticeship track . but a lot of people have not realized that the world has changed .

what is behind that ? part of it is definitely due to this problem of early tracking .
it makes sure that a lot of very bright children from low socioeconomic backgrounds do not go into the " gymnasium , " the one track that leads straight to university . another is that we have a very strong vocational education system .
historically , more than half the students in each grade would go into the apprenticeship track . but a lot of people have not realized that the world has changed .
the vocational system is n't as safe and lucrative as it once was , because of globalization .
a lot of the medium-skilled jobs are outsourced into eastern europe or asia . german universities used to be free of charge , but recently some states introduced tuition fees .
some people are arguing that this makes it hard for low-income students to study .
what do you think ? i think that in general it makes a lot of sense to have students pay at least some fees for the university .
at the moment we make parents pay more for their child 's preschool than for a university degree .
this is kind of ridiculous - it is both inefficient and unfair . it is inefficient in the sense that the earlier you invest public money , the higher the returns will be .
so you can actually change the whole track of children 's if you make sure that early on they get a better education . it is unfair because in the current system , you make the state pay for a university education , which at the moment is much more open to children from rich families than from low-income families .
so in a sense , by funding the system with taxes , you are making low-income people pay for the university education of children of rich families . i think what is strongly needed , and what has really been missing , is to accompany these tuition fees - and we are talking about 500 euros per semester , or 1,000 euros per year -lrb- $ 650 or $ 1,300 -rrb- , which is nothing compared to the us or the uk - by easy , income-contingent loans at the same time .
so people could pay back the loans later on , if and when they are successful in the labor market . interview : jennifer abramsohn send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

22 .
she said she wants the summit to lift the country out of its learning rut . prize-winning economist and education researcher ludger woessmann , of the ifo institute in munich , argued that a radical change toward increased competition is the best way to offer a broader array of students a more even shot at education .
he added that fairness dictates that university students help pay their own way . dw-world : is this education summit a serious effort toward policy change , or more of a political gambit on the part of angela merkel ? ludger woessmann : initially , chancellor merkel raised a lot of expectations , and i think she honestly wanted to achieve something at the summit .
but it is becoming more obvious that there wo n't be any huge results that come out of it .
it 's a big disappointment . why do you say that ? at first she said that education is the key precondition to equality in our social market economy , and that she would make education her priority .
the fact is that in germany , more than in almost any other western country , education is tied to social background .
so fixing education is the key to allowing everyone to accept and participate in the social market economy . now it seems the heads of the -lrb- individual german states -rrb- have called her back to reality .
according to the constitution , the federal government has basically no say at all in education topics .
it is the business of the states .
and they are just playing political games to make sure the federal government does n't get any influence . what kind of influence should the federal government have ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german education is free - and classes are full i think it would be important to have a federal school evaluation system , as a first step to see how each state has performed .
it would make them accountable for what they do , and would create huge incentives to do better , to try harder .
it would put politicians under pressure to perform . basically there are two problems that need to be dealt with : one is that we do a pretty mediocre job on international comparative tests like pisa -lrb- an international , triennial study that compares the high-school students ' abilities - eds -rrb- .
the other problem is that education results are so strongly tied to family background . so how should the government - federal or state - deal with these problems ? i think more autonomy for individual schools is needed .
at the moment public schools have no autonomy in choosing their own staff .
teachers are largely assigned by central bureaucracies .
and there is clear evidence that that holds back the quality of education . more generally , i think something that would lead the way forward would be to create more choice and competition between schools by setting private schools on the same funding level as public schools . you mean switching to a system that the us would call charter schools ? not really .
charter schools in the us are just public schools that have more autonomy .
i am talking here about , maybe , church-run schools .
you have to remember that we do n't have the separation of church and state that the us has in terms of accepting funding . what we have seen empirically is that school systems perform best when schools are financed by the states , using little private funding , but operated largely by private initiatives . the model is a system like the netherlands , where three-quarters of students go to schools that are not operated by the state , but mostly by churches and other charities .
these schools benefit the low income children the most .
it gives them the opportunity to attend privately operated schools regardless of how much money the parents have . they are rare , but there are a few private schools in germany . right - and that is the problem .
because what we see in international comparisons is that systematically , students perform better in countries that build more on private school operations .
not private funding , but operations . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : woessmann eyes education 's economic impact in the netherlands ... the schools are all funded in the same way , and they get exactly the same amount of money per student as the public school gets .
that creates choice for parents .
it makes schools start to compete with each other in a way that helps students . and what do you see as a remedy for the problem of socio-economic bias ? one thing is clear that the early tracking of students into different types of schools at such an early age - right now they are tracked at age 10 , in the fourth grade - decreases the quality of performance in germany .
we can systematically see that this tracking does nothing to improve performance .
it just makes outcomes more strongly dependent on family background . we should delay the tracking , and reduce the tracking into just two levels , if at all .
but this is such a politically charged topic in germany that they wo n't even dare to discuss it at the summit . the subject of educational tracking is a real political hot potato and has been for years .
what are the chances it is changed ? it has been debated since the 70s .
and it divides people along party lines .
it is one of those things where the federalist structure of germany makes any big , sweeping change impossible . is there anything you think will , in fact , be dealt with at the summit ? well , the final thing that research tells us would actually increase opportunity and performance in general is to put more focus on early childhood education .
it is something germany has slowly moved into , and will probably be discussed at the summit .
but i don ’ t expect there will be any big news . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : low-income kids often get a worse start in germany right now , germany focuses on providing child care instead of early education per se - there is hardly any educational content in the preschool programs .
but more and more people are becoming aware of how important it is to introduce learning and educational goals at an early age .
it would help people who do n't have an educational environment at home . a recent oecd study shows low rates of university attendance in germany compared with elsewhere in europe .
what is behind that ? part of it is definitely due to this problem of early tracking .
it makes sure that a lot of very bright children from low socioeconomic backgrounds do not go into the " gymnasium , " the one track that leads straight to university . another is that we have a very strong vocational education system .

how typical - and how threatening - are converts like eric breininger ? officials from germany 's federal office of criminal investigation -lrb- bka -rrb- confirmed on wednesday , oct.22 , that the six minute video of breininger , who is wanted as a suspected member of a terrorist group , was indeed genuine .
" we assume that came from the international jihad union -lrb- iju -rrb- , " a bka spokesperson told the dpa news agency .
the iju is a radical islamist organization that originated in uzbekistan and has been linked with attempted terrorist acts in germany four weeks ago , the bka launched a public search for breiniger after rumors surfaced that he was in the balkans and on his way back to germany . but they withdrew the warning over the weekend .
also on wednesday , oct 22 , the police also arrested the younger brother of one of three men accused of planning attacks last year on us citizens and interests using chemical-filled drums , the 21-year-old turk , named only as burhan y. , was arrested at langen south of frankfurt and is a suspected helper for the banned iju .
" germany should expect attacks " in the video , the 21-year-old breininger discussed his whereabouts and motivation .
" i am located in afghanistan and am not personally planning an attack on germany , " breininger said in the video , before adding : " we declare war on every country that fights alongside america against muslims . "
but breininger also said that as long as german soldiers are in afghanistan and uzbekistan , “ germany should expect attacks , " without giving any further details .
shown in the video wearing a turban and carrying a kalashnikov , breininger hinted that he may be preparing to sacrifice his life for his cause .
" if allah wishes , he will call me to him as a jidhadi , " he said .
so how did a young man from a suburban town in southern germany become a fanatic apparently willing to die for his religious beliefs in afghanistan ?
fateful turn bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a poster published by germany 's federal office of criminal investigation shows eric breininger according to various reports in the german media , breininger 's parents divorced when he was an adolescent , and he reportedly started using hashish and alcohol at a relatively early age .
he was prone to getting into fights and had trouble with the police .
in late 2006 , breininger got a job for a package-delivery company , where he met a pakistani who got him interested in radical islam .
a short time later , he also became friends with a radical islamic convert named daniel schneider .
breininger began calling himself abdul ghaffar el almani , avoiding his old friends and burning his cds .
he swore off drugs and alcohol .
he married in a mosque , and his wife eva p. wore a veil .
the marriage was short-lived .
" he wanted me to clean and cook and said he was looking for another woman , " eva p. later said in a television interview .
in june 2007 , breininger sold off most of his belongings on ebay , saying he wanted to go abroad and learn arabic , and moved in with schneider .
in september , schneider , who had relocated to the western german region of sauerland , was arrested along with two other suspected islamists for allegedly trying to make car bombs and planning attacks on us targets in germany .
breininger disappeared before police could detain him .
police suspect breininger has since received training in a terrorist camp , possibly in pakistan .
both german and american military forces in afghanistan are reported to have distributed pictures of him , warning that he is a potential suicide attacker .
how big a danger ?
the breininger case raises the question of how great a threat german converts to islam pose .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : police arrested a suspected member of the so-called " sauerland terror group " last year " converts can be more easily radicalized , " kai hirschmann of germany 's institute for terrorism research and study told a internet news site around the time of scheider 's arrest .
" as ' novices ' they try to be more religious than even the religious leaders , " hirschmann added .
" that often makes them especially fanatical and also especially dangerous . "
other experts , however , disagree with that assessment .
" you ca n't say that conversion to islam carries an explicit tendency toward becoming a radical , " stefan reichmuth , professor of islamic studies at the university of bochum told dw-world.de. estimates of the number of german converts to islam range between 15,000 and 80,000 .
but germany 's muslim league says that , of them , only about 25 fit the description of being radical or dangerously fanatic .
germany , which opposed the 2003 us-led invasion of iraq and has more than 3,000 troops in afghanistan under nato command , has tightened security and surveillance in response to the threat of attacks by islamic extremists .
the closest germany came to an attack was in july 2006 when suitcases containing homemade bombs were placed on two regional trains passing through cologne 's busy main train station .
they failed to detonate .
the september 11 , 2001 attacks on the united states were planned by an al-qaeda cell in the northern german city of hamburg led by mohammed atta , one of the hijackers of the planes involved in the attacks . dw staff -lrb- jc -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" the total far exceeded the $ 3.2 billion that the world bank had estimated georgia would need to rebuild its infrastructure , settle its refugees and get its economy back on track . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : georgian premier lado gurgenidze was satisfied with the conference 's result georgian prime minister lado gurgenidze , who attended the one-day donor conference in brussels , told reporters afterwards that his country was " deeply moved and humbled by the demonstration of solidarity that we have received . " " $ 4.5 billion far exceeds the expectations that we had ... at a time like this to show such support is something that no georgian will ever forget , " gurgenidze said . us the biggest donor the united states , which pledged a billion dollars over three years , was the biggest donor at the meeting of 67 nations and major financial institutions , followed by substantial donations from the european commission and japan . eu commission chief jose manuel barroso said the global community had a " moral imperative " to help conflict-hit georiga as he spoke of the commission 's pledge of 500 million euros over three years for reconstruction . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ferrero-waldner , right , with france 's foreign minister kouchner at the donor conference japan pledged $ 200 million in aid over three years , while the international monetary fund has promised a 750-million-euro financial package . germany 's deputy foreign minister gernot erler announced 33.7 million euros while sweden , according to a japanese aide , pledged 40 million euros .
france offered seven million euros . the funds are to be used exclusively for civilian purposes such as rebuilding transport and energy infrastructure .

how typical - and how threatening - are converts like eric breininger ? officials from germany 's federal office of criminal investigation -lrb- bka -rrb- confirmed on wednesday , oct.22 , that the six minute video of breininger , who is wanted as a suspected member of a terrorist group , was indeed genuine .
" we assume that came from the international jihad union -lrb- iju -rrb- , " a bka spokesperson told the dpa news agency .
the iju is a radical islamist organization that originated in uzbekistan and has been linked with attempted terrorist acts in germany four weeks ago , the bka launched a public search for breiniger after rumors surfaced that he was in the balkans and on his way back to germany . but they withdrew the warning over the weekend .
also on wednesday , oct 22 , the police also arrested the younger brother of one of three men accused of planning attacks last year on us citizens and interests using chemical-filled drums , the 21-year-old turk , named only as burhan y. , was arrested at langen south of frankfurt and is a suspected helper for the banned iju .
" germany should expect attacks " in the video , the 21-year-old breininger discussed his whereabouts and motivation .
" i am located in afghanistan and am not personally planning an attack on germany , " breininger said in the video , before adding : " we declare war on every country that fights alongside america against muslims . "
but breininger also said that as long as german soldiers are in afghanistan and uzbekistan , “ germany should expect attacks , " without giving any further details .
shown in the video wearing a turban and carrying a kalashnikov , breininger hinted that he may be preparing to sacrifice his life for his cause .
" if allah wishes , he will call me to him as a jidhadi , " he said .
so how did a young man from a suburban town in southern germany become a fanatic apparently willing to die for his religious beliefs in afghanistan ?
fateful turn bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a poster published by germany 's federal office of criminal investigation shows eric breininger according to various reports in the german media , breininger 's parents divorced when he was an adolescent , and he reportedly started using hashish and alcohol at a relatively early age .
he was prone to getting into fights and had trouble with the police .
in late 2006 , breininger got a job for a package-delivery company , where he met a pakistani who got him interested in radical islam .
a short time later , he also became friends with a radical islamic convert named daniel schneider .
breininger began calling himself abdul ghaffar el almani , avoiding his old friends and burning his cds .
he swore off drugs and alcohol .
he married in a mosque , and his wife eva p. wore a veil .
the marriage was short-lived .
" he wanted me to clean and cook and said he was looking for another woman , " eva p. later said in a television interview .
in june 2007 , breininger sold off most of his belongings on ebay , saying he wanted to go abroad and learn arabic , and moved in with schneider .
in september , schneider , who had relocated to the western german region of sauerland , was arrested along with two other suspected islamists for allegedly trying to make car bombs and planning attacks on us targets in germany .
breininger disappeared before police could detain him .
police suspect breininger has since received training in a terrorist camp , possibly in pakistan .
both german and american military forces in afghanistan are reported to have distributed pictures of him , warning that he is a potential suicide attacker .
how big a danger ?
the breininger case raises the question of how great a threat german converts to islam pose .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : police arrested a suspected member of the so-called " sauerland terror group " last year " converts can be more easily radicalized , " kai hirschmann of germany 's institute for terrorism research and study told a internet news site around the time of scheider 's arrest .
" as ' novices ' they try to be more religious than even the religious leaders , " hirschmann added .
" that often makes them especially fanatical and also especially dangerous . "
other experts , however , disagree with that assessment .
" you ca n't say that conversion to islam carries an explicit tendency toward becoming a radical , " stefan reichmuth , professor of islamic studies at the university of bochum told dw-world.de. estimates of the number of german converts to islam range between 15,000 and 80,000 .
but germany 's muslim league says that , of them , only about 25 fit the description of being radical or dangerously fanatic .
germany , which opposed the 2003 us-led invasion of iraq and has more than 3,000 troops in afghanistan under nato command , has tightened security and surveillance in response to the threat of attacks by islamic extremists .
the closest germany came to an attack was in july 2006 when suitcases containing homemade bombs were placed on two regional trains passing through cologne 's busy main train station .
they failed to detonate .

engineers and health care workers are in high demand . in a bid to attract high-skilled workers from developing countries , the european union will push forward a blue card scheme , an eu official told reuters news agency .
the blue card , which will be good for up to four years , will speed up the application process and make it easier for workers to bring families , get housing and acquire long-term resident status .
the eu hopes that the coordinated system for allocating work permits will allow the eu to compete with other western countries for educated migrants such as technology workers and hospital staff .

eu ministers are expected to endorse the blue card scheme before the end of 2008 and it will then come into force by mid-2010 .

now the question is : can the two bury the hatchet ? ballack 's broadside came in a newspaper interview , when he was asked about loew 's decision not to play veteran midfielder torsten frings in germany 's recent world cup qualifiers against russia and wales .
" respect and loyalty are the least one can expect as a veteran national player , " the germany captain told the frankfurter allgemeine zeitung .
ballack went on to name other examples of players he felt were squeezed out of the team without being given a fair chance .
at the head of his list was former national goalkeeper ollie kahn , who was demoted by loew 's predecessor , juergen klinsmann .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : frings has recently had an unwelcome new role in loew 's squad " a competition with jens lehmann was proclaimed that , to my eyes , he could n't win , " ballack said .
" the same was true with -lsb- defender -rsb- christian woerns who , in contrast to christoph metzelder , stayed true to one team and was n't sitting on the bench . "
ballack even defended striker kevin kuranyi , whom loew booted out of the squad entirely after kuranyi abandoned the team in response to not being nominated .
" -lsb- kuranyi -rsb- saw that it was going to be very difficult for him , even though he plays year in , year out in the champions league and has been a regular starter for a top bundesliga club for quite some time , " ballack said .
" those are important criteria for the national team , " the germany captain added .
" where will we end up if things like that no longer count ? "
surprise and disappointment bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the hero of germany 's recent win over wales was 24-year-old piotr trochowski loew seemed to be taken off guard by the verbal blasts from his most important player and representative on the pitch .
" i 'm fundamentally surprised that he chose to go public like this , " loew told the daily bild newspaper .
" and i 'm disappointed that he 's trying to affect personnel decisions in this way . "
loew said he had been up front with veteran players about their chances in the national side and insisted that it was up to him as coach to decide who played and who did n't .
loew stressed that he still wants ballack as team captain and would try to work through their differences .
but the coach admitted he did n't know precisely how or when to approach his angry star .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : kuranyi has almost certainly played his last match for loew " i want to think about the form in which i 'll talk to michael , " loew said .
" on principle i do n't tolerate interference .
but there will be a discussion .
not a few days from now , but very soon . "
the outcome of that chat may determine whether ballack is nominated for germany 's upcoming friendly against england .
" all our players know the rules concerning public criticism , " loew said .

now the question is : can the two bury the hatchet ? ballack 's broadside came in a newspaper interview , when he was asked about loew 's decision not to play veteran midfielder torsten frings in germany 's recent world cup qualifiers against russia and wales .
" respect and loyalty are the least one can expect as a veteran national player , " the germany captain told the frankfurter allgemeine zeitung .
ballack went on to name other examples of players he felt were squeezed out of the team without being given a fair chance .
at the head of his list was former national goalkeeper ollie kahn , who was demoted by loew 's predecessor , juergen klinsmann .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : frings has recently had an unwelcome new role in loew 's squad " a competition with jens lehmann was proclaimed that , to my eyes , he could n't win , " ballack said .
" the same was true with -lsb- defender -rsb- christian woerns who , in contrast to christoph metzelder , stayed true to one team and was n't sitting on the bench . "
ballack even defended striker kevin kuranyi , whom loew booted out of the squad entirely after kuranyi abandoned the team in response to not being nominated .
" -lsb- kuranyi -rsb- saw that it was going to be very difficult for him , even though he plays year in , year out in the champions league and has been a regular starter for a top bundesliga club for quite some time , " ballack said .
" those are important criteria for the national team , " the germany captain added .
" where will we end up if things like that no longer count ? "
surprise and disappointment bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the hero of germany 's recent win over wales was 24-year-old piotr trochowski loew seemed to be taken off guard by the verbal blasts from his most important player and representative on the pitch .
" i 'm fundamentally surprised that he chose to go public like this , " loew told the daily bild newspaper .
" and i 'm disappointed that he 's trying to affect personnel decisions in this way . "
loew said he had been up front with veteran players about their chances in the national side and insisted that it was up to him as coach to decide who played and who did n't .
loew stressed that he still wants ballack as team captain and would try to work through their differences .
but the coach admitted he did n't know precisely how or when to approach his angry star .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : kuranyi has almost certainly played his last match for loew " i want to think about the form in which i 'll talk to michael , " loew said .
" on principle i do n't tolerate interference .
but there will be a discussion .
not a few days from now , but very soon . "
the outcome of that chat may determine whether ballack is nominated for germany 's upcoming friendly against england .
" all our players know the rules concerning public criticism , " loew said .
bosses back loew bildunterschrift : ballack also feuded with germany team manager oliver bierhoff at euro 2008 germany 's football functionaries were quick to back the coach .
" this constant complaining ! " said german soccer association vice-president and soccer legend frank beckenbauer in a television interview .

they should shut their mouths and play soccer . "
german soccer association president theo zwanziger seconded those sentiments .

huber , 62 , announced on wedesday that he is stepping down as finance minister because of the bayernlb debacle .
the southern regional bank is jointly owned by the state of bavaria and regional savings banks .
the bank ran into trouble more than a year ago due to its heavy investment in asset-backed securities .

those conditions include bayernlb limiting executive pay to 500,000 euros .
it will also send any dividend payments to the state .
and the government will get the right to review any lending practices seen as risky .
the bank also has to promise to continue making loans to small- and medium-sized companies .
bayernlb is germany 's second biggest regional bank .
it posted 770 million euros in losses during the first three months of 2008 .
that forced shareholders to come up with 4.8 billion euros in loan guarantees .
the state link allowed regional banks to offer lower credit rates .

" rwe will participate in projects outside germany .
it depends on financing and on what partner we find .
but i think that three to five -lrb- projects -rrb- are in the pipeline , " chief executive juergen grossmann told the daily sueddeutsche zeitung newspaper .
essen-based rwe was one of " a small handful of power suppliers in europe with competence in nuclear plants , " he said .
grossmann did not give any indications where these projects would be built .
nuclear powerhouse rwe has been operating nuclear stations in germany since the 1960s .
nuclear power , which accounts for 30 percent of all power in germany , is currently being phased out .
rwe 's biblis plant will be allowed to operate until 2012 and its newest plant in emsland will have to go offline in about 2020 .
rwe , along with its subsidiaries , provides electricity to more than 20 million people and gas to 10 million .
most of its customers are in europe .
earlier this month , bulgaria chose rwe as the winning bidder for 49-percent stake in the belene power company , which will finance and run a four-billion-euro -lrb- $ 5.1-billion -rrb- nuclear plant near the northern town of belene . dw staff -lrb- th -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

now the question is : can the two bury the hatchet ? ballack 's broadside came in a newspaper interview , when he was asked about loew 's decision not to play veteran midfielder torsten frings in germany 's recent world cup qualifiers against russia and wales .
" respect and loyalty are the least one can expect as a veteran national player , " the germany captain told the frankfurter allgemeine zeitung .
ballack went on to name other examples of players he felt were squeezed out of the team without being given a fair chance .
at the head of his list was former national goalkeeper ollie kahn , who was demoted by loew 's predecessor , juergen klinsmann .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : frings has recently had an unwelcome new role in loew 's squad " a competition with jens lehmann was proclaimed that , to my eyes , he could n't win , " ballack said .
" the same was true with -lsb- defender -rsb- christian woerns who , in contrast to christoph metzelder , stayed true to one team and was n't sitting on the bench . "
ballack even defended striker kevin kuranyi , whom loew booted out of the squad entirely after kuranyi abandoned the team in response to not being nominated .
" -lsb- kuranyi -rsb- saw that it was going to be very difficult for him , even though he plays year in , year out in the champions league and has been a regular starter for a top bundesliga club for quite some time , " ballack said .
" those are important criteria for the national team , " the germany captain added .
" where will we end up if things like that no longer count ? "
surprise and disappointment bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the hero of germany 's recent win over wales was 24-year-old piotr trochowski loew seemed to be taken off guard by the verbal blasts from his most important player and representative on the pitch .
" i 'm fundamentally surprised that he chose to go public like this , " loew told the daily bild newspaper .
" and i 'm disappointed that he 's trying to affect personnel decisions in this way . "
loew said he had been up front with veteran players about their chances in the national side and insisted that it was up to him as coach to decide who played and who did n't .
loew stressed that he still wants ballack as team captain and would try to work through their differences .
but the coach admitted he did n't know precisely how or when to approach his angry star .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : kuranyi has almost certainly played his last match for loew " i want to think about the form in which i 'll talk to michael , " loew said .
" on principle i do n't tolerate interference .
but there will be a discussion .
not a few days from now , but very soon . "
the outcome of that chat may determine whether ballack is nominated for germany 's upcoming friendly against england .
" all our players know the rules concerning public criticism , " loew said .
bosses back loew bildunterschrift : ballack also feuded with germany team manager oliver bierhoff at euro 2008 germany 's football functionaries were quick to back the coach .
" this constant complaining ! " said german soccer association vice-president and soccer legend frank beckenbauer in a television interview .
" they 've become a pack of wimps - unbelievable !
they should shut their mouths and play soccer . "
german soccer association president theo zwanziger seconded those sentiments .
" i 'm disappointed by michael ballack 's behavior , " zwanziger said .
" this has created a difficult and complicated situation . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ballack will likely only see a yellow card for his latest ourburst zwanziger also stressed that germany under loew was headed in the right direction .
" the development of our national team over the past few years has been absolutely positive so i do n't understand at all why there should be criticism of joachim loew coming from the team via the media , " zwanziger said .
but while germany could thrive without players like frings and kuranyi , there is little question that the national side needs ballack , its on-the-field leader and most technically gifted player .
so loew may have no other choice but to forgive , or simply ignore , ballack 's attacks . dw staff -lrb- jc -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the board met in munich on tuesday , oct .
21 , and decided to " apply for stabilization measures , " said bavaria 's state finance minister , erwin huber , who heads bayernlb 's governing board .
huber , 62 , announced on wedesday that he is stepping down as finance minister because of the bayernlb debacle .
the southern regional bank is jointly owned by the state of bavaria and regional savings banks .
the bank ran into trouble more than a year ago due to its heavy investment in asset-backed securities .
these securities lost much of their value when the us market for high-risk mortgages collapsed in 2007 .
as the bank was recovering from this loss , it was hit a second time when interbank loans dried up in mid-september .
in addition , german regional bank westlb is reportedly also eyeing the government bank rescue plan . separately , german police led by prosecutors searched the offices of the federally owned kfw bank wednesday .
this action was part of an investigation into the transfer of 319 million euros to us bank lehman brothers , the day after the financial crisis triggered the new york-based financial house 's collapsed .
deal comes with strings attached bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german banks are still trying to find their balance germany 's federal government approved a 500-billion-euro federal rescue package on friday .
germany 's rescue package was similar to measures taken by governments across europe .
on monday , the cabinet finalized the conditions banks must follow if they want to make use of the rescue package .
those conditions include bayernlb limiting executive pay to 500,000 euros .
it will also send any dividend payments to the state .
and the government will get the right to review any lending practices seen as risky .
the bank also has to promise to continue making loans to small- and medium-sized companies .
bayernlb is germany 's second biggest regional bank .
it posted 770 million euros in losses during the first three months of 2008 .
that forced shareholders to come up with 4.8 billion euros in loan guarantees .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de terrorism -pipe- 22.10.2008 terrorist video highlights threat from fringe islamic converts großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " germany should expect attacks " as long as its soldiers are in afghanistan , breininger said german police said they 've discovered a video by a german convert to radical islamism saying he 's ready to wage jihad in afghanistan .
how typical - and how threatening - are converts like eric breininger ? officials from germany 's federal office of criminal investigation -lrb- bka -rrb- confirmed on wednesday , oct.22 , that the six minute video of breininger , who is wanted as a suspected member of a terrorist group , was indeed genuine .
" we assume that came from the international jihad union -lrb- iju -rrb- , " a bka spokesperson told the dpa news agency .
the iju is a radical islamist organization that originated in uzbekistan and has been linked with attempted terrorist acts in germany four weeks ago , the bka launched a public search for breiniger after rumors surfaced that he was in the balkans and on his way back to germany . but they withdrew the warning over the weekend .
also on wednesday , oct 22 , the police also arrested the younger brother of one of three men accused of planning attacks last year on us citizens and interests using chemical-filled drums , the 21-year-old turk , named only as burhan y. , was arrested at langen south of frankfurt and is a suspected helper for the banned iju .
" germany should expect attacks " in the video , the 21-year-old breininger discussed his whereabouts and motivation .
" i am located in afghanistan and am not personally planning an attack on germany , " breininger said in the video , before adding : " we declare war on every country that fights alongside america against muslims . "
but breininger also said that as long as german soldiers are in afghanistan and uzbekistan , “ germany should expect attacks , " without giving any further details .
shown in the video wearing a turban and carrying a kalashnikov , breininger hinted that he may be preparing to sacrifice his life for his cause .
" if allah wishes , he will call me to him as a jidhadi , " he said .
so how did a young man from a suburban town in southern germany become a fanatic apparently willing to die for his religious beliefs in afghanistan ?
fateful turn bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a poster published by germany 's federal office of criminal investigation shows eric breininger according to various reports in the german media , breininger 's parents divorced when he was an adolescent , and he reportedly started using hashish and alcohol at a relatively early age .
he was prone to getting into fights and had trouble with the police .
in late 2006 , breininger got a job for a package-delivery company , where he met a pakistani who got him interested in radical islam .
a short time later , he also became friends with a radical islamic convert named daniel schneider .
breininger began calling himself abdul ghaffar el almani , avoiding his old friends and burning his cds .
he swore off drugs and alcohol .
he married in a mosque , and his wife eva p. wore a veil .
the marriage was short-lived .
" he wanted me to clean and cook and said he was looking for another woman , " eva p. later said in a television interview .
in june 2007 , breininger sold off most of his belongings on ebay , saying he wanted to go abroad and learn arabic , and moved in with schneider .
in september , schneider , who had relocated to the western german region of sauerland , was arrested along with two other suspected islamists for allegedly trying to make car bombs and planning attacks on us targets in germany .
breininger disappeared before police could detain him .
police suspect breininger has since received training in a terrorist camp , possibly in pakistan .
both german and american military forces in afghanistan are reported to have distributed pictures of him , warning that he is a potential suicide attacker .
how big a danger ?
the breininger case raises the question of how great a threat german converts to islam pose .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : police arrested a suspected member of the so-called " sauerland terror group " last year " converts can be more easily radicalized , " kai hirschmann of germany 's institute for terrorism research and study told a internet news site around the time of scheider 's arrest .
" as ' novices ' they try to be more religious than even the religious leaders , " hirschmann added .
" that often makes them especially fanatical and also especially dangerous . "
other experts , however , disagree with that assessment .
" you ca n't say that conversion to islam carries an explicit tendency toward becoming a radical , " stefan reichmuth , professor of islamic studies at the university of bochum told dw-world.de. estimates of the number of german converts to islam range between 15,000 and 80,000 .
but germany 's muslim league says that , of them , only about 25 fit the description of being radical or dangerously fanatic .
germany , which opposed the 2003 us-led invasion of iraq and has more than 3,000 troops in afghanistan under nato command , has tightened security and surveillance in response to the threat of attacks by islamic extremists .
the closest germany came to an attack was in july 2006 when suitcases containing homemade bombs were placed on two regional trains passing through cologne 's busy main train station .
they failed to detonate .
the september 11 , 2001 attacks on the united states were planned by an al-qaeda cell in the northern german city of hamburg led by mohammed atta , one of the hijackers of the planes involved in the attacks . dw staff -lrb- jc -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the board met in munich on tuesday , oct .
21 , and decided to " apply for stabilization measures , " said bavaria 's state finance minister , erwin huber , who heads bayernlb 's governing board .
huber , 62 , announced on wedesday that he is stepping down as finance minister because of the bayernlb debacle .
the southern regional bank is jointly owned by the state of bavaria and regional savings banks .
the bank ran into trouble more than a year ago due to its heavy investment in asset-backed securities .
these securities lost much of their value when the us market for high-risk mortgages collapsed in 2007 .
as the bank was recovering from this loss , it was hit a second time when interbank loans dried up in mid-september .
in addition , german regional bank westlb is reportedly also eyeing the government bank rescue plan . separately , german police led by prosecutors searched the offices of the federally owned kfw bank wednesday .
this action was part of an investigation into the transfer of 319 million euros to us bank lehman brothers , the day after the financial crisis triggered the new york-based financial house 's collapsed .
deal comes with strings attached bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german banks are still trying to find their balance germany 's federal government approved a 500-billion-euro federal rescue package on friday .
germany 's rescue package was similar to measures taken by governments across europe .
on monday , the cabinet finalized the conditions banks must follow if they want to make use of the rescue package .
those conditions include bayernlb limiting executive pay to 500,000 euros .
it will also send any dividend payments to the state .
and the government will get the right to review any lending practices seen as risky .
the bank also has to promise to continue making loans to small- and medium-sized companies .
bayernlb is germany 's second biggest regional bank .
it posted 770 million euros in losses during the first three months of 2008 .
that forced shareholders to come up with 4.8 billion euros in loan guarantees .
the state link allowed regional banks to offer lower credit rates .
when the european commission cut back on that privilege in 2005 , the banks began engaging in risky investments as a way to keep making money .
other banks holding off bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the government has thrown banks a lifeline but the era of the landesbank could be coming to a close , merck finck analyst konrad becker told afp news agency .
" their business model does not work any more , " becker said .
" the era when each state had its own bank is over . "
other landesbanken have not said whether they will also ask for a bailout .
an hsh nordbank spokesman said on tuesday that no decision had been made .
a spokesman for the landesbank berlin said that there were currently no plans to take the rescue package .
other banks were similarly uncommitted , according to afp .
less that one in four germans expressed trust in domestic banks , according to a survey for the frankfurter allgemeine zeitung .
only 52 percent of germans said they trusted the bank in which they had their account . dw staff -lrb- th -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the chandrayaan mission aims to create a three-dimensional atlas of earth 's stellar neighbor , locate and confirm the presence of water , and study the lunar soil 's chemical and mineral composition . this is where the sir-2 infrared spectrometer developed by a group headed by urs mall at the max planck institute , comes into play . " at the moment , this mission offers use the only opportunity to actively be part of lunar research , " mall said in an interview with the daily berliner zeitung . the sir-2 works by using the optical properties of mineral components in lunar soil .
from the data collected , the researchers hope to gain insight into the early history of the moon and , by extension , the earth . the development of sir-2 was made possible by funding from the max planck society and the european space agency -lrb- esa -rrb- and reflects the society 's growing relationship with india . a total of 11 scientific instruments are part of the chandrayaan mission .
five were built in india ; the others were supplied by nasa , esa , and bulgaria . asian space race in the current asian space race , india has been competing with countries such as china and japan to develop its rocket and satellite technology .
more than a dozen indian satellites currently orbit earth , but this will be the first time the country has sent a spacecraft beyond earth 's atmosphere . if successful , india will beat its competitors , at least in terms of cost .

engineers and health care workers are in high demand . in a bid to attract high-skilled workers from developing countries , the european union will push forward a blue card scheme , an eu official told reuters news agency .
the blue card , which will be good for up to four years , will speed up the application process and make it easier for workers to bring families , get housing and acquire long-term resident status .
the eu hopes that the coordinated system for allocating work permits will allow the eu to compete with other western countries for educated migrants such as technology workers and hospital staff .
as europe grows older , the shortage of skilled professionals is expected to increase .
currently , skilled workers make up less than 2 percent of migrants in the eu .
that 's compared with 10 percent of migrants in australia , 7.3 percent in canada and 3.2 percent in the united states , according to eu data .
restrictions on placement the blue card would allow an immigrant to work in one eu country .
after the first 18 months , the worker could then move to another country , but would still have to apply for a new blue card within a month of arrival .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany , like other eu countries , is short on engineers some say that these limitations , insisted on by countries such as germany , will make the scheme less attractive as the card will not allow blue card job seekers to move freely within the eu .
" it is clearly a step in the right direction but i do n't expect it to be a big success because if you compare it to the united states , a similar title gives access to the whole us market , " jakob von weizsaecker , a german labor market specialist with the brussels-based bruegel economic policy think tank told reuters .
eu ministers are expected to endorse the blue card scheme before the end of 2008 and it will then come into force by mid-2010 .
new eu countries such as the czech republic insisted on the delay , since their own citizens are not yet allowed to work in all eu countries . dw staff -lrb- th -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" my father had died and the door of our house was shut because there were no more men in the family .
" so i cut my hair and from that day on kept the door of the house open , " she says grandly .
dressed in a baggy black suit and waist-coat , with a small fez hat perched on cropped white hair , qamile has all the trappings of a typical albanian old man .
but hearing the 88-year-old 's high-pitched voice and seeing her smooth but deeply-lined face quickly dispelled any doubts about her true identity . "
i think it 's better to be barren like me , than to have children that bring grief to you , i 've had a good life " qamile stema " people respect me , and shake my hand , as they would with a man ; but when they hear my voice and see my face they know i 'm a woman , " qamile says .
" and they still say to me , ' how you 've been ' - just as they would say to a man ! " she adds with a broad smile .
qamile is one of just a handful of " sworn virgins " still alive in albania : women , typically from poor rural communities in the north of the country , who opted to change their status , though not their sex .
according to the sociologist , zydi dervishi , who has interviewed more than 20 such women , some took such a life-changing decision in order to avoid an unwanted marriage ; others , to make up for the absence of a male heir in the family .
he says that in albania 's historically patriarchal society , a family without a son or a father figure was often considered leaderless .
sitting in the afternoon sun on the patio of a small brick house , three hours north of the capital , tirana , qamile relates how her father 's death had left her mother alone with just daughters .
qamile , the youngest , decided that she would take her father 's place .
she says that no one forced it upon her , and that some of her relatives later tried to persuade her to swap back .
but , qamile says , as the self-proclaimed " man " in her family , she enjoyed privileges beyond the reach of other women .
she earned the right to carry a rifle , as well as the duty to defend family honour ; she could work and smoke with the other men in the village and even pray with the men at the local mosque .
traditional punishment at weddings and funerals , she would always hang out with the other men and came to be seen as one of the village elders .
" even now she 's always sought out in the village for advice of what 's good and bad , " one of her relatives says .
while qamile clearly seems at ease in male company - laughing and joking with men as she talks about her life - other " sworn virgins " did not have such a positive experience , according to mr dervishi .
he says that some of the women he has spoken to - almost all now in their 80s - swapped roles when young in order to avoid their families being " punished " under age-old customs for refusing to marry .
tradition , particularly prevalent in the north of albania , dictated that turning down a suitor could lead to the man 's family exacting revenge on the girl 's father or brother .
the only way to settle the dispute without bloodshed , according to the same tradition , was for the girl to declare herself a virgin for life and assume the role of a man - and thus never marry .
such practices were frowned upon during the 40-year period of communist rule in albania , said mr dervishi , allowing some of these girls to swap back .
those who remained in their assumed roles , however , were often deeply unhappy , he says .
" they were neither accepted wholly by men , nor accepted wholly by women . "
post-communist democracy , migration and the influence of the west has radically changed albania and the position of women in society .
the sworn virgins are now seen as part of the country 's fading folklore , said mr dervishi .
yet qamile , who has rarely ventured out of her northern village on account of her arthritis , says she has no regrets about having taken such a momentous decision .
" i 'm happier to have stayed as a man because these days children leave home and then you are all alone .
" i think it 's better to be barren like me , than to have children that bring grief to you .
i 've had a good life . "

" my father had died and the door of our house was shut because there were no more men in the family .
" so i cut my hair and from that day on kept the door of the house open , " she says grandly .
dressed in a baggy black suit and waist-coat , with a small fez hat perched on cropped white hair , qamile has all the trappings of a typical albanian old man .
but hearing the 88-year-old 's high-pitched voice and seeing her smooth but deeply-lined face quickly dispelled any doubts about her true identity .

" and they still say to me , ' how you 've been ' - just as they would say to a man ! " she adds with a broad smile .
qamile is one of just a handful of " sworn virgins " still alive in albania : women , typically from poor rural communities in the north of the country , who opted to change their status , though not their sex .
according to the sociologist , zydi dervishi , who has interviewed more than 20 such women , some took such a life-changing decision in order to avoid an unwanted marriage ; others , to make up for the absence of a male heir in the family .
he says that in albania 's historically patriarchal society , a family without a son or a father figure was often considered leaderless .

advertisement qamile says she has no regrets about her life-changing decision sitting in the afternoon sun on the patio of a small brick house , three hours north of the capital , tirana , qamile relates how her father 's death had left her mother alone with just daughters .
qamile , the youngest , decided that she would take her father 's place .
she says that no one forced it upon her , and that some of her relatives later tried to persuade her to swap back .
but , qamile says , as the self-proclaimed " man " in her family , she enjoyed privileges beyond the reach of other women .
she earned the right to carry a rifle , as well as the duty to defend family honour ; she could work and smoke with the other men in the village and even pray with the men at the local mosque .
traditional punishment at weddings and funerals , she would always hang out with the other men and came to be seen as one of the village elders .
" even now she 's always sought out in the village for advice of what 's good and bad , " one of her relatives says .
while qamile clearly seems at ease in male company - laughing and joking with men as she talks about her life - other " sworn virgins " did not have such a positive experience , according to mr dervishi .
he says that some of the women he has spoken to - almost all now in their 80s - swapped roles when young in order to avoid their families being " punished " under age-old customs for refusing to marry .
tradition , particularly prevalent in the north of albania , dictated that turning down a suitor could lead to the man 's family exacting revenge on the girl 's father or brother .
" sworn virgins " are part of albania 's fading folklore the only way to settle the dispute without bloodshed , according to the same tradition , was for the girl to declare herself a virgin for life and assume the role of a man - and thus never marry .
such practices were frowned upon during the 40-year period of communist rule in albania , said mr dervishi , allowing some of these girls to swap back .
those who remained in their assumed roles , however , were often deeply unhappy , he says .
" they were neither accepted wholly by men , nor accepted wholly by women . "
post-communist democracy , migration and the influence of the west has radically changed albania and the position of women in society .
the sworn virgins are now seen as part of the country 's fading folklore , said mr dervishi .
yet qamile , who has rarely ventured out of her northern village on account of her arthritis , says she has no regrets about having taken such a momentous decision .
" i 'm happier to have stayed as a man because these days children leave home and then you are all alone .
" i think it 's better to be barren like me , than to have children that bring grief to you .
i 've had a good life . "

a total of 48 unofficial exclusions were reported last year , with 24 already in the first half of 2008 .
charity snap cymru expressed concern that the figures have not improved a year after a children 's commissioner report into the practice .
the commissioner 's office said it was working on bringing the figures down .
officially , schools should keep pupils out of class only if they have given them a fixed or permanent exclusion .
but some parents are asked to keep their children at home " unofficially " , which is known as an unofficial exclusion .
however , when a child is unofficially excluded from school they often do not receive the education and the formal support which is their right and which could help solve their problems .
snap cymru frequently has cases of unofficial exclusion referred to it .
the number of cases the organisation receives offers an accurate indicator of how prevalent the practice of unofficial exclusion is across the country .
this is because the real number of these kinds of exclusions is not known , as local authorities often do not know when schools exclude a pupil unofficially .
snap 's latest figures show there has been no appreciable change in unofficial exclusion numbers across wales .
chief executive director denise inger said it could cause major problems for the children involved both at school and in their later life .
" our case studies show unofficial exclusions will often lead to fixed-term exclusions and perhaps ultimately permanent exclusions at a later time , " she said .
" for a child to be excluded from school , unofficially or otherwise , gives the wrong message to that child , it says we have given up on you .
" it lowers the self-esteem and does not help the child in any part of their development . "
education inspector estyn , which highlighted the issue last year , echoed the concerns .
inspector meilyr rowlands said : " it 's like bullying really , we know it happens but because it 's something that happens informally we do n't actually have figures on it .
literacy link " we hope it 's not very common and hope it 's decreasing because we clearly think it 's unlawful and therefore not helpful to the young people involved or for their families .
" clearly there should not be any unlawful exclusions at all but we would also like to see a reduction in the number of permanent and temporary exclusions . "
both organisations said much could be done to combat the practice .
estyn said it had identified a " very clear link " between between literacy and bad behaviour , which often leads to unofficial exclusions .
it said if literacy skills could be improved by making courses , curriculums and teaching methods more interesting , maybe bad behaviour and exclusions , both official and unofficial , could be reduced .
snap strongly recommended that inter-agency meetings be automatically introduced if any child is excluded from school for more than 10 days .
deputy children 's commissioner maria battle said it was " very disappointing that on the ground and in the reality of children 's lives the problem is still the same as it was " .
" there seems to be in wales some of the best policies in the world but there 's this huge implementation gap and we 're going to concentrating on closing that gap .
" we need to make recommendations a reality in children 's lives and in their families lives . "
the welsh assembly government said the information from snap was useful , but could not be considered as a definitive view about unofficial exclusions in wales .
