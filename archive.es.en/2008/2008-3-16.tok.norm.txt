merkel for her part said the visit would begin a " new chapter " in relations between the two states , who established full diplomatic ties in 1965 .
the visit by merkel , who is accompanied by a high-powered delegation of cabinet ministers , business leaders and scientists , is to mark the 60th anniversary of the founding of the jewish state , which will be officially celebrated in may .
bildunterschrift : merkel 's visit is believed by many to be of historic importance " on the one hand we should never lose sight of our responsibility for the past - and german policy never will - on the other , we should look to the future of our relations " with israel , merkel said on the eve of her trip .
she said that anyone familiar with the history of the nazi era and the holocaust - in which 6 million jews lost their lives - would know that germany 's stable and friendly relations with israel today were " one of the miracles of history . "
apart from its symbolic value , however , the visit will also mark the start of annual consultations at cabinet level to be held between the two governments .
merkel and her eight accompanying ministers are due to hold a joint meeting with the israeli cabinet on monday morning , in what is seen as a definite indication of the strengthening of the ties between the two countries .
on tuesday , merkel will speak in the knesset , after the chamber modified its regulations which stipulate that only a visiting head of state , as opposed to head of government , may speak to the body .
pressure to address palestinian concerns bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some politicians in germany would want to see merkel take a tougher stance against israel ahead of her trip , however , merkel came under pressure in germany to use the visit to israel to criticize the jewish state over its settlement policy .
the head of the german-israeli parliamentary group , the greens politician jerzy montag , said merkel should raise points of difference between prime minister ehud olmert 's government and the palestinians .
" the chancellor should raise critical questions and make it clear that israel should - for both humanitarian reasons and out of long-term self-interest - look for new solutions in the settlement question , the handling of the checkpoints and the general living conditions of the palestinians , " montag said .
social democrat foreign policy spokesman rolf muetzenich seconded this view , while werner hoyer , a foreign policy spokesman for the liberal fdp regretted that merkel was not seeing palestinian president mahmoud abbas during the visit .
merkel ' office said the chancellor had spoken to abbas by phone on friday concerning the status of the current talks initiated by us president george w. bush at annapolis last year .
international conference bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany hopes to play a constructive role in resolving the mideast conflict abbas had asked merkel to raise the issue of israeli plans to restart the building of settlements in east jerusalem , saying that this was hampering the annapolis process .
merkel pledged to report back to the palestinian leader on her return from israel .
the palestinian leader also welcomed a german proposal to hold a conference on the middle east in berlin in june with the aim of boosting efforts to build an effective judicial system and police force in a future palestinian state .
israel , the palestinians and other arab states as well as the united states , russia , the un and european union members will be invited to the gathering .
german government spokesman ulrich wilhelm said that the event would not be a peace conference but a meeting to support the efforts of former british prime minister tony blair in his role as a eu coordinator seeking to build a modern palestinian state . dw staff -lrb- tt -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

but ocampo does n't particularly like the term " international court " anyway . " we 're a safeguard system .
we 're not some kind of global supreme court , " he said . on march 11 , 2003 , this " security system " began its work .
eighteen judges were named and , several days later , the chief prosecutor was appointed . moreno-ocampo 's job is to investigate each case before it goes to the judges .
he only steps in when a country 's highest court can not or does not want to punish a war crime , a crime against humanity or an act of genocide . individuals , not states , are tried and prosecuted in the international criminal court - though only if they come from a country that has ratified the court 's protocol or committed the crime in a country that has signed it .
so far , that has only happened with cases from congo , uganda and the central african republic .
otherwise , the un security council has to commission an investigation , which was the case in darfur . icc focuses on africa bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : luis moreno-ocampo is from argentina currently , the international criminal court is only working on these four cases .
" i looked for the most difficult cases and it turned out that they were all in africa , " said moreno-ocampo . the court does n't have jurisdiction in the middle east , since the countries there have not ratified its protocol .
neither has the united states .
most of the court 's 105 members are in europe , south america - and africa . the first case that it took on , congo , has already led to the trial of former militia leader thomas lubanga dyilo .
last october , a second congolese war criminal , germain katanga , was extradited to the hague . considering the court 's greatest weakness - namely , that it does n't have its own police but has to rely on help from the country in question or from international peacekeeping forces - this initial case is seen as a considerable success . victims can claim compensation apart from the absence of police , head judge philippe kirsch sees a second challenge : " this court operates under much more difficult conditions than other tribunals , especially because we investigate conflicts that are still going on . " the court has learned from other tribunals that it is crucial to involve the victims themselves , added kirsch . " in earlier tribunals , victims were mainly present as witnesses , but not to demand their own rights , " he said .
" at the international criminal court , they can not only demand their rights but also receive compensation . " another significant difference from other tribunals is the court 's initial chamber , which reviews evidence and separates the important material from the less important .
this allows for greater efficiency in subsequent trials . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : lubanga -lrb- right -rrb- was the first person arrested for trial at the icc it also prevents defendants from reading off long , drawn-out monologues or summoning witnesses that extend the trial by months or even years but do n't contribute anything constructive - like slobodan milosevic did at the international criminal tribunal for the former yugoslavia . opposition from the us despite its achievements , the international criminal court has continually had to defend itself against skeptics .
above all , the us .
president george w. bush has rejected ratifying the court 's protocol because he fears that americans could also be brought to trial . china , russia and india also have n't ratified it .
despite the absence of support from these important countries , kirsch is optimistic . " there has already been a development in countries that had objected to the international criminal court , " he said .
" our work is purely judicial and for this reason there 's more trust in the court than there was before . " the unshaven chief prosecutor also expressed hope that the court 's work would have a positive impact .

they 'll be joining the growing ranks of health care workers from former communist countries . country doctors are few and far between in germany .
general practitioners in the countryside earn around 20 percent less than their colleagues in the cities .
in the eastern states in particular , many working doctors either go abroad or to large urban hospitals and specialized practices , where there are more private patients and therefore more money to be earned .
the result is an ever-worsening doctor shortage outside the cities , which health ministry officials in the state of brandenburg now hope to reverse with a unique project - allowing doctors from eastern europe to pick up the slack .
the initiative , unveiled this week , is a win-win idea .
it foresees countering the doctor shortfall in brandenburg by allocating out-of-work doctors from former communist countries to country practices - not only helping integrate germany 's minorities into the working world but also helping solve what has become an acute problem within the health services .
the eastern european element bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : many old people are reluctant to get into homes in fact , eastern europeans have long been a presence within germany 's health services .
as germany struggles to cope with an ageing population , carers from eastern europe are stepping in to help the country meet a growing need for trained workers .
many of them work illegally , but growing numbers of internet agencies now provide the services of hired help from countries such as poland , romania , hungary and bulgaria .
nonetheless , many of them operate in a legal gray area given germany 's restrictions of free movement of labor within the eu .
one way the carers can circumvent these regulations is by registering in their home countries as freelancers , which allows them to spend up to six months working in germany .
agencies tend to send them to various eu countries for limited periods and then rotate them across the continent .
other agencies are entirely above board , offering east european professionals a chance to sign contracts with companies in their home countries which work with partner agencies in germany .
they get sent not only to private homes but also to understaffed hospitals and clinics .
dumping prices ?
but critics say that the eastern europeans are providing cheap labor and undercutting their german counterparts .
coming from poorer countries , they are usually willing to work for considerably less than their german counterparts and often prove more flexible to families looking after aged relations at home .
given that the agencies are also taking a cut , how profitable is it for the nurses themselves ?
" few of them last longer than six months , " said michaela niclaus from the agency " help4seniors . " 29-year-old marta from krakow did n't even stay that long .
she was sent to the small town of treis-karden in rhineland-palatinate to look after johannes wessler 's 87-year-old mother .
" my mother ca n't be on her own in the house , " wessler said .
" she ca n't get around by herself and she does n't want to go into a home . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany is struggling to look after its ageing population his problems were answered when he found marta on an agency web site .
he is n't the only one in his neighborhood to take advantage of affordable 24-hour care by trained eastern european care workers .
these days , the area - which is popular with pensioners - is home to growing numbers of poles , romanians and bulgarians all looking after the elderly local population .
but marta was allowed just two hours off a day , six days a week - and packed her bags after less than six months .
by 2011 at the latest , the government in berlin will be able to lift restrictions of free movement of workers within the eu .
until then , marta can be easily replaced . dw staff -lrb- jp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de health -pipe- 16.03.2008 eastern europeans pick up health care slack in germany großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : many eastern european doctors in germany have spent years unemployed a new initiative in brandenburg is aiming to remedy germany 's acute doctor shortage with professionals from eastern europe .
they 'll be joining the growing ranks of health care workers from former communist countries . country doctors are few and far between in germany .
general practitioners in the countryside earn around 20 percent less than their colleagues in the cities .
in the eastern states in particular , many working doctors either go abroad or to large urban hospitals and specialized practices , where there are more private patients and therefore more money to be earned .
the result is an ever-worsening doctor shortage outside the cities , which health ministry officials in the state of brandenburg now hope to reverse with a unique project - allowing doctors from eastern europe to pick up the slack .
the initiative , unveiled this week , is a win-win idea .
it foresees countering the doctor shortfall in brandenburg by allocating out-of-work doctors from former communist countries to country practices - not only helping integrate germany 's minorities into the working world but also helping solve what has become an acute problem within the health services .
the eastern european element bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : many old people are reluctant to get into homes in fact , eastern europeans have long been a presence within germany 's health services .
as germany struggles to cope with an ageing population , carers from eastern europe are stepping in to help the country meet a growing need for trained workers .
many of them work illegally , but growing numbers of internet agencies now provide the services of hired help from countries such as poland , romania , hungary and bulgaria .
nonetheless , many of them operate in a legal gray area given germany 's restrictions of free movement of labor within the eu .
one way the carers can circumvent these regulations is by registering in their home countries as freelancers , which allows them to spend up to six months working in germany .
agencies tend to send them to various eu countries for limited periods and then rotate them across the continent .
other agencies are entirely above board , offering east european professionals a chance to sign contracts with companies in their home countries which work with partner agencies in germany .
they get sent not only to private homes but also to understaffed hospitals and clinics .
dumping prices ?
but critics say that the eastern europeans are providing cheap labor and undercutting their german counterparts .
coming from poorer countries , they are usually willing to work for considerably less than their german counterparts and often prove more flexible to families looking after aged relations at home .
given that the agencies are also taking a cut , how profitable is it for the nurses themselves ?
" few of them last longer than six months , " said michaela niclaus from the agency " help4seniors . " 29-year-old marta from krakow did n't even stay that long .
she was sent to the small town of treis-karden in rhineland-palatinate to look after johannes wessler 's 87-year-old mother .
" my mother ca n't be on her own in the house , " wessler said .
" she ca n't get around by herself and she does n't want to go into a home . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany is struggling to look after its ageing population his problems were answered when he found marta on an agency web site .
he is n't the only one in his neighborhood to take advantage of affordable 24-hour care by trained eastern european care workers .
these days , the area - which is popular with pensioners - is home to growing numbers of poles , romanians and bulgarians all looking after the elderly local population .
but marta was allowed just two hours off a day , six days a week - and packed her bags after less than six months .
by 2011 at the latest , the government in berlin will be able to lift restrictions of free movement of workers within the eu .
until then , marta can be easily replaced . dw staff -lrb- jp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

merkel for her part said the visit would begin a " new chapter " in relations between the two states , who established full diplomatic ties in 1965 .
the visit by merkel , who is accompanied by a high-powered delegation of cabinet ministers , business leaders and scientists , is to mark the 60th anniversary of the founding of the jewish state , which will be officially celebrated in may .
bildunterschrift : merkel 's visit is believed by many to be of historic importance " on the one hand we should never lose sight of our responsibility for the past - and german policy never will - on the other , we should look to the future of our relations " with israel , merkel said on the eve of her trip .
she said that anyone familiar with the history of the nazi era and the holocaust - in which 6 million jews lost their lives - would know that germany 's stable and friendly relations with israel today were " one of the miracles of history . "
apart from its symbolic value , however , the visit will also mark the start of annual consultations at cabinet level to be held between the two governments .
merkel and her eight accompanying ministers are due to hold a joint meeting with the israeli cabinet on monday morning , in what is seen as a definite indication of the strengthening of the ties between the two countries .
on tuesday , merkel will speak in the knesset , after the chamber modified its regulations which stipulate that only a visiting head of state , as opposed to head of government , may speak to the body .
pressure to address palestinian concerns bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some politicians in germany would want to see merkel take a tougher stance against israel ahead of her trip , however , merkel came under pressure in germany to use the visit to israel to criticize the jewish state over its settlement policy .
the head of the german-israeli parliamentary group , the greens politician jerzy montag , said merkel should raise points of difference between prime minister ehud olmert 's government and the palestinians .
" the chancellor should raise critical questions and make it clear that israel should - for both humanitarian reasons and out of long-term self-interest - look for new solutions in the settlement question , the handling of the checkpoints and the general living conditions of the palestinians , " montag said .
social democrat foreign policy spokesman rolf muetzenich seconded this view , while werner hoyer , a foreign policy spokesman for the liberal fdp regretted that merkel was not seeing palestinian president mahmoud abbas during the visit .
merkel ' office said the chancellor had spoken to abbas by phone on friday concerning the status of the current talks initiated by us president george w. bush at annapolis last year .
international conference bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany hopes to play a constructive role in resolving the mideast conflict abbas had asked merkel to raise the issue of israeli plans to restart the building of settlements in east jerusalem , saying that this was hampering the annapolis process .
merkel pledged to report back to the palestinian leader on her return from israel .
the palestinian leader also welcomed a german proposal to hold a conference on the middle east in berlin in june with the aim of boosting efforts to build an effective judicial system and police force in a future palestinian state .
israel , the palestinians and other arab states as well as the united states , russia , the un and european union members will be invited to the gathering .
german government spokesman ulrich wilhelm said that the event would not be a peace conference but a meeting to support the efforts of former british prime minister tony blair in his role as a eu coordinator seeking to build a modern palestinian state . dw staff -lrb- tt -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

merkel for her part said the visit would begin a " new chapter " in relations between the two states , who established full diplomatic ties in 1965 .
the visit by merkel , who is accompanied by a high-powered delegation of cabinet ministers , business leaders and scientists , is to mark the 60th anniversary of the founding of the jewish state , which will be officially celebrated in may .
bildunterschrift : merkel 's visit is believed by many to be of historic importance " on the one hand we should never lose sight of our responsibility for the past - and german policy never will - on the other , we should look to the future of our relations " with israel , merkel said on the eve of her trip .
she said that anyone familiar with the history of the nazi era and the holocaust - in which 6 million jews lost their lives - would know that germany 's stable and friendly relations with israel today were " one of the miracles of history . "
apart from its symbolic value , however , the visit will also mark the start of annual consultations at cabinet level to be held between the two governments .
merkel and her eight accompanying ministers are due to hold a joint meeting with the israeli cabinet on monday morning , in what is seen as a definite indication of the strengthening of the ties between the two countries .
on tuesday , merkel will speak in the knesset , after the chamber modified its regulations which stipulate that only a visiting head of state , as opposed to head of government , may speak to the body .
pressure to address palestinian concerns bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some politicians in germany would want to see merkel take a tougher stance against israel ahead of her trip , however , merkel came under pressure in germany to use the visit to israel to criticize the jewish state over its settlement policy .
the head of the german-israeli parliamentary group , the greens politician jerzy montag , said merkel should raise points of difference between prime minister ehud olmert 's government and the palestinians .
" the chancellor should raise critical questions and make it clear that israel should - for both humanitarian reasons and out of long-term self-interest - look for new solutions in the settlement question , the handling of the checkpoints and the general living conditions of the palestinians , " montag said .
social democrat foreign policy spokesman rolf muetzenich seconded this view , while werner hoyer , a foreign policy spokesman for the liberal fdp regretted that merkel was not seeing palestinian president mahmoud abbas during the visit .
merkel ' office said the chancellor had spoken to abbas by phone on friday concerning the status of the current talks initiated by us president george w. bush at annapolis last year .
international conference bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany hopes to play a constructive role in resolving the mideast conflict abbas had asked merkel to raise the issue of israeli plans to restart the building of settlements in east jerusalem , saying that this was hampering the annapolis process .
merkel pledged to report back to the palestinian leader on her return from israel .
the palestinian leader also welcomed a german proposal to hold a conference on the middle east in berlin in june with the aim of boosting efforts to build an effective judicial system and police force in a future palestinian state .
israel , the palestinians and other arab states as well as the united states , russia , the un and european union members will be invited to the gathering .
german government spokesman ulrich wilhelm said that the event would not be a peace conference but a meeting to support the efforts of former british prime minister tony blair in his role as a eu coordinator seeking to build a modern palestinian state . dw staff -lrb- tt -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" the eu " expresses its deep concern that election procedures in the islamic republic of iran have fallen below the international standards and that the electoral process did not allow for truly competitive elections , " a statement said .
" in this regard it expresses its deep regret and disappointment that over a third of prospective candidates were prevented from standing in this year 's parliamentary elections , " the eu 's slovenian presidency said .
" these exclusions prevented the iranian people from being able to choose freely amongst the full range of political views in their country and represent a clear violation of the international norms . "
" as a result , the election was neither fair nor free . "
bildunterschrift : the eu is concerned about the legitimacy of the elections in iran conservatives lead meanwhile , conservatives lead in the iranian capital 's constituency , whose 30 seats are some of the most politically significant in iran 's parliament , according to initial results made available on sunday .
according state news agency isna , parliament speaker gholam-ali hadad-adel , a close aide of president mahmoud ahmadinejad , leads the tehran list , followed by other conservatives , most of them supporters of the president .
the only reformist candidate who could slip into the top 30 is majid ansari .
other reformists are considerably behind .
iranian interior minister mostafa pur mohammadi said on saturday that the conservative faction had so far gained more than 70 percent of the votes in the provinces in friday 's parliamentary elections .
the lead by the conservatives was expected as they formed the majority of the candidates , after more than half of the reformist candidates were disqualified by the senate-like guardian council for alleged lack of loyalty to the islamic system .

" the conservatives should increase the atmosphere of understanding and national unity , " larijani told journalists at a press conference in qom on saturday . "
the results of the elections should not lead to any arrogance . "
" i predict that the new legislative period will be much more effective than the current one , and give priority to national interests , " the pragmatic conservative official added .

but ocampo does n't particularly like the term " international court " anyway . " we 're a safeguard system .
we 're not some kind of global supreme court , " he said . on march 11 , 2003 , this " security system " began its work .
eighteen judges were named and , several days later , the chief prosecutor was appointed . moreno-ocampo 's job is to investigate each case before it goes to the judges .
he only steps in when a country 's highest court can not or does not want to punish a war crime , a crime against humanity or an act of genocide . individuals , not states , are tried and prosecuted in the international criminal court - though only if they come from a country that has ratified the court 's protocol or committed the crime in a country that has signed it .
so far , that has only happened with cases from congo , uganda and the central african republic .
otherwise , the un security council has to commission an investigation , which was the case in darfur . icc focuses on africa bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : luis moreno-ocampo is from argentina currently , the international criminal court is only working on these four cases .
" i looked for the most difficult cases and it turned out that they were all in africa , " said moreno-ocampo . the court does n't have jurisdiction in the middle east , since the countries there have not ratified its protocol .
neither has the united states .
most of the court 's 105 members are in europe , south america - and africa . the first case that it took on , congo , has already led to the trial of former militia leader thomas lubanga dyilo .
last october , a second congolese war criminal , germain katanga , was extradited to the hague . considering the court 's greatest weakness - namely , that it does n't have its own police but has to rely on help from the country in question or from international peacekeeping forces - this initial case is seen as a considerable success . victims can claim compensation apart from the absence of police , head judge philippe kirsch sees a second challenge : " this court operates under much more difficult conditions than other tribunals , especially because we investigate conflicts that are still going on . " the court has learned from other tribunals that it is crucial to involve the victims themselves , added kirsch . " in earlier tribunals , victims were mainly present as witnesses , but not to demand their own rights , " he said .
" at the international criminal court , they can not only demand their rights but also receive compensation . " another significant difference from other tribunals is the court 's initial chamber , which reviews evidence and separates the important material from the less important .
this allows for greater efficiency in subsequent trials . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : lubanga -lrb- right -rrb- was the first person arrested for trial at the icc it also prevents defendants from reading off long , drawn-out monologues or summoning witnesses that extend the trial by months or even years but do n't contribute anything constructive - like slobodan milosevic did at the international criminal tribunal for the former yugoslavia . opposition from the us despite its achievements , the international criminal court has continually had to defend itself against skeptics .
above all , the us .
president george w. bush has rejected ratifying the court 's protocol because he fears that americans could also be brought to trial . china , russia and india also have n't ratified it .
despite the absence of support from these important countries , kirsch is optimistic . " there has already been a development in countries that had objected to the international criminal court , " he said .
" our work is purely judicial and for this reason there 's more trust in the court than there was before . " the unshaven chief prosecutor also expressed hope that the court 's work would have a positive impact .
" justice is a prerequisite of lasting peace , " moreno-ocampo said .
" i think that justice is our contribution to peace .
the court shows that it can help promote justice in the world . " dw staff -lrb- rri / kjb -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" in earlier tribunals , victims were mainly present as witnesses , but not to demand their own rights , " he said .
" at the international criminal court , they can not only demand their rights but also receive compensation . " another significant difference from other tribunals is the court 's initial chamber , which reviews evidence and separates the important material from the less important .

but ocampo does n't particularly like the term " international court " anyway . " we 're a safeguard system .
we 're not some kind of global supreme court , " he said . on march 11 , 2003 , this " security system " began its work .
eighteen judges were named and , several days later , the chief prosecutor was appointed . moreno-ocampo 's job is to investigate each case before it goes to the judges .
he only steps in when a country 's highest court can not or does not want to punish a war crime , a crime against humanity or an act of genocide . individuals , not states , are tried and prosecuted in the international criminal court - though only if they come from a country that has ratified the court 's protocol or committed the crime in a country that has signed it .

merkel for her part said the visit would begin a " new chapter " in relations between the two states , who established full diplomatic ties in 1965 .
the visit by merkel , who is accompanied by a high-powered delegation of cabinet ministers , business leaders and scientists , is to mark the 60th anniversary of the founding of the jewish state , which will be officially celebrated in may .
bildunterschrift : merkel 's visit is believed by many to be of historic importance " on the one hand we should never lose sight of our responsibility for the past - and german policy never will - on the other , we should look to the future of our relations " with israel , merkel said on the eve of her trip .
she said that anyone familiar with the history of the nazi era and the holocaust - in which 6 million jews lost their lives - would know that germany 's stable and friendly relations with israel today were " one of the miracles of history . "
apart from its symbolic value , however , the visit will also mark the start of annual consultations at cabinet level to be held between the two governments .
merkel and her eight accompanying ministers are due to hold a joint meeting with the israeli cabinet on monday morning , in what is seen as a definite indication of the strengthening of the ties between the two countries .
on tuesday , merkel will speak in the knesset , after the chamber modified its regulations which stipulate that only a visiting head of state , as opposed to head of government , may speak to the body .
pressure to address palestinian concerns bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some politicians in germany would want to see merkel take a tougher stance against israel ahead of her trip , however , merkel came under pressure in germany to use the visit to israel to criticize the jewish state over its settlement policy .
the head of the german-israeli parliamentary group , the greens politician jerzy montag , said merkel should raise points of difference between prime minister ehud olmert 's government and the palestinians .
" the chancellor should raise critical questions and make it clear that israel should - for both humanitarian reasons and out of long-term self-interest - look for new solutions in the settlement question , the handling of the checkpoints and the general living conditions of the palestinians , " montag said .
social democrat foreign policy spokesman rolf muetzenich seconded this view , while werner hoyer , a foreign policy spokesman for the liberal fdp regretted that merkel was not seeing palestinian president mahmoud abbas during the visit .
merkel ' office said the chancellor had spoken to abbas by phone on friday concerning the status of the current talks initiated by us president george w. bush at annapolis last year .
international conference bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany hopes to play a constructive role in resolving the mideast conflict abbas had asked merkel to raise the issue of israeli plans to restart the building of settlements in east jerusalem , saying that this was hampering the annapolis process .
merkel pledged to report back to the palestinian leader on her return from israel .
the palestinian leader also welcomed a german proposal to hold a conference on the middle east in berlin in june with the aim of boosting efforts to build an effective judicial system and police force in a future palestinian state .
israel , the palestinians and other arab states as well as the united states , russia , the un and european union members will be invited to the gathering .

but ocampo does n't particularly like the term " international court " anyway . " we 're a safeguard system .
we 're not some kind of global supreme court , " he said . on march 11 , 2003 , this " security system " began its work .
eighteen judges were named and , several days later , the chief prosecutor was appointed . moreno-ocampo 's job is to investigate each case before it goes to the judges .
he only steps in when a country 's highest court can not or does not want to punish a war crime , a crime against humanity or an act of genocide . individuals , not states , are tried and prosecuted in the international criminal court - though only if they come from a country that has ratified the court 's protocol or committed the crime in a country that has signed it .
so far , that has only happened with cases from congo , uganda and the central african republic .
otherwise , the un security council has to commission an investigation , which was the case in darfur . icc focuses on africa bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : luis moreno-ocampo is from argentina currently , the international criminal court is only working on these four cases .
" i looked for the most difficult cases and it turned out that they were all in africa , " said moreno-ocampo . the court does n't have jurisdiction in the middle east , since the countries there have not ratified its protocol .
neither has the united states .
most of the court 's 105 members are in europe , south america - and africa . the first case that it took on , congo , has already led to the trial of former militia leader thomas lubanga dyilo .
last october , a second congolese war criminal , germain katanga , was extradited to the hague . considering the court 's greatest weakness - namely , that it does n't have its own police but has to rely on help from the country in question or from international peacekeeping forces - this initial case is seen as a considerable success . victims can claim compensation apart from the absence of police , head judge philippe kirsch sees a second challenge : " this court operates under much more difficult conditions than other tribunals , especially because we investigate conflicts that are still going on . " the court has learned from other tribunals that it is crucial to involve the victims themselves , added kirsch . " in earlier tribunals , victims were mainly present as witnesses , but not to demand their own rights , " he said .
" at the international criminal court , they can not only demand their rights but also receive compensation . " another significant difference from other tribunals is the court 's initial chamber , which reviews evidence and separates the important material from the less important .
this allows for greater efficiency in subsequent trials . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : lubanga -lrb- right -rrb- was the first person arrested for trial at the icc it also prevents defendants from reading off long , drawn-out monologues or summoning witnesses that extend the trial by months or even years but do n't contribute anything constructive - like slobodan milosevic did at the international criminal tribunal for the former yugoslavia . opposition from the us despite its achievements , the international criminal court has continually had to defend itself against skeptics .
above all , the us .
president george w. bush has rejected ratifying the court 's protocol because he fears that americans could also be brought to trial . china , russia and india also have n't ratified it .
despite the absence of support from these important countries , kirsch is optimistic . " there has already been a development in countries that had objected to the international criminal court , " he said .
" our work is purely judicial and for this reason there 's more trust in the court than there was before . " the unshaven chief prosecutor also expressed hope that the court 's work would have a positive impact .
" justice is a prerequisite of lasting peace , " moreno-ocampo said .
" i think that justice is our contribution to peace .
the court shows that it can help promote justice in the world . " dw staff -lrb- rri / kjb -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

merkel for her part said the visit would begin a " new chapter " in relations between the two states , who established full diplomatic ties in 1965 .
the visit by merkel , who is accompanied by a high-powered delegation of cabinet ministers , business leaders and scientists , is to mark the 60th anniversary of the founding of the jewish state , which will be officially celebrated in may .
bildunterschrift : merkel 's visit is believed by many to be of historic importance " on the one hand we should never lose sight of our responsibility for the past - and german policy never will - on the other , we should look to the future of our relations " with israel , merkel said on the eve of her trip .
she said that anyone familiar with the history of the nazi era and the holocaust - in which 6 million jews lost their lives - would know that germany 's stable and friendly relations with israel today were " one of the miracles of history . "
apart from its symbolic value , however , the visit will also mark the start of annual consultations at cabinet level to be held between the two governments .
merkel and her eight accompanying ministers are due to hold a joint meeting with the israeli cabinet on monday morning , in what is seen as a definite indication of the strengthening of the ties between the two countries .
on tuesday , merkel will speak in the knesset , after the chamber modified its regulations which stipulate that only a visiting head of state , as opposed to head of government , may speak to the body .
pressure to address palestinian concerns bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some politicians in germany would want to see merkel take a tougher stance against israel ahead of her trip , however , merkel came under pressure in germany to use the visit to israel to criticize the jewish state over its settlement policy .
the head of the german-israeli parliamentary group , the greens politician jerzy montag , said merkel should raise points of difference between prime minister ehud olmert 's government and the palestinians .
" the chancellor should raise critical questions and make it clear that israel should - for both humanitarian reasons and out of long-term self-interest - look for new solutions in the settlement question , the handling of the checkpoints and the general living conditions of the palestinians , " montag said .
social democrat foreign policy spokesman rolf muetzenich seconded this view , while werner hoyer , a foreign policy spokesman for the liberal fdp regretted that merkel was not seeing palestinian president mahmoud abbas during the visit .
merkel ' office said the chancellor had spoken to abbas by phone on friday concerning the status of the current talks initiated by us president george w. bush at annapolis last year .
international conference bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany hopes to play a constructive role in resolving the mideast conflict abbas had asked merkel to raise the issue of israeli plans to restart the building of settlements in east jerusalem , saying that this was hampering the annapolis process .
merkel pledged to report back to the palestinian leader on her return from israel .
the palestinian leader also welcomed a german proposal to hold a conference on the middle east in berlin in june with the aim of boosting efforts to build an effective judicial system and police force in a future palestinian state .
israel , the palestinians and other arab states as well as the united states , russia , the un and european union members will be invited to the gathering .

they 'll be joining the growing ranks of health care workers from former communist countries . country doctors are few and far between in germany .
general practitioners in the countryside earn around 20 percent less than their colleagues in the cities .
in the eastern states in particular , many working doctors either go abroad or to large urban hospitals and specialized practices , where there are more private patients and therefore more money to be earned .
the result is an ever-worsening doctor shortage outside the cities , which health ministry officials in the state of brandenburg now hope to reverse with a unique project - allowing doctors from eastern europe to pick up the slack .
the initiative , unveiled this week , is a win-win idea .
it foresees countering the doctor shortfall in brandenburg by allocating out-of-work doctors from former communist countries to country practices - not only helping integrate germany 's minorities into the working world but also helping solve what has become an acute problem within the health services .
the eastern european element bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : many old people are reluctant to get into homes in fact , eastern europeans have long been a presence within germany 's health services .
as germany struggles to cope with an ageing population , carers from eastern europe are stepping in to help the country meet a growing need for trained workers .
many of them work illegally , but growing numbers of internet agencies now provide the services of hired help from countries such as poland , romania , hungary and bulgaria .
nonetheless , many of them operate in a legal gray area given germany 's restrictions of free movement of labor within the eu .
one way the carers can circumvent these regulations is by registering in their home countries as freelancers , which allows them to spend up to six months working in germany .
agencies tend to send them to various eu countries for limited periods and then rotate them across the continent .
other agencies are entirely above board , offering east european professionals a chance to sign contracts with companies in their home countries which work with partner agencies in germany .
they get sent not only to private homes but also to understaffed hospitals and clinics .
dumping prices ?
but critics say that the eastern europeans are providing cheap labor and undercutting their german counterparts .
coming from poorer countries , they are usually willing to work for considerably less than their german counterparts and often prove more flexible to families looking after aged relations at home .
given that the agencies are also taking a cut , how profitable is it for the nurses themselves ?
" few of them last longer than six months , " said michaela niclaus from the agency " help4seniors . " 29-year-old marta from krakow did n't even stay that long .
she was sent to the small town of treis-karden in rhineland-palatinate to look after johannes wessler 's 87-year-old mother .
" my mother ca n't be on her own in the house , " wessler said .
" she ca n't get around by herself and she does n't want to go into a home . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany is struggling to look after its ageing population his problems were answered when he found marta on an agency web site .
he is n't the only one in his neighborhood to take advantage of affordable 24-hour care by trained eastern european care workers .
these days , the area - which is popular with pensioners - is home to growing numbers of poles , romanians and bulgarians all looking after the elderly local population .
but marta was allowed just two hours off a day , six days a week - and packed her bags after less than six months .
by 2011 at the latest , the government in berlin will be able to lift restrictions of free movement of workers within the eu .
until then , marta can be easily replaced . dw staff -lrb- jp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

they 'll be joining the growing ranks of health care workers from former communist countries . country doctors are few and far between in germany .
general practitioners in the countryside earn around 20 percent less than their colleagues in the cities .
in the eastern states in particular , many working doctors either go abroad or to large urban hospitals and specialized practices , where there are more private patients and therefore more money to be earned .
the result is an ever-worsening doctor shortage outside the cities , which health ministry officials in the state of brandenburg now hope to reverse with a unique project - allowing doctors from eastern europe to pick up the slack .
the initiative , unveiled this week , is a win-win idea .
it foresees countering the doctor shortfall in brandenburg by allocating out-of-work doctors from former communist countries to country practices - not only helping integrate germany 's minorities into the working world but also helping solve what has become an acute problem within the health services .
the eastern european element bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : many old people are reluctant to get into homes in fact , eastern europeans have long been a presence within germany 's health services .
as germany struggles to cope with an ageing population , carers from eastern europe are stepping in to help the country meet a growing need for trained workers .
many of them work illegally , but growing numbers of internet agencies now provide the services of hired help from countries such as poland , romania , hungary and bulgaria .
nonetheless , many of them operate in a legal gray area given germany 's restrictions of free movement of labor within the eu .
one way the carers can circumvent these regulations is by registering in their home countries as freelancers , which allows them to spend up to six months working in germany .
agencies tend to send them to various eu countries for limited periods and then rotate them across the continent .
other agencies are entirely above board , offering east european professionals a chance to sign contracts with companies in their home countries which work with partner agencies in germany .
they get sent not only to private homes but also to understaffed hospitals and clinics .
dumping prices ?
but critics say that the eastern europeans are providing cheap labor and undercutting their german counterparts .
coming from poorer countries , they are usually willing to work for considerably less than their german counterparts and often prove more flexible to families looking after aged relations at home .
given that the agencies are also taking a cut , how profitable is it for the nurses themselves ?
" few of them last longer than six months , " said michaela niclaus from the agency " help4seniors . " 29-year-old marta from krakow did n't even stay that long .
she was sent to the small town of treis-karden in rhineland-palatinate to look after johannes wessler 's 87-year-old mother .

these days , the area - which is popular with pensioners - is home to growing numbers of poles , romanians and bulgarians all looking after the elderly local population .
but marta was allowed just two hours off a day , six days a week - and packed her bags after less than six months .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de health -pipe- 16.03.2008 eastern europeans pick up health care slack in germany großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : many eastern european doctors in germany have spent years unemployed a new initiative in brandenburg is aiming to remedy germany 's acute doctor shortage with professionals from eastern europe .
they 'll be joining the growing ranks of health care workers from former communist countries . country doctors are few and far between in germany .
general practitioners in the countryside earn around 20 percent less than their colleagues in the cities .
in the eastern states in particular , many working doctors either go abroad or to large urban hospitals and specialized practices , where there are more private patients and therefore more money to be earned .
the result is an ever-worsening doctor shortage outside the cities , which health ministry officials in the state of brandenburg now hope to reverse with a unique project - allowing doctors from eastern europe to pick up the slack .
the initiative , unveiled this week , is a win-win idea .
it foresees countering the doctor shortfall in brandenburg by allocating out-of-work doctors from former communist countries to country practices - not only helping integrate germany 's minorities into the working world but also helping solve what has become an acute problem within the health services .
the eastern european element bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : many old people are reluctant to get into homes in fact , eastern europeans have long been a presence within germany 's health services .
as germany struggles to cope with an ageing population , carers from eastern europe are stepping in to help the country meet a growing need for trained workers .
many of them work illegally , but growing numbers of internet agencies now provide the services of hired help from countries such as poland , romania , hungary and bulgaria .
nonetheless , many of them operate in a legal gray area given germany 's restrictions of free movement of labor within the eu .
one way the carers can circumvent these regulations is by registering in their home countries as freelancers , which allows them to spend up to six months working in germany .
agencies tend to send them to various eu countries for limited periods and then rotate them across the continent .
other agencies are entirely above board , offering east european professionals a chance to sign contracts with companies in their home countries which work with partner agencies in germany .
they get sent not only to private homes but also to understaffed hospitals and clinics .
dumping prices ?
but critics say that the eastern europeans are providing cheap labor and undercutting their german counterparts .
coming from poorer countries , they are usually willing to work for considerably less than their german counterparts and often prove more flexible to families looking after aged relations at home .
given that the agencies are also taking a cut , how profitable is it for the nurses themselves ?
" few of them last longer than six months , " said michaela niclaus from the agency " help4seniors . " 29-year-old marta from krakow did n't even stay that long .
she was sent to the small town of treis-karden in rhineland-palatinate to look after johannes wessler 's 87-year-old mother .
" my mother ca n't be on her own in the house , " wessler said .
" she ca n't get around by herself and she does n't want to go into a home . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany is struggling to look after its ageing population his problems were answered when he found marta on an agency web site .
he is n't the only one in his neighborhood to take advantage of affordable 24-hour care by trained eastern european care workers .
these days , the area - which is popular with pensioners - is home to growing numbers of poles , romanians and bulgarians all looking after the elderly local population .
but marta was allowed just two hours off a day , six days a week - and packed her bags after less than six months .
by 2011 at the latest , the government in berlin will be able to lift restrictions of free movement of workers within the eu .
until then , marta can be easily replaced . dw staff -lrb- jp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

they 'll be joining the growing ranks of health care workers from former communist countries . country doctors are few and far between in germany .
general practitioners in the countryside earn around 20 percent less than their colleagues in the cities .
in the eastern states in particular , many working doctors either go abroad or to large urban hospitals and specialized practices , where there are more private patients and therefore more money to be earned .
the result is an ever-worsening doctor shortage outside the cities , which health ministry officials in the state of brandenburg now hope to reverse with a unique project - allowing doctors from eastern europe to pick up the slack .
the initiative , unveiled this week , is a win-win idea .
it foresees countering the doctor shortfall in brandenburg by allocating out-of-work doctors from former communist countries to country practices - not only helping integrate germany 's minorities into the working world but also helping solve what has become an acute problem within the health services .
the eastern european element bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : many old people are reluctant to get into homes in fact , eastern europeans have long been a presence within germany 's health services .
as germany struggles to cope with an ageing population , carers from eastern europe are stepping in to help the country meet a growing need for trained workers .
many of them work illegally , but growing numbers of internet agencies now provide the services of hired help from countries such as poland , romania , hungary and bulgaria .
nonetheless , many of them operate in a legal gray area given germany 's restrictions of free movement of labor within the eu .
one way the carers can circumvent these regulations is by registering in their home countries as freelancers , which allows them to spend up to six months working in germany .
agencies tend to send them to various eu countries for limited periods and then rotate them across the continent .
other agencies are entirely above board , offering east european professionals a chance to sign contracts with companies in their home countries which work with partner agencies in germany .
they get sent not only to private homes but also to understaffed hospitals and clinics .
dumping prices ?
but critics say that the eastern europeans are providing cheap labor and undercutting their german counterparts .
coming from poorer countries , they are usually willing to work for considerably less than their german counterparts and often prove more flexible to families looking after aged relations at home .
given that the agencies are also taking a cut , how profitable is it for the nurses themselves ?
" few of them last longer than six months , " said michaela niclaus from the agency " help4seniors . " 29-year-old marta from krakow did n't even stay that long .
she was sent to the small town of treis-karden in rhineland-palatinate to look after johannes wessler 's 87-year-old mother .
" my mother ca n't be on her own in the house , " wessler said .
" she ca n't get around by herself and she does n't want to go into a home . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany is struggling to look after its ageing population his problems were answered when he found marta on an agency web site .
he is n't the only one in his neighborhood to take advantage of affordable 24-hour care by trained eastern european care workers .
these days , the area - which is popular with pensioners - is home to growing numbers of poles , romanians and bulgarians all looking after the elderly local population .
but marta was allowed just two hours off a day , six days a week - and packed her bags after less than six months .
by 2011 at the latest , the government in berlin will be able to lift restrictions of free movement of workers within the eu .
until then , marta can be easily replaced . dw staff -lrb- jp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" the eu " expresses its deep concern that election procedures in the islamic republic of iran have fallen below the international standards and that the electoral process did not allow for truly competitive elections , " a statement said .
" in this regard it expresses its deep regret and disappointment that over a third of prospective candidates were prevented from standing in this year 's parliamentary elections , " the eu 's slovenian presidency said .
" these exclusions prevented the iranian people from being able to choose freely amongst the full range of political views in their country and represent a clear violation of the international norms . "
" as a result , the election was neither fair nor free . "
bildunterschrift : the eu is concerned about the legitimacy of the elections in iran conservatives lead meanwhile , conservatives lead in the iranian capital 's constituency , whose 30 seats are some of the most politically significant in iran 's parliament , according to initial results made available on sunday .
according state news agency isna , parliament speaker gholam-ali hadad-adel , a close aide of president mahmoud ahmadinejad , leads the tehran list , followed by other conservatives , most of them supporters of the president .
the only reformist candidate who could slip into the top 30 is majid ansari .
other reformists are considerably behind .
iranian interior minister mostafa pur mohammadi said on saturday that the conservative faction had so far gained more than 70 percent of the votes in the provinces in friday 's parliamentary elections .
the lead by the conservatives was expected as they formed the majority of the candidates , after more than half of the reformist candidates were disqualified by the senate-like guardian council for alleged lack of loyalty to the islamic system .
call for reforms bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ali larijani broke ranks with president ahmadinejad most prominent ahmadinejad opponent already elected to parliament is ali larijani , who gained a big win in the religious city of qom , 130 kilometres -lrb- 80 miles -rrb- south of tehran .
he represents the so-called " revisionists , " a group that used to back the president but gradually grew apart from him and formed their own faction .
" the conservatives should increase the atmosphere of understanding and national unity , " larijani told journalists at a press conference in qom on saturday . "
the results of the elections should not lead to any arrogance . "
" i predict that the new legislative period will be much more effective than the current one , and give priority to national interests , " the pragmatic conservative official added .
larijani resigned last october as chief nuclear negotiator after grave differences with ahmadinejad over the country 's nuclear policies and has since then been regarded as a critic of the president , especially over economic policies which have caused high inflation . dw staff -lrb- tt -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

merkel for her part said the visit would begin a " new chapter " in relations between the two states , who established full diplomatic ties in 1965 .
the visit by merkel , who is accompanied by a high-powered delegation of cabinet ministers , business leaders and scientists , is to mark the 60th anniversary of the founding of the jewish state , which will be officially celebrated in may .
bildunterschrift : merkel 's visit is believed by many to be of historic importance " on the one hand we should never lose sight of our responsibility for the past - and german policy never will - on the other , we should look to the future of our relations " with israel , merkel said on the eve of her trip .
she said that anyone familiar with the history of the nazi era and the holocaust - in which 6 million jews lost their lives - would know that germany 's stable and friendly relations with israel today were " one of the miracles of history . "
apart from its symbolic value , however , the visit will also mark the start of annual consultations at cabinet level to be held between the two governments .
merkel and her eight accompanying ministers are due to hold a joint meeting with the israeli cabinet on monday morning , in what is seen as a definite indication of the strengthening of the ties between the two countries .
on tuesday , merkel will speak in the knesset , after the chamber modified its regulations which stipulate that only a visiting head of state , as opposed to head of government , may speak to the body .

the head of the german-israeli parliamentary group , the greens politician jerzy montag , said merkel should raise points of difference between prime minister ehud olmert 's government and the palestinians .
" the chancellor should raise critical questions and make it clear that israel should - for both humanitarian reasons and out of long-term self-interest - look for new solutions in the settlement question , the handling of the checkpoints and the general living conditions of the palestinians , " montag said .
social democrat foreign policy spokesman rolf muetzenich seconded this view , while werner hoyer , a foreign policy spokesman for the liberal fdp regretted that merkel was not seeing palestinian president mahmoud abbas during the visit .
merkel ' office said the chancellor had spoken to abbas by phone on friday concerning the status of the current talks initiated by us president george w. bush at annapolis last year .
international conference bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany hopes to play a constructive role in resolving the mideast conflict abbas had asked merkel to raise the issue of israeli plans to restart the building of settlements in east jerusalem , saying that this was hampering the annapolis process .
merkel pledged to report back to the palestinian leader on her return from israel .
the palestinian leader also welcomed a german proposal to hold a conference on the middle east in berlin in june with the aim of boosting efforts to build an effective judicial system and police force in a future palestinian state .
israel , the palestinians and other arab states as well as the united states , russia , the un and european union members will be invited to the gathering .

merkel for her part said the visit would begin a " new chapter " in relations between the two states , who established full diplomatic ties in 1965 .
the visit by merkel , who is accompanied by a high-powered delegation of cabinet ministers , business leaders and scientists , is to mark the 60th anniversary of the founding of the jewish state , which will be officially celebrated in may .
bildunterschrift : merkel 's visit is believed by many to be of historic importance " on the one hand we should never lose sight of our responsibility for the past - and german policy never will - on the other , we should look to the future of our relations " with israel , merkel said on the eve of her trip .
she said that anyone familiar with the history of the nazi era and the holocaust - in which 6 million jews lost their lives - would know that germany 's stable and friendly relations with israel today were " one of the miracles of history . "
apart from its symbolic value , however , the visit will also mark the start of annual consultations at cabinet level to be held between the two governments .
merkel and her eight accompanying ministers are due to hold a joint meeting with the israeli cabinet on monday morning , in what is seen as a definite indication of the strengthening of the ties between the two countries .
on tuesday , merkel will speak in the knesset , after the chamber modified its regulations which stipulate that only a visiting head of state , as opposed to head of government , may speak to the body .
pressure to address palestinian concerns bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some politicians in germany would want to see merkel take a tougher stance against israel ahead of her trip , however , merkel came under pressure in germany to use the visit to israel to criticize the jewish state over its settlement policy .
the head of the german-israeli parliamentary group , the greens politician jerzy montag , said merkel should raise points of difference between prime minister ehud olmert 's government and the palestinians .
" the chancellor should raise critical questions and make it clear that israel should - for both humanitarian reasons and out of long-term self-interest - look for new solutions in the settlement question , the handling of the checkpoints and the general living conditions of the palestinians , " montag said .

according state news agency isna , parliament speaker gholam-ali hadad-adel , a close aide of president mahmoud ahmadinejad , leads the tehran list , followed by other conservatives , most of them supporters of the president .
the only reformist candidate who could slip into the top 30 is majid ansari .
other reformists are considerably behind .
iranian interior minister mostafa pur mohammadi said on saturday that the conservative faction had so far gained more than 70 percent of the votes in the provinces in friday 's parliamentary elections .
the lead by the conservatives was expected as they formed the majority of the candidates , after more than half of the reformist candidates were disqualified by the senate-like guardian council for alleged lack of loyalty to the islamic system .

" the eu " expresses its deep concern that election procedures in the islamic republic of iran have fallen below the international standards and that the electoral process did not allow for truly competitive elections , " a statement said .
" in this regard it expresses its deep regret and disappointment that over a third of prospective candidates were prevented from standing in this year 's parliamentary elections , " the eu 's slovenian presidency said .
" these exclusions prevented the iranian people from being able to choose freely amongst the full range of political views in their country and represent a clear violation of the international norms . "

they 'll be joining the growing ranks of health care workers from former communist countries . country doctors are few and far between in germany .
general practitioners in the countryside earn around 20 percent less than their colleagues in the cities .
in the eastern states in particular , many working doctors either go abroad or to large urban hospitals and specialized practices , where there are more private patients and therefore more money to be earned .
the result is an ever-worsening doctor shortage outside the cities , which health ministry officials in the state of brandenburg now hope to reverse with a unique project - allowing doctors from eastern europe to pick up the slack .
the initiative , unveiled this week , is a win-win idea .
it foresees countering the doctor shortfall in brandenburg by allocating out-of-work doctors from former communist countries to country practices - not only helping integrate germany 's minorities into the working world but also helping solve what has become an acute problem within the health services .
the eastern european element bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : many old people are reluctant to get into homes in fact , eastern europeans have long been a presence within germany 's health services .
as germany struggles to cope with an ageing population , carers from eastern europe are stepping in to help the country meet a growing need for trained workers .
many of them work illegally , but growing numbers of internet agencies now provide the services of hired help from countries such as poland , romania , hungary and bulgaria .
nonetheless , many of them operate in a legal gray area given germany 's restrictions of free movement of labor within the eu .
one way the carers can circumvent these regulations is by registering in their home countries as freelancers , which allows them to spend up to six months working in germany .
agencies tend to send them to various eu countries for limited periods and then rotate them across the continent .
other agencies are entirely above board , offering east european professionals a chance to sign contracts with companies in their home countries which work with partner agencies in germany .
they get sent not only to private homes but also to understaffed hospitals and clinics .
dumping prices ?
but critics say that the eastern europeans are providing cheap labor and undercutting their german counterparts .
coming from poorer countries , they are usually willing to work for considerably less than their german counterparts and often prove more flexible to families looking after aged relations at home .
given that the agencies are also taking a cut , how profitable is it for the nurses themselves ?
" few of them last longer than six months , " said michaela niclaus from the agency " help4seniors . " 29-year-old marta from krakow did n't even stay that long .
she was sent to the small town of treis-karden in rhineland-palatinate to look after johannes wessler 's 87-year-old mother .
" my mother ca n't be on her own in the house , " wessler said .
" she ca n't get around by herself and she does n't want to go into a home . "

these days , the area - which is popular with pensioners - is home to growing numbers of poles , romanians and bulgarians all looking after the elderly local population .
but marta was allowed just two hours off a day , six days a week - and packed her bags after less than six months .

merkel for her part said the visit would begin a " new chapter " in relations between the two states , who established full diplomatic ties in 1965 .
the visit by merkel , who is accompanied by a high-powered delegation of cabinet ministers , business leaders and scientists , is to mark the 60th anniversary of the founding of the jewish state , which will be officially celebrated in may .
bildunterschrift : merkel 's visit is believed by many to be of historic importance " on the one hand we should never lose sight of our responsibility for the past - and german policy never will - on the other , we should look to the future of our relations " with israel , merkel said on the eve of her trip .
she said that anyone familiar with the history of the nazi era and the holocaust - in which 6 million jews lost their lives - would know that germany 's stable and friendly relations with israel today were " one of the miracles of history . "
apart from its symbolic value , however , the visit will also mark the start of annual consultations at cabinet level to be held between the two governments .
merkel and her eight accompanying ministers are due to hold a joint meeting with the israeli cabinet on monday morning , in what is seen as a definite indication of the strengthening of the ties between the two countries .
on tuesday , merkel will speak in the knesset , after the chamber modified its regulations which stipulate that only a visiting head of state , as opposed to head of government , may speak to the body .
pressure to address palestinian concerns bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some politicians in germany would want to see merkel take a tougher stance against israel ahead of her trip , however , merkel came under pressure in germany to use the visit to israel to criticize the jewish state over its settlement policy .
the head of the german-israeli parliamentary group , the greens politician jerzy montag , said merkel should raise points of difference between prime minister ehud olmert 's government and the palestinians .
" the chancellor should raise critical questions and make it clear that israel should - for both humanitarian reasons and out of long-term self-interest - look for new solutions in the settlement question , the handling of the checkpoints and the general living conditions of the palestinians , " montag said .
social democrat foreign policy spokesman rolf muetzenich seconded this view , while werner hoyer , a foreign policy spokesman for the liberal fdp regretted that merkel was not seeing palestinian president mahmoud abbas during the visit .
merkel ' office said the chancellor had spoken to abbas by phone on friday concerning the status of the current talks initiated by us president george w. bush at annapolis last year .
international conference bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany hopes to play a constructive role in resolving the mideast conflict abbas had asked merkel to raise the issue of israeli plans to restart the building of settlements in east jerusalem , saying that this was hampering the annapolis process .
merkel pledged to report back to the palestinian leader on her return from israel .
the palestinian leader also welcomed a german proposal to hold a conference on the middle east in berlin in june with the aim of boosting efforts to build an effective judicial system and police force in a future palestinian state .
israel , the palestinians and other arab states as well as the united states , russia , the un and european union members will be invited to the gathering .
german government spokesman ulrich wilhelm said that the event would not be a peace conference but a meeting to support the efforts of former british prime minister tony blair in his role as a eu coordinator seeking to build a modern palestinian state . dw staff -lrb- tt -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

but ocampo does n't particularly like the term " international court " anyway . " we 're a safeguard system .
we 're not some kind of global supreme court , " he said . on march 11 , 2003 , this " security system " began its work .
eighteen judges were named and , several days later , the chief prosecutor was appointed . moreno-ocampo 's job is to investigate each case before it goes to the judges .
he only steps in when a country 's highest court can not or does not want to punish a war crime , a crime against humanity or an act of genocide . individuals , not states , are tried and prosecuted in the international criminal court - though only if they come from a country that has ratified the court 's protocol or committed the crime in a country that has signed it .
so far , that has only happened with cases from congo , uganda and the central african republic .
otherwise , the un security council has to commission an investigation , which was the case in darfur . icc focuses on africa bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : luis moreno-ocampo is from argentina currently , the international criminal court is only working on these four cases .
" i looked for the most difficult cases and it turned out that they were all in africa , " said moreno-ocampo . the court does n't have jurisdiction in the middle east , since the countries there have not ratified its protocol .
neither has the united states .
most of the court 's 105 members are in europe , south america - and africa . the first case that it took on , congo , has already led to the trial of former militia leader thomas lubanga dyilo .
last october , a second congolese war criminal , germain katanga , was extradited to the hague . considering the court 's greatest weakness - namely , that it does n't have its own police but has to rely on help from the country in question or from international peacekeeping forces - this initial case is seen as a considerable success . victims can claim compensation apart from the absence of police , head judge philippe kirsch sees a second challenge : " this court operates under much more difficult conditions than other tribunals , especially because we investigate conflicts that are still going on . " the court has learned from other tribunals that it is crucial to involve the victims themselves , added kirsch . " in earlier tribunals , victims were mainly present as witnesses , but not to demand their own rights , " he said .
" at the international criminal court , they can not only demand their rights but also receive compensation . " another significant difference from other tribunals is the court 's initial chamber , which reviews evidence and separates the important material from the less important .
this allows for greater efficiency in subsequent trials . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : lubanga -lrb- right -rrb- was the first person arrested for trial at the icc it also prevents defendants from reading off long , drawn-out monologues or summoning witnesses that extend the trial by months or even years but do n't contribute anything constructive - like slobodan milosevic did at the international criminal tribunal for the former yugoslavia . opposition from the us despite its achievements , the international criminal court has continually had to defend itself against skeptics .
above all , the us .
president george w. bush has rejected ratifying the court 's protocol because he fears that americans could also be brought to trial . china , russia and india also have n't ratified it .
despite the absence of support from these important countries , kirsch is optimistic . " there has already been a development in countries that had objected to the international criminal court , " he said .
" our work is purely judicial and for this reason there 's more trust in the court than there was before . " the unshaven chief prosecutor also expressed hope that the court 's work would have a positive impact .
" justice is a prerequisite of lasting peace , " moreno-ocampo said .
" i think that justice is our contribution to peace .
the court shows that it can help promote justice in the world . " dw staff -lrb- rri / kjb -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" the eu " expresses its deep concern that election procedures in the islamic republic of iran have fallen below the international standards and that the electoral process did not allow for truly competitive elections , " a statement said .
" in this regard it expresses its deep regret and disappointment that over a third of prospective candidates were prevented from standing in this year 's parliamentary elections , " the eu 's slovenian presidency said .
" these exclusions prevented the iranian people from being able to choose freely amongst the full range of political views in their country and represent a clear violation of the international norms . "
" as a result , the election was neither fair nor free . "
bildunterschrift : the eu is concerned about the legitimacy of the elections in iran conservatives lead meanwhile , conservatives lead in the iranian capital 's constituency , whose 30 seats are some of the most politically significant in iran 's parliament , according to initial results made available on sunday .
according state news agency isna , parliament speaker gholam-ali hadad-adel , a close aide of president mahmoud ahmadinejad , leads the tehran list , followed by other conservatives , most of them supporters of the president .
the only reformist candidate who could slip into the top 30 is majid ansari .
other reformists are considerably behind .
iranian interior minister mostafa pur mohammadi said on saturday that the conservative faction had so far gained more than 70 percent of the votes in the provinces in friday 's parliamentary elections .
the lead by the conservatives was expected as they formed the majority of the candidates , after more than half of the reformist candidates were disqualified by the senate-like guardian council for alleged lack of loyalty to the islamic system .
call for reforms bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ali larijani broke ranks with president ahmadinejad most prominent ahmadinejad opponent already elected to parliament is ali larijani , who gained a big win in the religious city of qom , 130 kilometres -lrb- 80 miles -rrb- south of tehran .
he represents the so-called " revisionists , " a group that used to back the president but gradually grew apart from him and formed their own faction .
" the conservatives should increase the atmosphere of understanding and national unity , " larijani told journalists at a press conference in qom on saturday . "
the results of the elections should not lead to any arrogance . "
" i predict that the new legislative period will be much more effective than the current one , and give priority to national interests , " the pragmatic conservative official added .
larijani resigned last october as chief nuclear negotiator after grave differences with ahmadinejad over the country 's nuclear policies and has since then been regarded as a critic of the president , especially over economic policies which have caused high inflation . dw staff -lrb- tt -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

merkel for her part said the visit would begin a " new chapter " in relations between the two states , who established full diplomatic ties in 1965 .
the visit by merkel , who is accompanied by a high-powered delegation of cabinet ministers , business leaders and scientists , is to mark the 60th anniversary of the founding of the jewish state , which will be officially celebrated in may .
bildunterschrift : merkel 's visit is believed by many to be of historic importance " on the one hand we should never lose sight of our responsibility for the past - and german policy never will - on the other , we should look to the future of our relations " with israel , merkel said on the eve of her trip .
she said that anyone familiar with the history of the nazi era and the holocaust - in which 6 million jews lost their lives - would know that germany 's stable and friendly relations with israel today were " one of the miracles of history . "
apart from its symbolic value , however , the visit will also mark the start of annual consultations at cabinet level to be held between the two governments .
merkel and her eight accompanying ministers are due to hold a joint meeting with the israeli cabinet on monday morning , in what is seen as a definite indication of the strengthening of the ties between the two countries .
on tuesday , merkel will speak in the knesset , after the chamber modified its regulations which stipulate that only a visiting head of state , as opposed to head of government , may speak to the body .
pressure to address palestinian concerns bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some politicians in germany would want to see merkel take a tougher stance against israel ahead of her trip , however , merkel came under pressure in germany to use the visit to israel to criticize the jewish state over its settlement policy .
the head of the german-israeli parliamentary group , the greens politician jerzy montag , said merkel should raise points of difference between prime minister ehud olmert 's government and the palestinians .
" the chancellor should raise critical questions and make it clear that israel should - for both humanitarian reasons and out of long-term self-interest - look for new solutions in the settlement question , the handling of the checkpoints and the general living conditions of the palestinians , " montag said .
social democrat foreign policy spokesman rolf muetzenich seconded this view , while werner hoyer , a foreign policy spokesman for the liberal fdp regretted that merkel was not seeing palestinian president mahmoud abbas during the visit .
merkel ' office said the chancellor had spoken to abbas by phone on friday concerning the status of the current talks initiated by us president george w. bush at annapolis last year .

merkel pledged to report back to the palestinian leader on her return from israel .
the palestinian leader also welcomed a german proposal to hold a conference on the middle east in berlin in june with the aim of boosting efforts to build an effective judicial system and police force in a future palestinian state .
israel , the palestinians and other arab states as well as the united states , russia , the un and european union members will be invited to the gathering .
german government spokesman ulrich wilhelm said that the event would not be a peace conference but a meeting to support the efforts of former british prime minister tony blair in his role as a eu coordinator seeking to build a modern palestinian state . dw staff -lrb- tt -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

but ocampo does n't particularly like the term " international court " anyway . " we 're a safeguard system .
we 're not some kind of global supreme court , " he said . on march 11 , 2003 , this " security system " began its work .
eighteen judges were named and , several days later , the chief prosecutor was appointed . moreno-ocampo 's job is to investigate each case before it goes to the judges .
he only steps in when a country 's highest court can not or does not want to punish a war crime , a crime against humanity or an act of genocide . individuals , not states , are tried and prosecuted in the international criminal court - though only if they come from a country that has ratified the court 's protocol or committed the crime in a country that has signed it .
so far , that has only happened with cases from congo , uganda and the central african republic .
otherwise , the un security council has to commission an investigation , which was the case in darfur . icc focuses on africa bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : luis moreno-ocampo is from argentina currently , the international criminal court is only working on these four cases .
" i looked for the most difficult cases and it turned out that they were all in africa , " said moreno-ocampo . the court does n't have jurisdiction in the middle east , since the countries there have not ratified its protocol .
neither has the united states .
most of the court 's 105 members are in europe , south america - and africa . the first case that it took on , congo , has already led to the trial of former militia leader thomas lubanga dyilo .
last october , a second congolese war criminal , germain katanga , was extradited to the hague . considering the court 's greatest weakness - namely , that it does n't have its own police but has to rely on help from the country in question or from international peacekeeping forces - this initial case is seen as a considerable success . victims can claim compensation apart from the absence of police , head judge philippe kirsch sees a second challenge : " this court operates under much more difficult conditions than other tribunals , especially because we investigate conflicts that are still going on . " the court has learned from other tribunals that it is crucial to involve the victims themselves , added kirsch . " in earlier tribunals , victims were mainly present as witnesses , but not to demand their own rights , " he said .
" at the international criminal court , they can not only demand their rights but also receive compensation . " another significant difference from other tribunals is the court 's initial chamber , which reviews evidence and separates the important material from the less important .
this allows for greater efficiency in subsequent trials . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : lubanga -lrb- right -rrb- was the first person arrested for trial at the icc it also prevents defendants from reading off long , drawn-out monologues or summoning witnesses that extend the trial by months or even years but do n't contribute anything constructive - like slobodan milosevic did at the international criminal tribunal for the former yugoslavia . opposition from the us despite its achievements , the international criminal court has continually had to defend itself against skeptics .
above all , the us .
president george w. bush has rejected ratifying the court 's protocol because he fears that americans could also be brought to trial . china , russia and india also have n't ratified it .
despite the absence of support from these important countries , kirsch is optimistic . " there has already been a development in countries that had objected to the international criminal court , " he said .
" our work is purely judicial and for this reason there 's more trust in the court than there was before . " the unshaven chief prosecutor also expressed hope that the court 's work would have a positive impact .
" justice is a prerequisite of lasting peace , " moreno-ocampo said .
" i think that justice is our contribution to peace .
the court shows that it can help promote justice in the world . " dw staff -lrb- rri / kjb -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" the eu " expresses its deep concern that election procedures in the islamic republic of iran have fallen below the international standards and that the electoral process did not allow for truly competitive elections , " a statement said .
" in this regard it expresses its deep regret and disappointment that over a third of prospective candidates were prevented from standing in this year 's parliamentary elections , " the eu 's slovenian presidency said .
" these exclusions prevented the iranian people from being able to choose freely amongst the full range of political views in their country and represent a clear violation of the international norms . "
" as a result , the election was neither fair nor free . "
bildunterschrift : the eu is concerned about the legitimacy of the elections in iran conservatives lead meanwhile , conservatives lead in the iranian capital 's constituency , whose 30 seats are some of the most politically significant in iran 's parliament , according to initial results made available on sunday .
according state news agency isna , parliament speaker gholam-ali hadad-adel , a close aide of president mahmoud ahmadinejad , leads the tehran list , followed by other conservatives , most of them supporters of the president .
the only reformist candidate who could slip into the top 30 is majid ansari .
other reformists are considerably behind .
iranian interior minister mostafa pur mohammadi said on saturday that the conservative faction had so far gained more than 70 percent of the votes in the provinces in friday 's parliamentary elections .
the lead by the conservatives was expected as they formed the majority of the candidates , after more than half of the reformist candidates were disqualified by the senate-like guardian council for alleged lack of loyalty to the islamic system .
call for reforms bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ali larijani broke ranks with president ahmadinejad most prominent ahmadinejad opponent already elected to parliament is ali larijani , who gained a big win in the religious city of qom , 130 kilometres -lrb- 80 miles -rrb- south of tehran .
he represents the so-called " revisionists , " a group that used to back the president but gradually grew apart from him and formed their own faction .
" the conservatives should increase the atmosphere of understanding and national unity , " larijani told journalists at a press conference in qom on saturday . "
the results of the elections should not lead to any arrogance . "
" i predict that the new legislative period will be much more effective than the current one , and give priority to national interests , " the pragmatic conservative official added .
larijani resigned last october as chief nuclear negotiator after grave differences with ahmadinejad over the country 's nuclear policies and has since then been regarded as a critic of the president , especially over economic policies which have caused high inflation . dw staff -lrb- tt -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

merkel for her part said the visit would begin a " new chapter " in relations between the two states , who established full diplomatic ties in 1965 .
the visit by merkel , who is accompanied by a high-powered delegation of cabinet ministers , business leaders and scientists , is to mark the 60th anniversary of the founding of the jewish state , which will be officially celebrated in may .
bildunterschrift : merkel 's visit is believed by many to be of historic importance " on the one hand we should never lose sight of our responsibility for the past - and german policy never will - on the other , we should look to the future of our relations " with israel , merkel said on the eve of her trip .
she said that anyone familiar with the history of the nazi era and the holocaust - in which 6 million jews lost their lives - would know that germany 's stable and friendly relations with israel today were " one of the miracles of history . "
apart from its symbolic value , however , the visit will also mark the start of annual consultations at cabinet level to be held between the two governments .
merkel and her eight accompanying ministers are due to hold a joint meeting with the israeli cabinet on monday morning , in what is seen as a definite indication of the strengthening of the ties between the two countries .
on tuesday , merkel will speak in the knesset , after the chamber modified its regulations which stipulate that only a visiting head of state , as opposed to head of government , may speak to the body .
pressure to address palestinian concerns bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some politicians in germany would want to see merkel take a tougher stance against israel ahead of her trip , however , merkel came under pressure in germany to use the visit to israel to criticize the jewish state over its settlement policy .
the head of the german-israeli parliamentary group , the greens politician jerzy montag , said merkel should raise points of difference between prime minister ehud olmert 's government and the palestinians .
" the chancellor should raise critical questions and make it clear that israel should - for both humanitarian reasons and out of long-term self-interest - look for new solutions in the settlement question , the handling of the checkpoints and the general living conditions of the palestinians , " montag said .
social democrat foreign policy spokesman rolf muetzenich seconded this view , while werner hoyer , a foreign policy spokesman for the liberal fdp regretted that merkel was not seeing palestinian president mahmoud abbas during the visit .
merkel ' office said the chancellor had spoken to abbas by phone on friday concerning the status of the current talks initiated by us president george w. bush at annapolis last year .
international conference bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany hopes to play a constructive role in resolving the mideast conflict abbas had asked merkel to raise the issue of israeli plans to restart the building of settlements in east jerusalem , saying that this was hampering the annapolis process .
merkel pledged to report back to the palestinian leader on her return from israel .
the palestinian leader also welcomed a german proposal to hold a conference on the middle east in berlin in june with the aim of boosting efforts to build an effective judicial system and police force in a future palestinian state .
israel , the palestinians and other arab states as well as the united states , russia , the un and european union members will be invited to the gathering .
german government spokesman ulrich wilhelm said that the event would not be a peace conference but a meeting to support the efforts of former british prime minister tony blair in his role as a eu coordinator seeking to build a modern palestinian state . dw staff -lrb- tt -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" the eu " expresses its deep concern that election procedures in the islamic republic of iran have fallen below the international standards and that the electoral process did not allow for truly competitive elections , " a statement said .
" in this regard it expresses its deep regret and disappointment that over a third of prospective candidates were prevented from standing in this year 's parliamentary elections , " the eu 's slovenian presidency said .
" these exclusions prevented the iranian people from being able to choose freely amongst the full range of political views in their country and represent a clear violation of the international norms . "
" as a result , the election was neither fair nor free . "
bildunterschrift : the eu is concerned about the legitimacy of the elections in iran conservatives lead meanwhile , conservatives lead in the iranian capital 's constituency , whose 30 seats are some of the most politically significant in iran 's parliament , according to initial results made available on sunday .
according state news agency isna , parliament speaker gholam-ali hadad-adel , a close aide of president mahmoud ahmadinejad , leads the tehran list , followed by other conservatives , most of them supporters of the president .
the only reformist candidate who could slip into the top 30 is majid ansari .
other reformists are considerably behind .
iranian interior minister mostafa pur mohammadi said on saturday that the conservative faction had so far gained more than 70 percent of the votes in the provinces in friday 's parliamentary elections .
the lead by the conservatives was expected as they formed the majority of the candidates , after more than half of the reformist candidates were disqualified by the senate-like guardian council for alleged lack of loyalty to the islamic system .

" the eu " expresses its deep concern that election procedures in the islamic republic of iran have fallen below the international standards and that the electoral process did not allow for truly competitive elections , " a statement said .
" in this regard it expresses its deep regret and disappointment that over a third of prospective candidates were prevented from standing in this year 's parliamentary elections , " the eu 's slovenian presidency said .
" these exclusions prevented the iranian people from being able to choose freely amongst the full range of political views in their country and represent a clear violation of the international norms . "
" as a result , the election was neither fair nor free . "
bildunterschrift : the eu is concerned about the legitimacy of the elections in iran conservatives lead meanwhile , conservatives lead in the iranian capital 's constituency , whose 30 seats are some of the most politically significant in iran 's parliament , according to initial results made available on sunday .
according state news agency isna , parliament speaker gholam-ali hadad-adel , a close aide of president mahmoud ahmadinejad , leads the tehran list , followed by other conservatives , most of them supporters of the president .
the only reformist candidate who could slip into the top 30 is majid ansari .
other reformists are considerably behind .
iranian interior minister mostafa pur mohammadi said on saturday that the conservative faction had so far gained more than 70 percent of the votes in the provinces in friday 's parliamentary elections .
the lead by the conservatives was expected as they formed the majority of the candidates , after more than half of the reformist candidates were disqualified by the senate-like guardian council for alleged lack of loyalty to the islamic system .

" the conservatives should increase the atmosphere of understanding and national unity , " larijani told journalists at a press conference in qom on saturday . "
the results of the elections should not lead to any arrogance . "
" i predict that the new legislative period will be much more effective than the current one , and give priority to national interests , " the pragmatic conservative official added .

they 'll be joining the growing ranks of health care workers from former communist countries . country doctors are few and far between in germany .
general practitioners in the countryside earn around 20 percent less than their colleagues in the cities .
in the eastern states in particular , many working doctors either go abroad or to large urban hospitals and specialized practices , where there are more private patients and therefore more money to be earned .
the result is an ever-worsening doctor shortage outside the cities , which health ministry officials in the state of brandenburg now hope to reverse with a unique project - allowing doctors from eastern europe to pick up the slack .
the initiative , unveiled this week , is a win-win idea .
it foresees countering the doctor shortfall in brandenburg by allocating out-of-work doctors from former communist countries to country practices - not only helping integrate germany 's minorities into the working world but also helping solve what has become an acute problem within the health services .
the eastern european element bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : many old people are reluctant to get into homes in fact , eastern europeans have long been a presence within germany 's health services .
as germany struggles to cope with an ageing population , carers from eastern europe are stepping in to help the country meet a growing need for trained workers .
many of them work illegally , but growing numbers of internet agencies now provide the services of hired help from countries such as poland , romania , hungary and bulgaria .
nonetheless , many of them operate in a legal gray area given germany 's restrictions of free movement of labor within the eu .
one way the carers can circumvent these regulations is by registering in their home countries as freelancers , which allows them to spend up to six months working in germany .
agencies tend to send them to various eu countries for limited periods and then rotate them across the continent .
other agencies are entirely above board , offering east european professionals a chance to sign contracts with companies in their home countries which work with partner agencies in germany .
they get sent not only to private homes but also to understaffed hospitals and clinics .
dumping prices ?
but critics say that the eastern europeans are providing cheap labor and undercutting their german counterparts .
coming from poorer countries , they are usually willing to work for considerably less than their german counterparts and often prove more flexible to families looking after aged relations at home .
given that the agencies are also taking a cut , how profitable is it for the nurses themselves ?
" few of them last longer than six months , " said michaela niclaus from the agency " help4seniors . " 29-year-old marta from krakow did n't even stay that long .
she was sent to the small town of treis-karden in rhineland-palatinate to look after johannes wessler 's 87-year-old mother .
" my mother ca n't be on her own in the house , " wessler said .
" she ca n't get around by herself and she does n't want to go into a home . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany is struggling to look after its ageing population his problems were answered when he found marta on an agency web site .
he is n't the only one in his neighborhood to take advantage of affordable 24-hour care by trained eastern european care workers .
these days , the area - which is popular with pensioners - is home to growing numbers of poles , romanians and bulgarians all looking after the elderly local population .
but marta was allowed just two hours off a day , six days a week - and packed her bags after less than six months .

they 'll be joining the growing ranks of health care workers from former communist countries . country doctors are few and far between in germany .
general practitioners in the countryside earn around 20 percent less than their colleagues in the cities .
in the eastern states in particular , many working doctors either go abroad or to large urban hospitals and specialized practices , where there are more private patients and therefore more money to be earned .
the result is an ever-worsening doctor shortage outside the cities , which health ministry officials in the state of brandenburg now hope to reverse with a unique project - allowing doctors from eastern europe to pick up the slack .
the initiative , unveiled this week , is a win-win idea .
it foresees countering the doctor shortfall in brandenburg by allocating out-of-work doctors from former communist countries to country practices - not only helping integrate germany 's minorities into the working world but also helping solve what has become an acute problem within the health services .
the eastern european element bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : many old people are reluctant to get into homes in fact , eastern europeans have long been a presence within germany 's health services .
as germany struggles to cope with an ageing population , carers from eastern europe are stepping in to help the country meet a growing need for trained workers .
many of them work illegally , but growing numbers of internet agencies now provide the services of hired help from countries such as poland , romania , hungary and bulgaria .
nonetheless , many of them operate in a legal gray area given germany 's restrictions of free movement of labor within the eu .
one way the carers can circumvent these regulations is by registering in their home countries as freelancers , which allows them to spend up to six months working in germany .
agencies tend to send them to various eu countries for limited periods and then rotate them across the continent .
other agencies are entirely above board , offering east european professionals a chance to sign contracts with companies in their home countries which work with partner agencies in germany .
they get sent not only to private homes but also to understaffed hospitals and clinics .
dumping prices ?
but critics say that the eastern europeans are providing cheap labor and undercutting their german counterparts .
coming from poorer countries , they are usually willing to work for considerably less than their german counterparts and often prove more flexible to families looking after aged relations at home .
given that the agencies are also taking a cut , how profitable is it for the nurses themselves ?

merkel for her part said the visit would begin a " new chapter " in relations between the two states , who established full diplomatic ties in 1965 .
the visit by merkel , who is accompanied by a high-powered delegation of cabinet ministers , business leaders and scientists , is to mark the 60th anniversary of the founding of the jewish state , which will be officially celebrated in may .
bildunterschrift : merkel 's visit is believed by many to be of historic importance " on the one hand we should never lose sight of our responsibility for the past - and german policy never will - on the other , we should look to the future of our relations " with israel , merkel said on the eve of her trip .
she said that anyone familiar with the history of the nazi era and the holocaust - in which 6 million jews lost their lives - would know that germany 's stable and friendly relations with israel today were " one of the miracles of history . "
apart from its symbolic value , however , the visit will also mark the start of annual consultations at cabinet level to be held between the two governments .
merkel and her eight accompanying ministers are due to hold a joint meeting with the israeli cabinet on monday morning , in what is seen as a definite indication of the strengthening of the ties between the two countries .
on tuesday , merkel will speak in the knesset , after the chamber modified its regulations which stipulate that only a visiting head of state , as opposed to head of government , may speak to the body .
pressure to address palestinian concerns bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some politicians in germany would want to see merkel take a tougher stance against israel ahead of her trip , however , merkel came under pressure in germany to use the visit to israel to criticize the jewish state over its settlement policy .
the head of the german-israeli parliamentary group , the greens politician jerzy montag , said merkel should raise points of difference between prime minister ehud olmert 's government and the palestinians .
" the chancellor should raise critical questions and make it clear that israel should - for both humanitarian reasons and out of long-term self-interest - look for new solutions in the settlement question , the handling of the checkpoints and the general living conditions of the palestinians , " montag said .
social democrat foreign policy spokesman rolf muetzenich seconded this view , while werner hoyer , a foreign policy spokesman for the liberal fdp regretted that merkel was not seeing palestinian president mahmoud abbas during the visit .
merkel ' office said the chancellor had spoken to abbas by phone on friday concerning the status of the current talks initiated by us president george w. bush at annapolis last year .

merkel for her part said the visit would begin a " new chapter " in relations between the two states , who established full diplomatic ties in 1965 .
the visit by merkel , who is accompanied by a high-powered delegation of cabinet ministers , business leaders and scientists , is to mark the 60th anniversary of the founding of the jewish state , which will be officially celebrated in may .
bildunterschrift : merkel 's visit is believed by many to be of historic importance " on the one hand we should never lose sight of our responsibility for the past - and german policy never will - on the other , we should look to the future of our relations " with israel , merkel said on the eve of her trip .
she said that anyone familiar with the history of the nazi era and the holocaust - in which 6 million jews lost their lives - would know that germany 's stable and friendly relations with israel today were " one of the miracles of history . "
apart from its symbolic value , however , the visit will also mark the start of annual consultations at cabinet level to be held between the two governments .
merkel and her eight accompanying ministers are due to hold a joint meeting with the israeli cabinet on monday morning , in what is seen as a definite indication of the strengthening of the ties between the two countries .

merkel for her part said the visit would begin a " new chapter " in relations between the two states , who established full diplomatic ties in 1965 .
the visit by merkel , who is accompanied by a high-powered delegation of cabinet ministers , business leaders and scientists , is to mark the 60th anniversary of the founding of the jewish state , which will be officially celebrated in may .
bildunterschrift : merkel 's visit is believed by many to be of historic importance " on the one hand we should never lose sight of our responsibility for the past - and german policy never will - on the other , we should look to the future of our relations " with israel , merkel said on the eve of her trip .
she said that anyone familiar with the history of the nazi era and the holocaust - in which 6 million jews lost their lives - would know that germany 's stable and friendly relations with israel today were " one of the miracles of history . "
apart from its symbolic value , however , the visit will also mark the start of annual consultations at cabinet level to be held between the two governments .
merkel and her eight accompanying ministers are due to hold a joint meeting with the israeli cabinet on monday morning , in what is seen as a definite indication of the strengthening of the ties between the two countries .
on tuesday , merkel will speak in the knesset , after the chamber modified its regulations which stipulate that only a visiting head of state , as opposed to head of government , may speak to the body .
pressure to address palestinian concerns bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some politicians in germany would want to see merkel take a tougher stance against israel ahead of her trip , however , merkel came under pressure in germany to use the visit to israel to criticize the jewish state over its settlement policy .
the head of the german-israeli parliamentary group , the greens politician jerzy montag , said merkel should raise points of difference between prime minister ehud olmert 's government and the palestinians .
" the chancellor should raise critical questions and make it clear that israel should - for both humanitarian reasons and out of long-term self-interest - look for new solutions in the settlement question , the handling of the checkpoints and the general living conditions of the palestinians , " montag said .
social democrat foreign policy spokesman rolf muetzenich seconded this view , while werner hoyer , a foreign policy spokesman for the liberal fdp regretted that merkel was not seeing palestinian president mahmoud abbas during the visit .
merkel ' office said the chancellor had spoken to abbas by phone on friday concerning the status of the current talks initiated by us president george w. bush at annapolis last year .
international conference bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany hopes to play a constructive role in resolving the mideast conflict abbas had asked merkel to raise the issue of israeli plans to restart the building of settlements in east jerusalem , saying that this was hampering the annapolis process .
merkel pledged to report back to the palestinian leader on her return from israel .
the palestinian leader also welcomed a german proposal to hold a conference on the middle east in berlin in june with the aim of boosting efforts to build an effective judicial system and police force in a future palestinian state .
israel , the palestinians and other arab states as well as the united states , russia , the un and european union members will be invited to the gathering .
german government spokesman ulrich wilhelm said that the event would not be a peace conference but a meeting to support the efforts of former british prime minister tony blair in his role as a eu coordinator seeking to build a modern palestinian state . dw staff -lrb- tt -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

but ocampo does n't particularly like the term " international court " anyway . " we 're a safeguard system .
we 're not some kind of global supreme court , " he said . on march 11 , 2003 , this " security system " began its work .
eighteen judges were named and , several days later , the chief prosecutor was appointed . moreno-ocampo 's job is to investigate each case before it goes to the judges .
he only steps in when a country 's highest court can not or does not want to punish a war crime , a crime against humanity or an act of genocide . individuals , not states , are tried and prosecuted in the international criminal court - though only if they come from a country that has ratified the court 's protocol or committed the crime in a country that has signed it .
so far , that has only happened with cases from congo , uganda and the central african republic .
otherwise , the un security council has to commission an investigation , which was the case in darfur . icc focuses on africa bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : luis moreno-ocampo is from argentina currently , the international criminal court is only working on these four cases .
" i looked for the most difficult cases and it turned out that they were all in africa , " said moreno-ocampo . the court does n't have jurisdiction in the middle east , since the countries there have not ratified its protocol .
neither has the united states .
most of the court 's 105 members are in europe , south america - and africa . the first case that it took on , congo , has already led to the trial of former militia leader thomas lubanga dyilo .
last october , a second congolese war criminal , germain katanga , was extradited to the hague . considering the court 's greatest weakness - namely , that it does n't have its own police but has to rely on help from the country in question or from international peacekeeping forces - this initial case is seen as a considerable success . victims can claim compensation apart from the absence of police , head judge philippe kirsch sees a second challenge : " this court operates under much more difficult conditions than other tribunals , especially because we investigate conflicts that are still going on . " the court has learned from other tribunals that it is crucial to involve the victims themselves , added kirsch . " in earlier tribunals , victims were mainly present as witnesses , but not to demand their own rights , " he said .
" at the international criminal court , they can not only demand their rights but also receive compensation . " another significant difference from other tribunals is the court 's initial chamber , which reviews evidence and separates the important material from the less important .
this allows for greater efficiency in subsequent trials . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : lubanga -lrb- right -rrb- was the first person arrested for trial at the icc it also prevents defendants from reading off long , drawn-out monologues or summoning witnesses that extend the trial by months or even years but do n't contribute anything constructive - like slobodan milosevic did at the international criminal tribunal for the former yugoslavia . opposition from the us despite its achievements , the international criminal court has continually had to defend itself against skeptics .
above all , the us .
president george w. bush has rejected ratifying the court 's protocol because he fears that americans could also be brought to trial . china , russia and india also have n't ratified it .
despite the absence of support from these important countries , kirsch is optimistic . " there has already been a development in countries that had objected to the international criminal court , " he said .
" our work is purely judicial and for this reason there 's more trust in the court than there was before . " the unshaven chief prosecutor also expressed hope that the court 's work would have a positive impact .
" justice is a prerequisite of lasting peace , " moreno-ocampo said .

they 'll be joining the growing ranks of health care workers from former communist countries . country doctors are few and far between in germany .
general practitioners in the countryside earn around 20 percent less than their colleagues in the cities .
in the eastern states in particular , many working doctors either go abroad or to large urban hospitals and specialized practices , where there are more private patients and therefore more money to be earned .
the result is an ever-worsening doctor shortage outside the cities , which health ministry officials in the state of brandenburg now hope to reverse with a unique project - allowing doctors from eastern europe to pick up the slack .
the initiative , unveiled this week , is a win-win idea .
it foresees countering the doctor shortfall in brandenburg by allocating out-of-work doctors from former communist countries to country practices - not only helping integrate germany 's minorities into the working world but also helping solve what has become an acute problem within the health services .
the eastern european element bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : many old people are reluctant to get into homes in fact , eastern europeans have long been a presence within germany 's health services .
as germany struggles to cope with an ageing population , carers from eastern europe are stepping in to help the country meet a growing need for trained workers .
many of them work illegally , but growing numbers of internet agencies now provide the services of hired help from countries such as poland , romania , hungary and bulgaria .
nonetheless , many of them operate in a legal gray area given germany 's restrictions of free movement of labor within the eu .
one way the carers can circumvent these regulations is by registering in their home countries as freelancers , which allows them to spend up to six months working in germany .
agencies tend to send them to various eu countries for limited periods and then rotate them across the continent .
other agencies are entirely above board , offering east european professionals a chance to sign contracts with companies in their home countries which work with partner agencies in germany .
they get sent not only to private homes but also to understaffed hospitals and clinics .
dumping prices ?
but critics say that the eastern europeans are providing cheap labor and undercutting their german counterparts .
coming from poorer countries , they are usually willing to work for considerably less than their german counterparts and often prove more flexible to families looking after aged relations at home .
given that the agencies are also taking a cut , how profitable is it for the nurses themselves ?
" few of them last longer than six months , " said michaela niclaus from the agency " help4seniors . " 29-year-old marta from krakow did n't even stay that long .
she was sent to the small town of treis-karden in rhineland-palatinate to look after johannes wessler 's 87-year-old mother .
" my mother ca n't be on her own in the house , " wessler said .
" she ca n't get around by herself and she does n't want to go into a home . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany is struggling to look after its ageing population his problems were answered when he found marta on an agency web site .
he is n't the only one in his neighborhood to take advantage of affordable 24-hour care by trained eastern european care workers .
these days , the area - which is popular with pensioners - is home to growing numbers of poles , romanians and bulgarians all looking after the elderly local population .
but marta was allowed just two hours off a day , six days a week - and packed her bags after less than six months .
by 2011 at the latest , the government in berlin will be able to lift restrictions of free movement of workers within the eu .
until then , marta can be easily replaced . dw staff -lrb- jp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" the eu " expresses its deep concern that election procedures in the islamic republic of iran have fallen below the international standards and that the electoral process did not allow for truly competitive elections , " a statement said .
" in this regard it expresses its deep regret and disappointment that over a third of prospective candidates were prevented from standing in this year 's parliamentary elections , " the eu 's slovenian presidency said .
" these exclusions prevented the iranian people from being able to choose freely amongst the full range of political views in their country and represent a clear violation of the international norms . "
" as a result , the election was neither fair nor free . "
bildunterschrift : the eu is concerned about the legitimacy of the elections in iran conservatives lead meanwhile , conservatives lead in the iranian capital 's constituency , whose 30 seats are some of the most politically significant in iran 's parliament , according to initial results made available on sunday .
according state news agency isna , parliament speaker gholam-ali hadad-adel , a close aide of president mahmoud ahmadinejad , leads the tehran list , followed by other conservatives , most of them supporters of the president .
the only reformist candidate who could slip into the top 30 is majid ansari .
other reformists are considerably behind .
iranian interior minister mostafa pur mohammadi said on saturday that the conservative faction had so far gained more than 70 percent of the votes in the provinces in friday 's parliamentary elections .
the lead by the conservatives was expected as they formed the majority of the candidates , after more than half of the reformist candidates were disqualified by the senate-like guardian council for alleged lack of loyalty to the islamic system .
call for reforms bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ali larijani broke ranks with president ahmadinejad most prominent ahmadinejad opponent already elected to parliament is ali larijani , who gained a big win in the religious city of qom , 130 kilometres -lrb- 80 miles -rrb- south of tehran .
he represents the so-called " revisionists , " a group that used to back the president but gradually grew apart from him and formed their own faction .
" the conservatives should increase the atmosphere of understanding and national unity , " larijani told journalists at a press conference in qom on saturday . "
the results of the elections should not lead to any arrogance . "
" i predict that the new legislative period will be much more effective than the current one , and give priority to national interests , " the pragmatic conservative official added .
larijani resigned last october as chief nuclear negotiator after grave differences with ahmadinejad over the country 's nuclear policies and has since then been regarded as a critic of the president , especially over economic policies which have caused high inflation . dw staff -lrb- tt -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de health -pipe- 16.03.2008 eastern europeans pick up health care slack in germany großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : many eastern european doctors in germany have spent years unemployed a new initiative in brandenburg is aiming to remedy germany 's acute doctor shortage with professionals from eastern europe .
they 'll be joining the growing ranks of health care workers from former communist countries . country doctors are few and far between in germany .
general practitioners in the countryside earn around 20 percent less than their colleagues in the cities .
in the eastern states in particular , many working doctors either go abroad or to large urban hospitals and specialized practices , where there are more private patients and therefore more money to be earned .
the result is an ever-worsening doctor shortage outside the cities , which health ministry officials in the state of brandenburg now hope to reverse with a unique project - allowing doctors from eastern europe to pick up the slack .
the initiative , unveiled this week , is a win-win idea .
it foresees countering the doctor shortfall in brandenburg by allocating out-of-work doctors from former communist countries to country practices - not only helping integrate germany 's minorities into the working world but also helping solve what has become an acute problem within the health services .
the eastern european element bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : many old people are reluctant to get into homes in fact , eastern europeans have long been a presence within germany 's health services .
as germany struggles to cope with an ageing population , carers from eastern europe are stepping in to help the country meet a growing need for trained workers .
many of them work illegally , but growing numbers of internet agencies now provide the services of hired help from countries such as poland , romania , hungary and bulgaria .
nonetheless , many of them operate in a legal gray area given germany 's restrictions of free movement of labor within the eu .
one way the carers can circumvent these regulations is by registering in their home countries as freelancers , which allows them to spend up to six months working in germany .

they 'll be joining the growing ranks of health care workers from former communist countries . country doctors are few and far between in germany .
general practitioners in the countryside earn around 20 percent less than their colleagues in the cities .
in the eastern states in particular , many working doctors either go abroad or to large urban hospitals and specialized practices , where there are more private patients and therefore more money to be earned .
the result is an ever-worsening doctor shortage outside the cities , which health ministry officials in the state of brandenburg now hope to reverse with a unique project - allowing doctors from eastern europe to pick up the slack .
the initiative , unveiled this week , is a win-win idea .
it foresees countering the doctor shortfall in brandenburg by allocating out-of-work doctors from former communist countries to country practices - not only helping integrate germany 's minorities into the working world but also helping solve what has become an acute problem within the health services .

" the eu " expresses its deep concern that election procedures in the islamic republic of iran have fallen below the international standards and that the electoral process did not allow for truly competitive elections , " a statement said .
" in this regard it expresses its deep regret and disappointment that over a third of prospective candidates were prevented from standing in this year 's parliamentary elections , " the eu 's slovenian presidency said .
" these exclusions prevented the iranian people from being able to choose freely amongst the full range of political views in their country and represent a clear violation of the international norms . "
" as a result , the election was neither fair nor free . "
bildunterschrift : the eu is concerned about the legitimacy of the elections in iran conservatives lead meanwhile , conservatives lead in the iranian capital 's constituency , whose 30 seats are some of the most politically significant in iran 's parliament , according to initial results made available on sunday .
according state news agency isna , parliament speaker gholam-ali hadad-adel , a close aide of president mahmoud ahmadinejad , leads the tehran list , followed by other conservatives , most of them supporters of the president .
the only reformist candidate who could slip into the top 30 is majid ansari .
other reformists are considerably behind .
iranian interior minister mostafa pur mohammadi said on saturday that the conservative faction had so far gained more than 70 percent of the votes in the provinces in friday 's parliamentary elections .
the lead by the conservatives was expected as they formed the majority of the candidates , after more than half of the reformist candidates were disqualified by the senate-like guardian council for alleged lack of loyalty to the islamic system .
call for reforms bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ali larijani broke ranks with president ahmadinejad most prominent ahmadinejad opponent already elected to parliament is ali larijani , who gained a big win in the religious city of qom , 130 kilometres -lrb- 80 miles -rrb- south of tehran .
he represents the so-called " revisionists , " a group that used to back the president but gradually grew apart from him and formed their own faction .
" the conservatives should increase the atmosphere of understanding and national unity , " larijani told journalists at a press conference in qom on saturday . "
the results of the elections should not lead to any arrogance . "
" i predict that the new legislative period will be much more effective than the current one , and give priority to national interests , " the pragmatic conservative official added .
larijani resigned last october as chief nuclear negotiator after grave differences with ahmadinejad over the country 's nuclear policies and has since then been regarded as a critic of the president , especially over economic policies which have caused high inflation . dw staff -lrb- tt -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

they 'll be joining the growing ranks of health care workers from former communist countries . country doctors are few and far between in germany .
general practitioners in the countryside earn around 20 percent less than their colleagues in the cities .
in the eastern states in particular , many working doctors either go abroad or to large urban hospitals and specialized practices , where there are more private patients and therefore more money to be earned .
the result is an ever-worsening doctor shortage outside the cities , which health ministry officials in the state of brandenburg now hope to reverse with a unique project - allowing doctors from eastern europe to pick up the slack .
the initiative , unveiled this week , is a win-win idea .
it foresees countering the doctor shortfall in brandenburg by allocating out-of-work doctors from former communist countries to country practices - not only helping integrate germany 's minorities into the working world but also helping solve what has become an acute problem within the health services .

many of them work illegally , but growing numbers of internet agencies now provide the services of hired help from countries such as poland , romania , hungary and bulgaria .
nonetheless , many of them operate in a legal gray area given germany 's restrictions of free movement of labor within the eu .
one way the carers can circumvent these regulations is by registering in their home countries as freelancers , which allows them to spend up to six months working in germany .
agencies tend to send them to various eu countries for limited periods and then rotate them across the continent .
other agencies are entirely above board , offering east european professionals a chance to sign contracts with companies in their home countries which work with partner agencies in germany .
they get sent not only to private homes but also to understaffed hospitals and clinics .
dumping prices ?
but critics say that the eastern europeans are providing cheap labor and undercutting their german counterparts .
coming from poorer countries , they are usually willing to work for considerably less than their german counterparts and often prove more flexible to families looking after aged relations at home .
given that the agencies are also taking a cut , how profitable is it for the nurses themselves ?
" few of them last longer than six months , " said michaela niclaus from the agency " help4seniors . " 29-year-old marta from krakow did n't even stay that long .
she was sent to the small town of treis-karden in rhineland-palatinate to look after johannes wessler 's 87-year-old mother .

merkel for her part said the visit would begin a " new chapter " in relations between the two states , who established full diplomatic ties in 1965 .
the visit by merkel , who is accompanied by a high-powered delegation of cabinet ministers , business leaders and scientists , is to mark the 60th anniversary of the founding of the jewish state , which will be officially celebrated in may .
bildunterschrift : merkel 's visit is believed by many to be of historic importance " on the one hand we should never lose sight of our responsibility for the past - and german policy never will - on the other , we should look to the future of our relations " with israel , merkel said on the eve of her trip .
she said that anyone familiar with the history of the nazi era and the holocaust - in which 6 million jews lost their lives - would know that germany 's stable and friendly relations with israel today were " one of the miracles of history . "
apart from its symbolic value , however , the visit will also mark the start of annual consultations at cabinet level to be held between the two governments .
merkel and her eight accompanying ministers are due to hold a joint meeting with the israeli cabinet on monday morning , in what is seen as a definite indication of the strengthening of the ties between the two countries .
on tuesday , merkel will speak in the knesset , after the chamber modified its regulations which stipulate that only a visiting head of state , as opposed to head of government , may speak to the body .
pressure to address palestinian concerns bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some politicians in germany would want to see merkel take a tougher stance against israel ahead of her trip , however , merkel came under pressure in germany to use the visit to israel to criticize the jewish state over its settlement policy .
the head of the german-israeli parliamentary group , the greens politician jerzy montag , said merkel should raise points of difference between prime minister ehud olmert 's government and the palestinians .
" the chancellor should raise critical questions and make it clear that israel should - for both humanitarian reasons and out of long-term self-interest - look for new solutions in the settlement question , the handling of the checkpoints and the general living conditions of the palestinians , " montag said .
social democrat foreign policy spokesman rolf muetzenich seconded this view , while werner hoyer , a foreign policy spokesman for the liberal fdp regretted that merkel was not seeing palestinian president mahmoud abbas during the visit .
merkel ' office said the chancellor had spoken to abbas by phone on friday concerning the status of the current talks initiated by us president george w. bush at annapolis last year .
international conference bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany hopes to play a constructive role in resolving the mideast conflict abbas had asked merkel to raise the issue of israeli plans to restart the building of settlements in east jerusalem , saying that this was hampering the annapolis process .
merkel pledged to report back to the palestinian leader on her return from israel .
the palestinian leader also welcomed a german proposal to hold a conference on the middle east in berlin in june with the aim of boosting efforts to build an effective judicial system and police force in a future palestinian state .
israel , the palestinians and other arab states as well as the united states , russia , the un and european union members will be invited to the gathering .
german government spokesman ulrich wilhelm said that the event would not be a peace conference but a meeting to support the efforts of former british prime minister tony blair in his role as a eu coordinator seeking to build a modern palestinian state . dw staff -lrb- tt -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

but ocampo does n't particularly like the term " international court " anyway . " we 're a safeguard system .
we 're not some kind of global supreme court , " he said . on march 11 , 2003 , this " security system " began its work .
eighteen judges were named and , several days later , the chief prosecutor was appointed . moreno-ocampo 's job is to investigate each case before it goes to the judges .
he only steps in when a country 's highest court can not or does not want to punish a war crime , a crime against humanity or an act of genocide . individuals , not states , are tried and prosecuted in the international criminal court - though only if they come from a country that has ratified the court 's protocol or committed the crime in a country that has signed it .
so far , that has only happened with cases from congo , uganda and the central african republic .
otherwise , the un security council has to commission an investigation , which was the case in darfur . icc focuses on africa bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : luis moreno-ocampo is from argentina currently , the international criminal court is only working on these four cases .
" i looked for the most difficult cases and it turned out that they were all in africa , " said moreno-ocampo . the court does n't have jurisdiction in the middle east , since the countries there have not ratified its protocol .
neither has the united states .
most of the court 's 105 members are in europe , south america - and africa . the first case that it took on , congo , has already led to the trial of former militia leader thomas lubanga dyilo .
last october , a second congolese war criminal , germain katanga , was extradited to the hague . considering the court 's greatest weakness - namely , that it does n't have its own police but has to rely on help from the country in question or from international peacekeeping forces - this initial case is seen as a considerable success . victims can claim compensation apart from the absence of police , head judge philippe kirsch sees a second challenge : " this court operates under much more difficult conditions than other tribunals , especially because we investigate conflicts that are still going on . " the court has learned from other tribunals that it is crucial to involve the victims themselves , added kirsch . " in earlier tribunals , victims were mainly present as witnesses , but not to demand their own rights , " he said .
" at the international criminal court , they can not only demand their rights but also receive compensation . " another significant difference from other tribunals is the court 's initial chamber , which reviews evidence and separates the important material from the less important .

eighteen judges were named and , several days later , the chief prosecutor was appointed . moreno-ocampo 's job is to investigate each case before it goes to the judges .
he only steps in when a country 's highest court can not or does not want to punish a war crime , a crime against humanity or an act of genocide . individuals , not states , are tried and prosecuted in the international criminal court - though only if they come from a country that has ratified the court 's protocol or committed the crime in a country that has signed it .

last october , a second congolese war criminal , germain katanga , was extradited to the hague . considering the court 's greatest weakness - namely , that it does n't have its own police but has to rely on help from the country in question or from international peacekeeping forces - this initial case is seen as a considerable success . victims can claim compensation apart from the absence of police , head judge philippe kirsch sees a second challenge : " this court operates under much more difficult conditions than other tribunals , especially because we investigate conflicts that are still going on .

but ocampo does n't particularly like the term " international court " anyway . " we 're a safeguard system .
we 're not some kind of global supreme court , " he said . on march 11 , 2003 , this " security system " began its work .
eighteen judges were named and , several days later , the chief prosecutor was appointed . moreno-ocampo 's job is to investigate each case before it goes to the judges .
he only steps in when a country 's highest court can not or does not want to punish a war crime , a crime against humanity or an act of genocide . individuals , not states , are tried and prosecuted in the international criminal court - though only if they come from a country that has ratified the court 's protocol or committed the crime in a country that has signed it .
so far , that has only happened with cases from congo , uganda and the central african republic .
otherwise , the un security council has to commission an investigation , which was the case in darfur . icc focuses on africa bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : luis moreno-ocampo is from argentina currently , the international criminal court is only working on these four cases .
" i looked for the most difficult cases and it turned out that they were all in africa , " said moreno-ocampo . the court does n't have jurisdiction in the middle east , since the countries there have not ratified its protocol .
neither has the united states .
most of the court 's 105 members are in europe , south america - and africa . the first case that it took on , congo , has already led to the trial of former militia leader thomas lubanga dyilo .
last october , a second congolese war criminal , germain katanga , was extradited to the hague . considering the court 's greatest weakness - namely , that it does n't have its own police but has to rely on help from the country in question or from international peacekeeping forces - this initial case is seen as a considerable success . victims can claim compensation apart from the absence of police , head judge philippe kirsch sees a second challenge : " this court operates under much more difficult conditions than other tribunals , especially because we investigate conflicts that are still going on . " the court has learned from other tribunals that it is crucial to involve the victims themselves , added kirsch . " in earlier tribunals , victims were mainly present as witnesses , but not to demand their own rights , " he said .
" at the international criminal court , they can not only demand their rights but also receive compensation . " another significant difference from other tribunals is the court 's initial chamber , which reviews evidence and separates the important material from the less important .
this allows for greater efficiency in subsequent trials . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : lubanga -lrb- right -rrb- was the first person arrested for trial at the icc it also prevents defendants from reading off long , drawn-out monologues or summoning witnesses that extend the trial by months or even years but do n't contribute anything constructive - like slobodan milosevic did at the international criminal tribunal for the former yugoslavia . opposition from the us despite its achievements , the international criminal court has continually had to defend itself against skeptics .
above all , the us .
president george w. bush has rejected ratifying the court 's protocol because he fears that americans could also be brought to trial . china , russia and india also have n't ratified it .
despite the absence of support from these important countries , kirsch is optimistic . " there has already been a development in countries that had objected to the international criminal court , " he said .
" our work is purely judicial and for this reason there 's more trust in the court than there was before . " the unshaven chief prosecutor also expressed hope that the court 's work would have a positive impact .
" justice is a prerequisite of lasting peace , " moreno-ocampo said .
" i think that justice is our contribution to peace .
the court shows that it can help promote justice in the world . " dw staff -lrb- rri / kjb -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

merkel for her part said the visit would begin a " new chapter " in relations between the two states , who established full diplomatic ties in 1965 .
the visit by merkel , who is accompanied by a high-powered delegation of cabinet ministers , business leaders and scientists , is to mark the 60th anniversary of the founding of the jewish state , which will be officially celebrated in may .
bildunterschrift : merkel 's visit is believed by many to be of historic importance " on the one hand we should never lose sight of our responsibility for the past - and german policy never will - on the other , we should look to the future of our relations " with israel , merkel said on the eve of her trip .
she said that anyone familiar with the history of the nazi era and the holocaust - in which 6 million jews lost their lives - would know that germany 's stable and friendly relations with israel today were " one of the miracles of history . "
apart from its symbolic value , however , the visit will also mark the start of annual consultations at cabinet level to be held between the two governments .
merkel and her eight accompanying ministers are due to hold a joint meeting with the israeli cabinet on monday morning , in what is seen as a definite indication of the strengthening of the ties between the two countries .
on tuesday , merkel will speak in the knesset , after the chamber modified its regulations which stipulate that only a visiting head of state , as opposed to head of government , may speak to the body .
pressure to address palestinian concerns bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some politicians in germany would want to see merkel take a tougher stance against israel ahead of her trip , however , merkel came under pressure in germany to use the visit to israel to criticize the jewish state over its settlement policy .
the head of the german-israeli parliamentary group , the greens politician jerzy montag , said merkel should raise points of difference between prime minister ehud olmert 's government and the palestinians .
" the chancellor should raise critical questions and make it clear that israel should - for both humanitarian reasons and out of long-term self-interest - look for new solutions in the settlement question , the handling of the checkpoints and the general living conditions of the palestinians , " montag said .
social democrat foreign policy spokesman rolf muetzenich seconded this view , while werner hoyer , a foreign policy spokesman for the liberal fdp regretted that merkel was not seeing palestinian president mahmoud abbas during the visit .
merkel ' office said the chancellor had spoken to abbas by phone on friday concerning the status of the current talks initiated by us president george w. bush at annapolis last year .
international conference bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany hopes to play a constructive role in resolving the mideast conflict abbas had asked merkel to raise the issue of israeli plans to restart the building of settlements in east jerusalem , saying that this was hampering the annapolis process .
merkel pledged to report back to the palestinian leader on her return from israel .
the palestinian leader also welcomed a german proposal to hold a conference on the middle east in berlin in june with the aim of boosting efforts to build an effective judicial system and police force in a future palestinian state .
israel , the palestinians and other arab states as well as the united states , russia , the un and european union members will be invited to the gathering .
german government spokesman ulrich wilhelm said that the event would not be a peace conference but a meeting to support the efforts of former british prime minister tony blair in his role as a eu coordinator seeking to build a modern palestinian state . dw staff -lrb- tt -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

merkel for her part said the visit would begin a " new chapter " in relations between the two states , who established full diplomatic ties in 1965 .
the visit by merkel , who is accompanied by a high-powered delegation of cabinet ministers , business leaders and scientists , is to mark the 60th anniversary of the founding of the jewish state , which will be officially celebrated in may .
bildunterschrift : merkel 's visit is believed by many to be of historic importance " on the one hand we should never lose sight of our responsibility for the past - and german policy never will - on the other , we should look to the future of our relations " with israel , merkel said on the eve of her trip .
she said that anyone familiar with the history of the nazi era and the holocaust - in which 6 million jews lost their lives - would know that germany 's stable and friendly relations with israel today were " one of the miracles of history . "
apart from its symbolic value , however , the visit will also mark the start of annual consultations at cabinet level to be held between the two governments .
merkel and her eight accompanying ministers are due to hold a joint meeting with the israeli cabinet on monday morning , in what is seen as a definite indication of the strengthening of the ties between the two countries .
on tuesday , merkel will speak in the knesset , after the chamber modified its regulations which stipulate that only a visiting head of state , as opposed to head of government , may speak to the body .
pressure to address palestinian concerns bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some politicians in germany would want to see merkel take a tougher stance against israel ahead of her trip , however , merkel came under pressure in germany to use the visit to israel to criticize the jewish state over its settlement policy .
the head of the german-israeli parliamentary group , the greens politician jerzy montag , said merkel should raise points of difference between prime minister ehud olmert 's government and the palestinians .
" the chancellor should raise critical questions and make it clear that israel should - for both humanitarian reasons and out of long-term self-interest - look for new solutions in the settlement question , the handling of the checkpoints and the general living conditions of the palestinians , " montag said .
social democrat foreign policy spokesman rolf muetzenich seconded this view , while werner hoyer , a foreign policy spokesman for the liberal fdp regretted that merkel was not seeing palestinian president mahmoud abbas during the visit .
merkel ' office said the chancellor had spoken to abbas by phone on friday concerning the status of the current talks initiated by us president george w. bush at annapolis last year .
international conference bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany hopes to play a constructive role in resolving the mideast conflict abbas had asked merkel to raise the issue of israeli plans to restart the building of settlements in east jerusalem , saying that this was hampering the annapolis process .
merkel pledged to report back to the palestinian leader on her return from israel .
the palestinian leader also welcomed a german proposal to hold a conference on the middle east in berlin in june with the aim of boosting efforts to build an effective judicial system and police force in a future palestinian state .
israel , the palestinians and other arab states as well as the united states , russia , the un and european union members will be invited to the gathering .
german government spokesman ulrich wilhelm said that the event would not be a peace conference but a meeting to support the efforts of former british prime minister tony blair in his role as a eu coordinator seeking to build a modern palestinian state . dw staff -lrb- tt -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" in this regard it expresses its deep regret and disappointment that over a third of prospective candidates were prevented from standing in this year 's parliamentary elections , " the eu 's slovenian presidency said .
" these exclusions prevented the iranian people from being able to choose freely amongst the full range of political views in their country and represent a clear violation of the international norms . "
" as a result , the election was neither fair nor free . "
bildunterschrift : the eu is concerned about the legitimacy of the elections in iran conservatives lead meanwhile , conservatives lead in the iranian capital 's constituency , whose 30 seats are some of the most politically significant in iran 's parliament , according to initial results made available on sunday .

the only reformist candidate who could slip into the top 30 is majid ansari .
other reformists are considerably behind .
iranian interior minister mostafa pur mohammadi said on saturday that the conservative faction had so far gained more than 70 percent of the votes in the provinces in friday 's parliamentary elections .
the lead by the conservatives was expected as they formed the majority of the candidates , after more than half of the reformist candidates were disqualified by the senate-like guardian council for alleged lack of loyalty to the islamic system .

" i predict that the new legislative period will be much more effective than the current one , and give priority to national interests , " the pragmatic conservative official added .

" the eu " expresses its deep concern that election procedures in the islamic republic of iran have fallen below the international standards and that the electoral process did not allow for truly competitive elections , " a statement said .
" in this regard it expresses its deep regret and disappointment that over a third of prospective candidates were prevented from standing in this year 's parliamentary elections , " the eu 's slovenian presidency said .
" these exclusions prevented the iranian people from being able to choose freely amongst the full range of political views in their country and represent a clear violation of the international norms . "

other reformists are considerably behind .
iranian interior minister mostafa pur mohammadi said on saturday that the conservative faction had so far gained more than 70 percent of the votes in the provinces in friday 's parliamentary elections .

but ocampo does n't particularly like the term " international court " anyway . " we 're a safeguard system .
we 're not some kind of global supreme court , " he said . on march 11 , 2003 , this " security system " began its work .
eighteen judges were named and , several days later , the chief prosecutor was appointed . moreno-ocampo 's job is to investigate each case before it goes to the judges .
he only steps in when a country 's highest court can not or does not want to punish a war crime , a crime against humanity or an act of genocide . individuals , not states , are tried and prosecuted in the international criminal court - though only if they come from a country that has ratified the court 's protocol or committed the crime in a country that has signed it .
so far , that has only happened with cases from congo , uganda and the central african republic .
otherwise , the un security council has to commission an investigation , which was the case in darfur . icc focuses on africa bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : luis moreno-ocampo is from argentina currently , the international criminal court is only working on these four cases .
" i looked for the most difficult cases and it turned out that they were all in africa , " said moreno-ocampo . the court does n't have jurisdiction in the middle east , since the countries there have not ratified its protocol .
neither has the united states .
most of the court 's 105 members are in europe , south america - and africa . the first case that it took on , congo , has already led to the trial of former militia leader thomas lubanga dyilo .
last october , a second congolese war criminal , germain katanga , was extradited to the hague . considering the court 's greatest weakness - namely , that it does n't have its own police but has to rely on help from the country in question or from international peacekeeping forces - this initial case is seen as a considerable success . victims can claim compensation apart from the absence of police , head judge philippe kirsch sees a second challenge : " this court operates under much more difficult conditions than other tribunals , especially because we investigate conflicts that are still going on . " the court has learned from other tribunals that it is crucial to involve the victims themselves , added kirsch . " in earlier tribunals , victims were mainly present as witnesses , but not to demand their own rights , " he said .
" at the international criminal court , they can not only demand their rights but also receive compensation . " another significant difference from other tribunals is the court 's initial chamber , which reviews evidence and separates the important material from the less important .
this allows for greater efficiency in subsequent trials . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : lubanga -lrb- right -rrb- was the first person arrested for trial at the icc it also prevents defendants from reading off long , drawn-out monologues or summoning witnesses that extend the trial by months or even years but do n't contribute anything constructive - like slobodan milosevic did at the international criminal tribunal for the former yugoslavia . opposition from the us despite its achievements , the international criminal court has continually had to defend itself against skeptics .
above all , the us .
president george w. bush has rejected ratifying the court 's protocol because he fears that americans could also be brought to trial . china , russia and india also have n't ratified it .
despite the absence of support from these important countries , kirsch is optimistic . " there has already been a development in countries that had objected to the international criminal court , " he said .
" our work is purely judicial and for this reason there 's more trust in the court than there was before . " the unshaven chief prosecutor also expressed hope that the court 's work would have a positive impact .
" justice is a prerequisite of lasting peace , " moreno-ocampo said .
" i think that justice is our contribution to peace .
the court shows that it can help promote justice in the world . " dw staff -lrb- rri / kjb -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

but ocampo does n't particularly like the term " international court " anyway . " we 're a safeguard system .
we 're not some kind of global supreme court , " he said . on march 11 , 2003 , this " security system " began its work .
eighteen judges were named and , several days later , the chief prosecutor was appointed . moreno-ocampo 's job is to investigate each case before it goes to the judges .
he only steps in when a country 's highest court can not or does not want to punish a war crime , a crime against humanity or an act of genocide . individuals , not states , are tried and prosecuted in the international criminal court - though only if they come from a country that has ratified the court 's protocol or committed the crime in a country that has signed it .
so far , that has only happened with cases from congo , uganda and the central african republic .
otherwise , the un security council has to commission an investigation , which was the case in darfur . icc focuses on africa bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : luis moreno-ocampo is from argentina currently , the international criminal court is only working on these four cases .
" i looked for the most difficult cases and it turned out that they were all in africa , " said moreno-ocampo . the court does n't have jurisdiction in the middle east , since the countries there have not ratified its protocol .
neither has the united states .
most of the court 's 105 members are in europe , south america - and africa . the first case that it took on , congo , has already led to the trial of former militia leader thomas lubanga dyilo .
last october , a second congolese war criminal , germain katanga , was extradited to the hague . considering the court 's greatest weakness - namely , that it does n't have its own police but has to rely on help from the country in question or from international peacekeeping forces - this initial case is seen as a considerable success . victims can claim compensation apart from the absence of police , head judge philippe kirsch sees a second challenge : " this court operates under much more difficult conditions than other tribunals , especially because we investigate conflicts that are still going on . " the court has learned from other tribunals that it is crucial to involve the victims themselves , added kirsch . " in earlier tribunals , victims were mainly present as witnesses , but not to demand their own rights , " he said .
" at the international criminal court , they can not only demand their rights but also receive compensation . " another significant difference from other tribunals is the court 's initial chamber , which reviews evidence and separates the important material from the less important .
this allows for greater efficiency in subsequent trials . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : lubanga -lrb- right -rrb- was the first person arrested for trial at the icc it also prevents defendants from reading off long , drawn-out monologues or summoning witnesses that extend the trial by months or even years but do n't contribute anything constructive - like slobodan milosevic did at the international criminal tribunal for the former yugoslavia . opposition from the us despite its achievements , the international criminal court has continually had to defend itself against skeptics .
above all , the us .
president george w. bush has rejected ratifying the court 's protocol because he fears that americans could also be brought to trial . china , russia and india also have n't ratified it .
despite the absence of support from these important countries , kirsch is optimistic . " there has already been a development in countries that had objected to the international criminal court , " he said .
" our work is purely judicial and for this reason there 's more trust in the court than there was before . " the unshaven chief prosecutor also expressed hope that the court 's work would have a positive impact .
" justice is a prerequisite of lasting peace , " moreno-ocampo said .
" i think that justice is our contribution to peace .

the los angeles times says workers at the ucla medical centre looked at spears ' confidential files when she was admitted to the hospital in january .
jeri simpson , the hospital 's head of human resources , confirmed to the ap news agency that several staff would be disciplined or fired over the incident .
" it 's very frustrating and it 's very disappointing , " she said .
according to the los angeles times , 13 staff - none of them doctors - will lose their jobs .
another 12 will be disciplined for looking at spears ' computer records , it reported .
however , the hospital would not confirm these figures , nor would it say when the incident took place .
there is no evidence that the information was leaked or sold this is not the first time the centre has had to reprimand employees for looking at spears ' records .
several workers were fired for snooping after spears gave birth to her first son , sean preston , in september 2005 .
" we feel horrible that it happened again , " simpson said , adding that ucla treats celebrities " all the time and you never hear about this " .
" i do n't know what it is about this particular person , i do n't know what it is about her , " she continued .
spears was taken to ucla by ambulance in the early hours of 31 january , and was reportedly held on a psychiatric ward .
her father has since been given control of her assets and estate , and she has been allowed only limited contact with her two sons .

bill aitken , the party 's holyrood justice spokesman , said improved abstinence-based projects were needed to help treat heroin users .
drug treatment experts and labour hit out at his comments .
mr aitken acknowledged methadone had its place but refused to apologise for his remarks to bbc scotland .
the number of people treated for heroin use in scotland reached record levels , according to figures released by the scottish government in july 2007 . "
it 's disappointing to see another negative portrayal of methadone patients in the public sphere " dr saket priyadarshi drug treatment expert about 21,000 people were said to be using methadone to help them with their addiction .
mr aitken told bbc scotland 's politics show using methadone as a first-resort treatment , which kept patients in a state of " partial suspended animation " , had to be tackled .
" we have a very high proportion of the drug-abusing population sitting fat , dumb and happy on methadone , " he said .
" we have got to stop this over-reliance on methadone , get people off that particular form of treatment and get them back into the community .
" the only way you 're going to do that , not in every case i accept , is by a much greater degree of abstinence-based treatment . "
dr saket priyadarshi , of the glasgow addiction service , said some methadone-using patients had been able to work , pay the mortgage and take part in family life , while others had been able to completely stop using the heroin substitute and live abstinent lives .
he said of mr aitken 's comments : " it 's disappointing to see another negative portrayal of methadone patients in the public sphere .
" many patients on methadone are doing very well and i do n't recognise that description . "
mike mccarron , of the scottish association of alcohol and drug action teams , said mr aitken 's comments flew in the face of international experience .
he added : " mr aitken is seeing the world as he would like to see it but , in fact , he does n't understand the real life experience of so many people and the great benefits they 're achieving in these services . "
scottish labour public health spokesman dr richard simpson branded the tory msp 's comments " deeply offensive " .
" we do need a grown-up debate about what 's available for people with drug addiction , " he said .
" we need to look at the alternatives , including abstinence and other pharmacological treatments , but we do not need this sort of language in this discussion . "
community safety minister fergus ewing said drug treatment needed to be more than a prescription service and promised improved services to help more methadone users back into drug-free lives .

mr aitken told bbc scotland 's politics show using methadone as a first-resort treatment , which kept patients in a state of " partial suspended animation " , had to be tackled .
" we have a very high proportion of the drug-abusing population sitting fat , dumb and happy on methadone , " he said .
" we have got to stop this over-reliance on methadone , get people off that particular form of treatment and get them back into the community .
" the only way you 're going to do that , not in every case i accept , is by a much greater degree of abstinence-based treatment . "
dr saket priyadarshi , of the glasgow addiction service , said some methadone-using patients had been able to work , pay the mortgage and take part in family life , while others had been able to completely stop using the heroin substitute and live abstinent lives .
he said of mr aitken 's comments : " it 's disappointing to see another negative portrayal of methadone patients in the public sphere .
" many patients on methadone are doing very well and i do n't recognise that description . "
mr aitken said there was too much reliance on methadone mike mccarron , of the scottish association of alcohol and drug action teams , said mr aitken 's comments flew in the face of international experience .
he added : " mr aitken is seeing the world as he would like to see it but , in fact , he does n't understand the real life experience of so many people and the great benefits they 're achieving in these services . "
scottish labour public health spokesman dr richard simpson branded the tory msp 's comments " deeply offensive " .
" we do need a grown-up debate about what 's available for people with drug addiction , " he said .
" we need to look at the alternatives , including abstinence and other pharmacological treatments , but we do not need this sort of language in this discussion . "
community safety minister fergus ewing said drug treatment needed to be more than a prescription service and promised improved services to help more methadone users back into drug-free lives .

it was the last chance for big weekend rallies before the island votes for a new president on 22 march .
the events - organised by the two main political parties - were also aimed at expressing public opposition to china 's anti-secession law .
the law , passed in 2005 , legalises the use of force against taiwan if it formally declares independence .
china regards the island as part of its territory .
' carnival ' government officials have warned that the violent events in the past few days in tibet have implications for taiwan - showing beijing would not give up the use of force against the island to resolve disputes .
massive crowds turned out as political rallies and marches were staged across the island .
they took on a carnival-like atmosphere - with people wearing baseball caps and t-shirts with political slogans .
super sunday , as it has been called , marks a big push by both political parties to rally their supporters on the last weekend before the election .
in its carefully-choreographed event , the governing democratic progressive party -lrb- dpp -rrb- asked people to gather at designated points and to walk anti-clockwise , highlighting the party 's campaign slogan to " reverse the tide " - to turn back their political fortunes and that of their candidate , who has been trailing in opinion polls .
the party 's presidential candidate , frank hsieh , attacked his rival 's plan to establish a cross-strait common market with china , saying it could lead to job losses and other social problems .
he said he and his party stood for the protection of taiwan 's core values - which was important if the island was to avoid the fate of tibet , which had seen peaceful protests violently put down by the chinese military in recent days .
for its part , the opposition kmt , or kuomintang , held its own rallies in every city and county .
