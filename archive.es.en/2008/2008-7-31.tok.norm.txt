the move comes after the former economy and labor minister implicitly advised against voting for the spd in a key state key poll . the decision , the culmination of a dispute dating back to january , represents just one more problem for the party , which is currently trailing its conservative coalition partners in the polls by 13 percent with around 26 percent support . observers see it a sign of the developing battle between the party 's left and reformist wings . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : clement said the decision had come like a " bolt from the blue " clement angered spd members in january when he wrote a guest column for a conservative newspaper in which he queried the suitability of andrea ypsilanti for the premiership of hesse during a closely fought election campaign .
he warned that the hesse spd would " lurch to the left " under ypsilanti and attacked her energy policy after she opposed both nuclear and coal-fired power stations . " for this reason , consider carefully who should be trusted with responsibility for the state and vote carefully , " he wrote just a week before the jan .
27 state elections , in which the spd narrowly failed to oust the governing christian democrats . an attack on party solidarity an sdp arbitration committee in north rhine-westphalia , where clement was state premier before taking the economics and labor minister in the government of former chancellor gerhard schroeder , ruled that clement had undermined party solidarity . " he called on people not to vote for our party and that is damaging behavior , " a local spd leader in north rhine-westphalia , rudolf malzahn , told news channel n24 , defending the party 's decision .
" he said he would do it again anytime .
regardless of what title and rank a person has - rules are rules . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : nrw spd chairwoman hannelore kraft expressed " regret " north rhine-westphalia spd chairwoman hannelore kraft expressed " regret that things have come this far , " but others in the party said it was time for the former minister to go . some critics claimed that clement , who serves on the supervisory board of german energy giant rwe , had exposed himself as a cynical turncoat .
the former minister left politics to work in the power generation sector three years ago . the law office representing clement - run by otto schily , schroder 's former interior minister - released a statement thursday saying clement would appeal the party 's decision . the 68-year-old clement was a leading figure in the centrist branch of the party , serving as north rhine-westphalia state premier from 1998 to 2002 then as the " super-minister " for economy and labor under schroeder until 2005 . clement strongly backed gerhard schroeder 's disputed agenda 2010 economic and labor market reforms in the face of opposition from the left wing of the party .
since leaving office , clement frequently has criticized the spd 's moves to roll back that program . dw staff -lrb- jg -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" of course , it will take some months before the prosecution and defense will be ready to start , " he told reporters .

he opted to delay his plea for 30 days and announced he would conduct his own defense . karadzic , who was no longer sporting the beard and long hair that helped him conceal his identity for over a decade , waived his right to representation during the hearing on thursday , july 31 . when judge alphons orie noted that he was alone , the wartime leader smiled and responded , " i have an invisible adviser , but i have decided to defend myself . " orie , who said he expected the trial to last for many months , gave karadzic 30 days to decide a plea at the initial hour-long hearing of the international criminal tribunal for the former yugoslavia .
the trial was adjourned until aug .
29 . bildunterschrift : many observers were surprised at karadzic 's clean-cut appearance repeat performance ? karadzic said that - like his former ally - he intends to defend himself throughout the rest of the trial .
slobodan milosevic , who was accused of crimes against humanity for his role in the bosnian wars , used this as a delaying tactic to drag out his trial at the criminal tribunal in the hague for years , dying in 2006 before it ended . karadzic , who is the most prominent balkans war crimes suspect to be arrested after milosevic , said on thursday that he would also reveal " numerous irregularities " related to his presence at the hearing . " i will inform the court of the many mistakes and irregularities , like the mistaken date of my arrest , " the 63-year-old said . he claimed that under the dayton accord , which ended the bosnian war and brokered by former us assistant secretary of state richard holbrooke , an agreement was made that he would not be brought to trial if he withdrew from public life . orie interrupted the former bosnian serb leader when he tried to read a prepared four-page statement about this , and said he should send the information to the court in writing . chief prosecutor serge brammetz said lessons had been learned from the milosevic case . " of course , it will take some months before the prosecution and defense will be ready to start , " he told reporters .
" it will be a complex trial , but we are fully aware of the importance of being efficient . " some observers say he is likely to use the trial to illuminate claims that a shady deal with the west helped him avoid detention for so long . " this is a political man , a former poet , he likes being the center of attention , " international justice expert heikelina verrijn stuart told afp news agency . charges include siege and massacre atrocities bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : karadzic had posed for years as an alternative medicine practitioner during thursday 's hearing , orie read out the 11 war crimes charges that were first leveled against karadzic in 1995 .
the majority of the charges against karadzic focus on his role in the siege of sarajevo and the srebrenica massacre . some 8,000 muslim men and boys were killed in the un safe haven of srebrenica , while the siege of sarajevo , which lasted over three years , is estimated to have left some 10,000 people dead .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de aviation -pipe- 31.07.2008 lufthansa strike displays german thoroughness , expert says großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the price of the strike is n't yet high enough for lufthansa to give in on wage demands dw-world.de spoke with aviation expert cord schellenberg about the costs and effects of the strike at lufthansa , german organization and the demands on the table . dw-world.de : the trade union verdi has estimated that the strike is costing lufthansa about 5 million euros -lrb- $ 7.8 million -rrb- a day .
is this an accurate estimation in your opinion ? cord schellenberg : it 's one speculation .
it 's possible that the costs for lufthansa are even higher , depending on how much external equipment and personnel it has to buy in .
but the strike is definitely having an effect on lufthansa . first of all , they have to inform all of their passengers around the world that they have to rebook their flights .
at the same time , they also have to set up replacement flight routes , change the technical planning for the planes and rework the flight crew schedules . in terms of organization , it 's a lot of work for lufthansa .
it also means financial costs , but , at the moment , it appears that costs are still lower for lufthansa than if they accepted the employees ' current demands . will lufthansa lose customers over the long term due to the strike ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german even organize strikes well , schellenberg said i think that customer faithfulness is very high at lufthansa .
that 's true both of customers on discount flights that are glad to be flying on a premium airline and of those that pay full price . in the middle and long term , people will forget the whole thing pretty quickly - particularly because the typical german value of " thoroughness " is apparent in how well lufthansa has re-planned the flights .
i think people are impressed by that . in other countries , like italy for example , a strike always means chaos .
but here in germany , even the strike is organized .
the airline is able to manage and goes to great expense to make the effect on passengers as small as possible . however , the consequences in the freight division will be more strongly felt than on the passenger side , because the freight customers see that their shipments ca n't be sent .
on the other hand , the explanation is reasonable for everyone . so the strike could actually have a positive effect on lufthansa 's image ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the pilots have gotten first-class treatment in the past at least it could bring recognition from the passengers .
everyone knows that strikes are n't common in germany , but also that they ca n't be avoided .
however , most strikes are conducted in such a way that the company does n't have any chance to react .
in this case , i think both sides are very prudent , and that 's certainly something the passengers will recognize . it 's not good for lufthansa 's image - that would be going too far - but i think most people would say , wow , the germans can even organize a strike well . ticket prices are something that affects the passengers even more .
lufthansa , like every other airline , is hit hard by rising fuel prices as well as the emissions trading program that the eu has approved to start in 2012 .
can travelers expect higher ticket prices in the near future ? yes , that 's not dependent on the strike .
it 's just a realistic view of the developments in the global economy .
when the economy cools down , the movement of people and goods naturally does as well .
the increase in kerosene prices came at the same time . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : verdi is losing members personnel costs are a separate matter .
it 's a normal part of business that personnel costs increase .
the lufthansa employees say , " the company did well in the past few years .
now we want to earn more too . "
that 's something that happens every year or so when wage negotiations take place and it does n't have to mean higher costs for the passengers . however , i think 1 euro , 19 euro and 29 euro tickets are now a thing of the past .
they never really existed anyways , because they were more of a marketing gimmick . there is a large discrepancy between lufthansa 's offer and the pay increase demands the union is making .
are verdi 's demands reasonable ? in the past few years , verdi has been sensitive and made demands that were reasonable for the airline .
but they were continuously passed up by the pilots .

is this an accurate estimation in your opinion ? cord schellenberg : it 's one speculation .
it 's possible that the costs for lufthansa are even higher , depending on how much external equipment and personnel it has to buy in .
but the strike is definitely having an effect on lufthansa . first of all , they have to inform all of their passengers around the world that they have to rebook their flights .
at the same time , they also have to set up replacement flight routes , change the technical planning for the planes and rework the flight crew schedules . in terms of organization , it 's a lot of work for lufthansa .
it also means financial costs , but , at the moment , it appears that costs are still lower for lufthansa than if they accepted the employees ' current demands . will lufthansa lose customers over the long term due to the strike ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german even organize strikes well , schellenberg said i think that customer faithfulness is very high at lufthansa .
that 's true both of customers on discount flights that are glad to be flying on a premium airline and of those that pay full price . in the middle and long term , people will forget the whole thing pretty quickly - particularly because the typical german value of " thoroughness " is apparent in how well lufthansa has re-planned the flights .
i think people are impressed by that . in other countries , like italy for example , a strike always means chaos .
but here in germany , even the strike is organized .
the airline is able to manage and goes to great expense to make the effect on passengers as small as possible . however , the consequences in the freight division will be more strongly felt than on the passenger side , because the freight customers see that their shipments ca n't be sent .
on the other hand , the explanation is reasonable for everyone . so the strike could actually have a positive effect on lufthansa 's image ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the pilots have gotten first-class treatment in the past at least it could bring recognition from the passengers .
everyone knows that strikes are n't common in germany , but also that they ca n't be avoided .
however , most strikes are conducted in such a way that the company does n't have any chance to react .
in this case , i think both sides are very prudent , and that 's certainly something the passengers will recognize . it 's not good for lufthansa 's image - that would be going too far - but i think most people would say , wow , the germans can even organize a strike well . ticket prices are something that affects the passengers even more .
lufthansa , like every other airline , is hit hard by rising fuel prices as well as the emissions trading program that the eu has approved to start in 2012 .
can travelers expect higher ticket prices in the near future ? yes , that 's not dependent on the strike .
it 's just a realistic view of the developments in the global economy .
when the economy cools down , the movement of people and goods naturally does as well .
the increase in kerosene prices came at the same time . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : verdi is losing members personnel costs are a separate matter .
it 's a normal part of business that personnel costs increase .
the lufthansa employees say , " the company did well in the past few years .
now we want to earn more too . "
that 's something that happens every year or so when wage negotiations take place and it does n't have to mean higher costs for the passengers . however , i think 1 euro , 19 euro and 29 euro tickets are now a thing of the past .
they never really existed anyways , because they were more of a marketing gimmick . there is a large discrepancy between lufthansa 's offer and the pay increase demands the union is making .
are verdi 's demands reasonable ? in the past few years , verdi has been sensitive and made demands that were reasonable for the airline .
but they were continuously passed up by the pilots .
the pilots were in formula 1 , so to speak , and the others in formula 5 .
formula 1 is nice and the pilots always made use of it .
and verdi always responded reasonably , but now that approach is over . the airline should ask itself if it 's really healthy to give the pilots such a prominent position as a pressure group in wage negotiations and to tell the more expendable employees - check-in personnel , flight attendants and catering staff - that they do n't have such a prominent position . verdi is responsible for the technicians , which can also be a pressure group , especially if they 're highly qualified .

is this an accurate estimation in your opinion ? cord schellenberg : it 's one speculation .
it 's possible that the costs for lufthansa are even higher , depending on how much external equipment and personnel it has to buy in .
but the strike is definitely having an effect on lufthansa . first of all , they have to inform all of their passengers around the world that they have to rebook their flights .
at the same time , they also have to set up replacement flight routes , change the technical planning for the planes and rework the flight crew schedules . in terms of organization , it 's a lot of work for lufthansa .
it also means financial costs , but , at the moment , it appears that costs are still lower for lufthansa than if they accepted the employees ' current demands . will lufthansa lose customers over the long term due to the strike ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german even organize strikes well , schellenberg said i think that customer faithfulness is very high at lufthansa .
that 's true both of customers on discount flights that are glad to be flying on a premium airline and of those that pay full price . in the middle and long term , people will forget the whole thing pretty quickly - particularly because the typical german value of " thoroughness " is apparent in how well lufthansa has re-planned the flights .
i think people are impressed by that . in other countries , like italy for example , a strike always means chaos .
but here in germany , even the strike is organized .
the airline is able to manage and goes to great expense to make the effect on passengers as small as possible . however , the consequences in the freight division will be more strongly felt than on the passenger side , because the freight customers see that their shipments ca n't be sent .
on the other hand , the explanation is reasonable for everyone . so the strike could actually have a positive effect on lufthansa 's image ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the pilots have gotten first-class treatment in the past at least it could bring recognition from the passengers .
everyone knows that strikes are n't common in germany , but also that they ca n't be avoided .
however , most strikes are conducted in such a way that the company does n't have any chance to react .
in this case , i think both sides are very prudent , and that 's certainly something the passengers will recognize . it 's not good for lufthansa 's image - that would be going too far - but i think most people would say , wow , the germans can even organize a strike well . ticket prices are something that affects the passengers even more .
lufthansa , like every other airline , is hit hard by rising fuel prices as well as the emissions trading program that the eu has approved to start in 2012 .
can travelers expect higher ticket prices in the near future ? yes , that 's not dependent on the strike .
it 's just a realistic view of the developments in the global economy .
when the economy cools down , the movement of people and goods naturally does as well .
the increase in kerosene prices came at the same time . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : verdi is losing members personnel costs are a separate matter .
it 's a normal part of business that personnel costs increase .
the lufthansa employees say , " the company did well in the past few years .
now we want to earn more too . "
that 's something that happens every year or so when wage negotiations take place and it does n't have to mean higher costs for the passengers . however , i think 1 euro , 19 euro and 29 euro tickets are now a thing of the past .
they never really existed anyways , because they were more of a marketing gimmick . there is a large discrepancy between lufthansa 's offer and the pay increase demands the union is making .
are verdi 's demands reasonable ? in the past few years , verdi has been sensitive and made demands that were reasonable for the airline .
but they were continuously passed up by the pilots .
the pilots were in formula 1 , so to speak , and the others in formula 5 .
formula 1 is nice and the pilots always made use of it .
and verdi always responded reasonably , but now that approach is over . the airline should ask itself if it 's really healthy to give the pilots such a prominent position as a pressure group in wage negotiations and to tell the more expendable employees - check-in personnel , flight attendants and catering staff - that they do n't have such a prominent position . verdi is responsible for the technicians , which can also be a pressure group , especially if they 're highly qualified .
if they do n't do their job , the planes ca n't be approved for takeoff .
verdi knows this and is taking advantage of it . the flight attendant union that is in competition with verdi is demanding 15 percent in the wage negotiations .
that shows the high stakes involved .
verdi really wants to achieve something for its members and does n't want the flight attendants in its organization to switch over to the other union . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : there 's a strong tradition of compromise in germany , said schellenberg verdi has been particularly active in the past few months with a series of strikes .
have they been emboldened by recent successes ? verdi is a bit like the spd -lsb- social democratic party -rsb- in germany : they 're losing members .
while spd puts on a show all year , verdi is trying to nail down some successes and achieve something for its members . lufthansa has n't made a counteroffer but said it 's willing to negotiate and private , informal have taken place .
are they dealing with the strike in the best way ? as i said , the germans can organize a strike well , on both sides .
it 's also a tradition in germany to find a compromise . i think the population is relatively relaxed .
it 's different than it might be in the us , for example , because here people say , " they 'll come to an agreement . "
you ca n't prescribe how they reach an agreement , but in the end both sides will calculate the costs and decide when they have to compromise . interview : kate bowen send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

but with the rest of europe banking on nuclear , german scientists don ’ t want to miss out on future developments . german research minister annette schavan said this week she will increase funding for nuclear research .
her announcement may have come as a surprise to those who believe that more money to be spent on research in this field is bound to contradict an agreement to phase out nuclear energy in germany completely . the phase-out deal was struck by the former coalition government of social democrats and greens .
it is still binding for the ruling grand coalition of chancellor angela merkel . schavan , a member of merkel 's christian democratic union , says that allocating more resources to nuclear research does not really undermine the country 's ambition to survive without atomic power .
she claims that some 14 million euros -lrb- $ 22 million -rrb- annually will primarily be used to enhance nuclear safety , radiation protection and nuclear waste storage technologies . young scientists to benefit bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the last german nuclear power plants are supposed to shut down in 2020 the minister also made it clear that the allocated resources would likewise be used to enable young german scientists to keep abreast with the latest developments in nuclear research .
with the rest of europe and many other parts of the world currently rediscovering the benefits of nuclear energy , she argued , german scientists must not lose out because of domestic restrictions . " our scientists must stay in the top league , " schavan told the berliner zeitung newspaper .
" as long as everywhere around us new power plants are being built , we can not afford to just sit back and invest nothing in nuclear safety and radiation protection . " skeptics up in arms but critics of the minister 's financial offensive do n't trust her announcements completely .
some lawmakers , including social democrat research expert joerg tauss , are reported to have qualms about her plans .
they believe that a good proportion of the additional money earmarked for atomic research may well end up in projects facilitating the development of a fourth generation of nuclear power plants . " we 'll be watching very carefully whether the research minister will actually earmark resources for research on this new line of reactors , " tauss told the frankfurter rundschau daily .
" if she does , we 'll put up a good fight to prevent this from happening . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : buetikofer says that schavan 's plan is a waste of money germany 's greens party , which has always been the staunchest opponent of nuclear power in the country , views the minister 's plans with a good deal of unease and skepticism .
greens co-leader reinhard buetikofer said that it would be outrageous if even the slightest part of the extra money would go towards research on the new reactor line . " why should taxpayers ' money be misused for research on reactors , which will not be built in germany at all in line with the coalition treaty on the complete phase-out of nuclear energy here " , buetikofer told dw-world.de.

the museum aims to help visitors immerse themselves in the architecture , sounds and smells of the roman settlement . germanic and celtic barbarians , accustomed to living in squat log huts , must have gasped in amazement when they first caught sight of the towering town center of colonia ulpia traiana some 2,000 years ago . the museum evokes the lofty roman basilica , which served as a lobby for the baths .

soviet soldiers of the 40th army rolled into afghanistan in august 1978 , beginning a devastating nine-year war which bombed most of the central asian nation back into the dark ages . the invasion increased the tensions between the superpowers in a cold war which had already rumbled on for over 30 years . in an attempt to force the soviets to pull out of afghanistan , president jimmy carter issued an ultimatum that the united states would boycott the moscow games if soviet troops had not withdrawn from the country by 12:01 a.m.
eastern standard time on february 20 , 1980 .
after the deadline passed and the soviet-afghan war continued unabated , carter confirmed the boycott of the games on march 21 . athletes allowed to compete despite boycott the us was joined in its boycott by the likes of japan , west germany , china , the philippines and canada .
the united kingdom , france and greece supported the boycott but allowed their athletes to participate if they wished . the united kingdom and france sent a much smaller delegation of athletes than usual .
however , the uk delegation was the largest from western europe , with 170 athletes applying to compete . the nations that fully boycotted the games held their own event in the philippines . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the olympic flag was used more times than ever before those athletes attending from boycott nations were joined by those from fully participating countries in marching under the olympic flag , and not their own at the opening and closing ceremony in support of the games and not the political maneuvers that had drastically affected a number of events . during the closing ceremony , the traditional unfurling of the flag of the next olympic host nation , in this case the united states , was adapted .
instead of the stars and stripes , the flag of los angeles , the next host city , was used . the olympic anthem was also played at medal ceremonies in favor of the national anthems of winning athletes from boycott nations .
as a result , the olympic flag and anthem were used on a number of occasions . despite the disruptions to many events and the fact that only81 nations participated , more world records were set in moscow than in the previous games in montreal in 1976 . tit-for-tat boycott follows in la 1984 bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " to russia with love !

" what are viewers supposed to think if , say , a young german dropout compares scientology ’ s treatment to the practices in the third reich , " she said .
" i do n't think that young people are really being brought up in a spirit of tolerance , if they get to see such scenes without scientology having the chance to put things straight . "
lutheran bishop johannes friedrich had told dw-world.de on wednesday that the film was meant to give young people a chance to make up their own minds . " i hope that the film can go a long way towards enlightenment by showing honest portraits of protagonists from both sides of the fence , " he said . unfair treatment ? weber also said that she is upset about a film project by germany 's regional public television network swr , which announced plans earlier this year to shoot a movie about a young person who is desperately trying to leave scientology . " it surely wo n't be a documentary , " weber said .
" nobody has ever contacted us for assistance or at least information .
but since it 's fiction , almost every bad thing can be said in the film about scientology .
we will be left to deal with the consequences , though , and that 's unfair . " hardy graupner send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?
dw-world.de new german films aim to shed light on scientology film companies in germany are now making attempts to look behind what they believe is the true nature of scientology .

but the debate over whether scientology is a sect or a genuine religion is sure to continue .
-lrb- 12.02.2008 -rrb- germany 's interior ministers label scientology unconstitutional germany 's top security officials have deemed scientology unconstitutional and vowed to work toward banning the sect .

but with the rest of europe banking on nuclear , german scientists don ’ t want to miss out on future developments . german research minister annette schavan said this week she will increase funding for nuclear research .

it is still binding for the ruling grand coalition of chancellor angela merkel . schavan , a member of merkel 's christian democratic union , says that allocating more resources to nuclear research does not really undermine the country 's ambition to survive without atomic power .

soviet soldiers of the 40th army rolled into afghanistan in august 1978 , beginning a devastating nine-year war which bombed most of the central asian nation back into the dark ages . the invasion increased the tensions between the superpowers in a cold war which had already rumbled on for over 30 years . in an attempt to force the soviets to pull out of afghanistan , president jimmy carter issued an ultimatum that the united states would boycott the moscow games if soviet troops had not withdrawn from the country by 12:01 a.m.
eastern standard time on february 20 , 1980 .
after the deadline passed and the soviet-afghan war continued unabated , carter confirmed the boycott of the games on march 21 . athletes allowed to compete despite boycott the us was joined in its boycott by the likes of japan , west germany , china , the philippines and canada .
the united kingdom , france and greece supported the boycott but allowed their athletes to participate if they wished . the united kingdom and france sent a much smaller delegation of athletes than usual .
however , the uk delegation was the largest from western europe , with 170 athletes applying to compete . the nations that fully boycotted the games held their own event in the philippines . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the olympic flag was used more times than ever before those athletes attending from boycott nations were joined by those from fully participating countries in marching under the olympic flag , and not their own at the opening and closing ceremony in support of the games and not the political maneuvers that had drastically affected a number of events . during the closing ceremony , the traditional unfurling of the flag of the next olympic host nation , in this case the united states , was adapted .
instead of the stars and stripes , the flag of los angeles , the next host city , was used . the olympic anthem was also played at medal ceremonies in favor of the national anthems of winning athletes from boycott nations .
as a result , the olympic flag and anthem were used on a number of occasions . despite the disruptions to many events and the fact that only81 nations participated , more world records were set in moscow than in the previous games in montreal in 1976 . tit-for-tat boycott follows in la 1984 bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " to russia with love !
wish you were here " in what appeared to be a tit-for-tat boycott , the soviet union and 14 eastern bloc countries would boycott the 1984 olympic games in los angeles .
iran and libya also boycotted for different reasons than revenge for the moscow boycott . the soviets stated that their decision not to attend came from security concerns and " chauvinistic sentiments and an anti-soviet hysteria being whipped up in the united states . " just as the us-led boycott nations had done in 1980 , those refusing to take part in the 1984 games held their own . boycotting countries organized their own major events over july and august 1984 , called the friendship games which featured 50 nations and which took place in nine countries . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the nation-state has had its day , writes political scientist winfried boettcher .
he calls instead for a europe built along regional lines that would help meet people 's cultural and economic needs . winfried böttcher is an emeritus professor of politics at the rwth aachen university , specializing in european politics .
he is particularly interested in the concept of a federal europe . the approach towards unifying europe has not changed since the founding of the coal and steel community over 50 years ago .
the absence of long-term goals means that cooperation continues to function on a trial-and-error basis .
varying interests , needs , functions and tasks continue to search for adequate organizational forms . the talk is still about moving towards the ever closer integration of the peoples of europe .
even today , no one can bring themselves to say that europe is amalgamating .
people approach europe pragmatically without knowing what form it should ultimately assume .
no one asks how we would like to live in europe in the future .

unlike the existing functionalist concept , this idea is based on a clear integration approach .
according to johan galtung , this is a process in which two or more political protagonists come together to form a new protagonist .
correspondingly , europe could be united politically , judicially , economically and socially , while preserving its cultural plurality . this is conditional upon the relinquishing of national , power-oriented sovereignty and submitting to a common will .
the nation-state has fulfilled its historical function .

regional society , in the form of civil society , is responsible for making decisions that are politically necessary .
in the ideal scenario , every single inhabitant of a region is also an active politician , albeit on various levels . the theoretical superstructure of a europe of regions is manifested in the principle of reason of region , as a kind of socialized reason of state .
the reason of region means that a region determines its goals according to its own rules , on the basis of the structural principle of " subsidiarity " on a sub-national level , i.e. within the framework of a constitutional , federal european structure .
each region lives according to its own " reason , " deploying its own endogenous potential and taking into account its chief particularities in cultural , social and , to a large extent , political autonomy and self-realization . rethinking subsidiarity regionalism and subsidiarity are inherently interdependent .
however , in our understanding of subsidiarity we go far beyond what is stated in article five of the treaty of amsterdam .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de aviation -pipe- 31.07.2008 lufthansa strike displays german thoroughness , expert says großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the price of the strike is n't yet high enough for lufthansa to give in on wage demands dw-world.de spoke with aviation expert cord schellenberg about the costs and effects of the strike at lufthansa , german organization and the demands on the table . dw-world.de : the trade union verdi has estimated that the strike is costing lufthansa about 5 million euros -lrb- $ 7.8 million -rrb- a day .
is this an accurate estimation in your opinion ? cord schellenberg : it 's one speculation .
it 's possible that the costs for lufthansa are even higher , depending on how much external equipment and personnel it has to buy in .
but the strike is definitely having an effect on lufthansa . first of all , they have to inform all of their passengers around the world that they have to rebook their flights .
at the same time , they also have to set up replacement flight routes , change the technical planning for the planes and rework the flight crew schedules . in terms of organization , it 's a lot of work for lufthansa .
it also means financial costs , but , at the moment , it appears that costs are still lower for lufthansa than if they accepted the employees ' current demands . will lufthansa lose customers over the long term due to the strike ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german even organize strikes well , schellenberg said i think that customer faithfulness is very high at lufthansa .
that 's true both of customers on discount flights that are glad to be flying on a premium airline and of those that pay full price . in the middle and long term , people will forget the whole thing pretty quickly - particularly because the typical german value of " thoroughness " is apparent in how well lufthansa has re-planned the flights .
i think people are impressed by that . in other countries , like italy for example , a strike always means chaos .
but here in germany , even the strike is organized .
the airline is able to manage and goes to great expense to make the effect on passengers as small as possible . however , the consequences in the freight division will be more strongly felt than on the passenger side , because the freight customers see that their shipments ca n't be sent .
on the other hand , the explanation is reasonable for everyone . so the strike could actually have a positive effect on lufthansa 's image ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the pilots have gotten first-class treatment in the past at least it could bring recognition from the passengers .
everyone knows that strikes are n't common in germany , but also that they ca n't be avoided .
however , most strikes are conducted in such a way that the company does n't have any chance to react .
in this case , i think both sides are very prudent , and that 's certainly something the passengers will recognize . it 's not good for lufthansa 's image - that would be going too far - but i think most people would say , wow , the germans can even organize a strike well . ticket prices are something that affects the passengers even more .
lufthansa , like every other airline , is hit hard by rising fuel prices as well as the emissions trading program that the eu has approved to start in 2012 .
can travelers expect higher ticket prices in the near future ? yes , that 's not dependent on the strike .
it 's just a realistic view of the developments in the global economy .
when the economy cools down , the movement of people and goods naturally does as well .
the increase in kerosene prices came at the same time . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : verdi is losing members personnel costs are a separate matter .
it 's a normal part of business that personnel costs increase .
the lufthansa employees say , " the company did well in the past few years .
now we want to earn more too . "
that 's something that happens every year or so when wage negotiations take place and it does n't have to mean higher costs for the passengers . however , i think 1 euro , 19 euro and 29 euro tickets are now a thing of the past .
they never really existed anyways , because they were more of a marketing gimmick . there is a large discrepancy between lufthansa 's offer and the pay increase demands the union is making .
are verdi 's demands reasonable ? in the past few years , verdi has been sensitive and made demands that were reasonable for the airline .
but they were continuously passed up by the pilots .
the pilots were in formula 1 , so to speak , and the others in formula 5 .
formula 1 is nice and the pilots always made use of it .
and verdi always responded reasonably , but now that approach is over . the airline should ask itself if it 's really healthy to give the pilots such a prominent position as a pressure group in wage negotiations and to tell the more expendable employees - check-in personnel , flight attendants and catering staff - that they do n't have such a prominent position . verdi is responsible for the technicians , which can also be a pressure group , especially if they 're highly qualified .
if they do n't do their job , the planes ca n't be approved for takeoff .
verdi knows this and is taking advantage of it . the flight attendant union that is in competition with verdi is demanding 15 percent in the wage negotiations .
that shows the high stakes involved .
verdi really wants to achieve something for its members and does n't want the flight attendants in its organization to switch over to the other union . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : there 's a strong tradition of compromise in germany , said schellenberg verdi has been particularly active in the past few months with a series of strikes .
have they been emboldened by recent successes ? verdi is a bit like the spd -lsb- social democratic party -rsb- in germany : they 're losing members .
while spd puts on a show all year , verdi is trying to nail down some successes and achieve something for its members . lufthansa has n't made a counteroffer but said it 's willing to negotiate and private , informal have taken place .
are they dealing with the strike in the best way ? as i said , the germans can organize a strike well , on both sides .
it 's also a tradition in germany to find a compromise . i think the population is relatively relaxed .
it 's different than it might be in the us , for example , because here people say , " they 'll come to an agreement . "
you ca n't prescribe how they reach an agreement , but in the end both sides will calculate the costs and decide when they have to compromise . interview : kate bowen send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the jobless rate was up 0.2 percent to 7.7 percent . this was , however , 505,000 less than the numbers out of work in unadjusted terms in july last year , when the unemployment rate stood at 8.9 percent .
in seasonally adjusted terms , unemployment fell by 20,000 to 3.25 million .
the number of unemployed had been shrinking fast in recent months , falling below 8 percent in may for the first time in 16 years .
releasing the data , labour office chief frank-juergen weise said developments on the labour market remained positive despite signs that it was losing some of its momentum .
he said that employers ' demand for workers remained high .
but a steady stream of data and economic sentiment surveys have pointed to the nation 's economy losing steam amid fears that inflation has been picking up on the back of high food and energy costs .
minimal economic growth expected german business confidence dropped to near a three-year low in july , according to a key survey drawn up by the ifo institute for economic research and released this month .
" these results suggest the economic upswing is coming to an end , " said ifo chief hans-werner sinn , releasing the latest report .
while german exports recorded their biggest fall in about four years in may , factory orders fell for the sixth consecutive month in may and industrial production also dropped sharply .
this points to economic growth sliding during the second quarter after a strong start to the year .

the jobless rate was up 0.2 percent to 7.7 percent . this was , however , 505,000 less than the numbers out of work in unadjusted terms in july last year , when the unemployment rate stood at 8.9 percent .
in seasonally adjusted terms , unemployment fell by 20,000 to 3.25 million .
the number of unemployed had been shrinking fast in recent months , falling below 8 percent in may for the first time in 16 years .
releasing the data , labour office chief frank-juergen weise said developments on the labour market remained positive despite signs that it was losing some of its momentum .
he said that employers ' demand for workers remained high .
but a steady stream of data and economic sentiment surveys have pointed to the nation 's economy losing steam amid fears that inflation has been picking up on the back of high food and energy costs .
minimal economic growth expected german business confidence dropped to near a three-year low in july , according to a key survey drawn up by the ifo institute for economic research and released this month .
" these results suggest the economic upswing is coming to an end , " said ifo chief hans-werner sinn , releasing the latest report .
while german exports recorded their biggest fall in about four years in may , factory orders fell for the sixth consecutive month in may and industrial production also dropped sharply .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de aviation -pipe- 31.07.2008 lufthansa strike displays german thoroughness , expert says großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the price of the strike is n't yet high enough for lufthansa to give in on wage demands dw-world.de spoke with aviation expert cord schellenberg about the costs and effects of the strike at lufthansa , german organization and the demands on the table . dw-world.de : the trade union verdi has estimated that the strike is costing lufthansa about 5 million euros -lrb- $ 7.8 million -rrb- a day .
is this an accurate estimation in your opinion ? cord schellenberg : it 's one speculation .
it 's possible that the costs for lufthansa are even higher , depending on how much external equipment and personnel it has to buy in .
but the strike is definitely having an effect on lufthansa . first of all , they have to inform all of their passengers around the world that they have to rebook their flights .
at the same time , they also have to set up replacement flight routes , change the technical planning for the planes and rework the flight crew schedules . in terms of organization , it 's a lot of work for lufthansa .
it also means financial costs , but , at the moment , it appears that costs are still lower for lufthansa than if they accepted the employees ' current demands . will lufthansa lose customers over the long term due to the strike ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german even organize strikes well , schellenberg said i think that customer faithfulness is very high at lufthansa .
that 's true both of customers on discount flights that are glad to be flying on a premium airline and of those that pay full price . in the middle and long term , people will forget the whole thing pretty quickly - particularly because the typical german value of " thoroughness " is apparent in how well lufthansa has re-planned the flights .
i think people are impressed by that . in other countries , like italy for example , a strike always means chaos .
but here in germany , even the strike is organized .
the airline is able to manage and goes to great expense to make the effect on passengers as small as possible . however , the consequences in the freight division will be more strongly felt than on the passenger side , because the freight customers see that their shipments ca n't be sent .
on the other hand , the explanation is reasonable for everyone . so the strike could actually have a positive effect on lufthansa 's image ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the pilots have gotten first-class treatment in the past at least it could bring recognition from the passengers .
everyone knows that strikes are n't common in germany , but also that they ca n't be avoided .
however , most strikes are conducted in such a way that the company does n't have any chance to react .
in this case , i think both sides are very prudent , and that 's certainly something the passengers will recognize . it 's not good for lufthansa 's image - that would be going too far - but i think most people would say , wow , the germans can even organize a strike well . ticket prices are something that affects the passengers even more .
lufthansa , like every other airline , is hit hard by rising fuel prices as well as the emissions trading program that the eu has approved to start in 2012 .
can travelers expect higher ticket prices in the near future ? yes , that 's not dependent on the strike .
it 's just a realistic view of the developments in the global economy .
when the economy cools down , the movement of people and goods naturally does as well .
the increase in kerosene prices came at the same time . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : verdi is losing members personnel costs are a separate matter .
it 's a normal part of business that personnel costs increase .
the lufthansa employees say , " the company did well in the past few years .
now we want to earn more too . "
that 's something that happens every year or so when wage negotiations take place and it does n't have to mean higher costs for the passengers . however , i think 1 euro , 19 euro and 29 euro tickets are now a thing of the past .
they never really existed anyways , because they were more of a marketing gimmick . there is a large discrepancy between lufthansa 's offer and the pay increase demands the union is making .
are verdi 's demands reasonable ? in the past few years , verdi has been sensitive and made demands that were reasonable for the airline .
but they were continuously passed up by the pilots .
the pilots were in formula 1 , so to speak , and the others in formula 5 .
formula 1 is nice and the pilots always made use of it .
and verdi always responded reasonably , but now that approach is over . the airline should ask itself if it 's really healthy to give the pilots such a prominent position as a pressure group in wage negotiations and to tell the more expendable employees - check-in personnel , flight attendants and catering staff - that they do n't have such a prominent position . verdi is responsible for the technicians , which can also be a pressure group , especially if they 're highly qualified .
if they do n't do their job , the planes ca n't be approved for takeoff .
verdi knows this and is taking advantage of it . the flight attendant union that is in competition with verdi is demanding 15 percent in the wage negotiations .
that shows the high stakes involved .
verdi really wants to achieve something for its members and does n't want the flight attendants in its organization to switch over to the other union . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : there 's a strong tradition of compromise in germany , said schellenberg verdi has been particularly active in the past few months with a series of strikes .
have they been emboldened by recent successes ? verdi is a bit like the spd -lsb- social democratic party -rsb- in germany : they 're losing members .
while spd puts on a show all year , verdi is trying to nail down some successes and achieve something for its members . lufthansa has n't made a counteroffer but said it 's willing to negotiate and private , informal have taken place .
are they dealing with the strike in the best way ? as i said , the germans can organize a strike well , on both sides .
it 's also a tradition in germany to find a compromise . i think the population is relatively relaxed .
it 's different than it might be in the us , for example , because here people say , " they 'll come to an agreement . "
you ca n't prescribe how they reach an agreement , but in the end both sides will calculate the costs and decide when they have to compromise . interview : kate bowen send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the move comes after the former economy and labor minister implicitly advised against voting for the spd in a key state key poll . the decision , the culmination of a dispute dating back to january , represents just one more problem for the party , which is currently trailing its conservative coalition partners in the polls by 13 percent with around 26 percent support . observers see it a sign of the developing battle between the party 's left and reformist wings . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : clement said the decision had come like a " bolt from the blue " clement angered spd members in january when he wrote a guest column for a conservative newspaper in which he queried the suitability of andrea ypsilanti for the premiership of hesse during a closely fought election campaign .
he warned that the hesse spd would " lurch to the left " under ypsilanti and attacked her energy policy after she opposed both nuclear and coal-fired power stations . " for this reason , consider carefully who should be trusted with responsibility for the state and vote carefully , " he wrote just a week before the jan .
27 state elections , in which the spd narrowly failed to oust the governing christian democrats . an attack on party solidarity an sdp arbitration committee in north rhine-westphalia , where clement was state premier before taking the economics and labor minister in the government of former chancellor gerhard schroeder , ruled that clement had undermined party solidarity . " he called on people not to vote for our party and that is damaging behavior , " a local spd leader in north rhine-westphalia , rudolf malzahn , told news channel n24 , defending the party 's decision .
" he said he would do it again anytime .

the museum aims to help visitors immerse themselves in the architecture , sounds and smells of the roman settlement . germanic and celtic barbarians , accustomed to living in squat log huts , must have gasped in amazement when they first caught sight of the towering town center of colonia ulpia traiana some 2,000 years ago . the museum evokes the lofty roman basilica , which served as a lobby for the baths .
the 24-meter -lrb- 79-foot -rrb- building was the height of a modern-day , eight-story apartment and had a gabled roof topped off with red roman tiles . built to scale bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : visitors might feel like they 've entered a time warp to help visitors understand the massive scale of the buildings , architects built steel-framed buildings the same size as the originals on the site of the old bathhouse and ancillary structures .
its height was calculated from the dimensions of its foundations . the new museum , part of the archaeological park at xanten -lrb- apx -rrb- , aims to offer the modern visitor a fresh perspective on roman civilization .
it 's out-of-the-way location means that the museum does not fight for space with a bustling modern city like the many archaeological remains that can be found in german cities such as trier , mainz , cologne and bonn . inside , visitors can see all the oddities that have been excavated from the site in the rhine valley , ranging from the waste heap of a workshop that used to make clay lamps to the gravestones of important citizens and the remains of a roman river barge hung in mid-air . getting a feel for the times bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the museum incorporates numerous archaeological finds the 22.5 million euro -lrb- $ 35 million -rrb- museum is set to open on aug .
16 , an apx spokesman told dpa news agency . the designers wanted visitors to understand the smells and sights of ancient rome .
there are boxes where visitors can feel the ruins ' broken roof tiles or smell typical roman spices . " our museum is not there to show which archaeologists dug up the most , " hans-joachim schalles , director of the museum , told dpa .
" it 's there so ordinary people can see what a roman town was like . " visitors can walk on a glass floor over a lane with the deep wheel-ruts of roman carts in it and the footprints of children 's bare feet and the hob-nailed boots of roman soldiers , all preserved for nearly 20 centuries in the mud . the museum 's 2,500 items show how an earlier germanic village was converted into a rich city of the roman empire , decorated with murals in the style of pompeii and with expensive glassware on the tables and was then conquered by frankish tribes . excavation continues at site bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : archaeologists have made many important finds in xanten the biggest item in the new museum building is a barge , the smallest the bones of a roman lapdog .
next door are the remains of the baths , which are protected from rain and snow by sheds which allow the outside air to circulate . experience has shown this is the best way to stop the remains from either completely drying out or becoming moldy from the dampness . finds such as a german silver hairpin suggest that the colonia was an ethnically mixed place , with celts and germans living among the romans and praying to their own gods . the legions of caesar augustus brought this region under roman control and a collection of their rough helmets is also in the museum .
concealed loudspeakers emit chatter in latin and other ancient tongues , as might have been heard on the town marketplace . around the year 100 of the common era , the roman emperor trajan funded its expansion into a city of about 10,000 bearing his name . thereafter it was a major city of the northern empire . most of the ruins slumber on undisturbed under the green grass of the apx .
archaeologists are likely to be burrowing and mapping the ancient town for many years to come .
local authorities hope to eventually expand the park to 73 hectares -lrb- 180 acres -rrb- to embrace the entire site . dw staff -lrb- th -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

but with the rest of europe banking on nuclear , german scientists don ’ t want to miss out on future developments . german research minister annette schavan said this week she will increase funding for nuclear research .
her announcement may have come as a surprise to those who believe that more money to be spent on research in this field is bound to contradict an agreement to phase out nuclear energy in germany completely . the phase-out deal was struck by the former coalition government of social democrats and greens .
it is still binding for the ruling grand coalition of chancellor angela merkel . schavan , a member of merkel 's christian democratic union , says that allocating more resources to nuclear research does not really undermine the country 's ambition to survive without atomic power .

some lawmakers , including social democrat research expert joerg tauss , are reported to have qualms about her plans .
they believe that a good proportion of the additional money earmarked for atomic research may well end up in projects facilitating the development of a fourth generation of nuclear power plants . " we 'll be watching very carefully whether the research minister will actually earmark resources for research on this new line of reactors , " tauss told the frankfurter rundschau daily .
" if she does , we 'll put up a good fight to prevent this from happening . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : buetikofer says that schavan 's plan is a waste of money germany 's greens party , which has always been the staunchest opponent of nuclear power in the country , views the minister 's plans with a good deal of unease and skepticism .
greens co-leader reinhard buetikofer said that it would be outrageous if even the slightest part of the extra money would go towards research on the new reactor line . " why should taxpayers ' money be misused for research on reactors , which will not be built in germany at all in line with the coalition treaty on the complete phase-out of nuclear energy here " , buetikofer told dw-world.de.

the jobless rate was up 0.2 percent to 7.7 percent . this was , however , 505,000 less than the numbers out of work in unadjusted terms in july last year , when the unemployment rate stood at 8.9 percent .
in seasonally adjusted terms , unemployment fell by 20,000 to 3.25 million .
the number of unemployed had been shrinking fast in recent months , falling below 8 percent in may for the first time in 16 years .
releasing the data , labour office chief frank-juergen weise said developments on the labour market remained positive despite signs that it was losing some of its momentum .
he said that employers ' demand for workers remained high .
but a steady stream of data and economic sentiment surveys have pointed to the nation 's economy losing steam amid fears that inflation has been picking up on the back of high food and energy costs .
minimal economic growth expected german business confidence dropped to near a three-year low in july , according to a key survey drawn up by the ifo institute for economic research and released this month .
" these results suggest the economic upswing is coming to an end , " said ifo chief hans-werner sinn , releasing the latest report .
while german exports recorded their biggest fall in about four years in may , factory orders fell for the sixth consecutive month in may and industrial production also dropped sharply .
this points to economic growth sliding during the second quarter after a strong start to the year .
the most pessimistic forecasts are for german economic growth to slow to 0.7 percent during the three months to the end of june . dpa news agency -lrb- th -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the move comes after the former economy and labor minister implicitly advised against voting for the spd in a key state key poll . the decision , the culmination of a dispute dating back to january , represents just one more problem for the party , which is currently trailing its conservative coalition partners in the polls by 13 percent with around 26 percent support . observers see it a sign of the developing battle between the party 's left and reformist wings . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : clement said the decision had come like a " bolt from the blue " clement angered spd members in january when he wrote a guest column for a conservative newspaper in which he queried the suitability of andrea ypsilanti for the premiership of hesse during a closely fought election campaign .
he warned that the hesse spd would " lurch to the left " under ypsilanti and attacked her energy policy after she opposed both nuclear and coal-fired power stations . " for this reason , consider carefully who should be trusted with responsibility for the state and vote carefully , " he wrote just a week before the jan .
27 state elections , in which the spd narrowly failed to oust the governing christian democrats . an attack on party solidarity an sdp arbitration committee in north rhine-westphalia , where clement was state premier before taking the economics and labor minister in the government of former chancellor gerhard schroeder , ruled that clement had undermined party solidarity . " he called on people not to vote for our party and that is damaging behavior , " a local spd leader in north rhine-westphalia , rudolf malzahn , told news channel n24 , defending the party 's decision .
" he said he would do it again anytime .
regardless of what title and rank a person has - rules are rules . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : nrw spd chairwoman hannelore kraft expressed " regret " north rhine-westphalia spd chairwoman hannelore kraft expressed " regret that things have come this far , " but others in the party said it was time for the former minister to go . some critics claimed that clement , who serves on the supervisory board of german energy giant rwe , had exposed himself as a cynical turncoat .
the former minister left politics to work in the power generation sector three years ago . the law office representing clement - run by otto schily , schroder 's former interior minister - released a statement thursday saying clement would appeal the party 's decision . the 68-year-old clement was a leading figure in the centrist branch of the party , serving as north rhine-westphalia state premier from 1998 to 2002 then as the " super-minister " for economy and labor under schroeder until 2005 . clement strongly backed gerhard schroeder 's disputed agenda 2010 economic and labor market reforms in the face of opposition from the left wing of the party .
since leaving office , clement frequently has criticized the spd 's moves to roll back that program . dw staff -lrb- jg -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the theory of sovereignty - which is connected to state and the good of the state and which separates politics and morality and gives absolute primacy to the goals of the state - is no longer viable .
the citizen is the central democratic figure in our counter model , which is based on a concept of a europe of the regions . democracy brought closer to home bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : regionalism could offer a way out of the current impasse humans , as supranational beings , are politically active in their own regions where they are directly affected by political decisions .
regional society , in the form of civil society , is responsible for making decisions that are politically necessary .
in the ideal scenario , every single inhabitant of a region is also an active politician , albeit on various levels . the theoretical superstructure of a europe of regions is manifested in the principle of reason of region , as a kind of socialized reason of state .
the reason of region means that a region determines its goals according to its own rules , on the basis of the structural principle of " subsidiarity " on a sub-national level , i.e. within the framework of a constitutional , federal european structure .
each region lives according to its own " reason , " deploying its own endogenous potential and taking into account its chief particularities in cultural , social and , to a large extent , political autonomy and self-realization . rethinking subsidiarity regionalism and subsidiarity are inherently interdependent .
however , in our understanding of subsidiarity we go far beyond what is stated in article five of the treaty of amsterdam .
we define subsidiarity as " actively supporting a nation-state or the european union , to develop local and regional subsystems so that democratic participation is improved , even if this means accepting a loss of power at the other levels . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : regional peculiarities will be championed in a federal europe if the principle of subsidiarity is understood in this way , it supports and strengthens an autonomous , lively regionalism .
by this , we understand something that is close to people 's everyday lives and is able to solve the problems that arise , if possible with the united and democratic participation of everyone involved .
the attempt to build a europe imposed from above is susceptible to crisis .
as the eu continues to expand , it will become increasingly vulnerable .
europe 's chances come from below , if it helps to meet people 's educational , cultural , leisure and welfare needs and if " normal " employees get the feeling that they would be worse off without the european union . breaking open encrusted power structures to sum up : the future of the european union can only survive both domestically and internationally , if the bloc develops a constitution that aims to set up a regional , federal system .
the structural principle of subsidiarity will break open encrusted power structures and lead to an efficient overhaul of existing power structures .
the focus will be on living democracy .
it will be tangible and close to the people .
as a result , it will be possible to develop adequate strategies for shaping our own european future and lending a european dimension to the future shape of the world . winfried boettcher -lrb- jg -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de aviation -pipe- 31.07.2008 lufthansa strike displays german thoroughness , expert says großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the price of the strike is n't yet high enough for lufthansa to give in on wage demands dw-world.de spoke with aviation expert cord schellenberg about the costs and effects of the strike at lufthansa , german organization and the demands on the table . dw-world.de : the trade union verdi has estimated that the strike is costing lufthansa about 5 million euros -lrb- $ 7.8 million -rrb- a day .
is this an accurate estimation in your opinion ? cord schellenberg : it 's one speculation .
it 's possible that the costs for lufthansa are even higher , depending on how much external equipment and personnel it has to buy in .
but the strike is definitely having an effect on lufthansa . first of all , they have to inform all of their passengers around the world that they have to rebook their flights .
at the same time , they also have to set up replacement flight routes , change the technical planning for the planes and rework the flight crew schedules . in terms of organization , it 's a lot of work for lufthansa .
it also means financial costs , but , at the moment , it appears that costs are still lower for lufthansa than if they accepted the employees ' current demands . will lufthansa lose customers over the long term due to the strike ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german even organize strikes well , schellenberg said i think that customer faithfulness is very high at lufthansa .
that 's true both of customers on discount flights that are glad to be flying on a premium airline and of those that pay full price . in the middle and long term , people will forget the whole thing pretty quickly - particularly because the typical german value of " thoroughness " is apparent in how well lufthansa has re-planned the flights .
i think people are impressed by that . in other countries , like italy for example , a strike always means chaos .
but here in germany , even the strike is organized .
the airline is able to manage and goes to great expense to make the effect on passengers as small as possible . however , the consequences in the freight division will be more strongly felt than on the passenger side , because the freight customers see that their shipments ca n't be sent .
on the other hand , the explanation is reasonable for everyone . so the strike could actually have a positive effect on lufthansa 's image ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the pilots have gotten first-class treatment in the past at least it could bring recognition from the passengers .
everyone knows that strikes are n't common in germany , but also that they ca n't be avoided .
however , most strikes are conducted in such a way that the company does n't have any chance to react .
in this case , i think both sides are very prudent , and that 's certainly something the passengers will recognize . it 's not good for lufthansa 's image - that would be going too far - but i think most people would say , wow , the germans can even organize a strike well . ticket prices are something that affects the passengers even more .
lufthansa , like every other airline , is hit hard by rising fuel prices as well as the emissions trading program that the eu has approved to start in 2012 .
can travelers expect higher ticket prices in the near future ? yes , that 's not dependent on the strike .
it 's just a realistic view of the developments in the global economy .
when the economy cools down , the movement of people and goods naturally does as well .
the increase in kerosene prices came at the same time . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : verdi is losing members personnel costs are a separate matter .
it 's a normal part of business that personnel costs increase .
the lufthansa employees say , " the company did well in the past few years .
now we want to earn more too . "
that 's something that happens every year or so when wage negotiations take place and it does n't have to mean higher costs for the passengers . however , i think 1 euro , 19 euro and 29 euro tickets are now a thing of the past .
they never really existed anyways , because they were more of a marketing gimmick . there is a large discrepancy between lufthansa 's offer and the pay increase demands the union is making .
are verdi 's demands reasonable ? in the past few years , verdi has been sensitive and made demands that were reasonable for the airline .
but they were continuously passed up by the pilots .
the pilots were in formula 1 , so to speak , and the others in formula 5 .
formula 1 is nice and the pilots always made use of it .
and verdi always responded reasonably , but now that approach is over . the airline should ask itself if it 's really healthy to give the pilots such a prominent position as a pressure group in wage negotiations and to tell the more expendable employees - check-in personnel , flight attendants and catering staff - that they do n't have such a prominent position . verdi is responsible for the technicians , which can also be a pressure group , especially if they 're highly qualified .
if they do n't do their job , the planes ca n't be approved for takeoff .
verdi knows this and is taking advantage of it . the flight attendant union that is in competition with verdi is demanding 15 percent in the wage negotiations .
that shows the high stakes involved .
verdi really wants to achieve something for its members and does n't want the flight attendants in its organization to switch over to the other union . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : there 's a strong tradition of compromise in germany , said schellenberg verdi has been particularly active in the past few months with a series of strikes .
have they been emboldened by recent successes ? verdi is a bit like the spd -lsb- social democratic party -rsb- in germany : they 're losing members .
while spd puts on a show all year , verdi is trying to nail down some successes and achieve something for its members . lufthansa has n't made a counteroffer but said it 's willing to negotiate and private , informal have taken place .
are they dealing with the strike in the best way ? as i said , the germans can organize a strike well , on both sides .
it 's also a tradition in germany to find a compromise . i think the population is relatively relaxed .
it 's different than it might be in the us , for example , because here people say , " they 'll come to an agreement . "
you ca n't prescribe how they reach an agreement , but in the end both sides will calculate the costs and decide when they have to compromise . interview : kate bowen send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

he opted to delay his plea for 30 days and announced he would conduct his own defense . karadzic , who was no longer sporting the beard and long hair that helped him conceal his identity for over a decade , waived his right to representation during the hearing on thursday , july 31 . when judge alphons orie noted that he was alone , the wartime leader smiled and responded , " i have an invisible adviser , but i have decided to defend myself .

the museum aims to help visitors immerse themselves in the architecture , sounds and smells of the roman settlement . germanic and celtic barbarians , accustomed to living in squat log huts , must have gasped in amazement when they first caught sight of the towering town center of colonia ulpia traiana some 2,000 years ago . the museum evokes the lofty roman basilica , which served as a lobby for the baths .
the 24-meter -lrb- 79-foot -rrb- building was the height of a modern-day , eight-story apartment and had a gabled roof topped off with red roman tiles . built to scale bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : visitors might feel like they 've entered a time warp to help visitors understand the massive scale of the buildings , architects built steel-framed buildings the same size as the originals on the site of the old bathhouse and ancillary structures .
its height was calculated from the dimensions of its foundations . the new museum , part of the archaeological park at xanten -lrb- apx -rrb- , aims to offer the modern visitor a fresh perspective on roman civilization .
it 's out-of-the-way location means that the museum does not fight for space with a bustling modern city like the many archaeological remains that can be found in german cities such as trier , mainz , cologne and bonn . inside , visitors can see all the oddities that have been excavated from the site in the rhine valley , ranging from the waste heap of a workshop that used to make clay lamps to the gravestones of important citizens and the remains of a roman river barge hung in mid-air . getting a feel for the times bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the museum incorporates numerous archaeological finds the 22.5 million euro -lrb- $ 35 million -rrb- museum is set to open on aug .
16 , an apx spokesman told dpa news agency . the designers wanted visitors to understand the smells and sights of ancient rome .
there are boxes where visitors can feel the ruins ' broken roof tiles or smell typical roman spices . " our museum is not there to show which archaeologists dug up the most , " hans-joachim schalles , director of the museum , told dpa .
" it 's there so ordinary people can see what a roman town was like . " visitors can walk on a glass floor over a lane with the deep wheel-ruts of roman carts in it and the footprints of children 's bare feet and the hob-nailed boots of roman soldiers , all preserved for nearly 20 centuries in the mud . the museum 's 2,500 items show how an earlier germanic village was converted into a rich city of the roman empire , decorated with murals in the style of pompeii and with expensive glassware on the tables and was then conquered by frankish tribes . excavation continues at site bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : archaeologists have made many important finds in xanten the biggest item in the new museum building is a barge , the smallest the bones of a roman lapdog .
next door are the remains of the baths , which are protected from rain and snow by sheds which allow the outside air to circulate . experience has shown this is the best way to stop the remains from either completely drying out or becoming moldy from the dampness . finds such as a german silver hairpin suggest that the colonia was an ethnically mixed place , with celts and germans living among the romans and praying to their own gods . the legions of caesar augustus brought this region under roman control and a collection of their rough helmets is also in the museum .
concealed loudspeakers emit chatter in latin and other ancient tongues , as might have been heard on the town marketplace . around the year 100 of the common era , the roman emperor trajan funded its expansion into a city of about 10,000 bearing his name . thereafter it was a major city of the northern empire . most of the ruins slumber on undisturbed under the green grass of the apx .
archaeologists are likely to be burrowing and mapping the ancient town for many years to come .
local authorities hope to eventually expand the park to 73 hectares -lrb- 180 acres -rrb- to embrace the entire site . dw staff -lrb- th -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the nation-state has had its day , writes political scientist winfried boettcher .
he calls instead for a europe built along regional lines that would help meet people 's cultural and economic needs . winfried böttcher is an emeritus professor of politics at the rwth aachen university , specializing in european politics .
he is particularly interested in the concept of a federal europe . the approach towards unifying europe has not changed since the founding of the coal and steel community over 50 years ago .
the absence of long-term goals means that cooperation continues to function on a trial-and-error basis .
varying interests , needs , functions and tasks continue to search for adequate organizational forms . the talk is still about moving towards the ever closer integration of the peoples of europe .
even today , no one can bring themselves to say that europe is amalgamating .
people approach europe pragmatically without knowing what form it should ultimately assume .
no one asks how we would like to live in europe in the future .
the nation-states , as the enablers of so-called european integration , prefer this functionalist method if only because it secures them the largest entitlements in terms of sovereignty . the future is federal bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : boettcher believes europe 's survival depends on subsidiarity by contrast , i believe that europe will only have a future if a federal concept places the normative question at the center of the debate .
unlike the existing functionalist concept , this idea is based on a clear integration approach .
according to johan galtung , this is a process in which two or more political protagonists come together to form a new protagonist .
correspondingly , europe could be united politically , judicially , economically and socially , while preserving its cultural plurality . this is conditional upon the relinquishing of national , power-oriented sovereignty and submitting to a common will .
the nation-state has fulfilled its historical function .
nowadays , it is one of the major troublemakers in the european integration process .
the theory of sovereignty - which is connected to state and the good of the state and which separates politics and morality and gives absolute primacy to the goals of the state - is no longer viable .
the citizen is the central democratic figure in our counter model , which is based on a concept of a europe of the regions . democracy brought closer to home bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : regionalism could offer a way out of the current impasse humans , as supranational beings , are politically active in their own regions where they are directly affected by political decisions .
regional society , in the form of civil society , is responsible for making decisions that are politically necessary .
in the ideal scenario , every single inhabitant of a region is also an active politician , albeit on various levels . the theoretical superstructure of a europe of regions is manifested in the principle of reason of region , as a kind of socialized reason of state .
the reason of region means that a region determines its goals according to its own rules , on the basis of the structural principle of " subsidiarity " on a sub-national level , i.e. within the framework of a constitutional , federal european structure .
each region lives according to its own " reason , " deploying its own endogenous potential and taking into account its chief particularities in cultural , social and , to a large extent , political autonomy and self-realization . rethinking subsidiarity regionalism and subsidiarity are inherently interdependent .
however , in our understanding of subsidiarity we go far beyond what is stated in article five of the treaty of amsterdam .
we define subsidiarity as " actively supporting a nation-state or the european union , to develop local and regional subsystems so that democratic participation is improved , even if this means accepting a loss of power at the other levels . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : regional peculiarities will be championed in a federal europe if the principle of subsidiarity is understood in this way , it supports and strengthens an autonomous , lively regionalism .
by this , we understand something that is close to people 's everyday lives and is able to solve the problems that arise , if possible with the united and democratic participation of everyone involved .
the attempt to build a europe imposed from above is susceptible to crisis .
as the eu continues to expand , it will become increasingly vulnerable .
europe 's chances come from below , if it helps to meet people 's educational , cultural , leisure and welfare needs and if " normal " employees get the feeling that they would be worse off without the european union . breaking open encrusted power structures to sum up : the future of the european union can only survive both domestically and internationally , if the bloc develops a constitution that aims to set up a regional , federal system .
the structural principle of subsidiarity will break open encrusted power structures and lead to an efficient overhaul of existing power structures .
the focus will be on living democracy .
it will be tangible and close to the people .
as a result , it will be possible to develop adequate strategies for shaping our own european future and lending a european dimension to the future shape of the world . winfried boettcher -lrb- jg -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" the ministry will talk to the highest officials within the german government to obtain clarification and express its concern over the fact that the german office of export controls gave its green light to the contract , " foreign ministry spokesman arye mekel told the afp news agency .
" the fact that germany , a member of the european group eu3 , which includes france , britain and germany , is adopting a position that harms international efforts to considerably toughen sanctions against iran over its continued nuclear program , is worrying , " the ministry said in a statement . but the german economics ministry said in a statement that the liquefied natural gas plants did not fall under any category of goods banned under the sanctions , adding that there was no legal means for preventing the transaction . goods " not of controversial nature " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : tehran is accused of using its nuclear energy program as a cover to build nuclear weapons the german export control office described the rift as a " misunderstanding . "
spokesman holger beutel said the 100 million euro -lrb- $ 156 million -rrb- deal between the german engineering firm steiner prematechnik gastec and iran was " for the export of goods that are not of a controversial nature . " the three systems are to cool and compress natural gas into liquid form so it can be transported by ship to export customers . this week the simon wiesenthal centre appealed to berlin to prohibit the deal .
jewish groups have criticized the contract , charging that germany is fostering economic relations with iran despite that nation 's nuclear program and its threats toward israel . germany is one of iran 's leading trading partners .
last year , german exports to the country totaled some 3.6 billion euros . berlin has , however , reduced export guarantees with iran , and german banks have largely ceased doing business with the islamic republic due to its nuclear program .
tehran insists its nuclear activities are non-military , but the west , including the united states many european union nations , fears iran is covertly trying to build nuclear weapons . germany is one of six states leading international efforts to thwart iranian nuclear ambitions .

" orie , who said he expected the trial to last for many months , gave karadzic 30 days to decide a plea at the initial hour-long hearing of the international criminal tribunal for the former yugoslavia .
the trial was adjourned until aug .
29 . bildunterschrift : many observers were surprised at karadzic 's clean-cut appearance repeat performance ? karadzic said that - like his former ally - he intends to defend himself throughout the rest of the trial .
slobodan milosevic , who was accused of crimes against humanity for his role in the bosnian wars , used this as a delaying tactic to drag out his trial at the criminal tribunal in the hague for years , dying in 2006 before it ended . karadzic , who is the most prominent balkans war crimes suspect to be arrested after milosevic , said on thursday that he would also reveal " numerous irregularities " related to his presence at the hearing . " i will inform the court of the many mistakes and irregularities , like the mistaken date of my arrest , " the 63-year-old said . he claimed that under the dayton accord , which ended the bosnian war and brokered by former us assistant secretary of state richard holbrooke , an agreement was made that he would not be brought to trial if he withdrew from public life . orie interrupted the former bosnian serb leader when he tried to read a prepared four-page statement about this , and said he should send the information to the court in writing . chief prosecutor serge brammetz said lessons had been learned from the milosevic case . " of course , it will take some months before the prosecution and defense will be ready to start , " he told reporters .
" it will be a complex trial , but we are fully aware of the importance of being efficient . " some observers say he is likely to use the trial to illuminate claims that a shady deal with the west helped him avoid detention for so long . " this is a political man , a former poet , he likes being the center of attention , " international justice expert heikelina verrijn stuart told afp news agency . charges include siege and massacre atrocities bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : karadzic had posed for years as an alternative medicine practitioner during thursday 's hearing , orie read out the 11 war crimes charges that were first leveled against karadzic in 1995 .
the majority of the charges against karadzic focus on his role in the siege of sarajevo and the srebrenica massacre . some 8,000 muslim men and boys were killed in the un safe haven of srebrenica , while the siege of sarajevo , which lasted over three years , is estimated to have left some 10,000 people dead .
if convicted of the crimes , karadzic faces life imprisonment . dw staff -lrb- jg -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the museum aims to help visitors immerse themselves in the architecture , sounds and smells of the roman settlement . germanic and celtic barbarians , accustomed to living in squat log huts , must have gasped in amazement when they first caught sight of the towering town center of colonia ulpia traiana some 2,000 years ago . the museum evokes the lofty roman basilica , which served as a lobby for the baths .
the 24-meter -lrb- 79-foot -rrb- building was the height of a modern-day , eight-story apartment and had a gabled roof topped off with red roman tiles . built to scale bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : visitors might feel like they 've entered a time warp to help visitors understand the massive scale of the buildings , architects built steel-framed buildings the same size as the originals on the site of the old bathhouse and ancillary structures .
its height was calculated from the dimensions of its foundations . the new museum , part of the archaeological park at xanten -lrb- apx -rrb- , aims to offer the modern visitor a fresh perspective on roman civilization .
it 's out-of-the-way location means that the museum does not fight for space with a bustling modern city like the many archaeological remains that can be found in german cities such as trier , mainz , cologne and bonn . inside , visitors can see all the oddities that have been excavated from the site in the rhine valley , ranging from the waste heap of a workshop that used to make clay lamps to the gravestones of important citizens and the remains of a roman river barge hung in mid-air . getting a feel for the times bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the museum incorporates numerous archaeological finds the 22.5 million euro -lrb- $ 35 million -rrb- museum is set to open on aug .
16 , an apx spokesman told dpa news agency . the designers wanted visitors to understand the smells and sights of ancient rome .
there are boxes where visitors can feel the ruins ' broken roof tiles or smell typical roman spices . " our museum is not there to show which archaeologists dug up the most , " hans-joachim schalles , director of the museum , told dpa .
" it 's there so ordinary people can see what a roman town was like . " visitors can walk on a glass floor over a lane with the deep wheel-ruts of roman carts in it and the footprints of children 's bare feet and the hob-nailed boots of roman soldiers , all preserved for nearly 20 centuries in the mud . the museum 's 2,500 items show how an earlier germanic village was converted into a rich city of the roman empire , decorated with murals in the style of pompeii and with expensive glassware on the tables and was then conquered by frankish tribes . excavation continues at site bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : archaeologists have made many important finds in xanten the biggest item in the new museum building is a barge , the smallest the bones of a roman lapdog .
next door are the remains of the baths , which are protected from rain and snow by sheds which allow the outside air to circulate . experience has shown this is the best way to stop the remains from either completely drying out or becoming moldy from the dampness . finds such as a german silver hairpin suggest that the colonia was an ethnically mixed place , with celts and germans living among the romans and praying to their own gods . the legions of caesar augustus brought this region under roman control and a collection of their rough helmets is also in the museum .
concealed loudspeakers emit chatter in latin and other ancient tongues , as might have been heard on the town marketplace . around the year 100 of the common era , the roman emperor trajan funded its expansion into a city of about 10,000 bearing his name . thereafter it was a major city of the northern empire . most of the ruins slumber on undisturbed under the green grass of the apx .
archaeologists are likely to be burrowing and mapping the ancient town for many years to come .
local authorities hope to eventually expand the park to 73 hectares -lrb- 180 acres -rrb- to embrace the entire site . dw staff -lrb- th -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

but with the rest of europe banking on nuclear , german scientists don ’ t want to miss out on future developments . german research minister annette schavan said this week she will increase funding for nuclear research .
her announcement may have come as a surprise to those who believe that more money to be spent on research in this field is bound to contradict an agreement to phase out nuclear energy in germany completely . the phase-out deal was struck by the former coalition government of social democrats and greens .
it is still binding for the ruling grand coalition of chancellor angela merkel . schavan , a member of merkel 's christian democratic union , says that allocating more resources to nuclear research does not really undermine the country 's ambition to survive without atomic power .
she claims that some 14 million euros -lrb- $ 22 million -rrb- annually will primarily be used to enhance nuclear safety , radiation protection and nuclear waste storage technologies . young scientists to benefit bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the last german nuclear power plants are supposed to shut down in 2020 the minister also made it clear that the allocated resources would likewise be used to enable young german scientists to keep abreast with the latest developments in nuclear research .
with the rest of europe and many other parts of the world currently rediscovering the benefits of nuclear energy , she argued , german scientists must not lose out because of domestic restrictions . " our scientists must stay in the top league , " schavan told the berliner zeitung newspaper .
" as long as everywhere around us new power plants are being built , we can not afford to just sit back and invest nothing in nuclear safety and radiation protection . " skeptics up in arms but critics of the minister 's financial offensive do n't trust her announcements completely .
some lawmakers , including social democrat research expert joerg tauss , are reported to have qualms about her plans .
they believe that a good proportion of the additional money earmarked for atomic research may well end up in projects facilitating the development of a fourth generation of nuclear power plants . " we 'll be watching very carefully whether the research minister will actually earmark resources for research on this new line of reactors , " tauss told the frankfurter rundschau daily .
" if she does , we 'll put up a good fight to prevent this from happening . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : buetikofer says that schavan 's plan is a waste of money germany 's greens party , which has always been the staunchest opponent of nuclear power in the country , views the minister 's plans with a good deal of unease and skepticism .
greens co-leader reinhard buetikofer said that it would be outrageous if even the slightest part of the extra money would go towards research on the new reactor line . " why should taxpayers ' money be misused for research on reactors , which will not be built in germany at all in line with the coalition treaty on the complete phase-out of nuclear energy here " , buetikofer told dw-world.de.
" i have the impression that this would rather be an attempt to subsidize germany 's nuclear industry and help them export its know-how and technology to countries where nuclear energy is experiencing a revival .

soviet soldiers of the 40th army rolled into afghanistan in august 1978 , beginning a devastating nine-year war which bombed most of the central asian nation back into the dark ages . the invasion increased the tensions between the superpowers in a cold war which had already rumbled on for over 30 years . in an attempt to force the soviets to pull out of afghanistan , president jimmy carter issued an ultimatum that the united states would boycott the moscow games if soviet troops had not withdrawn from the country by 12:01 a.m.
eastern standard time on february 20 , 1980 .
after the deadline passed and the soviet-afghan war continued unabated , carter confirmed the boycott of the games on march 21 . athletes allowed to compete despite boycott the us was joined in its boycott by the likes of japan , west germany , china , the philippines and canada .
the united kingdom , france and greece supported the boycott but allowed their athletes to participate if they wished . the united kingdom and france sent a much smaller delegation of athletes than usual .
however , the uk delegation was the largest from western europe , with 170 athletes applying to compete . the nations that fully boycotted the games held their own event in the philippines . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the olympic flag was used more times than ever before those athletes attending from boycott nations were joined by those from fully participating countries in marching under the olympic flag , and not their own at the opening and closing ceremony in support of the games and not the political maneuvers that had drastically affected a number of events . during the closing ceremony , the traditional unfurling of the flag of the next olympic host nation , in this case the united states , was adapted .
instead of the stars and stripes , the flag of los angeles , the next host city , was used . the olympic anthem was also played at medal ceremonies in favor of the national anthems of winning athletes from boycott nations .
as a result , the olympic flag and anthem were used on a number of occasions . despite the disruptions to many events and the fact that only81 nations participated , more world records were set in moscow than in the previous games in montreal in 1976 . tit-for-tat boycott follows in la 1984 bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " to russia with love !
wish you were here " in what appeared to be a tit-for-tat boycott , the soviet union and 14 eastern bloc countries would boycott the 1984 olympic games in los angeles .
iran and libya also boycotted for different reasons than revenge for the moscow boycott . the soviets stated that their decision not to attend came from security concerns and " chauvinistic sentiments and an anti-soviet hysteria being whipped up in the united states . " just as the us-led boycott nations had done in 1980 , those refusing to take part in the 1984 games held their own . boycotting countries organized their own major events over july and august 1984 , called the friendship games which featured 50 nations and which took place in nine countries . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de energy -pipe- 31.07.2008 german anti-nuclear activists slam plan to boost research großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : schavan says the money 's meant to keep german scientists from falling behind the german government is willing to spend millions of euros on atomic research in the years ahead despite a binding agreement to phase out nuclear energy completely .
but with the rest of europe banking on nuclear , german scientists don ’ t want to miss out on future developments . german research minister annette schavan said this week she will increase funding for nuclear research .
her announcement may have come as a surprise to those who believe that more money to be spent on research in this field is bound to contradict an agreement to phase out nuclear energy in germany completely . the phase-out deal was struck by the former coalition government of social democrats and greens .
it is still binding for the ruling grand coalition of chancellor angela merkel . schavan , a member of merkel 's christian democratic union , says that allocating more resources to nuclear research does not really undermine the country 's ambition to survive without atomic power .
she claims that some 14 million euros -lrb- $ 22 million -rrb- annually will primarily be used to enhance nuclear safety , radiation protection and nuclear waste storage technologies . young scientists to benefit bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the last german nuclear power plants are supposed to shut down in 2020 the minister also made it clear that the allocated resources would likewise be used to enable young german scientists to keep abreast with the latest developments in nuclear research .
with the rest of europe and many other parts of the world currently rediscovering the benefits of nuclear energy , she argued , german scientists must not lose out because of domestic restrictions . " our scientists must stay in the top league , " schavan told the berliner zeitung newspaper .
" as long as everywhere around us new power plants are being built , we can not afford to just sit back and invest nothing in nuclear safety and radiation protection . " skeptics up in arms but critics of the minister 's financial offensive do n't trust her announcements completely .
some lawmakers , including social democrat research expert joerg tauss , are reported to have qualms about her plans .
they believe that a good proportion of the additional money earmarked for atomic research may well end up in projects facilitating the development of a fourth generation of nuclear power plants . " we 'll be watching very carefully whether the research minister will actually earmark resources for research on this new line of reactors , " tauss told the frankfurter rundschau daily .
" if she does , we 'll put up a good fight to prevent this from happening . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : buetikofer says that schavan 's plan is a waste of money germany 's greens party , which has always been the staunchest opponent of nuclear power in the country , views the minister 's plans with a good deal of unease and skepticism .
greens co-leader reinhard buetikofer said that it would be outrageous if even the slightest part of the extra money would go towards research on the new reactor line . " why should taxpayers ' money be misused for research on reactors , which will not be built in germany at all in line with the coalition treaty on the complete phase-out of nuclear energy here " , buetikofer told dw-world.de.
" i have the impression that this would rather be an attempt to subsidize germany 's nuclear industry and help them export its know-how and technology to countries where nuclear energy is experiencing a revival .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de aviation -pipe- 31.07.2008 lufthansa strike displays german thoroughness , expert says großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the price of the strike is n't yet high enough for lufthansa to give in on wage demands dw-world.de spoke with aviation expert cord schellenberg about the costs and effects of the strike at lufthansa , german organization and the demands on the table . dw-world.de : the trade union verdi has estimated that the strike is costing lufthansa about 5 million euros -lrb- $ 7.8 million -rrb- a day .
is this an accurate estimation in your opinion ? cord schellenberg : it 's one speculation .
it 's possible that the costs for lufthansa are even higher , depending on how much external equipment and personnel it has to buy in .
but the strike is definitely having an effect on lufthansa . first of all , they have to inform all of their passengers around the world that they have to rebook their flights .
at the same time , they also have to set up replacement flight routes , change the technical planning for the planes and rework the flight crew schedules . in terms of organization , it 's a lot of work for lufthansa .
it also means financial costs , but , at the moment , it appears that costs are still lower for lufthansa than if they accepted the employees ' current demands . will lufthansa lose customers over the long term due to the strike ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german even organize strikes well , schellenberg said i think that customer faithfulness is very high at lufthansa .
that 's true both of customers on discount flights that are glad to be flying on a premium airline and of those that pay full price . in the middle and long term , people will forget the whole thing pretty quickly - particularly because the typical german value of " thoroughness " is apparent in how well lufthansa has re-planned the flights .
i think people are impressed by that . in other countries , like italy for example , a strike always means chaos .
but here in germany , even the strike is organized .
the airline is able to manage and goes to great expense to make the effect on passengers as small as possible . however , the consequences in the freight division will be more strongly felt than on the passenger side , because the freight customers see that their shipments ca n't be sent .
on the other hand , the explanation is reasonable for everyone . so the strike could actually have a positive effect on lufthansa 's image ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the pilots have gotten first-class treatment in the past at least it could bring recognition from the passengers .
everyone knows that strikes are n't common in germany , but also that they ca n't be avoided .
however , most strikes are conducted in such a way that the company does n't have any chance to react .
in this case , i think both sides are very prudent , and that 's certainly something the passengers will recognize . it 's not good for lufthansa 's image - that would be going too far - but i think most people would say , wow , the germans can even organize a strike well . ticket prices are something that affects the passengers even more .
lufthansa , like every other airline , is hit hard by rising fuel prices as well as the emissions trading program that the eu has approved to start in 2012 .
can travelers expect higher ticket prices in the near future ? yes , that 's not dependent on the strike .
it 's just a realistic view of the developments in the global economy .
when the economy cools down , the movement of people and goods naturally does as well .
the increase in kerosene prices came at the same time . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : verdi is losing members personnel costs are a separate matter .
it 's a normal part of business that personnel costs increase .
the lufthansa employees say , " the company did well in the past few years .
now we want to earn more too . "
that 's something that happens every year or so when wage negotiations take place and it does n't have to mean higher costs for the passengers . however , i think 1 euro , 19 euro and 29 euro tickets are now a thing of the past .
they never really existed anyways , because they were more of a marketing gimmick . there is a large discrepancy between lufthansa 's offer and the pay increase demands the union is making .
are verdi 's demands reasonable ? in the past few years , verdi has been sensitive and made demands that were reasonable for the airline .
but they were continuously passed up by the pilots .
the pilots were in formula 1 , so to speak , and the others in formula 5 .
formula 1 is nice and the pilots always made use of it .
and verdi always responded reasonably , but now that approach is over . the airline should ask itself if it 's really healthy to give the pilots such a prominent position as a pressure group in wage negotiations and to tell the more expendable employees - check-in personnel , flight attendants and catering staff - that they do n't have such a prominent position . verdi is responsible for the technicians , which can also be a pressure group , especially if they 're highly qualified .
if they do n't do their job , the planes ca n't be approved for takeoff .
verdi knows this and is taking advantage of it . the flight attendant union that is in competition with verdi is demanding 15 percent in the wage negotiations .
that shows the high stakes involved .
verdi really wants to achieve something for its members and does n't want the flight attendants in its organization to switch over to the other union . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : there 's a strong tradition of compromise in germany , said schellenberg verdi has been particularly active in the past few months with a series of strikes .
have they been emboldened by recent successes ? verdi is a bit like the spd -lsb- social democratic party -rsb- in germany : they 're losing members .
while spd puts on a show all year , verdi is trying to nail down some successes and achieve something for its members . lufthansa has n't made a counteroffer but said it 's willing to negotiate and private , informal have taken place .
are they dealing with the strike in the best way ? as i said , the germans can organize a strike well , on both sides .
it 's also a tradition in germany to find a compromise . i think the population is relatively relaxed .
it 's different than it might be in the us , for example , because here people say , " they 'll come to an agreement . "
you ca n't prescribe how they reach an agreement , but in the end both sides will calculate the costs and decide when they have to compromise . interview : kate bowen send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" the ministry will talk to the highest officials within the german government to obtain clarification and express its concern over the fact that the german office of export controls gave its green light to the contract , " foreign ministry spokesman arye mekel told the afp news agency .
" the fact that germany , a member of the european group eu3 , which includes france , britain and germany , is adopting a position that harms international efforts to considerably toughen sanctions against iran over its continued nuclear program , is worrying , " the ministry said in a statement . but the german economics ministry said in a statement that the liquefied natural gas plants did not fall under any category of goods banned under the sanctions , adding that there was no legal means for preventing the transaction . goods " not of controversial nature " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : tehran is accused of using its nuclear energy program as a cover to build nuclear weapons the german export control office described the rift as a " misunderstanding . "
spokesman holger beutel said the 100 million euro -lrb- $ 156 million -rrb- deal between the german engineering firm steiner prematechnik gastec and iran was " for the export of goods that are not of a controversial nature . " the three systems are to cool and compress natural gas into liquid form so it can be transported by ship to export customers . this week the simon wiesenthal centre appealed to berlin to prohibit the deal .
jewish groups have criticized the contract , charging that germany is fostering economic relations with iran despite that nation 's nuclear program and its threats toward israel . germany is one of iran 's leading trading partners .
last year , german exports to the country totaled some 3.6 billion euros . berlin has , however , reduced export guarantees with iran , and german banks have largely ceased doing business with the islamic republic due to its nuclear program .
tehran insists its nuclear activities are non-military , but the west , including the united states many european union nations , fears iran is covertly trying to build nuclear weapons . germany is one of six states leading international efforts to thwart iranian nuclear ambitions .
iran denies planning to build nuclear warheads under the cover of a civilian atomic energy program . dw staff -lrb- jg -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the nation-state has had its day , writes political scientist winfried boettcher .
he calls instead for a europe built along regional lines that would help meet people 's cultural and economic needs . winfried böttcher is an emeritus professor of politics at the rwth aachen university , specializing in european politics .
he is particularly interested in the concept of a federal europe . the approach towards unifying europe has not changed since the founding of the coal and steel community over 50 years ago .
the absence of long-term goals means that cooperation continues to function on a trial-and-error basis .
varying interests , needs , functions and tasks continue to search for adequate organizational forms . the talk is still about moving towards the ever closer integration of the peoples of europe .
even today , no one can bring themselves to say that europe is amalgamating .
people approach europe pragmatically without knowing what form it should ultimately assume .
no one asks how we would like to live in europe in the future .
the nation-states , as the enablers of so-called european integration , prefer this functionalist method if only because it secures them the largest entitlements in terms of sovereignty . the future is federal bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : boettcher believes europe 's survival depends on subsidiarity by contrast , i believe that europe will only have a future if a federal concept places the normative question at the center of the debate .
unlike the existing functionalist concept , this idea is based on a clear integration approach .
according to johan galtung , this is a process in which two or more political protagonists come together to form a new protagonist .
correspondingly , europe could be united politically , judicially , economically and socially , while preserving its cultural plurality . this is conditional upon the relinquishing of national , power-oriented sovereignty and submitting to a common will .
the nation-state has fulfilled its historical function .
nowadays , it is one of the major troublemakers in the european integration process .
the theory of sovereignty - which is connected to state and the good of the state and which separates politics and morality and gives absolute primacy to the goals of the state - is no longer viable .
the citizen is the central democratic figure in our counter model , which is based on a concept of a europe of the regions . democracy brought closer to home bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : regionalism could offer a way out of the current impasse humans , as supranational beings , are politically active in their own regions where they are directly affected by political decisions .
regional society , in the form of civil society , is responsible for making decisions that are politically necessary .
in the ideal scenario , every single inhabitant of a region is also an active politician , albeit on various levels . the theoretical superstructure of a europe of regions is manifested in the principle of reason of region , as a kind of socialized reason of state .
the reason of region means that a region determines its goals according to its own rules , on the basis of the structural principle of " subsidiarity " on a sub-national level , i.e. within the framework of a constitutional , federal european structure .
each region lives according to its own " reason , " deploying its own endogenous potential and taking into account its chief particularities in cultural , social and , to a large extent , political autonomy and self-realization . rethinking subsidiarity regionalism and subsidiarity are inherently interdependent .
however , in our understanding of subsidiarity we go far beyond what is stated in article five of the treaty of amsterdam .
we define subsidiarity as " actively supporting a nation-state or the european union , to develop local and regional subsystems so that democratic participation is improved , even if this means accepting a loss of power at the other levels . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : regional peculiarities will be championed in a federal europe if the principle of subsidiarity is understood in this way , it supports and strengthens an autonomous , lively regionalism .
by this , we understand something that is close to people 's everyday lives and is able to solve the problems that arise , if possible with the united and democratic participation of everyone involved .
the attempt to build a europe imposed from above is susceptible to crisis .
as the eu continues to expand , it will become increasingly vulnerable .
europe 's chances come from below , if it helps to meet people 's educational , cultural , leisure and welfare needs and if " normal " employees get the feeling that they would be worse off without the european union . breaking open encrusted power structures to sum up : the future of the european union can only survive both domestically and internationally , if the bloc develops a constitution that aims to set up a regional , federal system .
the structural principle of subsidiarity will break open encrusted power structures and lead to an efficient overhaul of existing power structures .
the focus will be on living democracy .
it will be tangible and close to the people .
as a result , it will be possible to develop adequate strategies for shaping our own european future and lending a european dimension to the future shape of the world . winfried boettcher -lrb- jg -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de aviation -pipe- 31.07.2008 lufthansa strike displays german thoroughness , expert says großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the price of the strike is n't yet high enough for lufthansa to give in on wage demands dw-world.de spoke with aviation expert cord schellenberg about the costs and effects of the strike at lufthansa , german organization and the demands on the table . dw-world.de : the trade union verdi has estimated that the strike is costing lufthansa about 5 million euros -lrb- $ 7.8 million -rrb- a day .
is this an accurate estimation in your opinion ? cord schellenberg : it 's one speculation .
it 's possible that the costs for lufthansa are even higher , depending on how much external equipment and personnel it has to buy in .
but the strike is definitely having an effect on lufthansa . first of all , they have to inform all of their passengers around the world that they have to rebook their flights .
at the same time , they also have to set up replacement flight routes , change the technical planning for the planes and rework the flight crew schedules . in terms of organization , it 's a lot of work for lufthansa .
it also means financial costs , but , at the moment , it appears that costs are still lower for lufthansa than if they accepted the employees ' current demands . will lufthansa lose customers over the long term due to the strike ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german even organize strikes well , schellenberg said i think that customer faithfulness is very high at lufthansa .
that 's true both of customers on discount flights that are glad to be flying on a premium airline and of those that pay full price . in the middle and long term , people will forget the whole thing pretty quickly - particularly because the typical german value of " thoroughness " is apparent in how well lufthansa has re-planned the flights .
i think people are impressed by that . in other countries , like italy for example , a strike always means chaos .
but here in germany , even the strike is organized .
the airline is able to manage and goes to great expense to make the effect on passengers as small as possible . however , the consequences in the freight division will be more strongly felt than on the passenger side , because the freight customers see that their shipments ca n't be sent .
on the other hand , the explanation is reasonable for everyone . so the strike could actually have a positive effect on lufthansa 's image ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the pilots have gotten first-class treatment in the past at least it could bring recognition from the passengers .
everyone knows that strikes are n't common in germany , but also that they ca n't be avoided .
however , most strikes are conducted in such a way that the company does n't have any chance to react .
in this case , i think both sides are very prudent , and that 's certainly something the passengers will recognize . it 's not good for lufthansa 's image - that would be going too far - but i think most people would say , wow , the germans can even organize a strike well . ticket prices are something that affects the passengers even more .
lufthansa , like every other airline , is hit hard by rising fuel prices as well as the emissions trading program that the eu has approved to start in 2012 .
can travelers expect higher ticket prices in the near future ? yes , that 's not dependent on the strike .
it 's just a realistic view of the developments in the global economy .
when the economy cools down , the movement of people and goods naturally does as well .
the increase in kerosene prices came at the same time . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : verdi is losing members personnel costs are a separate matter .
it 's a normal part of business that personnel costs increase .
the lufthansa employees say , " the company did well in the past few years .
now we want to earn more too . "
that 's something that happens every year or so when wage negotiations take place and it does n't have to mean higher costs for the passengers . however , i think 1 euro , 19 euro and 29 euro tickets are now a thing of the past .
they never really existed anyways , because they were more of a marketing gimmick . there is a large discrepancy between lufthansa 's offer and the pay increase demands the union is making .
are verdi 's demands reasonable ? in the past few years , verdi has been sensitive and made demands that were reasonable for the airline .
but they were continuously passed up by the pilots .
the pilots were in formula 1 , so to speak , and the others in formula 5 .
formula 1 is nice and the pilots always made use of it .
and verdi always responded reasonably , but now that approach is over . the airline should ask itself if it 's really healthy to give the pilots such a prominent position as a pressure group in wage negotiations and to tell the more expendable employees - check-in personnel , flight attendants and catering staff - that they do n't have such a prominent position . verdi is responsible for the technicians , which can also be a pressure group , especially if they 're highly qualified .
if they do n't do their job , the planes ca n't be approved for takeoff .
verdi knows this and is taking advantage of it . the flight attendant union that is in competition with verdi is demanding 15 percent in the wage negotiations .
that shows the high stakes involved .
verdi really wants to achieve something for its members and does n't want the flight attendants in its organization to switch over to the other union . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : there 's a strong tradition of compromise in germany , said schellenberg verdi has been particularly active in the past few months with a series of strikes .
have they been emboldened by recent successes ? verdi is a bit like the spd -lsb- social democratic party -rsb- in germany : they 're losing members .
while spd puts on a show all year , verdi is trying to nail down some successes and achieve something for its members . lufthansa has n't made a counteroffer but said it 's willing to negotiate and private , informal have taken place .
are they dealing with the strike in the best way ? as i said , the germans can organize a strike well , on both sides .
it 's also a tradition in germany to find a compromise . i think the population is relatively relaxed .
it 's different than it might be in the us , for example , because here people say , " they 'll come to an agreement . "
you ca n't prescribe how they reach an agreement , but in the end both sides will calculate the costs and decide when they have to compromise . interview : kate bowen send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

but with the rest of europe banking on nuclear , german scientists don ’ t want to miss out on future developments . german research minister annette schavan said this week she will increase funding for nuclear research .
her announcement may have come as a surprise to those who believe that more money to be spent on research in this field is bound to contradict an agreement to phase out nuclear energy in germany completely . the phase-out deal was struck by the former coalition government of social democrats and greens .
it is still binding for the ruling grand coalition of chancellor angela merkel . schavan , a member of merkel 's christian democratic union , says that allocating more resources to nuclear research does not really undermine the country 's ambition to survive without atomic power .
she claims that some 14 million euros -lrb- $ 22 million -rrb- annually will primarily be used to enhance nuclear safety , radiation protection and nuclear waste storage technologies . young scientists to benefit bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the last german nuclear power plants are supposed to shut down in 2020 the minister also made it clear that the allocated resources would likewise be used to enable young german scientists to keep abreast with the latest developments in nuclear research .
with the rest of europe and many other parts of the world currently rediscovering the benefits of nuclear energy , she argued , german scientists must not lose out because of domestic restrictions . " our scientists must stay in the top league , " schavan told the berliner zeitung newspaper .
" as long as everywhere around us new power plants are being built , we can not afford to just sit back and invest nothing in nuclear safety and radiation protection . " skeptics up in arms but critics of the minister 's financial offensive do n't trust her announcements completely .
some lawmakers , including social democrat research expert joerg tauss , are reported to have qualms about her plans .
they believe that a good proportion of the additional money earmarked for atomic research may well end up in projects facilitating the development of a fourth generation of nuclear power plants . " we 'll be watching very carefully whether the research minister will actually earmark resources for research on this new line of reactors , " tauss told the frankfurter rundschau daily .
" if she does , we 'll put up a good fight to prevent this from happening . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : buetikofer says that schavan 's plan is a waste of money germany 's greens party , which has always been the staunchest opponent of nuclear power in the country , views the minister 's plans with a good deal of unease and skepticism .
greens co-leader reinhard buetikofer said that it would be outrageous if even the slightest part of the extra money would go towards research on the new reactor line . " why should taxpayers ' money be misused for research on reactors , which will not be built in germany at all in line with the coalition treaty on the complete phase-out of nuclear energy here " , buetikofer told dw-world.de.
" i have the impression that this would rather be an attempt to subsidize germany 's nuclear industry and help them export its know-how and technology to countries where nuclear energy is experiencing a revival .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de aviation -pipe- 31.07.2008 lufthansa strike displays german thoroughness , expert says großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the price of the strike is n't yet high enough for lufthansa to give in on wage demands dw-world.de spoke with aviation expert cord schellenberg about the costs and effects of the strike at lufthansa , german organization and the demands on the table . dw-world.de : the trade union verdi has estimated that the strike is costing lufthansa about 5 million euros -lrb- $ 7.8 million -rrb- a day .
is this an accurate estimation in your opinion ? cord schellenberg : it 's one speculation .
it 's possible that the costs for lufthansa are even higher , depending on how much external equipment and personnel it has to buy in .
but the strike is definitely having an effect on lufthansa . first of all , they have to inform all of their passengers around the world that they have to rebook their flights .
at the same time , they also have to set up replacement flight routes , change the technical planning for the planes and rework the flight crew schedules . in terms of organization , it 's a lot of work for lufthansa .
it also means financial costs , but , at the moment , it appears that costs are still lower for lufthansa than if they accepted the employees ' current demands . will lufthansa lose customers over the long term due to the strike ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german even organize strikes well , schellenberg said i think that customer faithfulness is very high at lufthansa .
that 's true both of customers on discount flights that are glad to be flying on a premium airline and of those that pay full price . in the middle and long term , people will forget the whole thing pretty quickly - particularly because the typical german value of " thoroughness " is apparent in how well lufthansa has re-planned the flights .
i think people are impressed by that . in other countries , like italy for example , a strike always means chaos .
but here in germany , even the strike is organized .
the airline is able to manage and goes to great expense to make the effect on passengers as small as possible . however , the consequences in the freight division will be more strongly felt than on the passenger side , because the freight customers see that their shipments ca n't be sent .
on the other hand , the explanation is reasonable for everyone . so the strike could actually have a positive effect on lufthansa 's image ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the pilots have gotten first-class treatment in the past at least it could bring recognition from the passengers .
everyone knows that strikes are n't common in germany , but also that they ca n't be avoided .
however , most strikes are conducted in such a way that the company does n't have any chance to react .
in this case , i think both sides are very prudent , and that 's certainly something the passengers will recognize . it 's not good for lufthansa 's image - that would be going too far - but i think most people would say , wow , the germans can even organize a strike well . ticket prices are something that affects the passengers even more .
lufthansa , like every other airline , is hit hard by rising fuel prices as well as the emissions trading program that the eu has approved to start in 2012 .
can travelers expect higher ticket prices in the near future ? yes , that 's not dependent on the strike .
it 's just a realistic view of the developments in the global economy .
when the economy cools down , the movement of people and goods naturally does as well .
the increase in kerosene prices came at the same time . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : verdi is losing members personnel costs are a separate matter .
it 's a normal part of business that personnel costs increase .
the lufthansa employees say , " the company did well in the past few years .
now we want to earn more too . "
that 's something that happens every year or so when wage negotiations take place and it does n't have to mean higher costs for the passengers . however , i think 1 euro , 19 euro and 29 euro tickets are now a thing of the past .
they never really existed anyways , because they were more of a marketing gimmick . there is a large discrepancy between lufthansa 's offer and the pay increase demands the union is making .
are verdi 's demands reasonable ? in the past few years , verdi has been sensitive and made demands that were reasonable for the airline .
but they were continuously passed up by the pilots .
the pilots were in formula 1 , so to speak , and the others in formula 5 .
formula 1 is nice and the pilots always made use of it .
and verdi always responded reasonably , but now that approach is over . the airline should ask itself if it 's really healthy to give the pilots such a prominent position as a pressure group in wage negotiations and to tell the more expendable employees - check-in personnel , flight attendants and catering staff - that they do n't have such a prominent position . verdi is responsible for the technicians , which can also be a pressure group , especially if they 're highly qualified .
if they do n't do their job , the planes ca n't be approved for takeoff .
verdi knows this and is taking advantage of it . the flight attendant union that is in competition with verdi is demanding 15 percent in the wage negotiations .
that shows the high stakes involved .
verdi really wants to achieve something for its members and does n't want the flight attendants in its organization to switch over to the other union . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : there 's a strong tradition of compromise in germany , said schellenberg verdi has been particularly active in the past few months with a series of strikes .
have they been emboldened by recent successes ? verdi is a bit like the spd -lsb- social democratic party -rsb- in germany : they 're losing members .
while spd puts on a show all year , verdi is trying to nail down some successes and achieve something for its members . lufthansa has n't made a counteroffer but said it 's willing to negotiate and private , informal have taken place .
are they dealing with the strike in the best way ? as i said , the germans can organize a strike well , on both sides .
it 's also a tradition in germany to find a compromise . i think the population is relatively relaxed .
it 's different than it might be in the us , for example , because here people say , " they 'll come to an agreement . "

the nation-state has had its day , writes political scientist winfried boettcher .
he calls instead for a europe built along regional lines that would help meet people 's cultural and economic needs . winfried böttcher is an emeritus professor of politics at the rwth aachen university , specializing in european politics .
he is particularly interested in the concept of a federal europe . the approach towards unifying europe has not changed since the founding of the coal and steel community over 50 years ago .
the absence of long-term goals means that cooperation continues to function on a trial-and-error basis .
varying interests , needs , functions and tasks continue to search for adequate organizational forms . the talk is still about moving towards the ever closer integration of the peoples of europe .
even today , no one can bring themselves to say that europe is amalgamating .
people approach europe pragmatically without knowing what form it should ultimately assume .
no one asks how we would like to live in europe in the future .
the nation-states , as the enablers of so-called european integration , prefer this functionalist method if only because it secures them the largest entitlements in terms of sovereignty . the future is federal bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : boettcher believes europe 's survival depends on subsidiarity by contrast , i believe that europe will only have a future if a federal concept places the normative question at the center of the debate .
unlike the existing functionalist concept , this idea is based on a clear integration approach .
according to johan galtung , this is a process in which two or more political protagonists come together to form a new protagonist .
correspondingly , europe could be united politically , judicially , economically and socially , while preserving its cultural plurality . this is conditional upon the relinquishing of national , power-oriented sovereignty and submitting to a common will .
the nation-state has fulfilled its historical function .
nowadays , it is one of the major troublemakers in the european integration process .
the theory of sovereignty - which is connected to state and the good of the state and which separates politics and morality and gives absolute primacy to the goals of the state - is no longer viable .
the citizen is the central democratic figure in our counter model , which is based on a concept of a europe of the regions . democracy brought closer to home bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : regionalism could offer a way out of the current impasse humans , as supranational beings , are politically active in their own regions where they are directly affected by political decisions .
regional society , in the form of civil society , is responsible for making decisions that are politically necessary .
in the ideal scenario , every single inhabitant of a region is also an active politician , albeit on various levels . the theoretical superstructure of a europe of regions is manifested in the principle of reason of region , as a kind of socialized reason of state .
the reason of region means that a region determines its goals according to its own rules , on the basis of the structural principle of " subsidiarity " on a sub-national level , i.e. within the framework of a constitutional , federal european structure .
each region lives according to its own " reason , " deploying its own endogenous potential and taking into account its chief particularities in cultural , social and , to a large extent , political autonomy and self-realization . rethinking subsidiarity regionalism and subsidiarity are inherently interdependent .
however , in our understanding of subsidiarity we go far beyond what is stated in article five of the treaty of amsterdam .
we define subsidiarity as " actively supporting a nation-state or the european union , to develop local and regional subsystems so that democratic participation is improved , even if this means accepting a loss of power at the other levels . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : regional peculiarities will be championed in a federal europe if the principle of subsidiarity is understood in this way , it supports and strengthens an autonomous , lively regionalism .
by this , we understand something that is close to people 's everyday lives and is able to solve the problems that arise , if possible with the united and democratic participation of everyone involved .
the attempt to build a europe imposed from above is susceptible to crisis .
as the eu continues to expand , it will become increasingly vulnerable .
europe 's chances come from below , if it helps to meet people 's educational , cultural , leisure and welfare needs and if " normal " employees get the feeling that they would be worse off without the european union . breaking open encrusted power structures to sum up : the future of the european union can only survive both domestically and internationally , if the bloc develops a constitution that aims to set up a regional , federal system .
the structural principle of subsidiarity will break open encrusted power structures and lead to an efficient overhaul of existing power structures .
the focus will be on living democracy .

the nation-state has had its day , writes political scientist winfried boettcher .
he calls instead for a europe built along regional lines that would help meet people 's cultural and economic needs . winfried böttcher is an emeritus professor of politics at the rwth aachen university , specializing in european politics .
he is particularly interested in the concept of a federal europe . the approach towards unifying europe has not changed since the founding of the coal and steel community over 50 years ago .
the absence of long-term goals means that cooperation continues to function on a trial-and-error basis .
varying interests , needs , functions and tasks continue to search for adequate organizational forms . the talk is still about moving towards the ever closer integration of the peoples of europe .
even today , no one can bring themselves to say that europe is amalgamating .
people approach europe pragmatically without knowing what form it should ultimately assume .
no one asks how we would like to live in europe in the future .
the nation-states , as the enablers of so-called european integration , prefer this functionalist method if only because it secures them the largest entitlements in terms of sovereignty . the future is federal bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : boettcher believes europe 's survival depends on subsidiarity by contrast , i believe that europe will only have a future if a federal concept places the normative question at the center of the debate .
unlike the existing functionalist concept , this idea is based on a clear integration approach .
according to johan galtung , this is a process in which two or more political protagonists come together to form a new protagonist .
correspondingly , europe could be united politically , judicially , economically and socially , while preserving its cultural plurality . this is conditional upon the relinquishing of national , power-oriented sovereignty and submitting to a common will .
the nation-state has fulfilled its historical function .
nowadays , it is one of the major troublemakers in the european integration process .
the theory of sovereignty - which is connected to state and the good of the state and which separates politics and morality and gives absolute primacy to the goals of the state - is no longer viable .
the citizen is the central democratic figure in our counter model , which is based on a concept of a europe of the regions . democracy brought closer to home bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : regionalism could offer a way out of the current impasse humans , as supranational beings , are politically active in their own regions where they are directly affected by political decisions .
regional society , in the form of civil society , is responsible for making decisions that are politically necessary .
in the ideal scenario , every single inhabitant of a region is also an active politician , albeit on various levels . the theoretical superstructure of a europe of regions is manifested in the principle of reason of region , as a kind of socialized reason of state .
the reason of region means that a region determines its goals according to its own rules , on the basis of the structural principle of " subsidiarity " on a sub-national level , i.e. within the framework of a constitutional , federal european structure .
each region lives according to its own " reason , " deploying its own endogenous potential and taking into account its chief particularities in cultural , social and , to a large extent , political autonomy and self-realization . rethinking subsidiarity regionalism and subsidiarity are inherently interdependent .
however , in our understanding of subsidiarity we go far beyond what is stated in article five of the treaty of amsterdam .
we define subsidiarity as " actively supporting a nation-state or the european union , to develop local and regional subsystems so that democratic participation is improved , even if this means accepting a loss of power at the other levels . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : regional peculiarities will be championed in a federal europe if the principle of subsidiarity is understood in this way , it supports and strengthens an autonomous , lively regionalism .
by this , we understand something that is close to people 's everyday lives and is able to solve the problems that arise , if possible with the united and democratic participation of everyone involved .
the attempt to build a europe imposed from above is susceptible to crisis .
as the eu continues to expand , it will become increasingly vulnerable .
europe 's chances come from below , if it helps to meet people 's educational , cultural , leisure and welfare needs and if " normal " employees get the feeling that they would be worse off without the european union . breaking open encrusted power structures to sum up : the future of the european union can only survive both domestically and internationally , if the bloc develops a constitution that aims to set up a regional , federal system .
the structural principle of subsidiarity will break open encrusted power structures and lead to an efficient overhaul of existing power structures .
the focus will be on living democracy .
it will be tangible and close to the people .
as a result , it will be possible to develop adequate strategies for shaping our own european future and lending a european dimension to the future shape of the world . winfried boettcher -lrb- jg -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

soviet soldiers of the 40th army rolled into afghanistan in august 1978 , beginning a devastating nine-year war which bombed most of the central asian nation back into the dark ages . the invasion increased the tensions between the superpowers in a cold war which had already rumbled on for over 30 years . in an attempt to force the soviets to pull out of afghanistan , president jimmy carter issued an ultimatum that the united states would boycott the moscow games if soviet troops had not withdrawn from the country by 12:01 a.m.

the united kingdom , france and greece supported the boycott but allowed their athletes to participate if they wished . the united kingdom and france sent a much smaller delegation of athletes than usual .

the move comes after the former economy and labor minister implicitly advised against voting for the spd in a key state key poll . the decision , the culmination of a dispute dating back to january , represents just one more problem for the party , which is currently trailing its conservative coalition partners in the polls by 13 percent with around 26 percent support . observers see it a sign of the developing battle between the party 's left and reformist wings . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : clement said the decision had come like a " bolt from the blue " clement angered spd members in january when he wrote a guest column for a conservative newspaper in which he queried the suitability of andrea ypsilanti for the premiership of hesse during a closely fought election campaign .
he warned that the hesse spd would " lurch to the left " under ypsilanti and attacked her energy policy after she opposed both nuclear and coal-fired power stations . " for this reason , consider carefully who should be trusted with responsibility for the state and vote carefully , " he wrote just a week before the jan .
27 state elections , in which the spd narrowly failed to oust the governing christian democrats . an attack on party solidarity an sdp arbitration committee in north rhine-westphalia , where clement was state premier before taking the economics and labor minister in the government of former chancellor gerhard schroeder , ruled that clement had undermined party solidarity . " he called on people not to vote for our party and that is damaging behavior , " a local spd leader in north rhine-westphalia , rudolf malzahn , told news channel n24 , defending the party 's decision .
" he said he would do it again anytime .
regardless of what title and rank a person has - rules are rules . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : nrw spd chairwoman hannelore kraft expressed " regret " north rhine-westphalia spd chairwoman hannelore kraft expressed " regret that things have come this far , " but others in the party said it was time for the former minister to go . some critics claimed that clement , who serves on the supervisory board of german energy giant rwe , had exposed himself as a cynical turncoat .
the former minister left politics to work in the power generation sector three years ago . the law office representing clement - run by otto schily , schroder 's former interior minister - released a statement thursday saying clement would appeal the party 's decision . the 68-year-old clement was a leading figure in the centrist branch of the party , serving as north rhine-westphalia state premier from 1998 to 2002 then as the " super-minister " for economy and labor under schroeder until 2005 . clement strongly backed gerhard schroeder 's disputed agenda 2010 economic and labor market reforms in the face of opposition from the left wing of the party .
since leaving office , clement frequently has criticized the spd 's moves to roll back that program . dw staff -lrb- jg -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

soviet soldiers of the 40th army rolled into afghanistan in august 1978 , beginning a devastating nine-year war which bombed most of the central asian nation back into the dark ages . the invasion increased the tensions between the superpowers in a cold war which had already rumbled on for over 30 years . in an attempt to force the soviets to pull out of afghanistan , president jimmy carter issued an ultimatum that the united states would boycott the moscow games if soviet troops had not withdrawn from the country by 12:01 a.m.
eastern standard time on february 20 , 1980 .
after the deadline passed and the soviet-afghan war continued unabated , carter confirmed the boycott of the games on march 21 . athletes allowed to compete despite boycott the us was joined in its boycott by the likes of japan , west germany , china , the philippines and canada .
the united kingdom , france and greece supported the boycott but allowed their athletes to participate if they wished . the united kingdom and france sent a much smaller delegation of athletes than usual .
however , the uk delegation was the largest from western europe , with 170 athletes applying to compete . the nations that fully boycotted the games held their own event in the philippines . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the olympic flag was used more times than ever before those athletes attending from boycott nations were joined by those from fully participating countries in marching under the olympic flag , and not their own at the opening and closing ceremony in support of the games and not the political maneuvers that had drastically affected a number of events . during the closing ceremony , the traditional unfurling of the flag of the next olympic host nation , in this case the united states , was adapted .
instead of the stars and stripes , the flag of los angeles , the next host city , was used . the olympic anthem was also played at medal ceremonies in favor of the national anthems of winning athletes from boycott nations .
as a result , the olympic flag and anthem were used on a number of occasions . despite the disruptions to many events and the fact that only81 nations participated , more world records were set in moscow than in the previous games in montreal in 1976 . tit-for-tat boycott follows in la 1984 bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " to russia with love !
wish you were here " in what appeared to be a tit-for-tat boycott , the soviet union and 14 eastern bloc countries would boycott the 1984 olympic games in los angeles .
iran and libya also boycotted for different reasons than revenge for the moscow boycott . the soviets stated that their decision not to attend came from security concerns and " chauvinistic sentiments and an anti-soviet hysteria being whipped up in the united states . " just as the us-led boycott nations had done in 1980 , those refusing to take part in the 1984 games held their own . boycotting countries organized their own major events over july and august 1984 , called the friendship games which featured 50 nations and which took place in nine countries . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the nation-state has had its day , writes political scientist winfried boettcher .
he calls instead for a europe built along regional lines that would help meet people 's cultural and economic needs . winfried böttcher is an emeritus professor of politics at the rwth aachen university , specializing in european politics .
he is particularly interested in the concept of a federal europe . the approach towards unifying europe has not changed since the founding of the coal and steel community over 50 years ago .
the absence of long-term goals means that cooperation continues to function on a trial-and-error basis .
varying interests , needs , functions and tasks continue to search for adequate organizational forms . the talk is still about moving towards the ever closer integration of the peoples of europe .
even today , no one can bring themselves to say that europe is amalgamating .
people approach europe pragmatically without knowing what form it should ultimately assume .
no one asks how we would like to live in europe in the future .
the nation-states , as the enablers of so-called european integration , prefer this functionalist method if only because it secures them the largest entitlements in terms of sovereignty . the future is federal bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : boettcher believes europe 's survival depends on subsidiarity by contrast , i believe that europe will only have a future if a federal concept places the normative question at the center of the debate .
unlike the existing functionalist concept , this idea is based on a clear integration approach .
according to johan galtung , this is a process in which two or more political protagonists come together to form a new protagonist .
correspondingly , europe could be united politically , judicially , economically and socially , while preserving its cultural plurality . this is conditional upon the relinquishing of national , power-oriented sovereignty and submitting to a common will .
the nation-state has fulfilled its historical function .
nowadays , it is one of the major troublemakers in the european integration process .
the theory of sovereignty - which is connected to state and the good of the state and which separates politics and morality and gives absolute primacy to the goals of the state - is no longer viable .
the citizen is the central democratic figure in our counter model , which is based on a concept of a europe of the regions . democracy brought closer to home bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : regionalism could offer a way out of the current impasse humans , as supranational beings , are politically active in their own regions where they are directly affected by political decisions .
regional society , in the form of civil society , is responsible for making decisions that are politically necessary .
in the ideal scenario , every single inhabitant of a region is also an active politician , albeit on various levels . the theoretical superstructure of a europe of regions is manifested in the principle of reason of region , as a kind of socialized reason of state .
the reason of region means that a region determines its goals according to its own rules , on the basis of the structural principle of " subsidiarity " on a sub-national level , i.e. within the framework of a constitutional , federal european structure .
each region lives according to its own " reason , " deploying its own endogenous potential and taking into account its chief particularities in cultural , social and , to a large extent , political autonomy and self-realization . rethinking subsidiarity regionalism and subsidiarity are inherently interdependent .
however , in our understanding of subsidiarity we go far beyond what is stated in article five of the treaty of amsterdam .
we define subsidiarity as " actively supporting a nation-state or the european union , to develop local and regional subsystems so that democratic participation is improved , even if this means accepting a loss of power at the other levels . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : regional peculiarities will be championed in a federal europe if the principle of subsidiarity is understood in this way , it supports and strengthens an autonomous , lively regionalism .
by this , we understand something that is close to people 's everyday lives and is able to solve the problems that arise , if possible with the united and democratic participation of everyone involved .
the attempt to build a europe imposed from above is susceptible to crisis .
as the eu continues to expand , it will become increasingly vulnerable .
europe 's chances come from below , if it helps to meet people 's educational , cultural , leisure and welfare needs and if " normal " employees get the feeling that they would be worse off without the european union . breaking open encrusted power structures to sum up : the future of the european union can only survive both domestically and internationally , if the bloc develops a constitution that aims to set up a regional , federal system .
the structural principle of subsidiarity will break open encrusted power structures and lead to an efficient overhaul of existing power structures .
the focus will be on living democracy .
it will be tangible and close to the people .

soviet soldiers of the 40th army rolled into afghanistan in august 1978 , beginning a devastating nine-year war which bombed most of the central asian nation back into the dark ages . the invasion increased the tensions between the superpowers in a cold war which had already rumbled on for over 30 years . in an attempt to force the soviets to pull out of afghanistan , president jimmy carter issued an ultimatum that the united states would boycott the moscow games if soviet troops had not withdrawn from the country by 12:01 a.m.
eastern standard time on february 20 , 1980 .
after the deadline passed and the soviet-afghan war continued unabated , carter confirmed the boycott of the games on march 21 . athletes allowed to compete despite boycott the us was joined in its boycott by the likes of japan , west germany , china , the philippines and canada .
the united kingdom , france and greece supported the boycott but allowed their athletes to participate if they wished . the united kingdom and france sent a much smaller delegation of athletes than usual .
however , the uk delegation was the largest from western europe , with 170 athletes applying to compete . the nations that fully boycotted the games held their own event in the philippines . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the olympic flag was used more times than ever before those athletes attending from boycott nations were joined by those from fully participating countries in marching under the olympic flag , and not their own at the opening and closing ceremony in support of the games and not the political maneuvers that had drastically affected a number of events . during the closing ceremony , the traditional unfurling of the flag of the next olympic host nation , in this case the united states , was adapted .
instead of the stars and stripes , the flag of los angeles , the next host city , was used . the olympic anthem was also played at medal ceremonies in favor of the national anthems of winning athletes from boycott nations .
as a result , the olympic flag and anthem were used on a number of occasions . despite the disruptions to many events and the fact that only81 nations participated , more world records were set in moscow than in the previous games in montreal in 1976 . tit-for-tat boycott follows in la 1984 bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " to russia with love !
wish you were here " in what appeared to be a tit-for-tat boycott , the soviet union and 14 eastern bloc countries would boycott the 1984 olympic games in los angeles .
iran and libya also boycotted for different reasons than revenge for the moscow boycott . the soviets stated that their decision not to attend came from security concerns and " chauvinistic sentiments and an anti-soviet hysteria being whipped up in the united states . " just as the us-led boycott nations had done in 1980 , those refusing to take part in the 1984 games held their own . boycotting countries organized their own major events over july and august 1984 , called the friendship games which featured 50 nations and which took place in nine countries . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the nation-state has had its day , writes political scientist winfried boettcher .
he calls instead for a europe built along regional lines that would help meet people 's cultural and economic needs . winfried böttcher is an emeritus professor of politics at the rwth aachen university , specializing in european politics .
he is particularly interested in the concept of a federal europe . the approach towards unifying europe has not changed since the founding of the coal and steel community over 50 years ago .
the absence of long-term goals means that cooperation continues to function on a trial-and-error basis .
varying interests , needs , functions and tasks continue to search for adequate organizational forms . the talk is still about moving towards the ever closer integration of the peoples of europe .
even today , no one can bring themselves to say that europe is amalgamating .
people approach europe pragmatically without knowing what form it should ultimately assume .
no one asks how we would like to live in europe in the future .
the nation-states , as the enablers of so-called european integration , prefer this functionalist method if only because it secures them the largest entitlements in terms of sovereignty . the future is federal bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : boettcher believes europe 's survival depends on subsidiarity by contrast , i believe that europe will only have a future if a federal concept places the normative question at the center of the debate .
unlike the existing functionalist concept , this idea is based on a clear integration approach .
according to johan galtung , this is a process in which two or more political protagonists come together to form a new protagonist .
correspondingly , europe could be united politically , judicially , economically and socially , while preserving its cultural plurality . this is conditional upon the relinquishing of national , power-oriented sovereignty and submitting to a common will .
the nation-state has fulfilled its historical function .
nowadays , it is one of the major troublemakers in the european integration process .
the theory of sovereignty - which is connected to state and the good of the state and which separates politics and morality and gives absolute primacy to the goals of the state - is no longer viable .
the citizen is the central democratic figure in our counter model , which is based on a concept of a europe of the regions . democracy brought closer to home bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : regionalism could offer a way out of the current impasse humans , as supranational beings , are politically active in their own regions where they are directly affected by political decisions .
regional society , in the form of civil society , is responsible for making decisions that are politically necessary .
in the ideal scenario , every single inhabitant of a region is also an active politician , albeit on various levels . the theoretical superstructure of a europe of regions is manifested in the principle of reason of region , as a kind of socialized reason of state .
the reason of region means that a region determines its goals according to its own rules , on the basis of the structural principle of " subsidiarity " on a sub-national level , i.e. within the framework of a constitutional , federal european structure .
each region lives according to its own " reason , " deploying its own endogenous potential and taking into account its chief particularities in cultural , social and , to a large extent , political autonomy and self-realization . rethinking subsidiarity regionalism and subsidiarity are inherently interdependent .
however , in our understanding of subsidiarity we go far beyond what is stated in article five of the treaty of amsterdam .
we define subsidiarity as " actively supporting a nation-state or the european union , to develop local and regional subsystems so that democratic participation is improved , even if this means accepting a loss of power at the other levels . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : regional peculiarities will be championed in a federal europe if the principle of subsidiarity is understood in this way , it supports and strengthens an autonomous , lively regionalism .
by this , we understand something that is close to people 's everyday lives and is able to solve the problems that arise , if possible with the united and democratic participation of everyone involved .
the attempt to build a europe imposed from above is susceptible to crisis .
as the eu continues to expand , it will become increasingly vulnerable .
europe 's chances come from below , if it helps to meet people 's educational , cultural , leisure and welfare needs and if " normal " employees get the feeling that they would be worse off without the european union . breaking open encrusted power structures to sum up : the future of the european union can only survive both domestically and internationally , if the bloc develops a constitution that aims to set up a regional , federal system .
the structural principle of subsidiarity will break open encrusted power structures and lead to an efficient overhaul of existing power structures .
the focus will be on living democracy .
it will be tangible and close to the people .
as a result , it will be possible to develop adequate strategies for shaping our own european future and lending a european dimension to the future shape of the world . winfried boettcher -lrb- jg -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the jobless rate was up 0.2 percent to 7.7 percent . this was , however , 505,000 less than the numbers out of work in unadjusted terms in july last year , when the unemployment rate stood at 8.9 percent .
in seasonally adjusted terms , unemployment fell by 20,000 to 3.25 million .
the number of unemployed had been shrinking fast in recent months , falling below 8 percent in may for the first time in 16 years .
releasing the data , labour office chief frank-juergen weise said developments on the labour market remained positive despite signs that it was losing some of its momentum .
he said that employers ' demand for workers remained high .
but a steady stream of data and economic sentiment surveys have pointed to the nation 's economy losing steam amid fears that inflation has been picking up on the back of high food and energy costs .

while german exports recorded their biggest fall in about four years in may , factory orders fell for the sixth consecutive month in may and industrial production also dropped sharply .
this points to economic growth sliding during the second quarter after a strong start to the year .

the nation-state has had its day , writes political scientist winfried boettcher .
he calls instead for a europe built along regional lines that would help meet people 's cultural and economic needs . winfried böttcher is an emeritus professor of politics at the rwth aachen university , specializing in european politics .
he is particularly interested in the concept of a federal europe . the approach towards unifying europe has not changed since the founding of the coal and steel community over 50 years ago .
the absence of long-term goals means that cooperation continues to function on a trial-and-error basis .
varying interests , needs , functions and tasks continue to search for adequate organizational forms . the talk is still about moving towards the ever closer integration of the peoples of europe .
even today , no one can bring themselves to say that europe is amalgamating .
people approach europe pragmatically without knowing what form it should ultimately assume .
no one asks how we would like to live in europe in the future .
the nation-states , as the enablers of so-called european integration , prefer this functionalist method if only because it secures them the largest entitlements in terms of sovereignty . the future is federal bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : boettcher believes europe 's survival depends on subsidiarity by contrast , i believe that europe will only have a future if a federal concept places the normative question at the center of the debate .
unlike the existing functionalist concept , this idea is based on a clear integration approach .
according to johan galtung , this is a process in which two or more political protagonists come together to form a new protagonist .
correspondingly , europe could be united politically , judicially , economically and socially , while preserving its cultural plurality . this is conditional upon the relinquishing of national , power-oriented sovereignty and submitting to a common will .
the nation-state has fulfilled its historical function .
nowadays , it is one of the major troublemakers in the european integration process .
the theory of sovereignty - which is connected to state and the good of the state and which separates politics and morality and gives absolute primacy to the goals of the state - is no longer viable .
the citizen is the central democratic figure in our counter model , which is based on a concept of a europe of the regions . democracy brought closer to home bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : regionalism could offer a way out of the current impasse humans , as supranational beings , are politically active in their own regions where they are directly affected by political decisions .
regional society , in the form of civil society , is responsible for making decisions that are politically necessary .
in the ideal scenario , every single inhabitant of a region is also an active politician , albeit on various levels . the theoretical superstructure of a europe of regions is manifested in the principle of reason of region , as a kind of socialized reason of state .
the reason of region means that a region determines its goals according to its own rules , on the basis of the structural principle of " subsidiarity " on a sub-national level , i.e. within the framework of a constitutional , federal european structure .
each region lives according to its own " reason , " deploying its own endogenous potential and taking into account its chief particularities in cultural , social and , to a large extent , political autonomy and self-realization . rethinking subsidiarity regionalism and subsidiarity are inherently interdependent .
however , in our understanding of subsidiarity we go far beyond what is stated in article five of the treaty of amsterdam .
we define subsidiarity as " actively supporting a nation-state or the european union , to develop local and regional subsystems so that democratic participation is improved , even if this means accepting a loss of power at the other levels . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : regional peculiarities will be championed in a federal europe if the principle of subsidiarity is understood in this way , it supports and strengthens an autonomous , lively regionalism .
by this , we understand something that is close to people 's everyday lives and is able to solve the problems that arise , if possible with the united and democratic participation of everyone involved .
the attempt to build a europe imposed from above is susceptible to crisis .
as the eu continues to expand , it will become increasingly vulnerable .
europe 's chances come from below , if it helps to meet people 's educational , cultural , leisure and welfare needs and if " normal " employees get the feeling that they would be worse off without the european union . breaking open encrusted power structures to sum up : the future of the european union can only survive both domestically and internationally , if the bloc develops a constitution that aims to set up a regional , federal system .
the structural principle of subsidiarity will break open encrusted power structures and lead to an efficient overhaul of existing power structures .
the focus will be on living democracy .
it will be tangible and close to the people .
as a result , it will be possible to develop adequate strategies for shaping our own european future and lending a european dimension to the future shape of the world . winfried boettcher -lrb- jg -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the jobless rate was up 0.2 percent to 7.7 percent . this was , however , 505,000 less than the numbers out of work in unadjusted terms in july last year , when the unemployment rate stood at 8.9 percent .
in seasonally adjusted terms , unemployment fell by 20,000 to 3.25 million .
the number of unemployed had been shrinking fast in recent months , falling below 8 percent in may for the first time in 16 years .
releasing the data , labour office chief frank-juergen weise said developments on the labour market remained positive despite signs that it was losing some of its momentum .
he said that employers ' demand for workers remained high .
but a steady stream of data and economic sentiment surveys have pointed to the nation 's economy losing steam amid fears that inflation has been picking up on the back of high food and energy costs .
minimal economic growth expected german business confidence dropped to near a three-year low in july , according to a key survey drawn up by the ifo institute for economic research and released this month .
" these results suggest the economic upswing is coming to an end , " said ifo chief hans-werner sinn , releasing the latest report .
while german exports recorded their biggest fall in about four years in may , factory orders fell for the sixth consecutive month in may and industrial production also dropped sharply .
this points to economic growth sliding during the second quarter after a strong start to the year .
the most pessimistic forecasts are for german economic growth to slow to 0.7 percent during the three months to the end of june . dpa news agency -lrb- th -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

soviet soldiers of the 40th army rolled into afghanistan in august 1978 , beginning a devastating nine-year war which bombed most of the central asian nation back into the dark ages . the invasion increased the tensions between the superpowers in a cold war which had already rumbled on for over 30 years . in an attempt to force the soviets to pull out of afghanistan , president jimmy carter issued an ultimatum that the united states would boycott the moscow games if soviet troops had not withdrawn from the country by 12:01 a.m.
eastern standard time on february 20 , 1980 .
after the deadline passed and the soviet-afghan war continued unabated , carter confirmed the boycott of the games on march 21 . athletes allowed to compete despite boycott the us was joined in its boycott by the likes of japan , west germany , china , the philippines and canada .
the united kingdom , france and greece supported the boycott but allowed their athletes to participate if they wished . the united kingdom and france sent a much smaller delegation of athletes than usual .
however , the uk delegation was the largest from western europe , with 170 athletes applying to compete . the nations that fully boycotted the games held their own event in the philippines . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the olympic flag was used more times than ever before those athletes attending from boycott nations were joined by those from fully participating countries in marching under the olympic flag , and not their own at the opening and closing ceremony in support of the games and not the political maneuvers that had drastically affected a number of events . during the closing ceremony , the traditional unfurling of the flag of the next olympic host nation , in this case the united states , was adapted .
instead of the stars and stripes , the flag of los angeles , the next host city , was used . the olympic anthem was also played at medal ceremonies in favor of the national anthems of winning athletes from boycott nations .
as a result , the olympic flag and anthem were used on a number of occasions . despite the disruptions to many events and the fact that only81 nations participated , more world records were set in moscow than in the previous games in montreal in 1976 . tit-for-tat boycott follows in la 1984 bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " to russia with love !
wish you were here " in what appeared to be a tit-for-tat boycott , the soviet union and 14 eastern bloc countries would boycott the 1984 olympic games in los angeles .
iran and libya also boycotted for different reasons than revenge for the moscow boycott . the soviets stated that their decision not to attend came from security concerns and " chauvinistic sentiments and an anti-soviet hysteria being whipped up in the united states . " just as the us-led boycott nations had done in 1980 , those refusing to take part in the 1984 games held their own . boycotting countries organized their own major events over july and august 1984 , called the friendship games which featured 50 nations and which took place in nine countries . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the museum aims to help visitors immerse themselves in the architecture , sounds and smells of the roman settlement . germanic and celtic barbarians , accustomed to living in squat log huts , must have gasped in amazement when they first caught sight of the towering town center of colonia ulpia traiana some 2,000 years ago . the museum evokes the lofty roman basilica , which served as a lobby for the baths .
the 24-meter -lrb- 79-foot -rrb- building was the height of a modern-day , eight-story apartment and had a gabled roof topped off with red roman tiles . built to scale bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : visitors might feel like they 've entered a time warp to help visitors understand the massive scale of the buildings , architects built steel-framed buildings the same size as the originals on the site of the old bathhouse and ancillary structures .
its height was calculated from the dimensions of its foundations . the new museum , part of the archaeological park at xanten -lrb- apx -rrb- , aims to offer the modern visitor a fresh perspective on roman civilization .
it 's out-of-the-way location means that the museum does not fight for space with a bustling modern city like the many archaeological remains that can be found in german cities such as trier , mainz , cologne and bonn . inside , visitors can see all the oddities that have been excavated from the site in the rhine valley , ranging from the waste heap of a workshop that used to make clay lamps to the gravestones of important citizens and the remains of a roman river barge hung in mid-air . getting a feel for the times bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the museum incorporates numerous archaeological finds the 22.5 million euro -lrb- $ 35 million -rrb- museum is set to open on aug .
16 , an apx spokesman told dpa news agency . the designers wanted visitors to understand the smells and sights of ancient rome .
there are boxes where visitors can feel the ruins ' broken roof tiles or smell typical roman spices . " our museum is not there to show which archaeologists dug up the most , " hans-joachim schalles , director of the museum , told dpa .

the museum aims to help visitors immerse themselves in the architecture , sounds and smells of the roman settlement . germanic and celtic barbarians , accustomed to living in squat log huts , must have gasped in amazement when they first caught sight of the towering town center of colonia ulpia traiana some 2,000 years ago . the museum evokes the lofty roman basilica , which served as a lobby for the baths .
the 24-meter -lrb- 79-foot -rrb- building was the height of a modern-day , eight-story apartment and had a gabled roof topped off with red roman tiles . built to scale bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : visitors might feel like they 've entered a time warp to help visitors understand the massive scale of the buildings , architects built steel-framed buildings the same size as the originals on the site of the old bathhouse and ancillary structures .
its height was calculated from the dimensions of its foundations . the new museum , part of the archaeological park at xanten -lrb- apx -rrb- , aims to offer the modern visitor a fresh perspective on roman civilization .
it 's out-of-the-way location means that the museum does not fight for space with a bustling modern city like the many archaeological remains that can be found in german cities such as trier , mainz , cologne and bonn . inside , visitors can see all the oddities that have been excavated from the site in the rhine valley , ranging from the waste heap of a workshop that used to make clay lamps to the gravestones of important citizens and the remains of a roman river barge hung in mid-air . getting a feel for the times bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the museum incorporates numerous archaeological finds the 22.5 million euro -lrb- $ 35 million -rrb- museum is set to open on aug .
16 , an apx spokesman told dpa news agency . the designers wanted visitors to understand the smells and sights of ancient rome .
there are boxes where visitors can feel the ruins ' broken roof tiles or smell typical roman spices . " our museum is not there to show which archaeologists dug up the most , " hans-joachim schalles , director of the museum , told dpa .
" it 's there so ordinary people can see what a roman town was like . " visitors can walk on a glass floor over a lane with the deep wheel-ruts of roman carts in it and the footprints of children 's bare feet and the hob-nailed boots of roman soldiers , all preserved for nearly 20 centuries in the mud . the museum 's 2,500 items show how an earlier germanic village was converted into a rich city of the roman empire , decorated with murals in the style of pompeii and with expensive glassware on the tables and was then conquered by frankish tribes . excavation continues at site bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : archaeologists have made many important finds in xanten the biggest item in the new museum building is a barge , the smallest the bones of a roman lapdog .
next door are the remains of the baths , which are protected from rain and snow by sheds which allow the outside air to circulate . experience has shown this is the best way to stop the remains from either completely drying out or becoming moldy from the dampness . finds such as a german silver hairpin suggest that the colonia was an ethnically mixed place , with celts and germans living among the romans and praying to their own gods . the legions of caesar augustus brought this region under roman control and a collection of their rough helmets is also in the museum .
concealed loudspeakers emit chatter in latin and other ancient tongues , as might have been heard on the town marketplace . around the year 100 of the common era , the roman emperor trajan funded its expansion into a city of about 10,000 bearing his name . thereafter it was a major city of the northern empire . most of the ruins slumber on undisturbed under the green grass of the apx .
archaeologists are likely to be burrowing and mapping the ancient town for many years to come .
local authorities hope to eventually expand the park to 73 hectares -lrb- 180 acres -rrb- to embrace the entire site . dw staff -lrb- th -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

he opted to delay his plea for 30 days and announced he would conduct his own defense . karadzic , who was no longer sporting the beard and long hair that helped him conceal his identity for over a decade , waived his right to representation during the hearing on thursday , july 31 . when judge alphons orie noted that he was alone , the wartime leader smiled and responded , " i have an invisible adviser , but i have decided to defend myself . " orie , who said he expected the trial to last for many months , gave karadzic 30 days to decide a plea at the initial hour-long hearing of the international criminal tribunal for the former yugoslavia .
the trial was adjourned until aug .
29 . bildunterschrift : many observers were surprised at karadzic 's clean-cut appearance repeat performance ? karadzic said that - like his former ally - he intends to defend himself throughout the rest of the trial .
slobodan milosevic , who was accused of crimes against humanity for his role in the bosnian wars , used this as a delaying tactic to drag out his trial at the criminal tribunal in the hague for years , dying in 2006 before it ended . karadzic , who is the most prominent balkans war crimes suspect to be arrested after milosevic , said on thursday that he would also reveal " numerous irregularities " related to his presence at the hearing . " i will inform the court of the many mistakes and irregularities , like the mistaken date of my arrest , " the 63-year-old said . he claimed that under the dayton accord , which ended the bosnian war and brokered by former us assistant secretary of state richard holbrooke , an agreement was made that he would not be brought to trial if he withdrew from public life . orie interrupted the former bosnian serb leader when he tried to read a prepared four-page statement about this , and said he should send the information to the court in writing . chief prosecutor serge brammetz said lessons had been learned from the milosevic case . " of course , it will take some months before the prosecution and defense will be ready to start , " he told reporters .
" it will be a complex trial , but we are fully aware of the importance of being efficient . " some observers say he is likely to use the trial to illuminate claims that a shady deal with the west helped him avoid detention for so long . " this is a political man , a former poet , he likes being the center of attention , " international justice expert heikelina verrijn stuart told afp news agency . charges include siege and massacre atrocities bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : karadzic had posed for years as an alternative medicine practitioner during thursday 's hearing , orie read out the 11 war crimes charges that were first leveled against karadzic in 1995 .
the majority of the charges against karadzic focus on his role in the siege of sarajevo and the srebrenica massacre . some 8,000 muslim men and boys were killed in the un safe haven of srebrenica , while the siege of sarajevo , which lasted over three years , is estimated to have left some 10,000 people dead .

but with the rest of europe banking on nuclear , german scientists don ’ t want to miss out on future developments . german research minister annette schavan said this week she will increase funding for nuclear research .
her announcement may have come as a surprise to those who believe that more money to be spent on research in this field is bound to contradict an agreement to phase out nuclear energy in germany completely . the phase-out deal was struck by the former coalition government of social democrats and greens .
it is still binding for the ruling grand coalition of chancellor angela merkel . schavan , a member of merkel 's christian democratic union , says that allocating more resources to nuclear research does not really undermine the country 's ambition to survive without atomic power .
she claims that some 14 million euros -lrb- $ 22 million -rrb- annually will primarily be used to enhance nuclear safety , radiation protection and nuclear waste storage technologies . young scientists to benefit bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the last german nuclear power plants are supposed to shut down in 2020 the minister also made it clear that the allocated resources would likewise be used to enable young german scientists to keep abreast with the latest developments in nuclear research .
with the rest of europe and many other parts of the world currently rediscovering the benefits of nuclear energy , she argued , german scientists must not lose out because of domestic restrictions . " our scientists must stay in the top league , " schavan told the berliner zeitung newspaper .
" as long as everywhere around us new power plants are being built , we can not afford to just sit back and invest nothing in nuclear safety and radiation protection . " skeptics up in arms but critics of the minister 's financial offensive do n't trust her announcements completely .
some lawmakers , including social democrat research expert joerg tauss , are reported to have qualms about her plans .
they believe that a good proportion of the additional money earmarked for atomic research may well end up in projects facilitating the development of a fourth generation of nuclear power plants . " we 'll be watching very carefully whether the research minister will actually earmark resources for research on this new line of reactors , " tauss told the frankfurter rundschau daily .
" if she does , we 'll put up a good fight to prevent this from happening . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : buetikofer says that schavan 's plan is a waste of money germany 's greens party , which has always been the staunchest opponent of nuclear power in the country , views the minister 's plans with a good deal of unease and skepticism .
greens co-leader reinhard buetikofer said that it would be outrageous if even the slightest part of the extra money would go towards research on the new reactor line . " why should taxpayers ' money be misused for research on reactors , which will not be built in germany at all in line with the coalition treaty on the complete phase-out of nuclear energy here " , buetikofer told dw-world.de.
" i have the impression that this would rather be an attempt to subsidize germany 's nuclear industry and help them export its know-how and technology to countries where nuclear energy is experiencing a revival .

he opted to delay his plea for 30 days and announced he would conduct his own defense . karadzic , who was no longer sporting the beard and long hair that helped him conceal his identity for over a decade , waived his right to representation during the hearing on thursday , july 31 . when judge alphons orie noted that he was alone , the wartime leader smiled and responded , " i have an invisible adviser , but i have decided to defend myself .

" of course , it will take some months before the prosecution and defense will be ready to start , " he told reporters .
" it will be a complex trial , but we are fully aware of the importance of being efficient .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de aviation -pipe- 31.07.2008 lufthansa strike displays german thoroughness , expert says großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the price of the strike is n't yet high enough for lufthansa to give in on wage demands dw-world.de spoke with aviation expert cord schellenberg about the costs and effects of the strike at lufthansa , german organization and the demands on the table . dw-world.de : the trade union verdi has estimated that the strike is costing lufthansa about 5 million euros -lrb- $ 7.8 million -rrb- a day .
is this an accurate estimation in your opinion ? cord schellenberg : it 's one speculation .
it 's possible that the costs for lufthansa are even higher , depending on how much external equipment and personnel it has to buy in .
but the strike is definitely having an effect on lufthansa . first of all , they have to inform all of their passengers around the world that they have to rebook their flights .
at the same time , they also have to set up replacement flight routes , change the technical planning for the planes and rework the flight crew schedules . in terms of organization , it 's a lot of work for lufthansa .
it also means financial costs , but , at the moment , it appears that costs are still lower for lufthansa than if they accepted the employees ' current demands . will lufthansa lose customers over the long term due to the strike ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german even organize strikes well , schellenberg said i think that customer faithfulness is very high at lufthansa .
that 's true both of customers on discount flights that are glad to be flying on a premium airline and of those that pay full price . in the middle and long term , people will forget the whole thing pretty quickly - particularly because the typical german value of " thoroughness " is apparent in how well lufthansa has re-planned the flights .
i think people are impressed by that . in other countries , like italy for example , a strike always means chaos .
but here in germany , even the strike is organized .
the airline is able to manage and goes to great expense to make the effect on passengers as small as possible . however , the consequences in the freight division will be more strongly felt than on the passenger side , because the freight customers see that their shipments ca n't be sent .
on the other hand , the explanation is reasonable for everyone . so the strike could actually have a positive effect on lufthansa 's image ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the pilots have gotten first-class treatment in the past at least it could bring recognition from the passengers .
everyone knows that strikes are n't common in germany , but also that they ca n't be avoided .
however , most strikes are conducted in such a way that the company does n't have any chance to react .
in this case , i think both sides are very prudent , and that 's certainly something the passengers will recognize . it 's not good for lufthansa 's image - that would be going too far - but i think most people would say , wow , the germans can even organize a strike well . ticket prices are something that affects the passengers even more .
lufthansa , like every other airline , is hit hard by rising fuel prices as well as the emissions trading program that the eu has approved to start in 2012 .
can travelers expect higher ticket prices in the near future ? yes , that 's not dependent on the strike .
it 's just a realistic view of the developments in the global economy .
when the economy cools down , the movement of people and goods naturally does as well .
the increase in kerosene prices came at the same time . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : verdi is losing members personnel costs are a separate matter .
it 's a normal part of business that personnel costs increase .
the lufthansa employees say , " the company did well in the past few years .
now we want to earn more too . "
that 's something that happens every year or so when wage negotiations take place and it does n't have to mean higher costs for the passengers . however , i think 1 euro , 19 euro and 29 euro tickets are now a thing of the past .
they never really existed anyways , because they were more of a marketing gimmick . there is a large discrepancy between lufthansa 's offer and the pay increase demands the union is making .
are verdi 's demands reasonable ? in the past few years , verdi has been sensitive and made demands that were reasonable for the airline .
but they were continuously passed up by the pilots .

is this an accurate estimation in your opinion ? cord schellenberg : it 's one speculation .
it 's possible that the costs for lufthansa are even higher , depending on how much external equipment and personnel it has to buy in .
but the strike is definitely having an effect on lufthansa . first of all , they have to inform all of their passengers around the world that they have to rebook their flights .
at the same time , they also have to set up replacement flight routes , change the technical planning for the planes and rework the flight crew schedules . in terms of organization , it 's a lot of work for lufthansa .
it also means financial costs , but , at the moment , it appears that costs are still lower for lufthansa than if they accepted the employees ' current demands . will lufthansa lose customers over the long term due to the strike ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german even organize strikes well , schellenberg said i think that customer faithfulness is very high at lufthansa .
that 's true both of customers on discount flights that are glad to be flying on a premium airline and of those that pay full price . in the middle and long term , people will forget the whole thing pretty quickly - particularly because the typical german value of " thoroughness " is apparent in how well lufthansa has re-planned the flights .
i think people are impressed by that . in other countries , like italy for example , a strike always means chaos .
but here in germany , even the strike is organized .
the airline is able to manage and goes to great expense to make the effect on passengers as small as possible . however , the consequences in the freight division will be more strongly felt than on the passenger side , because the freight customers see that their shipments ca n't be sent .
on the other hand , the explanation is reasonable for everyone . so the strike could actually have a positive effect on lufthansa 's image ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the pilots have gotten first-class treatment in the past at least it could bring recognition from the passengers .
everyone knows that strikes are n't common in germany , but also that they ca n't be avoided .
however , most strikes are conducted in such a way that the company does n't have any chance to react .
in this case , i think both sides are very prudent , and that 's certainly something the passengers will recognize . it 's not good for lufthansa 's image - that would be going too far - but i think most people would say , wow , the germans can even organize a strike well . ticket prices are something that affects the passengers even more .
lufthansa , like every other airline , is hit hard by rising fuel prices as well as the emissions trading program that the eu has approved to start in 2012 .
can travelers expect higher ticket prices in the near future ? yes , that 's not dependent on the strike .
it 's just a realistic view of the developments in the global economy .
when the economy cools down , the movement of people and goods naturally does as well .
the increase in kerosene prices came at the same time . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : verdi is losing members personnel costs are a separate matter .
it 's a normal part of business that personnel costs increase .
the lufthansa employees say , " the company did well in the past few years .
now we want to earn more too . "
that 's something that happens every year or so when wage negotiations take place and it does n't have to mean higher costs for the passengers . however , i think 1 euro , 19 euro and 29 euro tickets are now a thing of the past .
they never really existed anyways , because they were more of a marketing gimmick . there is a large discrepancy between lufthansa 's offer and the pay increase demands the union is making .
are verdi 's demands reasonable ? in the past few years , verdi has been sensitive and made demands that were reasonable for the airline .
but they were continuously passed up by the pilots .
the pilots were in formula 1 , so to speak , and the others in formula 5 .
formula 1 is nice and the pilots always made use of it .
and verdi always responded reasonably , but now that approach is over . the airline should ask itself if it 's really healthy to give the pilots such a prominent position as a pressure group in wage negotiations and to tell the more expendable employees - check-in personnel , flight attendants and catering staff - that they do n't have such a prominent position . verdi is responsible for the technicians , which can also be a pressure group , especially if they 're highly qualified .

is this an accurate estimation in your opinion ? cord schellenberg : it 's one speculation .
it 's possible that the costs for lufthansa are even higher , depending on how much external equipment and personnel it has to buy in .
but the strike is definitely having an effect on lufthansa . first of all , they have to inform all of their passengers around the world that they have to rebook their flights .
at the same time , they also have to set up replacement flight routes , change the technical planning for the planes and rework the flight crew schedules . in terms of organization , it 's a lot of work for lufthansa .
it also means financial costs , but , at the moment , it appears that costs are still lower for lufthansa than if they accepted the employees ' current demands . will lufthansa lose customers over the long term due to the strike ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german even organize strikes well , schellenberg said i think that customer faithfulness is very high at lufthansa .
that 's true both of customers on discount flights that are glad to be flying on a premium airline and of those that pay full price . in the middle and long term , people will forget the whole thing pretty quickly - particularly because the typical german value of " thoroughness " is apparent in how well lufthansa has re-planned the flights .
i think people are impressed by that . in other countries , like italy for example , a strike always means chaos .
but here in germany , even the strike is organized .
the airline is able to manage and goes to great expense to make the effect on passengers as small as possible . however , the consequences in the freight division will be more strongly felt than on the passenger side , because the freight customers see that their shipments ca n't be sent .
on the other hand , the explanation is reasonable for everyone . so the strike could actually have a positive effect on lufthansa 's image ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the pilots have gotten first-class treatment in the past at least it could bring recognition from the passengers .
everyone knows that strikes are n't common in germany , but also that they ca n't be avoided .
however , most strikes are conducted in such a way that the company does n't have any chance to react .
in this case , i think both sides are very prudent , and that 's certainly something the passengers will recognize . it 's not good for lufthansa 's image - that would be going too far - but i think most people would say , wow , the germans can even organize a strike well . ticket prices are something that affects the passengers even more .
lufthansa , like every other airline , is hit hard by rising fuel prices as well as the emissions trading program that the eu has approved to start in 2012 .
can travelers expect higher ticket prices in the near future ? yes , that 's not dependent on the strike .
it 's just a realistic view of the developments in the global economy .
when the economy cools down , the movement of people and goods naturally does as well .
the increase in kerosene prices came at the same time . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : verdi is losing members personnel costs are a separate matter .
it 's a normal part of business that personnel costs increase .
the lufthansa employees say , " the company did well in the past few years .
now we want to earn more too . "
that 's something that happens every year or so when wage negotiations take place and it does n't have to mean higher costs for the passengers . however , i think 1 euro , 19 euro and 29 euro tickets are now a thing of the past .
they never really existed anyways , because they were more of a marketing gimmick . there is a large discrepancy between lufthansa 's offer and the pay increase demands the union is making .
are verdi 's demands reasonable ? in the past few years , verdi has been sensitive and made demands that were reasonable for the airline .
but they were continuously passed up by the pilots .
the pilots were in formula 1 , so to speak , and the others in formula 5 .
formula 1 is nice and the pilots always made use of it .
and verdi always responded reasonably , but now that approach is over . the airline should ask itself if it 's really healthy to give the pilots such a prominent position as a pressure group in wage negotiations and to tell the more expendable employees - check-in personnel , flight attendants and catering staff - that they do n't have such a prominent position . verdi is responsible for the technicians , which can also be a pressure group , especially if they 're highly qualified .
if they do n't do their job , the planes ca n't be approved for takeoff .
verdi knows this and is taking advantage of it . the flight attendant union that is in competition with verdi is demanding 15 percent in the wage negotiations .
that shows the high stakes involved .
verdi really wants to achieve something for its members and does n't want the flight attendants in its organization to switch over to the other union . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : there 's a strong tradition of compromise in germany , said schellenberg verdi has been particularly active in the past few months with a series of strikes .
have they been emboldened by recent successes ? verdi is a bit like the spd -lsb- social democratic party -rsb- in germany : they 're losing members .
while spd puts on a show all year , verdi is trying to nail down some successes and achieve something for its members . lufthansa has n't made a counteroffer but said it 's willing to negotiate and private , informal have taken place .
are they dealing with the strike in the best way ? as i said , the germans can organize a strike well , on both sides .
it 's also a tradition in germany to find a compromise . i think the population is relatively relaxed .
it 's different than it might be in the us , for example , because here people say , " they 'll come to an agreement . "
you ca n't prescribe how they reach an agreement , but in the end both sides will calculate the costs and decide when they have to compromise . interview : kate bowen send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

he opted to delay his plea for 30 days and announced he would conduct his own defense . karadzic , who was no longer sporting the beard and long hair that helped him conceal his identity for over a decade , waived his right to representation during the hearing on thursday , july 31 . when judge alphons orie noted that he was alone , the wartime leader smiled and responded , " i have an invisible adviser , but i have decided to defend myself . " orie , who said he expected the trial to last for many months , gave karadzic 30 days to decide a plea at the initial hour-long hearing of the international criminal tribunal for the former yugoslavia .
the trial was adjourned until aug .
29 . bildunterschrift : many observers were surprised at karadzic 's clean-cut appearance repeat performance ? karadzic said that - like his former ally - he intends to defend himself throughout the rest of the trial .
slobodan milosevic , who was accused of crimes against humanity for his role in the bosnian wars , used this as a delaying tactic to drag out his trial at the criminal tribunal in the hague for years , dying in 2006 before it ended . karadzic , who is the most prominent balkans war crimes suspect to be arrested after milosevic , said on thursday that he would also reveal " numerous irregularities " related to his presence at the hearing . " i will inform the court of the many mistakes and irregularities , like the mistaken date of my arrest , " the 63-year-old said . he claimed that under the dayton accord , which ended the bosnian war and brokered by former us assistant secretary of state richard holbrooke , an agreement was made that he would not be brought to trial if he withdrew from public life . orie interrupted the former bosnian serb leader when he tried to read a prepared four-page statement about this , and said he should send the information to the court in writing . chief prosecutor serge brammetz said lessons had been learned from the milosevic case . " of course , it will take some months before the prosecution and defense will be ready to start , " he told reporters .
" it will be a complex trial , but we are fully aware of the importance of being efficient . " some observers say he is likely to use the trial to illuminate claims that a shady deal with the west helped him avoid detention for so long . " this is a political man , a former poet , he likes being the center of attention , " international justice expert heikelina verrijn stuart told afp news agency . charges include siege and massacre atrocities bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : karadzic had posed for years as an alternative medicine practitioner during thursday 's hearing , orie read out the 11 war crimes charges that were first leveled against karadzic in 1995 .
the majority of the charges against karadzic focus on his role in the siege of sarajevo and the srebrenica massacre . some 8,000 muslim men and boys were killed in the un safe haven of srebrenica , while the siege of sarajevo , which lasted over three years , is estimated to have left some 10,000 people dead .

soviet soldiers of the 40th army rolled into afghanistan in august 1978 , beginning a devastating nine-year war which bombed most of the central asian nation back into the dark ages . the invasion increased the tensions between the superpowers in a cold war which had already rumbled on for over 30 years . in an attempt to force the soviets to pull out of afghanistan , president jimmy carter issued an ultimatum that the united states would boycott the moscow games if soviet troops had not withdrawn from the country by 12:01 a.m.
eastern standard time on february 20 , 1980 .
after the deadline passed and the soviet-afghan war continued unabated , carter confirmed the boycott of the games on march 21 . athletes allowed to compete despite boycott the us was joined in its boycott by the likes of japan , west germany , china , the philippines and canada .
the united kingdom , france and greece supported the boycott but allowed their athletes to participate if they wished . the united kingdom and france sent a much smaller delegation of athletes than usual .
however , the uk delegation was the largest from western europe , with 170 athletes applying to compete . the nations that fully boycotted the games held their own event in the philippines . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the olympic flag was used more times than ever before those athletes attending from boycott nations were joined by those from fully participating countries in marching under the olympic flag , and not their own at the opening and closing ceremony in support of the games and not the political maneuvers that had drastically affected a number of events . during the closing ceremony , the traditional unfurling of the flag of the next olympic host nation , in this case the united states , was adapted .
instead of the stars and stripes , the flag of los angeles , the next host city , was used . the olympic anthem was also played at medal ceremonies in favor of the national anthems of winning athletes from boycott nations .
as a result , the olympic flag and anthem were used on a number of occasions . despite the disruptions to many events and the fact that only81 nations participated , more world records were set in moscow than in the previous games in montreal in 1976 . tit-for-tat boycott follows in la 1984 bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " to russia with love !
wish you were here " in what appeared to be a tit-for-tat boycott , the soviet union and 14 eastern bloc countries would boycott the 1984 olympic games in los angeles .
iran and libya also boycotted for different reasons than revenge for the moscow boycott . the soviets stated that their decision not to attend came from security concerns and " chauvinistic sentiments and an anti-soviet hysteria being whipped up in the united states . " just as the us-led boycott nations had done in 1980 , those refusing to take part in the 1984 games held their own . boycotting countries organized their own major events over july and august 1984 , called the friendship games which featured 50 nations and which took place in nine countries . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the nation-state has had its day , writes political scientist winfried boettcher .
he calls instead for a europe built along regional lines that would help meet people 's cultural and economic needs . winfried böttcher is an emeritus professor of politics at the rwth aachen university , specializing in european politics .
he is particularly interested in the concept of a federal europe . the approach towards unifying europe has not changed since the founding of the coal and steel community over 50 years ago .
the absence of long-term goals means that cooperation continues to function on a trial-and-error basis .
varying interests , needs , functions and tasks continue to search for adequate organizational forms . the talk is still about moving towards the ever closer integration of the peoples of europe .
even today , no one can bring themselves to say that europe is amalgamating .
people approach europe pragmatically without knowing what form it should ultimately assume .
no one asks how we would like to live in europe in the future .
the nation-states , as the enablers of so-called european integration , prefer this functionalist method if only because it secures them the largest entitlements in terms of sovereignty . the future is federal bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : boettcher believes europe 's survival depends on subsidiarity by contrast , i believe that europe will only have a future if a federal concept places the normative question at the center of the debate .
unlike the existing functionalist concept , this idea is based on a clear integration approach .
according to johan galtung , this is a process in which two or more political protagonists come together to form a new protagonist .
correspondingly , europe could be united politically , judicially , economically and socially , while preserving its cultural plurality . this is conditional upon the relinquishing of national , power-oriented sovereignty and submitting to a common will .
the nation-state has fulfilled its historical function .
nowadays , it is one of the major troublemakers in the european integration process .
the theory of sovereignty - which is connected to state and the good of the state and which separates politics and morality and gives absolute primacy to the goals of the state - is no longer viable .
the citizen is the central democratic figure in our counter model , which is based on a concept of a europe of the regions . democracy brought closer to home bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : regionalism could offer a way out of the current impasse humans , as supranational beings , are politically active in their own regions where they are directly affected by political decisions .
regional society , in the form of civil society , is responsible for making decisions that are politically necessary .
in the ideal scenario , every single inhabitant of a region is also an active politician , albeit on various levels . the theoretical superstructure of a europe of regions is manifested in the principle of reason of region , as a kind of socialized reason of state .
the reason of region means that a region determines its goals according to its own rules , on the basis of the structural principle of " subsidiarity " on a sub-national level , i.e. within the framework of a constitutional , federal european structure .
each region lives according to its own " reason , " deploying its own endogenous potential and taking into account its chief particularities in cultural , social and , to a large extent , political autonomy and self-realization . rethinking subsidiarity regionalism and subsidiarity are inherently interdependent .
however , in our understanding of subsidiarity we go far beyond what is stated in article five of the treaty of amsterdam .
we define subsidiarity as " actively supporting a nation-state or the european union , to develop local and regional subsystems so that democratic participation is improved , even if this means accepting a loss of power at the other levels . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : regional peculiarities will be championed in a federal europe if the principle of subsidiarity is understood in this way , it supports and strengthens an autonomous , lively regionalism .
by this , we understand something that is close to people 's everyday lives and is able to solve the problems that arise , if possible with the united and democratic participation of everyone involved .
the attempt to build a europe imposed from above is susceptible to crisis .
as the eu continues to expand , it will become increasingly vulnerable .
europe 's chances come from below , if it helps to meet people 's educational , cultural , leisure and welfare needs and if " normal " employees get the feeling that they would be worse off without the european union . breaking open encrusted power structures to sum up : the future of the european union can only survive both domestically and internationally , if the bloc develops a constitution that aims to set up a regional , federal system .
the structural principle of subsidiarity will break open encrusted power structures and lead to an efficient overhaul of existing power structures .
the focus will be on living democracy .
it will be tangible and close to the people .
as a result , it will be possible to develop adequate strategies for shaping our own european future and lending a european dimension to the future shape of the world . winfried boettcher -lrb- jg -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the jobless rate was up 0.2 percent to 7.7 percent . this was , however , 505,000 less than the numbers out of work in unadjusted terms in july last year , when the unemployment rate stood at 8.9 percent .
in seasonally adjusted terms , unemployment fell by 20,000 to 3.25 million .
the number of unemployed had been shrinking fast in recent months , falling below 8 percent in may for the first time in 16 years .
releasing the data , labour office chief frank-juergen weise said developments on the labour market remained positive despite signs that it was losing some of its momentum .
he said that employers ' demand for workers remained high .
but a steady stream of data and economic sentiment surveys have pointed to the nation 's economy losing steam amid fears that inflation has been picking up on the back of high food and energy costs .
minimal economic growth expected german business confidence dropped to near a three-year low in july , according to a key survey drawn up by the ifo institute for economic research and released this month .
" these results suggest the economic upswing is coming to an end , " said ifo chief hans-werner sinn , releasing the latest report .
while german exports recorded their biggest fall in about four years in may , factory orders fell for the sixth consecutive month in may and industrial production also dropped sharply .
this points to economic growth sliding during the second quarter after a strong start to the year .

the museum aims to help visitors immerse themselves in the architecture , sounds and smells of the roman settlement . germanic and celtic barbarians , accustomed to living in squat log huts , must have gasped in amazement when they first caught sight of the towering town center of colonia ulpia traiana some 2,000 years ago . the museum evokes the lofty roman basilica , which served as a lobby for the baths .
the 24-meter -lrb- 79-foot -rrb- building was the height of a modern-day , eight-story apartment and had a gabled roof topped off with red roman tiles . built to scale bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : visitors might feel like they 've entered a time warp to help visitors understand the massive scale of the buildings , architects built steel-framed buildings the same size as the originals on the site of the old bathhouse and ancillary structures .
its height was calculated from the dimensions of its foundations . the new museum , part of the archaeological park at xanten -lrb- apx -rrb- , aims to offer the modern visitor a fresh perspective on roman civilization .
it 's out-of-the-way location means that the museum does not fight for space with a bustling modern city like the many archaeological remains that can be found in german cities such as trier , mainz , cologne and bonn . inside , visitors can see all the oddities that have been excavated from the site in the rhine valley , ranging from the waste heap of a workshop that used to make clay lamps to the gravestones of important citizens and the remains of a roman river barge hung in mid-air . getting a feel for the times bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the museum incorporates numerous archaeological finds the 22.5 million euro -lrb- $ 35 million -rrb- museum is set to open on aug .
16 , an apx spokesman told dpa news agency . the designers wanted visitors to understand the smells and sights of ancient rome .
there are boxes where visitors can feel the ruins ' broken roof tiles or smell typical roman spices . " our museum is not there to show which archaeologists dug up the most , " hans-joachim schalles , director of the museum , told dpa .
" it 's there so ordinary people can see what a roman town was like . " visitors can walk on a glass floor over a lane with the deep wheel-ruts of roman carts in it and the footprints of children 's bare feet and the hob-nailed boots of roman soldiers , all preserved for nearly 20 centuries in the mud . the museum 's 2,500 items show how an earlier germanic village was converted into a rich city of the roman empire , decorated with murals in the style of pompeii and with expensive glassware on the tables and was then conquered by frankish tribes . excavation continues at site bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : archaeologists have made many important finds in xanten the biggest item in the new museum building is a barge , the smallest the bones of a roman lapdog .
next door are the remains of the baths , which are protected from rain and snow by sheds which allow the outside air to circulate . experience has shown this is the best way to stop the remains from either completely drying out or becoming moldy from the dampness . finds such as a german silver hairpin suggest that the colonia was an ethnically mixed place , with celts and germans living among the romans and praying to their own gods . the legions of caesar augustus brought this region under roman control and a collection of their rough helmets is also in the museum .
concealed loudspeakers emit chatter in latin and other ancient tongues , as might have been heard on the town marketplace . around the year 100 of the common era , the roman emperor trajan funded its expansion into a city of about 10,000 bearing his name . thereafter it was a major city of the northern empire . most of the ruins slumber on undisturbed under the green grass of the apx .
archaeologists are likely to be burrowing and mapping the ancient town for many years to come .
local authorities hope to eventually expand the park to 73 hectares -lrb- 180 acres -rrb- to embrace the entire site . dw staff -lrb- th -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the nation-state has had its day , writes political scientist winfried boettcher .
he calls instead for a europe built along regional lines that would help meet people 's cultural and economic needs . winfried böttcher is an emeritus professor of politics at the rwth aachen university , specializing in european politics .
he is particularly interested in the concept of a federal europe . the approach towards unifying europe has not changed since the founding of the coal and steel community over 50 years ago .
the absence of long-term goals means that cooperation continues to function on a trial-and-error basis .
varying interests , needs , functions and tasks continue to search for adequate organizational forms . the talk is still about moving towards the ever closer integration of the peoples of europe .
even today , no one can bring themselves to say that europe is amalgamating .
people approach europe pragmatically without knowing what form it should ultimately assume .
no one asks how we would like to live in europe in the future .
the nation-states , as the enablers of so-called european integration , prefer this functionalist method if only because it secures them the largest entitlements in terms of sovereignty . the future is federal bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : boettcher believes europe 's survival depends on subsidiarity by contrast , i believe that europe will only have a future if a federal concept places the normative question at the center of the debate .
unlike the existing functionalist concept , this idea is based on a clear integration approach .
according to johan galtung , this is a process in which two or more political protagonists come together to form a new protagonist .
correspondingly , europe could be united politically , judicially , economically and socially , while preserving its cultural plurality . this is conditional upon the relinquishing of national , power-oriented sovereignty and submitting to a common will .
the nation-state has fulfilled its historical function .
nowadays , it is one of the major troublemakers in the european integration process .
the theory of sovereignty - which is connected to state and the good of the state and which separates politics and morality and gives absolute primacy to the goals of the state - is no longer viable .

regional society , in the form of civil society , is responsible for making decisions that are politically necessary .
in the ideal scenario , every single inhabitant of a region is also an active politician , albeit on various levels . the theoretical superstructure of a europe of regions is manifested in the principle of reason of region , as a kind of socialized reason of state .
the reason of region means that a region determines its goals according to its own rules , on the basis of the structural principle of " subsidiarity " on a sub-national level , i.e. within the framework of a constitutional , federal european structure .
each region lives according to its own " reason , " deploying its own endogenous potential and taking into account its chief particularities in cultural , social and , to a large extent , political autonomy and self-realization . rethinking subsidiarity regionalism and subsidiarity are inherently interdependent .
however , in our understanding of subsidiarity we go far beyond what is stated in article five of the treaty of amsterdam .
we define subsidiarity as " actively supporting a nation-state or the european union , to develop local and regional subsystems so that democratic participation is improved , even if this means accepting a loss of power at the other levels . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : regional peculiarities will be championed in a federal europe if the principle of subsidiarity is understood in this way , it supports and strengthens an autonomous , lively regionalism .

the jobless rate was up 0.2 percent to 7.7 percent . this was , however , 505,000 less than the numbers out of work in unadjusted terms in july last year , when the unemployment rate stood at 8.9 percent .
in seasonally adjusted terms , unemployment fell by 20,000 to 3.25 million .
the number of unemployed had been shrinking fast in recent months , falling below 8 percent in may for the first time in 16 years .
releasing the data , labour office chief frank-juergen weise said developments on the labour market remained positive despite signs that it was losing some of its momentum .
he said that employers ' demand for workers remained high .
but a steady stream of data and economic sentiment surveys have pointed to the nation 's economy losing steam amid fears that inflation has been picking up on the back of high food and energy costs .
minimal economic growth expected german business confidence dropped to near a three-year low in july , according to a key survey drawn up by the ifo institute for economic research and released this month .
" these results suggest the economic upswing is coming to an end , " said ifo chief hans-werner sinn , releasing the latest report .
while german exports recorded their biggest fall in about four years in may , factory orders fell for the sixth consecutive month in may and industrial production also dropped sharply .
this points to economic growth sliding during the second quarter after a strong start to the year .

but with the rest of europe banking on nuclear , german scientists don ’ t want to miss out on future developments . german research minister annette schavan said this week she will increase funding for nuclear research .
her announcement may have come as a surprise to those who believe that more money to be spent on research in this field is bound to contradict an agreement to phase out nuclear energy in germany completely . the phase-out deal was struck by the former coalition government of social democrats and greens .
it is still binding for the ruling grand coalition of chancellor angela merkel . schavan , a member of merkel 's christian democratic union , says that allocating more resources to nuclear research does not really undermine the country 's ambition to survive without atomic power .

some lawmakers , including social democrat research expert joerg tauss , are reported to have qualms about her plans .
they believe that a good proportion of the additional money earmarked for atomic research may well end up in projects facilitating the development of a fourth generation of nuclear power plants . " we 'll be watching very carefully whether the research minister will actually earmark resources for research on this new line of reactors , " tauss told the frankfurter rundschau daily .

greens co-leader reinhard buetikofer said that it would be outrageous if even the slightest part of the extra money would go towards research on the new reactor line . " why should taxpayers ' money be misused for research on reactors , which will not be built in germany at all in line with the coalition treaty on the complete phase-out of nuclear energy here " , buetikofer told dw-world.de.

but with the rest of europe banking on nuclear , german scientists don ’ t want to miss out on future developments . german research minister annette schavan said this week she will increase funding for nuclear research .

the move comes after the former economy and labor minister implicitly advised against voting for the spd in a key state key poll . the decision , the culmination of a dispute dating back to january , represents just one more problem for the party , which is currently trailing its conservative coalition partners in the polls by 13 percent with around 26 percent support . observers see it a sign of the developing battle between the party 's left and reformist wings . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : clement said the decision had come like a " bolt from the blue " clement angered spd members in january when he wrote a guest column for a conservative newspaper in which he queried the suitability of andrea ypsilanti for the premiership of hesse during a closely fought election campaign .
he warned that the hesse spd would " lurch to the left " under ypsilanti and attacked her energy policy after she opposed both nuclear and coal-fired power stations . " for this reason , consider carefully who should be trusted with responsibility for the state and vote carefully , " he wrote just a week before the jan .
27 state elections , in which the spd narrowly failed to oust the governing christian democrats . an attack on party solidarity an sdp arbitration committee in north rhine-westphalia , where clement was state premier before taking the economics and labor minister in the government of former chancellor gerhard schroeder , ruled that clement had undermined party solidarity . " he called on people not to vote for our party and that is damaging behavior , " a local spd leader in north rhine-westphalia , rudolf malzahn , told news channel n24 , defending the party 's decision .
" he said he would do it again anytime .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de aviation -pipe- 31.07.2008 lufthansa strike displays german thoroughness , expert says großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the price of the strike is n't yet high enough for lufthansa to give in on wage demands dw-world.de spoke with aviation expert cord schellenberg about the costs and effects of the strike at lufthansa , german organization and the demands on the table . dw-world.de : the trade union verdi has estimated that the strike is costing lufthansa about 5 million euros -lrb- $ 7.8 million -rrb- a day .
is this an accurate estimation in your opinion ? cord schellenberg : it 's one speculation .
it 's possible that the costs for lufthansa are even higher , depending on how much external equipment and personnel it has to buy in .
but the strike is definitely having an effect on lufthansa . first of all , they have to inform all of their passengers around the world that they have to rebook their flights .
at the same time , they also have to set up replacement flight routes , change the technical planning for the planes and rework the flight crew schedules . in terms of organization , it 's a lot of work for lufthansa .
it also means financial costs , but , at the moment , it appears that costs are still lower for lufthansa than if they accepted the employees ' current demands . will lufthansa lose customers over the long term due to the strike ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german even organize strikes well , schellenberg said i think that customer faithfulness is very high at lufthansa .
that 's true both of customers on discount flights that are glad to be flying on a premium airline and of those that pay full price . in the middle and long term , people will forget the whole thing pretty quickly - particularly because the typical german value of " thoroughness " is apparent in how well lufthansa has re-planned the flights .
i think people are impressed by that . in other countries , like italy for example , a strike always means chaos .
but here in germany , even the strike is organized .
the airline is able to manage and goes to great expense to make the effect on passengers as small as possible . however , the consequences in the freight division will be more strongly felt than on the passenger side , because the freight customers see that their shipments ca n't be sent .
on the other hand , the explanation is reasonable for everyone . so the strike could actually have a positive effect on lufthansa 's image ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the pilots have gotten first-class treatment in the past at least it could bring recognition from the passengers .
everyone knows that strikes are n't common in germany , but also that they ca n't be avoided .
however , most strikes are conducted in such a way that the company does n't have any chance to react .
in this case , i think both sides are very prudent , and that 's certainly something the passengers will recognize . it 's not good for lufthansa 's image - that would be going too far - but i think most people would say , wow , the germans can even organize a strike well . ticket prices are something that affects the passengers even more .
lufthansa , like every other airline , is hit hard by rising fuel prices as well as the emissions trading program that the eu has approved to start in 2012 .
can travelers expect higher ticket prices in the near future ? yes , that 's not dependent on the strike .
it 's just a realistic view of the developments in the global economy .
when the economy cools down , the movement of people and goods naturally does as well .
the increase in kerosene prices came at the same time . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : verdi is losing members personnel costs are a separate matter .
it 's a normal part of business that personnel costs increase .
the lufthansa employees say , " the company did well in the past few years .
now we want to earn more too . "
that 's something that happens every year or so when wage negotiations take place and it does n't have to mean higher costs for the passengers . however , i think 1 euro , 19 euro and 29 euro tickets are now a thing of the past .
they never really existed anyways , because they were more of a marketing gimmick . there is a large discrepancy between lufthansa 's offer and the pay increase demands the union is making .
are verdi 's demands reasonable ? in the past few years , verdi has been sensitive and made demands that were reasonable for the airline .
but they were continuously passed up by the pilots .
the pilots were in formula 1 , so to speak , and the others in formula 5 .
formula 1 is nice and the pilots always made use of it .
and verdi always responded reasonably , but now that approach is over . the airline should ask itself if it 's really healthy to give the pilots such a prominent position as a pressure group in wage negotiations and to tell the more expendable employees - check-in personnel , flight attendants and catering staff - that they do n't have such a prominent position . verdi is responsible for the technicians , which can also be a pressure group , especially if they 're highly qualified .
if they do n't do their job , the planes ca n't be approved for takeoff .
verdi knows this and is taking advantage of it . the flight attendant union that is in competition with verdi is demanding 15 percent in the wage negotiations .
that shows the high stakes involved .
verdi really wants to achieve something for its members and does n't want the flight attendants in its organization to switch over to the other union . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : there 's a strong tradition of compromise in germany , said schellenberg verdi has been particularly active in the past few months with a series of strikes .
have they been emboldened by recent successes ? verdi is a bit like the spd -lsb- social democratic party -rsb- in germany : they 're losing members .
while spd puts on a show all year , verdi is trying to nail down some successes and achieve something for its members . lufthansa has n't made a counteroffer but said it 's willing to negotiate and private , informal have taken place .
are they dealing with the strike in the best way ? as i said , the germans can organize a strike well , on both sides .
it 's also a tradition in germany to find a compromise . i think the population is relatively relaxed .
it 's different than it might be in the us , for example , because here people say , " they 'll come to an agreement . "
you ca n't prescribe how they reach an agreement , but in the end both sides will calculate the costs and decide when they have to compromise . interview : kate bowen send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

is this an accurate estimation in your opinion ? cord schellenberg : it 's one speculation .
it 's possible that the costs for lufthansa are even higher , depending on how much external equipment and personnel it has to buy in .
but the strike is definitely having an effect on lufthansa . first of all , they have to inform all of their passengers around the world that they have to rebook their flights .
at the same time , they also have to set up replacement flight routes , change the technical planning for the planes and rework the flight crew schedules . in terms of organization , it 's a lot of work for lufthansa .
it also means financial costs , but , at the moment , it appears that costs are still lower for lufthansa than if they accepted the employees ' current demands . will lufthansa lose customers over the long term due to the strike ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german even organize strikes well , schellenberg said i think that customer faithfulness is very high at lufthansa .
that 's true both of customers on discount flights that are glad to be flying on a premium airline and of those that pay full price . in the middle and long term , people will forget the whole thing pretty quickly - particularly because the typical german value of " thoroughness " is apparent in how well lufthansa has re-planned the flights .
i think people are impressed by that . in other countries , like italy for example , a strike always means chaos .
but here in germany , even the strike is organized .
the airline is able to manage and goes to great expense to make the effect on passengers as small as possible . however , the consequences in the freight division will be more strongly felt than on the passenger side , because the freight customers see that their shipments ca n't be sent .
on the other hand , the explanation is reasonable for everyone . so the strike could actually have a positive effect on lufthansa 's image ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the pilots have gotten first-class treatment in the past at least it could bring recognition from the passengers .
everyone knows that strikes are n't common in germany , but also that they ca n't be avoided .
however , most strikes are conducted in such a way that the company does n't have any chance to react .
in this case , i think both sides are very prudent , and that 's certainly something the passengers will recognize . it 's not good for lufthansa 's image - that would be going too far - but i think most people would say , wow , the germans can even organize a strike well . ticket prices are something that affects the passengers even more .
lufthansa , like every other airline , is hit hard by rising fuel prices as well as the emissions trading program that the eu has approved to start in 2012 .

the nation-state has had its day , writes political scientist winfried boettcher .
he calls instead for a europe built along regional lines that would help meet people 's cultural and economic needs . winfried böttcher is an emeritus professor of politics at the rwth aachen university , specializing in european politics .
he is particularly interested in the concept of a federal europe . the approach towards unifying europe has not changed since the founding of the coal and steel community over 50 years ago .
the absence of long-term goals means that cooperation continues to function on a trial-and-error basis .
varying interests , needs , functions and tasks continue to search for adequate organizational forms . the talk is still about moving towards the ever closer integration of the peoples of europe .
even today , no one can bring themselves to say that europe is amalgamating .
people approach europe pragmatically without knowing what form it should ultimately assume .
no one asks how we would like to live in europe in the future .
the nation-states , as the enablers of so-called european integration , prefer this functionalist method if only because it secures them the largest entitlements in terms of sovereignty . the future is federal bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : boettcher believes europe 's survival depends on subsidiarity by contrast , i believe that europe will only have a future if a federal concept places the normative question at the center of the debate .
unlike the existing functionalist concept , this idea is based on a clear integration approach .
according to johan galtung , this is a process in which two or more political protagonists come together to form a new protagonist .
correspondingly , europe could be united politically , judicially , economically and socially , while preserving its cultural plurality . this is conditional upon the relinquishing of national , power-oriented sovereignty and submitting to a common will .
the nation-state has fulfilled its historical function .
nowadays , it is one of the major troublemakers in the european integration process .
the theory of sovereignty - which is connected to state and the good of the state and which separates politics and morality and gives absolute primacy to the goals of the state - is no longer viable .
the citizen is the central democratic figure in our counter model , which is based on a concept of a europe of the regions . democracy brought closer to home bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : regionalism could offer a way out of the current impasse humans , as supranational beings , are politically active in their own regions where they are directly affected by political decisions .
regional society , in the form of civil society , is responsible for making decisions that are politically necessary .
in the ideal scenario , every single inhabitant of a region is also an active politician , albeit on various levels . the theoretical superstructure of a europe of regions is manifested in the principle of reason of region , as a kind of socialized reason of state .
the reason of region means that a region determines its goals according to its own rules , on the basis of the structural principle of " subsidiarity " on a sub-national level , i.e. within the framework of a constitutional , federal european structure .
each region lives according to its own " reason , " deploying its own endogenous potential and taking into account its chief particularities in cultural , social and , to a large extent , political autonomy and self-realization . rethinking subsidiarity regionalism and subsidiarity are inherently interdependent .
however , in our understanding of subsidiarity we go far beyond what is stated in article five of the treaty of amsterdam .
we define subsidiarity as " actively supporting a nation-state or the european union , to develop local and regional subsystems so that democratic participation is improved , even if this means accepting a loss of power at the other levels . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : regional peculiarities will be championed in a federal europe if the principle of subsidiarity is understood in this way , it supports and strengthens an autonomous , lively regionalism .
by this , we understand something that is close to people 's everyday lives and is able to solve the problems that arise , if possible with the united and democratic participation of everyone involved .
the attempt to build a europe imposed from above is susceptible to crisis .
as the eu continues to expand , it will become increasingly vulnerable .
europe 's chances come from below , if it helps to meet people 's educational , cultural , leisure and welfare needs and if " normal " employees get the feeling that they would be worse off without the european union . breaking open encrusted power structures to sum up : the future of the european union can only survive both domestically and internationally , if the bloc develops a constitution that aims to set up a regional , federal system .
the structural principle of subsidiarity will break open encrusted power structures and lead to an efficient overhaul of existing power structures .
the focus will be on living democracy .
it will be tangible and close to the people .
as a result , it will be possible to develop adequate strategies for shaping our own european future and lending a european dimension to the future shape of the world . winfried boettcher -lrb- jg -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

he opted to delay his plea for 30 days and announced he would conduct his own defense . karadzic , who was no longer sporting the beard and long hair that helped him conceal his identity for over a decade , waived his right to representation during the hearing on thursday , july 31 . when judge alphons orie noted that he was alone , the wartime leader smiled and responded , " i have an invisible adviser , but i have decided to defend myself . " orie , who said he expected the trial to last for many months , gave karadzic 30 days to decide a plea at the initial hour-long hearing of the international criminal tribunal for the former yugoslavia .
the trial was adjourned until aug .
29 . bildunterschrift : many observers were surprised at karadzic 's clean-cut appearance repeat performance ? karadzic said that - like his former ally - he intends to defend himself throughout the rest of the trial .
slobodan milosevic , who was accused of crimes against humanity for his role in the bosnian wars , used this as a delaying tactic to drag out his trial at the criminal tribunal in the hague for years , dying in 2006 before it ended . karadzic , who is the most prominent balkans war crimes suspect to be arrested after milosevic , said on thursday that he would also reveal " numerous irregularities " related to his presence at the hearing . " i will inform the court of the many mistakes and irregularities , like the mistaken date of my arrest , " the 63-year-old said . he claimed that under the dayton accord , which ended the bosnian war and brokered by former us assistant secretary of state richard holbrooke , an agreement was made that he would not be brought to trial if he withdrew from public life . orie interrupted the former bosnian serb leader when he tried to read a prepared four-page statement about this , and said he should send the information to the court in writing . chief prosecutor serge brammetz said lessons had been learned from the milosevic case . " of course , it will take some months before the prosecution and defense will be ready to start , " he told reporters .
" it will be a complex trial , but we are fully aware of the importance of being efficient . " some observers say he is likely to use the trial to illuminate claims that a shady deal with the west helped him avoid detention for so long . " this is a political man , a former poet , he likes being the center of attention , " international justice expert heikelina verrijn stuart told afp news agency . charges include siege and massacre atrocities bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : karadzic had posed for years as an alternative medicine practitioner during thursday 's hearing , orie read out the 11 war crimes charges that were first leveled against karadzic in 1995 .
the majority of the charges against karadzic focus on his role in the siege of sarajevo and the srebrenica massacre . some 8,000 muslim men and boys were killed in the un safe haven of srebrenica , while the siege of sarajevo , which lasted over three years , is estimated to have left some 10,000 people dead .

" the ministry will talk to the highest officials within the german government to obtain clarification and express its concern over the fact that the german office of export controls gave its green light to the contract , " foreign ministry spokesman arye mekel told the afp news agency .
" the fact that germany , a member of the european group eu3 , which includes france , britain and germany , is adopting a position that harms international efforts to considerably toughen sanctions against iran over its continued nuclear program , is worrying , " the ministry said in a statement . but the german economics ministry said in a statement that the liquefied natural gas plants did not fall under any category of goods banned under the sanctions , adding that there was no legal means for preventing the transaction . goods " not of controversial nature " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : tehran is accused of using its nuclear energy program as a cover to build nuclear weapons the german export control office described the rift as a " misunderstanding . "
spokesman holger beutel said the 100 million euro -lrb- $ 156 million -rrb- deal between the german engineering firm steiner prematechnik gastec and iran was " for the export of goods that are not of a controversial nature . " the three systems are to cool and compress natural gas into liquid form so it can be transported by ship to export customers . this week the simon wiesenthal centre appealed to berlin to prohibit the deal .
jewish groups have criticized the contract , charging that germany is fostering economic relations with iran despite that nation 's nuclear program and its threats toward israel . germany is one of iran 's leading trading partners .
last year , german exports to the country totaled some 3.6 billion euros . berlin has , however , reduced export guarantees with iran , and german banks have largely ceased doing business with the islamic republic due to its nuclear program .
tehran insists its nuclear activities are non-military , but the west , including the united states many european union nations , fears iran is covertly trying to build nuclear weapons . germany is one of six states leading international efforts to thwart iranian nuclear ambitions .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de in focus : euro-visions : debating europe 's future making the case for a multi-speed europe greens politician : turkish eu entry is in europe 's interest europe needs better ideas , communication , expert says europeans seek eu response to global issues european union -pipe- 31.07.2008 eu should become union of european regions , expert says großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : will people get a taste for a europe of the regions ?
the nation-state has had its day , writes political scientist winfried boettcher .
he calls instead for a europe built along regional lines that would help meet people 's cultural and economic needs . winfried böttcher is an emeritus professor of politics at the rwth aachen university , specializing in european politics .
he is particularly interested in the concept of a federal europe . the approach towards unifying europe has not changed since the founding of the coal and steel community over 50 years ago .
the absence of long-term goals means that cooperation continues to function on a trial-and-error basis .
varying interests , needs , functions and tasks continue to search for adequate organizational forms . the talk is still about moving towards the ever closer integration of the peoples of europe .
even today , no one can bring themselves to say that europe is amalgamating .
people approach europe pragmatically without knowing what form it should ultimately assume .
no one asks how we would like to live in europe in the future .
the nation-states , as the enablers of so-called european integration , prefer this functionalist method if only because it secures them the largest entitlements in terms of sovereignty . the future is federal bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : boettcher believes europe 's survival depends on subsidiarity by contrast , i believe that europe will only have a future if a federal concept places the normative question at the center of the debate .
unlike the existing functionalist concept , this idea is based on a clear integration approach .
according to johan galtung , this is a process in which two or more political protagonists come together to form a new protagonist .
correspondingly , europe could be united politically , judicially , economically and socially , while preserving its cultural plurality . this is conditional upon the relinquishing of national , power-oriented sovereignty and submitting to a common will .
the nation-state has fulfilled its historical function .
nowadays , it is one of the major troublemakers in the european integration process .
the theory of sovereignty - which is connected to state and the good of the state and which separates politics and morality and gives absolute primacy to the goals of the state - is no longer viable .
the citizen is the central democratic figure in our counter model , which is based on a concept of a europe of the regions . democracy brought closer to home bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : regionalism could offer a way out of the current impasse humans , as supranational beings , are politically active in their own regions where they are directly affected by political decisions .
regional society , in the form of civil society , is responsible for making decisions that are politically necessary .
in the ideal scenario , every single inhabitant of a region is also an active politician , albeit on various levels . the theoretical superstructure of a europe of regions is manifested in the principle of reason of region , as a kind of socialized reason of state .
the reason of region means that a region determines its goals according to its own rules , on the basis of the structural principle of " subsidiarity " on a sub-national level , i.e. within the framework of a constitutional , federal european structure .
each region lives according to its own " reason , " deploying its own endogenous potential and taking into account its chief particularities in cultural , social and , to a large extent , political autonomy and self-realization . rethinking subsidiarity regionalism and subsidiarity are inherently interdependent .
however , in our understanding of subsidiarity we go far beyond what is stated in article five of the treaty of amsterdam .
we define subsidiarity as " actively supporting a nation-state or the european union , to develop local and regional subsystems so that democratic participation is improved , even if this means accepting a loss of power at the other levels . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : regional peculiarities will be championed in a federal europe if the principle of subsidiarity is understood in this way , it supports and strengthens an autonomous , lively regionalism .
by this , we understand something that is close to people 's everyday lives and is able to solve the problems that arise , if possible with the united and democratic participation of everyone involved .
the attempt to build a europe imposed from above is susceptible to crisis .
as the eu continues to expand , it will become increasingly vulnerable .
europe 's chances come from below , if it helps to meet people 's educational , cultural , leisure and welfare needs and if " normal " employees get the feeling that they would be worse off without the european union . breaking open encrusted power structures to sum up : the future of the european union can only survive both domestically and internationally , if the bloc develops a constitution that aims to set up a regional , federal system .
the structural principle of subsidiarity will break open encrusted power structures and lead to an efficient overhaul of existing power structures .

the nation-state has had its day , writes political scientist winfried boettcher .
he calls instead for a europe built along regional lines that would help meet people 's cultural and economic needs . winfried böttcher is an emeritus professor of politics at the rwth aachen university , specializing in european politics .
he is particularly interested in the concept of a federal europe . the approach towards unifying europe has not changed since the founding of the coal and steel community over 50 years ago .
the absence of long-term goals means that cooperation continues to function on a trial-and-error basis .
varying interests , needs , functions and tasks continue to search for adequate organizational forms . the talk is still about moving towards the ever closer integration of the peoples of europe .
even today , no one can bring themselves to say that europe is amalgamating .
people approach europe pragmatically without knowing what form it should ultimately assume .
no one asks how we would like to live in europe in the future .
the nation-states , as the enablers of so-called european integration , prefer this functionalist method if only because it secures them the largest entitlements in terms of sovereignty . the future is federal bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : boettcher believes europe 's survival depends on subsidiarity by contrast , i believe that europe will only have a future if a federal concept places the normative question at the center of the debate .
unlike the existing functionalist concept , this idea is based on a clear integration approach .
according to johan galtung , this is a process in which two or more political protagonists come together to form a new protagonist .
correspondingly , europe could be united politically , judicially , economically and socially , while preserving its cultural plurality . this is conditional upon the relinquishing of national , power-oriented sovereignty and submitting to a common will .
the nation-state has fulfilled its historical function .
nowadays , it is one of the major troublemakers in the european integration process .
the theory of sovereignty - which is connected to state and the good of the state and which separates politics and morality and gives absolute primacy to the goals of the state - is no longer viable .
the citizen is the central democratic figure in our counter model , which is based on a concept of a europe of the regions . democracy brought closer to home bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : regionalism could offer a way out of the current impasse humans , as supranational beings , are politically active in their own regions where they are directly affected by political decisions .
regional society , in the form of civil society , is responsible for making decisions that are politically necessary .
in the ideal scenario , every single inhabitant of a region is also an active politician , albeit on various levels . the theoretical superstructure of a europe of regions is manifested in the principle of reason of region , as a kind of socialized reason of state .
the reason of region means that a region determines its goals according to its own rules , on the basis of the structural principle of " subsidiarity " on a sub-national level , i.e. within the framework of a constitutional , federal european structure .
each region lives according to its own " reason , " deploying its own endogenous potential and taking into account its chief particularities in cultural , social and , to a large extent , political autonomy and self-realization . rethinking subsidiarity regionalism and subsidiarity are inherently interdependent .
however , in our understanding of subsidiarity we go far beyond what is stated in article five of the treaty of amsterdam .
we define subsidiarity as " actively supporting a nation-state or the european union , to develop local and regional subsystems so that democratic participation is improved , even if this means accepting a loss of power at the other levels . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : regional peculiarities will be championed in a federal europe if the principle of subsidiarity is understood in this way , it supports and strengthens an autonomous , lively regionalism .
by this , we understand something that is close to people 's everyday lives and is able to solve the problems that arise , if possible with the united and democratic participation of everyone involved .
the attempt to build a europe imposed from above is susceptible to crisis .
as the eu continues to expand , it will become increasingly vulnerable .
europe 's chances come from below , if it helps to meet people 's educational , cultural , leisure and welfare needs and if " normal " employees get the feeling that they would be worse off without the european union . breaking open encrusted power structures to sum up : the future of the european union can only survive both domestically and internationally , if the bloc develops a constitution that aims to set up a regional , federal system .
the structural principle of subsidiarity will break open encrusted power structures and lead to an efficient overhaul of existing power structures .
the focus will be on living democracy .
it will be tangible and close to the people .
as a result , it will be possible to develop adequate strategies for shaping our own european future and lending a european dimension to the future shape of the world . winfried boettcher -lrb- jg -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

soviet soldiers of the 40th army rolled into afghanistan in august 1978 , beginning a devastating nine-year war which bombed most of the central asian nation back into the dark ages . the invasion increased the tensions between the superpowers in a cold war which had already rumbled on for over 30 years . in an attempt to force the soviets to pull out of afghanistan , president jimmy carter issued an ultimatum that the united states would boycott the moscow games if soviet troops had not withdrawn from the country by 12:01 a.m.

soviet soldiers of the 40th army rolled into afghanistan in august 1978 , beginning a devastating nine-year war which bombed most of the central asian nation back into the dark ages . the invasion increased the tensions between the superpowers in a cold war which had already rumbled on for over 30 years . in an attempt to force the soviets to pull out of afghanistan , president jimmy carter issued an ultimatum that the united states would boycott the moscow games if soviet troops had not withdrawn from the country by 12:01 a.m.
eastern standard time on february 20 , 1980 .
after the deadline passed and the soviet-afghan war continued unabated , carter confirmed the boycott of the games on march 21 . athletes allowed to compete despite boycott the us was joined in its boycott by the likes of japan , west germany , china , the philippines and canada .
the united kingdom , france and greece supported the boycott but allowed their athletes to participate if they wished . the united kingdom and france sent a much smaller delegation of athletes than usual .
however , the uk delegation was the largest from western europe , with 170 athletes applying to compete . the nations that fully boycotted the games held their own event in the philippines . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the olympic flag was used more times than ever before those athletes attending from boycott nations were joined by those from fully participating countries in marching under the olympic flag , and not their own at the opening and closing ceremony in support of the games and not the political maneuvers that had drastically affected a number of events . during the closing ceremony , the traditional unfurling of the flag of the next olympic host nation , in this case the united states , was adapted .
instead of the stars and stripes , the flag of los angeles , the next host city , was used . the olympic anthem was also played at medal ceremonies in favor of the national anthems of winning athletes from boycott nations .
as a result , the olympic flag and anthem were used on a number of occasions . despite the disruptions to many events and the fact that only81 nations participated , more world records were set in moscow than in the previous games in montreal in 1976 . tit-for-tat boycott follows in la 1984 bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " to russia with love !
wish you were here " in what appeared to be a tit-for-tat boycott , the soviet union and 14 eastern bloc countries would boycott the 1984 olympic games in los angeles .
iran and libya also boycotted for different reasons than revenge for the moscow boycott . the soviets stated that their decision not to attend came from security concerns and " chauvinistic sentiments and an anti-soviet hysteria being whipped up in the united states . " just as the us-led boycott nations had done in 1980 , those refusing to take part in the 1984 games held their own . boycotting countries organized their own major events over july and august 1984 , called the friendship games which featured 50 nations and which took place in nine countries . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the nation-state has had its day , writes political scientist winfried boettcher .
he calls instead for a europe built along regional lines that would help meet people 's cultural and economic needs . winfried böttcher is an emeritus professor of politics at the rwth aachen university , specializing in european politics .
he is particularly interested in the concept of a federal europe . the approach towards unifying europe has not changed since the founding of the coal and steel community over 50 years ago .
the absence of long-term goals means that cooperation continues to function on a trial-and-error basis .
varying interests , needs , functions and tasks continue to search for adequate organizational forms . the talk is still about moving towards the ever closer integration of the peoples of europe .
even today , no one can bring themselves to say that europe is amalgamating .
people approach europe pragmatically without knowing what form it should ultimately assume .
no one asks how we would like to live in europe in the future .
the nation-states , as the enablers of so-called european integration , prefer this functionalist method if only because it secures them the largest entitlements in terms of sovereignty . the future is federal bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : boettcher believes europe 's survival depends on subsidiarity by contrast , i believe that europe will only have a future if a federal concept places the normative question at the center of the debate .
unlike the existing functionalist concept , this idea is based on a clear integration approach .
according to johan galtung , this is a process in which two or more political protagonists come together to form a new protagonist .
correspondingly , europe could be united politically , judicially , economically and socially , while preserving its cultural plurality . this is conditional upon the relinquishing of national , power-oriented sovereignty and submitting to a common will .
the nation-state has fulfilled its historical function .
nowadays , it is one of the major troublemakers in the european integration process .
the theory of sovereignty - which is connected to state and the good of the state and which separates politics and morality and gives absolute primacy to the goals of the state - is no longer viable .

regional society , in the form of civil society , is responsible for making decisions that are politically necessary .
in the ideal scenario , every single inhabitant of a region is also an active politician , albeit on various levels . the theoretical superstructure of a europe of regions is manifested in the principle of reason of region , as a kind of socialized reason of state .
the reason of region means that a region determines its goals according to its own rules , on the basis of the structural principle of " subsidiarity " on a sub-national level , i.e. within the framework of a constitutional , federal european structure .
each region lives according to its own " reason , " deploying its own endogenous potential and taking into account its chief particularities in cultural , social and , to a large extent , political autonomy and self-realization . rethinking subsidiarity regionalism and subsidiarity are inherently interdependent .
however , in our understanding of subsidiarity we go far beyond what is stated in article five of the treaty of amsterdam .
we define subsidiarity as " actively supporting a nation-state or the european union , to develop local and regional subsystems so that democratic participation is improved , even if this means accepting a loss of power at the other levels . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : regional peculiarities will be championed in a federal europe if the principle of subsidiarity is understood in this way , it supports and strengthens an autonomous , lively regionalism .

" the ministry will talk to the highest officials within the german government to obtain clarification and express its concern over the fact that the german office of export controls gave its green light to the contract , " foreign ministry spokesman arye mekel told the afp news agency .
" the fact that germany , a member of the european group eu3 , which includes france , britain and germany , is adopting a position that harms international efforts to considerably toughen sanctions against iran over its continued nuclear program , is worrying , " the ministry said in a statement . but the german economics ministry said in a statement that the liquefied natural gas plants did not fall under any category of goods banned under the sanctions , adding that there was no legal means for preventing the transaction . goods " not of controversial nature " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : tehran is accused of using its nuclear energy program as a cover to build nuclear weapons the german export control office described the rift as a " misunderstanding . "
spokesman holger beutel said the 100 million euro -lrb- $ 156 million -rrb- deal between the german engineering firm steiner prematechnik gastec and iran was " for the export of goods that are not of a controversial nature . " the three systems are to cool and compress natural gas into liquid form so it can be transported by ship to export customers . this week the simon wiesenthal centre appealed to berlin to prohibit the deal .
jewish groups have criticized the contract , charging that germany is fostering economic relations with iran despite that nation 's nuclear program and its threats toward israel . germany is one of iran 's leading trading partners .
last year , german exports to the country totaled some 3.6 billion euros . berlin has , however , reduced export guarantees with iran , and german banks have largely ceased doing business with the islamic republic due to its nuclear program .
tehran insists its nuclear activities are non-military , but the west , including the united states many european union nations , fears iran is covertly trying to build nuclear weapons . germany is one of six states leading international efforts to thwart iranian nuclear ambitions .

but with the rest of europe banking on nuclear , german scientists don ’ t want to miss out on future developments . german research minister annette schavan said this week she will increase funding for nuclear research .
her announcement may have come as a surprise to those who believe that more money to be spent on research in this field is bound to contradict an agreement to phase out nuclear energy in germany completely . the phase-out deal was struck by the former coalition government of social democrats and greens .
it is still binding for the ruling grand coalition of chancellor angela merkel . schavan , a member of merkel 's christian democratic union , says that allocating more resources to nuclear research does not really undermine the country 's ambition to survive without atomic power .

" as long as everywhere around us new power plants are being built , we can not afford to just sit back and invest nothing in nuclear safety and radiation protection . " skeptics up in arms but critics of the minister 's financial offensive do n't trust her announcements completely .
some lawmakers , including social democrat research expert joerg tauss , are reported to have qualms about her plans .
they believe that a good proportion of the additional money earmarked for atomic research may well end up in projects facilitating the development of a fourth generation of nuclear power plants . " we 'll be watching very carefully whether the research minister will actually earmark resources for research on this new line of reactors , " tauss told the frankfurter rundschau daily .

but with the rest of europe banking on nuclear , german scientists don ’ t want to miss out on future developments . german research minister annette schavan said this week she will increase funding for nuclear research .
her announcement may have come as a surprise to those who believe that more money to be spent on research in this field is bound to contradict an agreement to phase out nuclear energy in germany completely . the phase-out deal was struck by the former coalition government of social democrats and greens .
it is still binding for the ruling grand coalition of chancellor angela merkel . schavan , a member of merkel 's christian democratic union , says that allocating more resources to nuclear research does not really undermine the country 's ambition to survive without atomic power .
she claims that some 14 million euros -lrb- $ 22 million -rrb- annually will primarily be used to enhance nuclear safety , radiation protection and nuclear waste storage technologies . young scientists to benefit bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the last german nuclear power plants are supposed to shut down in 2020 the minister also made it clear that the allocated resources would likewise be used to enable young german scientists to keep abreast with the latest developments in nuclear research .

" we 'll be watching very carefully whether the research minister will actually earmark resources for research on this new line of reactors , " tauss told the frankfurter rundschau daily .

greens co-leader reinhard buetikofer said that it would be outrageous if even the slightest part of the extra money would go towards research on the new reactor line .

the museum aims to help visitors immerse themselves in the architecture , sounds and smells of the roman settlement . germanic and celtic barbarians , accustomed to living in squat log huts , must have gasped in amazement when they first caught sight of the towering town center of colonia ulpia traiana some 2,000 years ago . the museum evokes the lofty roman basilica , which served as a lobby for the baths .

the nation-state has had its day , writes political scientist winfried boettcher .
he calls instead for a europe built along regional lines that would help meet people 's cultural and economic needs . winfried böttcher is an emeritus professor of politics at the rwth aachen university , specializing in european politics .
he is particularly interested in the concept of a federal europe . the approach towards unifying europe has not changed since the founding of the coal and steel community over 50 years ago .
the absence of long-term goals means that cooperation continues to function on a trial-and-error basis .
varying interests , needs , functions and tasks continue to search for adequate organizational forms . the talk is still about moving towards the ever closer integration of the peoples of europe .
even today , no one can bring themselves to say that europe is amalgamating .
people approach europe pragmatically without knowing what form it should ultimately assume .
no one asks how we would like to live in europe in the future .
the nation-states , as the enablers of so-called european integration , prefer this functionalist method if only because it secures them the largest entitlements in terms of sovereignty . the future is federal bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : boettcher believes europe 's survival depends on subsidiarity by contrast , i believe that europe will only have a future if a federal concept places the normative question at the center of the debate .
unlike the existing functionalist concept , this idea is based on a clear integration approach .
according to johan galtung , this is a process in which two or more political protagonists come together to form a new protagonist .
correspondingly , europe could be united politically , judicially , economically and socially , while preserving its cultural plurality . this is conditional upon the relinquishing of national , power-oriented sovereignty and submitting to a common will .
the nation-state has fulfilled its historical function .
nowadays , it is one of the major troublemakers in the european integration process .
the theory of sovereignty - which is connected to state and the good of the state and which separates politics and morality and gives absolute primacy to the goals of the state - is no longer viable .
the citizen is the central democratic figure in our counter model , which is based on a concept of a europe of the regions . democracy brought closer to home bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : regionalism could offer a way out of the current impasse humans , as supranational beings , are politically active in their own regions where they are directly affected by political decisions .
regional society , in the form of civil society , is responsible for making decisions that are politically necessary .
in the ideal scenario , every single inhabitant of a region is also an active politician , albeit on various levels . the theoretical superstructure of a europe of regions is manifested in the principle of reason of region , as a kind of socialized reason of state .
the reason of region means that a region determines its goals according to its own rules , on the basis of the structural principle of " subsidiarity " on a sub-national level , i.e. within the framework of a constitutional , federal european structure .
each region lives according to its own " reason , " deploying its own endogenous potential and taking into account its chief particularities in cultural , social and , to a large extent , political autonomy and self-realization . rethinking subsidiarity regionalism and subsidiarity are inherently interdependent .
however , in our understanding of subsidiarity we go far beyond what is stated in article five of the treaty of amsterdam .
we define subsidiarity as " actively supporting a nation-state or the european union , to develop local and regional subsystems so that democratic participation is improved , even if this means accepting a loss of power at the other levels . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : regional peculiarities will be championed in a federal europe if the principle of subsidiarity is understood in this way , it supports and strengthens an autonomous , lively regionalism .
by this , we understand something that is close to people 's everyday lives and is able to solve the problems that arise , if possible with the united and democratic participation of everyone involved .
the attempt to build a europe imposed from above is susceptible to crisis .
as the eu continues to expand , it will become increasingly vulnerable .
europe 's chances come from below , if it helps to meet people 's educational , cultural , leisure and welfare needs and if " normal " employees get the feeling that they would be worse off without the european union . breaking open encrusted power structures to sum up : the future of the european union can only survive both domestically and internationally , if the bloc develops a constitution that aims to set up a regional , federal system .
the structural principle of subsidiarity will break open encrusted power structures and lead to an efficient overhaul of existing power structures .
the focus will be on living democracy .
it will be tangible and close to the people .
as a result , it will be possible to develop adequate strategies for shaping our own european future and lending a european dimension to the future shape of the world . winfried boettcher -lrb- jg -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

he opted to delay his plea for 30 days and announced he would conduct his own defense . karadzic , who was no longer sporting the beard and long hair that helped him conceal his identity for over a decade , waived his right to representation during the hearing on thursday , july 31 . when judge alphons orie noted that he was alone , the wartime leader smiled and responded , " i have an invisible adviser , but i have decided to defend myself .

" of course , it will take some months before the prosecution and defense will be ready to start , " he told reporters .
" it will be a complex trial , but we are fully aware of the importance of being efficient . " some observers say he is likely to use the trial to illuminate claims that a shady deal with the west helped him avoid detention for so long .

the jobless rate was up 0.2 percent to 7.7 percent . this was , however , 505,000 less than the numbers out of work in unadjusted terms in july last year , when the unemployment rate stood at 8.9 percent .

the jobless rate was up 0.2 percent to 7.7 percent . this was , however , 505,000 less than the numbers out of work in unadjusted terms in july last year , when the unemployment rate stood at 8.9 percent .
in seasonally adjusted terms , unemployment fell by 20,000 to 3.25 million .
the number of unemployed had been shrinking fast in recent months , falling below 8 percent in may for the first time in 16 years .
releasing the data , labour office chief frank-juergen weise said developments on the labour market remained positive despite signs that it was losing some of its momentum .
he said that employers ' demand for workers remained high .
but a steady stream of data and economic sentiment surveys have pointed to the nation 's economy losing steam amid fears that inflation has been picking up on the back of high food and energy costs .
minimal economic growth expected german business confidence dropped to near a three-year low in july , according to a key survey drawn up by the ifo institute for economic research and released this month .
" these results suggest the economic upswing is coming to an end , " said ifo chief hans-werner sinn , releasing the latest report .
while german exports recorded their biggest fall in about four years in may , factory orders fell for the sixth consecutive month in may and industrial production also dropped sharply .
this points to economic growth sliding during the second quarter after a strong start to the year .
the most pessimistic forecasts are for german economic growth to slow to 0.7 percent during the three months to the end of june . dpa news agency -lrb- th -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the nation-state has had its day , writes political scientist winfried boettcher .
he calls instead for a europe built along regional lines that would help meet people 's cultural and economic needs . winfried böttcher is an emeritus professor of politics at the rwth aachen university , specializing in european politics .
he is particularly interested in the concept of a federal europe . the approach towards unifying europe has not changed since the founding of the coal and steel community over 50 years ago .
the absence of long-term goals means that cooperation continues to function on a trial-and-error basis .
varying interests , needs , functions and tasks continue to search for adequate organizational forms . the talk is still about moving towards the ever closer integration of the peoples of europe .
even today , no one can bring themselves to say that europe is amalgamating .
people approach europe pragmatically without knowing what form it should ultimately assume .
no one asks how we would like to live in europe in the future .
the nation-states , as the enablers of so-called european integration , prefer this functionalist method if only because it secures them the largest entitlements in terms of sovereignty . the future is federal bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : boettcher believes europe 's survival depends on subsidiarity by contrast , i believe that europe will only have a future if a federal concept places the normative question at the center of the debate .
unlike the existing functionalist concept , this idea is based on a clear integration approach .
according to johan galtung , this is a process in which two or more political protagonists come together to form a new protagonist .
correspondingly , europe could be united politically , judicially , economically and socially , while preserving its cultural plurality . this is conditional upon the relinquishing of national , power-oriented sovereignty and submitting to a common will .
the nation-state has fulfilled its historical function .
nowadays , it is one of the major troublemakers in the european integration process .
the theory of sovereignty - which is connected to state and the good of the state and which separates politics and morality and gives absolute primacy to the goals of the state - is no longer viable .
the citizen is the central democratic figure in our counter model , which is based on a concept of a europe of the regions . democracy brought closer to home bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : regionalism could offer a way out of the current impasse humans , as supranational beings , are politically active in their own regions where they are directly affected by political decisions .
regional society , in the form of civil society , is responsible for making decisions that are politically necessary .
in the ideal scenario , every single inhabitant of a region is also an active politician , albeit on various levels . the theoretical superstructure of a europe of regions is manifested in the principle of reason of region , as a kind of socialized reason of state .
the reason of region means that a region determines its goals according to its own rules , on the basis of the structural principle of " subsidiarity " on a sub-national level , i.e. within the framework of a constitutional , federal european structure .
each region lives according to its own " reason , " deploying its own endogenous potential and taking into account its chief particularities in cultural , social and , to a large extent , political autonomy and self-realization . rethinking subsidiarity regionalism and subsidiarity are inherently interdependent .
however , in our understanding of subsidiarity we go far beyond what is stated in article five of the treaty of amsterdam .
we define subsidiarity as " actively supporting a nation-state or the european union , to develop local and regional subsystems so that democratic participation is improved , even if this means accepting a loss of power at the other levels . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : regional peculiarities will be championed in a federal europe if the principle of subsidiarity is understood in this way , it supports and strengthens an autonomous , lively regionalism .
by this , we understand something that is close to people 's everyday lives and is able to solve the problems that arise , if possible with the united and democratic participation of everyone involved .
the attempt to build a europe imposed from above is susceptible to crisis .
as the eu continues to expand , it will become increasingly vulnerable .
europe 's chances come from below , if it helps to meet people 's educational , cultural , leisure and welfare needs and if " normal " employees get the feeling that they would be worse off without the european union . breaking open encrusted power structures to sum up : the future of the european union can only survive both domestically and internationally , if the bloc develops a constitution that aims to set up a regional , federal system .
the structural principle of subsidiarity will break open encrusted power structures and lead to an efficient overhaul of existing power structures .
the focus will be on living democracy .
it will be tangible and close to the people .
as a result , it will be possible to develop adequate strategies for shaping our own european future and lending a european dimension to the future shape of the world . winfried boettcher -lrb- jg -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the move comes after the former economy and labor minister implicitly advised against voting for the spd in a key state key poll . the decision , the culmination of a dispute dating back to january , represents just one more problem for the party , which is currently trailing its conservative coalition partners in the polls by 13 percent with around 26 percent support . observers see it a sign of the developing battle between the party 's left and reformist wings . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : clement said the decision had come like a " bolt from the blue " clement angered spd members in january when he wrote a guest column for a conservative newspaper in which he queried the suitability of andrea ypsilanti for the premiership of hesse during a closely fought election campaign .
he warned that the hesse spd would " lurch to the left " under ypsilanti and attacked her energy policy after she opposed both nuclear and coal-fired power stations . " for this reason , consider carefully who should be trusted with responsibility for the state and vote carefully , " he wrote just a week before the jan .
27 state elections , in which the spd narrowly failed to oust the governing christian democrats . an attack on party solidarity an sdp arbitration committee in north rhine-westphalia , where clement was state premier before taking the economics and labor minister in the government of former chancellor gerhard schroeder , ruled that clement had undermined party solidarity . " he called on people not to vote for our party and that is damaging behavior , " a local spd leader in north rhine-westphalia , rudolf malzahn , told news channel n24 , defending the party 's decision .
" he said he would do it again anytime .
regardless of what title and rank a person has - rules are rules . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : nrw spd chairwoman hannelore kraft expressed " regret " north rhine-westphalia spd chairwoman hannelore kraft expressed " regret that things have come this far , " but others in the party said it was time for the former minister to go . some critics claimed that clement , who serves on the supervisory board of german energy giant rwe , had exposed himself as a cynical turncoat .
the former minister left politics to work in the power generation sector three years ago . the law office representing clement - run by otto schily , schroder 's former interior minister - released a statement thursday saying clement would appeal the party 's decision . the 68-year-old clement was a leading figure in the centrist branch of the party , serving as north rhine-westphalia state premier from 1998 to 2002 then as the " super-minister " for economy and labor under schroeder until 2005 . clement strongly backed gerhard schroeder 's disputed agenda 2010 economic and labor market reforms in the face of opposition from the left wing of the party .
since leaving office , clement frequently has criticized the spd 's moves to roll back that program . dw staff -lrb- jg -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

is this an accurate estimation in your opinion ? cord schellenberg : it 's one speculation .
it 's possible that the costs for lufthansa are even higher , depending on how much external equipment and personnel it has to buy in .
but the strike is definitely having an effect on lufthansa . first of all , they have to inform all of their passengers around the world that they have to rebook their flights .
at the same time , they also have to set up replacement flight routes , change the technical planning for the planes and rework the flight crew schedules . in terms of organization , it 's a lot of work for lufthansa .
it also means financial costs , but , at the moment , it appears that costs are still lower for lufthansa than if they accepted the employees ' current demands . will lufthansa lose customers over the long term due to the strike ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german even organize strikes well , schellenberg said i think that customer faithfulness is very high at lufthansa .
that 's true both of customers on discount flights that are glad to be flying on a premium airline and of those that pay full price . in the middle and long term , people will forget the whole thing pretty quickly - particularly because the typical german value of " thoroughness " is apparent in how well lufthansa has re-planned the flights .
i think people are impressed by that . in other countries , like italy for example , a strike always means chaos .
but here in germany , even the strike is organized .
the airline is able to manage and goes to great expense to make the effect on passengers as small as possible . however , the consequences in the freight division will be more strongly felt than on the passenger side , because the freight customers see that their shipments ca n't be sent .
on the other hand , the explanation is reasonable for everyone . so the strike could actually have a positive effect on lufthansa 's image ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the pilots have gotten first-class treatment in the past at least it could bring recognition from the passengers .
everyone knows that strikes are n't common in germany , but also that they ca n't be avoided .
however , most strikes are conducted in such a way that the company does n't have any chance to react .
in this case , i think both sides are very prudent , and that 's certainly something the passengers will recognize . it 's not good for lufthansa 's image - that would be going too far - but i think most people would say , wow , the germans can even organize a strike well . ticket prices are something that affects the passengers even more .
lufthansa , like every other airline , is hit hard by rising fuel prices as well as the emissions trading program that the eu has approved to start in 2012 .
can travelers expect higher ticket prices in the near future ? yes , that 's not dependent on the strike .
it 's just a realistic view of the developments in the global economy .
when the economy cools down , the movement of people and goods naturally does as well .
the increase in kerosene prices came at the same time . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : verdi is losing members personnel costs are a separate matter .
it 's a normal part of business that personnel costs increase .
the lufthansa employees say , " the company did well in the past few years .
now we want to earn more too . "
that 's something that happens every year or so when wage negotiations take place and it does n't have to mean higher costs for the passengers . however , i think 1 euro , 19 euro and 29 euro tickets are now a thing of the past .
they never really existed anyways , because they were more of a marketing gimmick . there is a large discrepancy between lufthansa 's offer and the pay increase demands the union is making .
are verdi 's demands reasonable ? in the past few years , verdi has been sensitive and made demands that were reasonable for the airline .
but they were continuously passed up by the pilots .
the pilots were in formula 1 , so to speak , and the others in formula 5 .
formula 1 is nice and the pilots always made use of it .
and verdi always responded reasonably , but now that approach is over . the airline should ask itself if it 's really healthy to give the pilots such a prominent position as a pressure group in wage negotiations and to tell the more expendable employees - check-in personnel , flight attendants and catering staff - that they do n't have such a prominent position . verdi is responsible for the technicians , which can also be a pressure group , especially if they 're highly qualified .
if they do n't do their job , the planes ca n't be approved for takeoff .
verdi knows this and is taking advantage of it . the flight attendant union that is in competition with verdi is demanding 15 percent in the wage negotiations .
that shows the high stakes involved .
verdi really wants to achieve something for its members and does n't want the flight attendants in its organization to switch over to the other union . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : there 's a strong tradition of compromise in germany , said schellenberg verdi has been particularly active in the past few months with a series of strikes .
have they been emboldened by recent successes ? verdi is a bit like the spd -lsb- social democratic party -rsb- in germany : they 're losing members .
while spd puts on a show all year , verdi is trying to nail down some successes and achieve something for its members . lufthansa has n't made a counteroffer but said it 's willing to negotiate and private , informal have taken place .
are they dealing with the strike in the best way ? as i said , the germans can organize a strike well , on both sides .
it 's also a tradition in germany to find a compromise . i think the population is relatively relaxed .
it 's different than it might be in the us , for example , because here people say , " they 'll come to an agreement . "
you ca n't prescribe how they reach an agreement , but in the end both sides will calculate the costs and decide when they have to compromise . interview : kate bowen send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

on the other hand , the explanation is reasonable for everyone . so the strike could actually have a positive effect on lufthansa 's image ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the pilots have gotten first-class treatment in the past at least it could bring recognition from the passengers .
everyone knows that strikes are n't common in germany , but also that they ca n't be avoided .
however , most strikes are conducted in such a way that the company does n't have any chance to react .
in this case , i think both sides are very prudent , and that 's certainly something the passengers will recognize . it 's not good for lufthansa 's image - that would be going too far - but i think most people would say , wow , the germans can even organize a strike well . ticket prices are something that affects the passengers even more .
lufthansa , like every other airline , is hit hard by rising fuel prices as well as the emissions trading program that the eu has approved to start in 2012 .
can travelers expect higher ticket prices in the near future ? yes , that 's not dependent on the strike .
it 's just a realistic view of the developments in the global economy .
when the economy cools down , the movement of people and goods naturally does as well .
the increase in kerosene prices came at the same time . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : verdi is losing members personnel costs are a separate matter .
it 's a normal part of business that personnel costs increase .
the lufthansa employees say , " the company did well in the past few years .
now we want to earn more too . "
that 's something that happens every year or so when wage negotiations take place and it does n't have to mean higher costs for the passengers . however , i think 1 euro , 19 euro and 29 euro tickets are now a thing of the past .
they never really existed anyways , because they were more of a marketing gimmick . there is a large discrepancy between lufthansa 's offer and the pay increase demands the union is making .
are verdi 's demands reasonable ? in the past few years , verdi has been sensitive and made demands that were reasonable for the airline .
but they were continuously passed up by the pilots .
the pilots were in formula 1 , so to speak , and the others in formula 5 .
formula 1 is nice and the pilots always made use of it .
and verdi always responded reasonably , but now that approach is over . the airline should ask itself if it 's really healthy to give the pilots such a prominent position as a pressure group in wage negotiations and to tell the more expendable employees - check-in personnel , flight attendants and catering staff - that they do n't have such a prominent position . verdi is responsible for the technicians , which can also be a pressure group , especially if they 're highly qualified .
if they do n't do their job , the planes ca n't be approved for takeoff .
verdi knows this and is taking advantage of it . the flight attendant union that is in competition with verdi is demanding 15 percent in the wage negotiations .
that shows the high stakes involved .
verdi really wants to achieve something for its members and does n't want the flight attendants in its organization to switch over to the other union . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : there 's a strong tradition of compromise in germany , said schellenberg verdi has been particularly active in the past few months with a series of strikes .
have they been emboldened by recent successes ? verdi is a bit like the spd -lsb- social democratic party -rsb- in germany : they 're losing members .
while spd puts on a show all year , verdi is trying to nail down some successes and achieve something for its members . lufthansa has n't made a counteroffer but said it 's willing to negotiate and private , informal have taken place .
are they dealing with the strike in the best way ? as i said , the germans can organize a strike well , on both sides .
it 's also a tradition in germany to find a compromise . i think the population is relatively relaxed .
it 's different than it might be in the us , for example , because here people say , " they 'll come to an agreement . "
you ca n't prescribe how they reach an agreement , but in the end both sides will calculate the costs and decide when they have to compromise . interview : kate bowen send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

he opted to delay his plea for 30 days and announced he would conduct his own defense . karadzic , who was no longer sporting the beard and long hair that helped him conceal his identity for over a decade , waived his right to representation during the hearing on thursday , july 31 . when judge alphons orie noted that he was alone , the wartime leader smiled and responded , " i have an invisible adviser , but i have decided to defend myself .

" of course , it will take some months before the prosecution and defense will be ready to start , " he told reporters .
" it will be a complex trial , but we are fully aware of the importance of being efficient .

soviet soldiers of the 40th army rolled into afghanistan in august 1978 , beginning a devastating nine-year war which bombed most of the central asian nation back into the dark ages . the invasion increased the tensions between the superpowers in a cold war which had already rumbled on for over 30 years . in an attempt to force the soviets to pull out of afghanistan , president jimmy carter issued an ultimatum that the united states would boycott the moscow games if soviet troops had not withdrawn from the country by 12:01 a.m.
eastern standard time on february 20 , 1980 .
after the deadline passed and the soviet-afghan war continued unabated , carter confirmed the boycott of the games on march 21 . athletes allowed to compete despite boycott the us was joined in its boycott by the likes of japan , west germany , china , the philippines and canada .
the united kingdom , france and greece supported the boycott but allowed their athletes to participate if they wished . the united kingdom and france sent a much smaller delegation of athletes than usual .
however , the uk delegation was the largest from western europe , with 170 athletes applying to compete . the nations that fully boycotted the games held their own event in the philippines . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the olympic flag was used more times than ever before those athletes attending from boycott nations were joined by those from fully participating countries in marching under the olympic flag , and not their own at the opening and closing ceremony in support of the games and not the political maneuvers that had drastically affected a number of events . during the closing ceremony , the traditional unfurling of the flag of the next olympic host nation , in this case the united states , was adapted .
instead of the stars and stripes , the flag of los angeles , the next host city , was used . the olympic anthem was also played at medal ceremonies in favor of the national anthems of winning athletes from boycott nations .
as a result , the olympic flag and anthem were used on a number of occasions . despite the disruptions to many events and the fact that only81 nations participated , more world records were set in moscow than in the previous games in montreal in 1976 . tit-for-tat boycott follows in la 1984 bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " to russia with love !
wish you were here " in what appeared to be a tit-for-tat boycott , the soviet union and 14 eastern bloc countries would boycott the 1984 olympic games in los angeles .
iran and libya also boycotted for different reasons than revenge for the moscow boycott . the soviets stated that their decision not to attend came from security concerns and " chauvinistic sentiments and an anti-soviet hysteria being whipped up in the united states . " just as the us-led boycott nations had done in 1980 , those refusing to take part in the 1984 games held their own . boycotting countries organized their own major events over july and august 1984 , called the friendship games which featured 50 nations and which took place in nine countries . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the museum aims to help visitors immerse themselves in the architecture , sounds and smells of the roman settlement . germanic and celtic barbarians , accustomed to living in squat log huts , must have gasped in amazement when they first caught sight of the towering town center of colonia ulpia traiana some 2,000 years ago . the museum evokes the lofty roman basilica , which served as a lobby for the baths .
the 24-meter -lrb- 79-foot -rrb- building was the height of a modern-day , eight-story apartment and had a gabled roof topped off with red roman tiles . built to scale bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : visitors might feel like they 've entered a time warp to help visitors understand the massive scale of the buildings , architects built steel-framed buildings the same size as the originals on the site of the old bathhouse and ancillary structures .
its height was calculated from the dimensions of its foundations . the new museum , part of the archaeological park at xanten -lrb- apx -rrb- , aims to offer the modern visitor a fresh perspective on roman civilization .
it 's out-of-the-way location means that the museum does not fight for space with a bustling modern city like the many archaeological remains that can be found in german cities such as trier , mainz , cologne and bonn . inside , visitors can see all the oddities that have been excavated from the site in the rhine valley , ranging from the waste heap of a workshop that used to make clay lamps to the gravestones of important citizens and the remains of a roman river barge hung in mid-air . getting a feel for the times bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the museum incorporates numerous archaeological finds the 22.5 million euro -lrb- $ 35 million -rrb- museum is set to open on aug .
16 , an apx spokesman told dpa news agency . the designers wanted visitors to understand the smells and sights of ancient rome .
there are boxes where visitors can feel the ruins ' broken roof tiles or smell typical roman spices . " our museum is not there to show which archaeologists dug up the most , " hans-joachim schalles , director of the museum , told dpa .
" it 's there so ordinary people can see what a roman town was like . " visitors can walk on a glass floor over a lane with the deep wheel-ruts of roman carts in it and the footprints of children 's bare feet and the hob-nailed boots of roman soldiers , all preserved for nearly 20 centuries in the mud . the museum 's 2,500 items show how an earlier germanic village was converted into a rich city of the roman empire , decorated with murals in the style of pompeii and with expensive glassware on the tables and was then conquered by frankish tribes . excavation continues at site bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : archaeologists have made many important finds in xanten the biggest item in the new museum building is a barge , the smallest the bones of a roman lapdog .
next door are the remains of the baths , which are protected from rain and snow by sheds which allow the outside air to circulate . experience has shown this is the best way to stop the remains from either completely drying out or becoming moldy from the dampness . finds such as a german silver hairpin suggest that the colonia was an ethnically mixed place , with celts and germans living among the romans and praying to their own gods . the legions of caesar augustus brought this region under roman control and a collection of their rough helmets is also in the museum .
concealed loudspeakers emit chatter in latin and other ancient tongues , as might have been heard on the town marketplace . around the year 100 of the common era , the roman emperor trajan funded its expansion into a city of about 10,000 bearing his name . thereafter it was a major city of the northern empire . most of the ruins slumber on undisturbed under the green grass of the apx .
archaeologists are likely to be burrowing and mapping the ancient town for many years to come .
local authorities hope to eventually expand the park to 73 hectares -lrb- 180 acres -rrb- to embrace the entire site . dw staff -lrb- th -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

but with the rest of europe banking on nuclear , german scientists don ’ t want to miss out on future developments . german research minister annette schavan said this week she will increase funding for nuclear research .
her announcement may have come as a surprise to those who believe that more money to be spent on research in this field is bound to contradict an agreement to phase out nuclear energy in germany completely . the phase-out deal was struck by the former coalition government of social democrats and greens .
it is still binding for the ruling grand coalition of chancellor angela merkel . schavan , a member of merkel 's christian democratic union , says that allocating more resources to nuclear research does not really undermine the country 's ambition to survive without atomic power .
she claims that some 14 million euros -lrb- $ 22 million -rrb- annually will primarily be used to enhance nuclear safety , radiation protection and nuclear waste storage technologies . young scientists to benefit bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the last german nuclear power plants are supposed to shut down in 2020 the minister also made it clear that the allocated resources would likewise be used to enable young german scientists to keep abreast with the latest developments in nuclear research .
with the rest of europe and many other parts of the world currently rediscovering the benefits of nuclear energy , she argued , german scientists must not lose out because of domestic restrictions . " our scientists must stay in the top league , " schavan told the berliner zeitung newspaper .
" as long as everywhere around us new power plants are being built , we can not afford to just sit back and invest nothing in nuclear safety and radiation protection . " skeptics up in arms but critics of the minister 's financial offensive do n't trust her announcements completely .
some lawmakers , including social democrat research expert joerg tauss , are reported to have qualms about her plans .
they believe that a good proportion of the additional money earmarked for atomic research may well end up in projects facilitating the development of a fourth generation of nuclear power plants . " we 'll be watching very carefully whether the research minister will actually earmark resources for research on this new line of reactors , " tauss told the frankfurter rundschau daily .
" if she does , we 'll put up a good fight to prevent this from happening . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : buetikofer says that schavan 's plan is a waste of money germany 's greens party , which has always been the staunchest opponent of nuclear power in the country , views the minister 's plans with a good deal of unease and skepticism .
greens co-leader reinhard buetikofer said that it would be outrageous if even the slightest part of the extra money would go towards research on the new reactor line . " why should taxpayers ' money be misused for research on reactors , which will not be built in germany at all in line with the coalition treaty on the complete phase-out of nuclear energy here " , buetikofer told dw-world.de.
" i have the impression that this would rather be an attempt to subsidize germany 's nuclear industry and help them export its know-how and technology to countries where nuclear energy is experiencing a revival .

but that is what manuel uribe from monterrey , northern mexico , has done .
now the world 's heaviest man is on track to become the planet 's most successful slimmer .
put another way , his weight loss in one year is the equivalent of shedding two fully grown adult males from his body .
manuel is already in the latest edition of the guinness world records as the heaviest living person .
that 's because , not long ago he weighed 560kg -lrb- 88 stones -rrb- , or half a tonne .
supervised diet supersized by nature , he has now downsized through diet and willpower .
and that will put him in the record books again .
" look at my face , " he says .
" i have lost a lot . "
manuel puts it all down to something called the zone diet .
the diet , supervised by a team of scientists and nutritionists , consists of a strict formula of carbohydrates , proteins and fats .
it 's about controlling hormone levels in the body , particularly insulin and glucagons .
those behind the diet say that when these are at the correct levels through the right intake of food , anti inflammatory chemicals are released to keep the body 's weight in check .
they say the body then uses its stored fat for energy , thereby causing weight loss .
" life is good now because food is medicine , " said manuel .
" if you have the right food your body gets what it needs .
if i can lose weight , anyone can . "
manuel certainly does n't starve himself to achieve his weight loss .
he eats roughly five times a day .
his lunch was a plate of chicken cooked in olive oil with broccoli , tomatoes and slices of raw red pepper .
mother ' proud ' he can eat fish , chicken , some meat , many types of fruit and pretty much any vegetables , but all in strictly controlled portions called ' blocks ' .
he is even allowed one fizzy drink a day - sugar-free , of course .
" he likes his food , " said his mother , otilia .
" but i am very proud for what he has achieved in the past year . "
the zone diet is controversial .
the american heart association does n't recommend diets high in proteins .
it also says there is not enough evidence about the long-term effects of being on the diet .
the zone diet 's backers say they have a lot of evidence to prove it is safe and that it is not ' high protein ' , as such .
they say that the amount of protein a person absorbs depends on their height and build .
they say that goes for carbohydrate and fat intake as well .
manuel 's weight problems are partly genetic , partly down to overeating .
his scale of morbid obesity puts him in the top half of one percent of overweight people .
extreme case dr roberto rumbaut , a surgeon in mexico who specialises in obesity , puts manuel 's case in perspective .
" manuel uribe is an extreme case , " he said .
" where the obesity crisis lies is in people who are 13 to 31kg -lrb- 30 to 70lb -rrb- overweight . "
dr rumbaut said there were 1.6 billion overweight people in the world , of which about 450 million are obese , according to figures from the world health organisation -lrb- who -rrb- .
" it 's these people who are putting pressure on health services everywhere , " he said .
dr rumbaut says it 's not just diet that will resolve what has been called the world 's " globesity " problem .
" it 's the old fashioned stuff like exercise and lifestyle changes , " he said .
back at the house , manuel sits on the reinforced steel bed that he has not left in six years .
next to it is a massage machine that he uses to draw the circulation along his limbs .
his only movement is to use his hips to swing himself from the lying down position to sitting upright .
new girlfriend it is a dream of his to walk .
it 's a dream shared by his new girlfriend , claudia , who has helped to wash , feed and encourage him through this last year or so of dramatic weight loss .
" we are very happy for the effort he has been making recently , " she said .
" sometimes he is sad and cries because he can not get off his bed .
but he is an example for other obese people to move forward .
as he says : ' if i can , you can ' . "
alongside his copy of the guinness world records lies another text , the bible .
" i have claudia , my mother and god to thank , " said manuel .
" i am happy . "
still larger than life , but now , the incredible , shrinking , manuel uribe .

they say that the amount of protein a person absorbs depends on their height and build .
they say that goes for carbohydrate and fat intake as well .
manuel 's weight problems are partly genetic , partly down to overeating .
his scale of morbid obesity puts him in the top half of one percent of overweight people .
extreme case dr roberto rumbaut , a surgeon in mexico who specialises in obesity , puts manuel 's case in perspective .
" manuel uribe is an extreme case , " he said .
" where the obesity crisis lies is in people who are 13 to 31kg -lrb- 30 to 70lb -rrb- overweight . "
dr rumbaut said there were 1.6 billion overweight people in the world , of which about 450 million are obese , according to figures from the world health organisation -lrb- who -rrb- .
dr roberto rumbaut says obesity puts pressure on health services " it 's these people who are putting pressure on health services everywhere , " he said .
dr rumbaut says it 's not just diet that will resolve what has been called the world 's " globesity " problem .
" it 's the old fashioned stuff like exercise and lifestyle changes , " he said .
back at the house , manuel sits on the reinforced steel bed that he has not left in six years .
next to it is a massage machine that he uses to draw the circulation along his limbs .
his only movement is to use his hips to swing himself from the lying down position to sitting upright .
new girlfriend it is a dream of his to walk .
it 's a dream shared by his new girlfriend , claudia , who has helped to wash , feed and encourage him through this last year or so of dramatic weight loss .
" we are very happy for the effort he has been making recently , " she said .
manuel 's girlfriend , claudia , has encouraged him " sometimes he is sad and cries because he can not get off his bed .
but he is an example for other obese people to move forward .
as he says : ' if i can , you can ' . "
alongside his copy of the guinness world records lies another text , the bible .
" i have claudia , my mother and god to thank , " said manuel .
" i am happy . "
still larger than life , but now , the incredible , shrinking , manuel uribe .

the government says an extra 300,000 pupils have enrolled rolling out the programme in january , president mwai kibaki said free education would ensure that children from poor homes acquired quality education .
his government introduced universal free primary education after he was first elected in 2002 .
under the programme , the government would pay tuition fees while parents covered boarding costs and bought uniforms .
but seven months after the programme was supposed to take off , the government has provided only a quarter of the funding schools need to make it work .
some school administrators have been forced to run the institutions on a credit line while others have opted to reinstate tuition fees to avoid closing down .
rising debt sylvester wambua , the head teacher at kyanguli memorial school , says the delay is threatening operations at the institution .
where do you get the beds , the books with the peanuts that the government sends chacha ngalando , school administrator " the government is supposed to give us $ 95,861 - they have only given us $ 19,354 .
" the free secondary education is really a challenge .
we have creditors , we can not pay them , " mr wambua says .
buckling under the weight of a $ 77,000 deficit this year , the school has been incurring debts to bridge the gap .
mr wambua is not the only school administrator grappling with a myriad of problems resulting from the lapse of support by the government .
chacha ngalando , the school administrator at kithangaini secondary school in eastern province is also struggling to make ends meet .
" there has been an increase in the student population , which means increasing the infrastructure .
so where do you get the beds , the books with the peanuts that the government sends ? "
mr ngalando asks .
cash crunch but the government has blamed the delay on school administrators , who it says have not provided proper bank accounts for the funds to be deposited .
schools have to make do with reduced funding and it promises that things will get better .
education assistant minister calist mwatela says the programme needs time to succeed .
" it should be understood that our system is a transformation ...
it has its own challenges , " mr mwatela says .
but the government has also admitted that it is facing a cash crunch .
kenya 's economy took a hit from the post-election violence witnessed early this year .
the government is also facing increased expenditure to meet the costs of a 42-member cabinet formed as part of a power-sharing agreement .
the cabinet will cost the government an extra $ 300m , and the ministry of finance warns it may be forced to shift funding from vital programmes .
key ministries - among them medical services , roads , education and finance - have already had their budgets slashed to accommodate the increased government expenditure .
the free secondary school education programme may just be one of the casualties .
heavy price to cope with the funding crisis , administrators at schools serving the middle class have defied the government 's directive not to charge fees .
some schools are now asking parents to pay as much as $ 1,300 per year instead of the recommended $ 300 .
if the government continues to delay the funding , the quality of high school education in public schools could be seriously compromised .
if this happens , it is the students from poor families who will pay a heavy price , as their parents can not afford to take them to the costly private schools .
but the government insists that the programme has been a success .
president kibaki says enrolment in secondary schools has shot up by 300,000 since january .
after a rocky start and with mounting challenges , the government faces an uphill task in providing high quality free secondary education .

the government is also facing increased expenditure to meet the costs of a 42-member cabinet formed as part of a power-sharing agreement .
the cabinet will cost the government an extra $ 300m , and the ministry of finance warns it may be forced to shift funding from vital programmes .
key ministries - among them medical services , roads , education and finance - have already had their budgets slashed to accommodate the increased government expenditure .
the free secondary school education programme may just be one of the casualties .
heavy price to cope with the funding crisis , administrators at schools serving the middle class have defied the government 's directive not to charge fees .
some schools are now asking parents to pay as much as $ 1,300 per year instead of the recommended $ 300 .
if the government continues to delay the funding , the quality of high school education in public schools could be seriously compromised .
if this happens , it is the students from poor families who will pay a heavy price , as their parents can not afford to take them to the costly private schools .
but the government insists that the programme has been a success .
president kibaki says enrolment in secondary schools has shot up by 300,000 since january .
after a rocky start and with mounting challenges , the government faces an uphill task in providing high quality free secondary education .

pojaman shinawatra was granted bail by a bangkok court in the first of several cases against the former first family .
her brother and secretary were also found guilty of evading tax of 546m baht -lrb- $ 16.3m -rrb- in a 1997 shares transfer in the family telecoms business .
the ex-pm himself , deposed in a 2006 coup , is being tried in the supreme court for alleged corruption .
' politically motivated ' cases against thaksin family case one : abuse of power related to purchase of state land by his wife .
who : thaksin and his wife .
status : trial underway case two : abuse of power linked to government lottery scheme .
who : thaksin and several former cabinet ministers .
status : case accepted by supreme court case three : abuse of power related to state loan to burma alleged to have benefited family business .
who : thaksin .
status : case accepted by supreme court case four : concealing assets .
who : thaksin , wife and two others .
status : awaiting court decision on proceeding to trial case five : tax evasion .

status : pojaman shinawatra and her brother jailed for three years , her secretary for two years several other claims also lodged pojaman shinawatra 's brother , bannapot damapong , was also sentenced to three years , while her secretary was handed a two-year sentence .
the trio were freed on bail of 5m baht -lrb- $ 149,000 -rrb- each on thursday , pending an appeal .
mr thaksin 's wife , who is his most important political and business partner , looked stunned as the court delivered its verdict .
seconds after the ruling , she reportedly walked over to pat her husband on the back .
mr thaksin 's spokesman , pongthep thepkanjana , said the family would appeal and " fight to the end " .
a judge read out the verdicts in a televised ruling , saying that she should have been " a good role model as the wife of the prime minister " .
more than 1,000 supporters carrying roses and banners mobbed the family as they left the court .
about 300 riot police were deployed in the area amid concerns of possible protests but there was no trouble .
mr thaksin has always denied any wrongdoing by his family in this case - and several other lawsuits filed against them - and maintains the charges are politically motivated .
unlike his wife , he will not be able to appeal if convicted .
his party , thai rak thai , was outlawed after the military coup , and mr thaksin was banned from politics for five years .
he made a triumphant return from exile in march after his political allies in the people 's power party set up a coalition government .
after thai authorities froze more than $ 2bn -lrb- £ 1bn -rrb- of his family 's assets pending corruption cases against him , he is now reportedly worth $ 400m -lrb- £ 200m -rrb- .
the bbc 's jonathan head in bangkok says many thais doubted this powerful and wealthy couple would ever be convicted but those doubts have now been swept aside .
under the new constitution brought in by the military last year the judiciary was given increased authority to hold politicians to account .
our correspondent says that as the cases pile up against the former first family , the judiciary is now being seen as perhaps the most powerful institution in the country .

pojaman shinawatra was granted bail by a bangkok court in the first of several cases against the former first family .
her brother and secretary were also found guilty of evading tax of 546m baht -lrb- $ 16.3m -rrb- in a 1997 shares transfer in the family telecoms business .
the ex-pm himself , deposed in a 2006 coup , is being tried in the supreme court for alleged corruption .
' politically motivated ' cases against thaksin family case one : abuse of power related to purchase of state land by his wife .
who : thaksin and his wife .
status : trial underway case two : abuse of power linked to government lottery scheme .
who : thaksin and several former cabinet ministers .
status : case accepted by supreme court case three : abuse of power related to state loan to burma alleged to have benefited family business .
who : thaksin .
status : case accepted by supreme court case four : concealing assets .
who : thaksin , wife and two others .
status : awaiting court decision on proceeding to trial case five : tax evasion .
who : members of thaksin 's family .
status : pojaman shinawatra and her brother jailed for three years , her secretary for two years several other claims also lodged pojaman shinawatra 's brother , bannapot damapong , was also sentenced to three years , while her secretary was handed a two-year sentence .
the trio were freed on bail of 5m baht -lrb- $ 149,000 -rrb- each on thursday , pending an appeal .
mr thaksin 's wife , who is his most important political and business partner , looked stunned as the court delivered its verdict .
seconds after the ruling , she reportedly walked over to pat her husband on the back .
mr thaksin 's spokesman , pongthep thepkanjana , said the family would appeal and " fight to the end " .
a judge read out the verdicts in a televised ruling , saying that she should have been " a good role model as the wife of the prime minister " .

advertisement pojaman shinawatra makes her way into court more than 1,000 supporters carrying roses and banners mobbed the family as they left the court .
about 300 riot police were deployed in the area amid concerns of possible protests but there was no trouble .
mr thaksin has always denied any wrongdoing by his family in this case - and several other lawsuits filed against them - and maintains the charges are politically motivated .
unlike his wife , he will not be able to appeal if convicted .
his party , thai rak thai , was outlawed after the military coup , and mr thaksin was banned from politics for five years .
he made a triumphant return from exile in march after his political allies in the people 's power party set up a coalition government .
after thai authorities froze more than $ 2bn -lrb- £ 1bn -rrb- of his family 's assets pending corruption cases against him , he is now reportedly worth $ 400m -lrb- £ 200m -rrb- .
the bbc 's jonathan head in bangkok says many thais doubted this powerful and wealthy couple would ever be convicted but those doubts have now been swept aside .
under the new constitution brought in by the military last year the judiciary was given increased authority to hold politicians to account .
our correspondent says that as the cases pile up against the former first family , the judiciary is now being seen as perhaps the most powerful institution in the country .

unlike many of its global rivals , deutsche bank managed to make a profit in the quarter even after the problems .
pre-tax profits came in at 642m euros , well down on the 2.7bn euros it made in the same period a year earlier .
almost half of the write-downs were caused by investments in assets that were backed by residential mortgages .
exposure to monoline insurers , which guarantee the repayment of a bond if its issuer is unable to do so , as well as under-performing investments in commercial property , made up much of the rest of the write-downs .
" the second quarter of 2008 proved to be another very challenging quarter for the banking industry , " said chief executive josef ackermann .
" we remain cautious for the remainder of 2008 . "
the credit crunch began in the us where it was sparked by record defaults on sub-prime mortgages .
sub-prime lenders provide financing to people with poor or non-existent credit histories .
it later emerged that many european banks had bought repackaged bundles of debts which were linked to us residential mortgages .
some of the european banks have now been hit as hard as their us counterparts in terms of losses from the credit crunch .

unlike many of its global rivals , deutsche bank managed to make a profit in the quarter even after the problems .
pre-tax profits came in at 642m euros , well down on the 2.7bn euros it made in the same period a year earlier .
almost half of the write-downs were caused by investments in assets that were backed by residential mortgages .
exposure to monoline insurers , which guarantee the repayment of a bond if its issuer is unable to do so , as well as under-performing investments in commercial property , made up much of the rest of the write-downs .
" the second quarter of 2008 proved to be another very challenging quarter for the banking industry , " said chief executive josef ackermann .
" we remain cautious for the remainder of 2008 . "
the credit crunch began in the us where it was sparked by record defaults on sub-prime mortgages .
sub-prime lenders provide financing to people with poor or non-existent credit histories .
it later emerged that many european banks had bought repackaged bundles of debts which were linked to us residential mortgages .
some of the european banks have now been hit as hard as their us counterparts in terms of losses from the credit crunch .

but they said 45 girls in the uk , aged between five months and 16 , were saved from the act since march last year .
despite new legislation outlawing the practice , no-one has been convicted .
the met 's project azure , which tackles the problem , is offering a £ 20,000 reward to bring the first person in the uk to justice .
female circumcision is believed to reduce a woman 's desire for sex , and therefore sex outside marriage , and can be carried out on girls as young as four .
police fear up to 6,500 girls in london are at risk from a tradition that can be traced back to many african nations .

" some of that comes down to the fact that we ca n't age the injuries .

earlier this week author ruth rendell accused ministers of failing to protect young women .
baroness rendell helped introduce a 2004 law that made it an offence to send a child abroad for the procedure .
anyone involved now faces a 14-year prison term .

despite new legislation outlawing the practice , no-one has been convicted .
the met 's project azure , which tackles the problem , is offering a £ 20,000 reward to bring the first person in the uk to justice .
female circumcision is believed to reduce a woman 's desire for sex , and therefore sex outside marriage , and can be carried out on girls as young as four .

profit before tax totalled £ 60m in the 12 months to the end of june 2008 , down from £ 724m a year earlier .
the drop reflected the additional cost of the new premier league football contract and accounting charges related to a stake in rival broadcaster itv .
bskyb said that it added 400,000 new customers during the financial year .
at the same time , its revenue rose 9 % to £ 4.95bn.
' difficult environment ' " we have continued to grow strongly in a more difficult consumer environment , " said jeremy darroch , bskyb 's chief executive .
he added that it had been a banner year for the firm 's sky plus system , which allows customers to record programmes and pause live tv .
the accounting charge was determined by itv 's share price , which bskyb said has had a " significant and prolonged decline " .
in february , business secretary john hutton ordered bskyb to cut its itv holding to 7.5 % .
bskyb is now appealing against that decision to the competition appeal tribunal , and said that it was awaiting the outcome of the review .

profit before tax totalled £ 60m in the 12 months to the end of june 2008 , down from £ 724m a year earlier .
the drop reflected the additional cost of the new premier league football contract and accounting charges related to a stake in rival broadcaster itv .
bskyb said that it added 400,000 new customers during the financial year .
at the same time , its revenue rose 9 % to £ 4.95bn.
' difficult environment ' " we have continued to grow strongly in a more difficult consumer environment , " said jeremy darroch , bskyb 's chief executive .
he added that it had been a banner year for the firm 's sky plus system , which allows customers to record programmes and pause live tv .
the accounting charge was determined by itv 's share price , which bskyb said has had a " significant and prolonged decline " .
in february , business secretary john hutton ordered bskyb to cut its itv holding to 7.5 % .
bskyb is now appealing against that decision to the competition appeal tribunal , and said that it was awaiting the outcome of the review .

" this is a good day for turkey and for europe , " eu enlargement commissioner olli rehn told reuters news agency .
he urged the turkish government to " re-energise the reforms " .
the political uncertainty has delayed progress in turkey 's bid to join the eu .
while shunning a ban , the judges did cut half the akp 's treasury funding for this year , in the ruling on wednesday .
a state prosecutor brought the case against the akp , accusing it of trying to introduce islamic sharia law by stealth .
the akp , which won a huge poll victory last year , denies it wants to create an islamist state .
it called the case an attack on democracy . "
i think the court should have rejected this trial from the beginning " yusuf tok , istanbul akp verdict : turkish readers react send us your comments commenting on the ruling , a spokeswoman for eu foreign policy chief javier solana said turkey was " leaving a tense situation and we very much hope that the decision by the court will contribute to restore political stability " .
the french junior minister in charge of european affairs , jean-pierre jouyet , said the turkish decision " comes as a relief " .
france is the current holder of the eu presidency .
paris wants to " continue the negotiations with a view to opening two or even three chapters by the end of the year " , he told the afp news agency , referring to the areas covered in the detailed eu membership talks .
international impact a ban on the akp could have seriously damaged turkey 's negotiations to join the eu and affected the economy , the bbc 's sarah rainsford reports from ankara .
after the verdict , turkish prime minister recep tayyip erdogan said the whole country had been saved from a great injustice .
he described the trial as a waste of time and energy - and pledged his party would now press ahead with reforms - to modernise turkey and ensure its eu membership and prosperity .
eu officials always stressed that political parties should only be voted out of power in elections , not banned by the courts .
however , court president hasim kilic said the financial sanctions imposed on the akp were a " serious warning " .
the court case followed a series of confrontations between the akp , which has islamist roots , and the secular elite .
turkish secularists have staged huge anti-akp rallies .
the party 's attempt to allow islamic headscarves to be worn at universities was highly controversial .
last month the constitutional court overruled the move to lift the existing headscarf ban , saying it violated the secular constitution .
