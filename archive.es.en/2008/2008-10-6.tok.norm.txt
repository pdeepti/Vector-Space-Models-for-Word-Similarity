the leaders of germany 's ruling coalition agreed sunday to push for a constitutional change allowing the military to help out local law enforcement in certain cases .
germany places strict limits on its military given the excesses committed during the nazi era .
yet politicians have argued that the military could fill an important role in the case of a terrorist attack , acting as a backup to police .
german defense minister franz josef jung welcomed the decision to “ protect citizens in germany ” according to his spokesman .
ruling parties find compromise bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some are concerned that the military will be used against protestors germany 's interior minister wolfgang schaeuble had originally called for an even broader use of the military to respond to domestic terrorist threats .
many of these demands were scrapped in reaching the final compromise .
volker kauder , of chancellor angela merkel 's christian democratic union -lrb- cdu -rrb- , emphasized sunday that the military would only be used in extraordinary circumstances .
“ we have finally found a way to deploy the bundeswehr in specific , confined cases , ” kauder said .
peter struck , head of the social democratic party -lrb- spd -rrb- , said he could imagine a scenario where german marines would help the coast guard during an emergency .
worries over abuses of power bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : schaeuble has called for broader use of the miltary domestically left party parliamentarian petra pau criticized the plans , saying that the coalition wanted to officially condone what was already allowed “ through the back door . ”
germany 's koelner stadt-anzeiger newspaper also warned in an editorial in its monday edition that demonstrators and terrorists are often seen as being one in the same by law enforcement .
the newspaper warned against the " militarization of domestic politics .

6 , three days after a pkk attack on a border post killed 15 turkish soldiers . according to a statement released by the turkish general staff , the warplanes bombed pkk positions in the mountainous avasin region of northern iraq .
" the planes returned safely to base after successfully completing their mission , " the statement said .
turkish jets also attacked positions in the same area on sunday night .
the attack on friday night on the aktutun border post in the south-eastern province of hakkari that left 15 soldiers and 23 pkk separatists dead has shocked turkey and led to the general staff on sunday announcing that it was to relocate five military border posts .
a spokesman for the military said the administration of the kurdish autonomous area in iraq had not helped in the fight against the pkk , despite overtures by iraq 's kurdish president jalal talabani .
after the attack talabani called his turkish counterpart abdullah gul to propose a meeting of high-ranking security experts from both sides , suggesting iraqi willingness to help turkey de-escalate the situation .
the turkish air force has conducted a number of airstrikes against pkk targets in northern iraq since a week-long cross-border incursion into northern iraq was launched in february .
ankara blames the separatist group for the deaths of more than 35,000 people since the early 1980s when the pkk began its fight for independence or autonomy for the mainly kurdish-populated south-east of turkey .
turkish dead laid to rest as tensions heighten bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : angry crowds protested the deaths of turkish soldiers the 15 turkish soldiers killed in saturday 's attack on an iraq border post were borne to their graves on sunday by a crowd of thousands shouting angry slogans against the perpetrators - the outlawed kurdish workers party , or pkk .
the attack , which claimed 38 lives in total , was launched by the guerrilla group , which operates from inside iraq , after a week of turkish air force raids on their positions .
turkish government and military leaders have vowed to escalate the campaign against the pkk .
" we will now conduct our campaign against terrorism even more decisively , " said turkish prime minister recep tayyip erdogan , after he broke off his journey to central asia in response to the attack .
but turkey can not win the war against the pkk by military force alone .
one day before the aktutun border post attack , the worst pkk assault this year , the turkish air force had bombarded suspected pkk positions in the qandil mountains of iraq , close to the iranian border .
large pkk operation targets border post bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : kurdish troops hit the turkish post on the iraq border at the same time , the attack on the troops stationed at aktutun was about to be launched , although they did n't know it .
according to turkish media reports , more than 300 pkk fighters assembled for the raid on the border post .
at daybreak on saturday they opened fire with heavy weapons from iraq as other fighters moved in on the ground .
the battle at aktutun lasted for five hours .
it was the fifth attack on the post since 1992 .
turkey hit back with combat helicopters and special forces .
after the attack , iraqi president jalal talabani , himself a kurd , called his turkish counterpart abdullah gul to propose a meeting of high-ranking security experts from both sides , suggesting iraqi willingness to help turkey de-escalate the situation .
however , turkish daily millyet commented on sunday that " long- range weapons can not be brought into position without those responsible for security in iraq noticing . "
also under question is the value of us support in informing turkey of pkk movements within iraq .
the turkish parliament is due to vote monday on whether to allow the army to extend its mandate for operations in northern iraq for a further year .
the approval of the mandate was not in doubt even before saturday 's attack , as evidently turkey 's operations in northern iraq had not brought the pkk to its knees .
in february , turkey launched a ground offensive in iraq , although us criticism brought it to a rapid end .
us defense secretary robert gates has suggested the military struggle against the pkk be conducted together with economic and political means .
" only this way can terrorism be stopped , " he said .
the pkk is considered by the united states and the european union to be a terrorist group . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

berlin hoped a new 50-billion-euro -lrb- $ 68-billion -rrb- rescue plan for the distressed mortgage lender hypo real estate -lrb- hre -rrb- , a munich-based company that lends to commercial developers and municipalities to build hotels , offices , roads , airports and the like , and a blanket guarantee on private bank accounts would prevent panic from seizing a nation of savers .
finance minister peer steinbrueck said he did not rule out raising state guarantees on hre credit lines and that there was " a plan b in the drawer " to ensure the banking sector did not collapse .
steinbrueck did not provide details but told a press conference : " we are aware that we will not get very far with case-by-case solutions . "
the bank is now to be provided with credit lines worth a total 50 billion euros , of which a little more than half was to be guaranteed by the state .
hre shares were hammered in afternoon trading on the frankfurt stock exchange however , losing 35.15 percent to 4.87 euros .
meanwhile , the government said it would guarantee private bank accounts , estimated to be worth 1.6 trillion euros .
economics professor hans-peter burghof of the university of hohenheim told german radio that amount represented " the biggest guarantee in history .
" never has anyone anywhere in the world guaranteed such a sum in two simple sentences , " he said , while noting that in principle the idea of giving guarantees was to ensure they would not be needed .
merkel pledges to protect financial system bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel tried to instill calm in investors and savers chancellor angela merkel told reporters on sunday that the government " will not allow an institution 's crisis to become a crisis for the entire system . "
" we are saying to women and men savers that their deposits are safe .
the federal government promises that , " merkel said .
questions about the german government assurance of an estimated 1 trillion euros -lrb- $ 1.4 trillion -rrb- of personal savings at german banks meanwhile were being raised on monday .
neighbouring nations came under pressure to follow germany 's lead .
berlin described the assurance to savers , issued by chancellor merkel in two sentences in front of television cameras on sunday , as " able to be relied on . "
berlin has not announced any legislation on a deposit-insurance scheme beyond existing bank-industry guarantees .
officials said they were still talking to banks on how to shape the guarantee .
merkel 's spokesman ulrich wilhelm said in berlin , " it 's a political statement that can be relied on and is decisive . "
the german government and its capabilities stood behind this assurance , he added .
jonathan todd , spokesman for european competition commissioner neelie kroes , said : " we were informed by the german authorities of their intentions .
" the commission notes that the measures seem to be limited to retail bank deposits , and so less liable to give rise to distortions of competition . "
todd added , " in general , retail deposit guarantee schemes for savers can be an appropriate policy response to fears regarding the stability of the banking system . "
the crisis reached germany with the stumble by hre and the embarrassment which followed a 35-billion-euro bail-out a week ago which proved inadequate .
global insight senior economist timo klein told reporters : " since they were unable to correct themselves , financial markets looked to the german government -lrb- for help -rrb- .
the dax is now looking for a general plan for the banks , maybe as early as wednesday . "
brussels sees no problem with german plan bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the commission is keeping an eye on developments in brussels , the european commission said the german decision regarding private accounts appeared to conform to eu competition rules and did not pose the same problems as a similar announcement by ireland .
" the commission notes that the measures seem to be limited to retail bank deposits , so -lrb- it is -rrb- less liable to give rise to distortion of competition , " said commission spokesman todd .
in britain , prime minister gordon brown 's spokesman said london understood that berlin did not plan to pass legislation on the guarantees and added : " we have been in the process of seeking clarification from germany as to what they have committed themselves to . "
an initial guarantee issued by the irish government to banks has drawn criticism from several european union countries which feared it could distort competition by making irish bank accounts more attractive to eu savers .
hre management under fire bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the hre has tottered on the verge of collapse for days meanwhile , as germany sought to calm the public with a " decisive " pledge about savings , property lender hre was under further pressure from other banks and berlin to sack its chief executive .
german finance minister peer steinbrueck said it was " unthinkable " to keep dealing with the same hre top management .
he charged that hre , at the same time as seeking state aid , had used lawyers against the government so as to " escape its responsibilities . "
in monday trading , hre stock declined as much as 40 percent from friday 's close as investors worried that the new bail-out might also prove inadequate .
in brussels , the eu commission 's todd , said , " as soon as the details are notified to us we will assess very quickly whether the new measures are compatible with -lrb- the eu 's -rrb- state aid rules . "
a newspaper , die welt , was to appear tuesday with a report that hre was blaming its plunge from grace on a downgrading by ratings agencies that allowed creditors to call up loans .
berlin has refused demands by the banking industry to nationalize hre , a lender seen in germany as too important to let fail .
steinbrueck said financial securities that have been disdained in the past by central banks would be used as security for much of the 15-billion-euro expansion of the hre bail-out .
the european central bank -lrb- ecb -rrb- had agreed to this , he said .
" nobody can forecast just yet how much this paper is actually worth , " he added .

berlin hoped a new 50-billion-euro -lrb- $ 68-billion -rrb- rescue plan for the distressed mortgage lender hypo real estate -lrb- hre -rrb- , a munich-based company that lends to commercial developers and municipalities to build hotels , offices , roads , airports and the like , and a blanket guarantee on private bank accounts would prevent panic from seizing a nation of savers .
finance minister peer steinbrueck said he did not rule out raising state guarantees on hre credit lines and that there was " a plan b in the drawer " to ensure the banking sector did not collapse .
steinbrueck did not provide details but told a press conference : " we are aware that we will not get very far with case-by-case solutions . "
the bank is now to be provided with credit lines worth a total 50 billion euros , of which a little more than half was to be guaranteed by the state .
hre shares were hammered in afternoon trading on the frankfurt stock exchange however , losing 35.15 percent to 4.87 euros .
meanwhile , the government said it would guarantee private bank accounts , estimated to be worth 1.6 trillion euros .
economics professor hans-peter burghof of the university of hohenheim told german radio that amount represented " the biggest guarantee in history .
" never has anyone anywhere in the world guaranteed such a sum in two simple sentences , " he said , while noting that in principle the idea of giving guarantees was to ensure they would not be needed .
merkel pledges to protect financial system bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel tried to instill calm in investors and savers chancellor angela merkel told reporters on sunday that the government " will not allow an institution 's crisis to become a crisis for the entire system . "
" we are saying to women and men savers that their deposits are safe .
the federal government promises that , " merkel said .
questions about the german government assurance of an estimated 1 trillion euros -lrb- $ 1.4 trillion -rrb- of personal savings at german banks meanwhile were being raised on monday .
neighbouring nations came under pressure to follow germany 's lead .
berlin described the assurance to savers , issued by chancellor merkel in two sentences in front of television cameras on sunday , as " able to be relied on . "
berlin has not announced any legislation on a deposit-insurance scheme beyond existing bank-industry guarantees .
officials said they were still talking to banks on how to shape the guarantee .
merkel 's spokesman ulrich wilhelm said in berlin , " it 's a political statement that can be relied on and is decisive . "
the german government and its capabilities stood behind this assurance , he added .
jonathan todd , spokesman for european competition commissioner neelie kroes , said : " we were informed by the german authorities of their intentions .
" the commission notes that the measures seem to be limited to retail bank deposits , and so less liable to give rise to distortions of competition . "
todd added , " in general , retail deposit guarantee schemes for savers can be an appropriate policy response to fears regarding the stability of the banking system . "
the crisis reached germany with the stumble by hre and the embarrassment which followed a 35-billion-euro bail-out a week ago which proved inadequate .
global insight senior economist timo klein told reporters : " since they were unable to correct themselves , financial markets looked to the german government -lrb- for help -rrb- .
the dax is now looking for a general plan for the banks , maybe as early as wednesday . "
brussels sees no problem with german plan bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the commission is keeping an eye on developments in brussels , the european commission said the german decision regarding private accounts appeared to conform to eu competition rules and did not pose the same problems as a similar announcement by ireland .
" the commission notes that the measures seem to be limited to retail bank deposits , so -lrb- it is -rrb- less liable to give rise to distortion of competition , " said commission spokesman todd .
in britain , prime minister gordon brown 's spokesman said london understood that berlin did not plan to pass legislation on the guarantees and added : " we have been in the process of seeking clarification from germany as to what they have committed themselves to . "
an initial guarantee issued by the irish government to banks has drawn criticism from several european union countries which feared it could distort competition by making irish bank accounts more attractive to eu savers .
hre management under fire bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the hre has tottered on the verge of collapse for days meanwhile , as germany sought to calm the public with a " decisive " pledge about savings , property lender hre was under further pressure from other banks and berlin to sack its chief executive .
german finance minister peer steinbrueck said it was " unthinkable " to keep dealing with the same hre top management .
he charged that hre , at the same time as seeking state aid , had used lawyers against the government so as to " escape its responsibilities . "
in monday trading , hre stock declined as much as 40 percent from friday 's close as investors worried that the new bail-out might also prove inadequate .
in brussels , the eu commission 's todd , said , " as soon as the details are notified to us we will assess very quickly whether the new measures are compatible with -lrb- the eu 's -rrb- state aid rules . "
a newspaper , die welt , was to appear tuesday with a report that hre was blaming its plunge from grace on a downgrading by ratings agencies that allowed creditors to call up loans .
berlin has refused demands by the banking industry to nationalize hre , a lender seen in germany as too important to let fail .
steinbrueck said financial securities that have been disdained in the past by central banks would be used as security for much of the 15-billion-euro expansion of the hre bail-out .
the european central bank -lrb- ecb -rrb- had agreed to this , he said .
" nobody can forecast just yet how much this paper is actually worth , " he added .

6 , three days after a pkk attack on a border post killed 15 turkish soldiers . according to a statement released by the turkish general staff , the warplanes bombed pkk positions in the mountainous avasin region of northern iraq .
" the planes returned safely to base after successfully completing their mission , " the statement said .
turkish jets also attacked positions in the same area on sunday night .
the attack on friday night on the aktutun border post in the south-eastern province of hakkari that left 15 soldiers and 23 pkk separatists dead has shocked turkey and led to the general staff on sunday announcing that it was to relocate five military border posts .
a spokesman for the military said the administration of the kurdish autonomous area in iraq had not helped in the fight against the pkk , despite overtures by iraq 's kurdish president jalal talabani .
after the attack talabani called his turkish counterpart abdullah gul to propose a meeting of high-ranking security experts from both sides , suggesting iraqi willingness to help turkey de-escalate the situation .
the turkish air force has conducted a number of airstrikes against pkk targets in northern iraq since a week-long cross-border incursion into northern iraq was launched in february .
ankara blames the separatist group for the deaths of more than 35,000 people since the early 1980s when the pkk began its fight for independence or autonomy for the mainly kurdish-populated south-east of turkey .
turkish dead laid to rest as tensions heighten bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : angry crowds protested the deaths of turkish soldiers the 15 turkish soldiers killed in saturday 's attack on an iraq border post were borne to their graves on sunday by a crowd of thousands shouting angry slogans against the perpetrators - the outlawed kurdish workers party , or pkk .
the attack , which claimed 38 lives in total , was launched by the guerrilla group , which operates from inside iraq , after a week of turkish air force raids on their positions .
turkish government and military leaders have vowed to escalate the campaign against the pkk .
" we will now conduct our campaign against terrorism even more decisively , " said turkish prime minister recep tayyip erdogan , after he broke off his journey to central asia in response to the attack .
but turkey can not win the war against the pkk by military force alone .
one day before the aktutun border post attack , the worst pkk assault this year , the turkish air force had bombarded suspected pkk positions in the qandil mountains of iraq , close to the iranian border .
large pkk operation targets border post bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : kurdish troops hit the turkish post on the iraq border at the same time , the attack on the troops stationed at aktutun was about to be launched , although they did n't know it .
according to turkish media reports , more than 300 pkk fighters assembled for the raid on the border post .
at daybreak on saturday they opened fire with heavy weapons from iraq as other fighters moved in on the ground .
the battle at aktutun lasted for five hours .
it was the fifth attack on the post since 1992 .
turkey hit back with combat helicopters and special forces .
after the attack , iraqi president jalal talabani , himself a kurd , called his turkish counterpart abdullah gul to propose a meeting of high-ranking security experts from both sides , suggesting iraqi willingness to help turkey de-escalate the situation .
however , turkish daily millyet commented on sunday that " long- range weapons can not be brought into position without those responsible for security in iraq noticing . "
also under question is the value of us support in informing turkey of pkk movements within iraq .
the turkish parliament is due to vote monday on whether to allow the army to extend its mandate for operations in northern iraq for a further year .
the approval of the mandate was not in doubt even before saturday 's attack , as evidently turkey 's operations in northern iraq had not brought the pkk to its knees .
in february , turkey launched a ground offensive in iraq , although us criticism brought it to a rapid end .
us defense secretary robert gates has suggested the military struggle against the pkk be conducted together with economic and political means .
" only this way can terrorism be stopped , " he said .
the pkk is considered by the united states and the european union to be a terrorist group . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the leaders of germany 's ruling coalition agreed sunday to push for a constitutional change allowing the military to help out local law enforcement in certain cases .
germany places strict limits on its military given the excesses committed during the nazi era .
yet politicians have argued that the military could fill an important role in the case of a terrorist attack , acting as a backup to police .
german defense minister franz josef jung welcomed the decision to “ protect citizens in germany ” according to his spokesman .
ruling parties find compromise bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some are concerned that the military will be used against protestors germany 's interior minister wolfgang schaeuble had originally called for an even broader use of the military to respond to domestic terrorist threats .
many of these demands were scrapped in reaching the final compromise .

“ we have finally found a way to deploy the bundeswehr in specific , confined cases , ” kauder said .

6 , three days after a pkk attack on a border post killed 15 turkish soldiers . according to a statement released by the turkish general staff , the warplanes bombed pkk positions in the mountainous avasin region of northern iraq .
" the planes returned safely to base after successfully completing their mission , " the statement said .
turkish jets also attacked positions in the same area on sunday night .
the attack on friday night on the aktutun border post in the south-eastern province of hakkari that left 15 soldiers and 23 pkk separatists dead has shocked turkey and led to the general staff on sunday announcing that it was to relocate five military border posts .
a spokesman for the military said the administration of the kurdish autonomous area in iraq had not helped in the fight against the pkk , despite overtures by iraq 's kurdish president jalal talabani .
after the attack talabani called his turkish counterpart abdullah gul to propose a meeting of high-ranking security experts from both sides , suggesting iraqi willingness to help turkey de-escalate the situation .
the turkish air force has conducted a number of airstrikes against pkk targets in northern iraq since a week-long cross-border incursion into northern iraq was launched in february .
ankara blames the separatist group for the deaths of more than 35,000 people since the early 1980s when the pkk began its fight for independence or autonomy for the mainly kurdish-populated south-east of turkey .
turkish dead laid to rest as tensions heighten bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : angry crowds protested the deaths of turkish soldiers the 15 turkish soldiers killed in saturday 's attack on an iraq border post were borne to their graves on sunday by a crowd of thousands shouting angry slogans against the perpetrators - the outlawed kurdish workers party , or pkk .
the attack , which claimed 38 lives in total , was launched by the guerrilla group , which operates from inside iraq , after a week of turkish air force raids on their positions .
turkish government and military leaders have vowed to escalate the campaign against the pkk .
" we will now conduct our campaign against terrorism even more decisively , " said turkish prime minister recep tayyip erdogan , after he broke off his journey to central asia in response to the attack .
but turkey can not win the war against the pkk by military force alone .
one day before the aktutun border post attack , the worst pkk assault this year , the turkish air force had bombarded suspected pkk positions in the qandil mountains of iraq , close to the iranian border .
large pkk operation targets border post bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : kurdish troops hit the turkish post on the iraq border at the same time , the attack on the troops stationed at aktutun was about to be launched , although they did n't know it .
according to turkish media reports , more than 300 pkk fighters assembled for the raid on the border post .
at daybreak on saturday they opened fire with heavy weapons from iraq as other fighters moved in on the ground .
the battle at aktutun lasted for five hours .
it was the fifth attack on the post since 1992 .
turkey hit back with combat helicopters and special forces .
after the attack , iraqi president jalal talabani , himself a kurd , called his turkish counterpart abdullah gul to propose a meeting of high-ranking security experts from both sides , suggesting iraqi willingness to help turkey de-escalate the situation .
however , turkish daily millyet commented on sunday that " long- range weapons can not be brought into position without those responsible for security in iraq noticing . "
also under question is the value of us support in informing turkey of pkk movements within iraq .
the turkish parliament is due to vote monday on whether to allow the army to extend its mandate for operations in northern iraq for a further year .
the approval of the mandate was not in doubt even before saturday 's attack , as evidently turkey 's operations in northern iraq had not brought the pkk to its knees .
in february , turkey launched a ground offensive in iraq , although us criticism brought it to a rapid end .
us defense secretary robert gates has suggested the military struggle against the pkk be conducted together with economic and political means .
" only this way can terrorism be stopped , " he said .

yet investors remained skittish about europe 's financial future . calls for a common european approach to the banking crisis continued on monday as both the european and asian stock markets were down sharply in early trading .
up until this weekend , germany had stoically opposed issuing a blanket guarantee on all bank deposits despite other countries moving to do so .
yet with confidence deeply shaken after a first bailout for hypo real estate fell through , the german government abruptly changed course on sunday .

on saturday , leaders of britain , france , germany and italy said they would protect fragile banks , but would not copy the blanket $ 700 billion bailout agreed in the us last week .
eu finance ministers will try to put together plans on monday and tuesday for restoring confidence in the banking system .
germany looks to restore confidence germany had previously guaranteed 20,000 euros -lrb- $ 28,400 -rrb- savings per person .
finance ministry spokesman torsten albig told the business daily handelsblatt that the estimated value of the guaranteed all accounts would total 568 billion euros .
handelsblatt said the state was the only " fire brigade " that could come to the rescue in the face of a crisis of this size .
" this means the government and the banks will have to bite the bullet , " it said .

on saturday , leaders of britain , france , germany and italy said they would protect fragile banks , but would not copy the blanket $ 700 billion bailout agreed in the us last week .
eu finance ministers will try to put together plans on monday and tuesday for restoring confidence in the banking system .
germany looks to restore confidence germany had previously guaranteed 20,000 euros -lrb- $ 28,400 -rrb- savings per person .
finance ministry spokesman torsten albig told the business daily handelsblatt that the estimated value of the guaranteed all accounts would total 568 billion euros .
handelsblatt said the state was the only " fire brigade " that could come to the rescue in the face of a crisis of this size .
" this means the government and the banks will have to bite the bullet , " it said .
" this is an important signal intended to bring a calming , instead of reactions that are disproportionate and make crisis resolution and crisis prevention more difficult , " finance minister peer steinbrueck said . dw staff -lrb- th -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

smaller teams are now losing their respect for the champions , who are only 11th in the table after two wins in seven matches , beckenbauer wrote in his column for bild newspaper on monday .
" the mythos that in the end bayern -lrb- almost -rrb- always win has taken a break ... the league senses that we are vulnerable , " he said .
team needs to work it out bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : another one of those days bayern followed up two successive league defeats by with a 3-3 draw at home saturday by bochum who scored two late goals to earn a point .
there were jeers from bayern fans .
coach juergen klinsmann said the performance was unacceptable .
beckenbauer said the team gave bochum far too much room to play .
he also hoped goalkeeper michael rensing would soon radiate the same assurance between the posts as the now retired oliver kahn .
" bayern will only be able to recapture the mythos with hard work , " he said .
can they shape up ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : klinsmann still has the dressing room on side " i keep my fingers crossed for juergen klinsmann .
it may be the case that he upset many fans with radical changes .
the criticism from the stands and the media is something he will have to tolerate . "
however beckenbauer said the bayern board would need to be remain calm , and that the relationship between klinsmann and the team was " intact . "
" that was not for example the case in the end with felix magath -lrb- dismissed in early 2007 before ottmar hitzfeld took charge -rrb- .
with klinsmann i see no rift .
he needs time for his ideas to take effect .
" we have to have patience and analyze in the winter break what needs to be done . "
coach sees reasons for optimism bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : do they need to play harder ?
klinsmann said sunday he was determined to correct the mistakes and get bayern moving back up the league table .
" we understand the fans ' dismay and disappointment .
they have every right to voice it , " he told the bayern munich internet television channel fcb.tv.
" seven games into the bundesliga season , what bayern have achieved is not acceptable , and i wo n't accept it either . "
however the coach said he was still optimistic for the season .
" we can still hit all our targets .
we 're through in the dfb cup , we 're top of our champions league group , and in the bundesliga , we fortunately have enough games to put things right step by step - although we obviously need more determination , and the players have to start living up to expectations .
we have a lot of work ahead of us , " he said . dpa news agency -lrb- th -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

yet investors remained skittish about europe 's financial future . calls for a common european approach to the banking crisis continued on monday as both the european and asian stock markets were down sharply in early trading .
up until this weekend , germany had stoically opposed issuing a blanket guarantee on all bank deposits despite other countries moving to do so .
yet with confidence deeply shaken after a first bailout for hypo real estate fell through , the german government abruptly changed course on sunday .
in an attempt to prevent a run on banks , germany announced it will guarantee all personal bank deposits in the country .
“ we tell all savings account holders that your deposits are safe .
the federal government assures it , ” german chancellor angela merkel said after an emergency government meeting in a bid to prevent a panic run on banks .
now britain is reportedly under pressure to change its stance .
britain had criticized recent decisions by ireland and greece to guarantee savings accounts , worrying that the moves could shift money away from british banks .
germany leads , others follow bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : fortis is getting help from a french bank british finance minister alistair darling is expected to address the issue in a speech to lawmakers on monday .
britain has already promised to increase the level of private savings guaranteed by the government to 50,000 pounds -lrb- $ 88,000 -rrb- per person .
the government has hesitated to go any higher than that due to the potential costs involved .
darling is reportedly considering using public funds to take stakes in banks .

6 , three days after a pkk attack on a border post killed 15 turkish soldiers . according to a statement released by the turkish general staff , the warplanes bombed pkk positions in the mountainous avasin region of northern iraq .
" the planes returned safely to base after successfully completing their mission , " the statement said .
turkish jets also attacked positions in the same area on sunday night .
the attack on friday night on the aktutun border post in the south-eastern province of hakkari that left 15 soldiers and 23 pkk separatists dead has shocked turkey and led to the general staff on sunday announcing that it was to relocate five military border posts .
a spokesman for the military said the administration of the kurdish autonomous area in iraq had not helped in the fight against the pkk , despite overtures by iraq 's kurdish president jalal talabani .
after the attack talabani called his turkish counterpart abdullah gul to propose a meeting of high-ranking security experts from both sides , suggesting iraqi willingness to help turkey de-escalate the situation .
the turkish air force has conducted a number of airstrikes against pkk targets in northern iraq since a week-long cross-border incursion into northern iraq was launched in february .
ankara blames the separatist group for the deaths of more than 35,000 people since the early 1980s when the pkk began its fight for independence or autonomy for the mainly kurdish-populated south-east of turkey .
turkish dead laid to rest as tensions heighten bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : angry crowds protested the deaths of turkish soldiers the 15 turkish soldiers killed in saturday 's attack on an iraq border post were borne to their graves on sunday by a crowd of thousands shouting angry slogans against the perpetrators - the outlawed kurdish workers party , or pkk .
the attack , which claimed 38 lives in total , was launched by the guerrilla group , which operates from inside iraq , after a week of turkish air force raids on their positions .
turkish government and military leaders have vowed to escalate the campaign against the pkk .
" we will now conduct our campaign against terrorism even more decisively , " said turkish prime minister recep tayyip erdogan , after he broke off his journey to central asia in response to the attack .
but turkey can not win the war against the pkk by military force alone .
one day before the aktutun border post attack , the worst pkk assault this year , the turkish air force had bombarded suspected pkk positions in the qandil mountains of iraq , close to the iranian border .
large pkk operation targets border post bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : kurdish troops hit the turkish post on the iraq border at the same time , the attack on the troops stationed at aktutun was about to be launched , although they did n't know it .
according to turkish media reports , more than 300 pkk fighters assembled for the raid on the border post .
at daybreak on saturday they opened fire with heavy weapons from iraq as other fighters moved in on the ground .
the battle at aktutun lasted for five hours .
it was the fifth attack on the post since 1992 .
turkey hit back with combat helicopters and special forces .
after the attack , iraqi president jalal talabani , himself a kurd , called his turkish counterpart abdullah gul to propose a meeting of high-ranking security experts from both sides , suggesting iraqi willingness to help turkey de-escalate the situation .
however , turkish daily millyet commented on sunday that " long- range weapons can not be brought into position without those responsible for security in iraq noticing . "
also under question is the value of us support in informing turkey of pkk movements within iraq .
the turkish parliament is due to vote monday on whether to allow the army to extend its mandate for operations in northern iraq for a further year .
the approval of the mandate was not in doubt even before saturday 's attack , as evidently turkey 's operations in northern iraq had not brought the pkk to its knees .
in february , turkey launched a ground offensive in iraq , although us criticism brought it to a rapid end .
us defense secretary robert gates has suggested the military struggle against the pkk be conducted together with economic and political means .
" only this way can terrorism be stopped , " he said .
the pkk is considered by the united states and the european union to be a terrorist group . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

turkish dead laid to rest as tensions heighten bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : angry crowds protested the deaths of turkish soldiers the 15 turkish soldiers killed in saturday 's attack on an iraq border post were borne to their graves on sunday by a crowd of thousands shouting angry slogans against the perpetrators - the outlawed kurdish workers party , or pkk .
the attack , which claimed 38 lives in total , was launched by the guerrilla group , which operates from inside iraq , after a week of turkish air force raids on their positions .
turkish government and military leaders have vowed to escalate the campaign against the pkk .
" we will now conduct our campaign against terrorism even more decisively , " said turkish prime minister recep tayyip erdogan , after he broke off his journey to central asia in response to the attack .
but turkey can not win the war against the pkk by military force alone .
one day before the aktutun border post attack , the worst pkk assault this year , the turkish air force had bombarded suspected pkk positions in the qandil mountains of iraq , close to the iranian border .
large pkk operation targets border post bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : kurdish troops hit the turkish post on the iraq border at the same time , the attack on the troops stationed at aktutun was about to be launched , although they did n't know it .
according to turkish media reports , more than 300 pkk fighters assembled for the raid on the border post .
at daybreak on saturday they opened fire with heavy weapons from iraq as other fighters moved in on the ground .
the battle at aktutun lasted for five hours .
it was the fifth attack on the post since 1992 .
turkey hit back with combat helicopters and special forces .
after the attack , iraqi president jalal talabani , himself a kurd , called his turkish counterpart abdullah gul to propose a meeting of high-ranking security experts from both sides , suggesting iraqi willingness to help turkey de-escalate the situation .
however , turkish daily millyet commented on sunday that " long- range weapons can not be brought into position without those responsible for security in iraq noticing . "
also under question is the value of us support in informing turkey of pkk movements within iraq .
the turkish parliament is due to vote monday on whether to allow the army to extend its mandate for operations in northern iraq for a further year .
the approval of the mandate was not in doubt even before saturday 's attack , as evidently turkey 's operations in northern iraq had not brought the pkk to its knees .
in february , turkey launched a ground offensive in iraq , although us criticism brought it to a rapid end .
us defense secretary robert gates has suggested the military struggle against the pkk be conducted together with economic and political means .
" only this way can terrorism be stopped , " he said .
the pkk is considered by the united states and the european union to be a terrorist group . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

that package had a price tag of 35 billion euros . the german finance ministry said in a statement that the new deal will see the financial sector topping up that sum with an additional 15 billion euros .
" with this mutually agreed solution , the institution -lrb- hypo real estate -rrb- will be stabilized and with it , germany strengthened as a place to conduct finance in difficult times , " the statement said . on monday , german finance minister peer steinbrueck said he would not rule out increasing the government 's gurantee for hypo real estate -lrb- hre -rrb- which is worth almost 27 billion euros .
hre on monday hailed the bailout , saying it would allow the company to keep functioning amidst the ongoing financial crisis .
" we are very thankful for the backing of all those involved , " hre boss georg funke said in a statement .
" the solution guarantees the stability of the hypo real estate group , which will have enough liqudity and will be able to continue functioning even as the financial crisis continues , " funke added .
government keen to avoid knock-on effect , panic bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the government is unhappy about what it sees as poor management decisions speaking to reporters before the deal was announced , merkel said the government was " pulling out all the stops " to save hypo real estate -lrb- hre -rrb- . " the government says today that we will not allow an institution 's crisis to become a crisis for the entire system , " merkel said . merkel 's government had scrambled to reach a deal before asian markets opened monday , fearing the company would not last long for more than a few days without a rescue package .
the chancellor also warned that managers at financial institutions should be held accountable for what she termed irresponsible behavior .
" we owe that to the taxpayers in germany , " she said .
in a further move to shore up the german banking system , the government issued a guarantee for all savings in german banks . in a bid to stave off panic withdrawals , finance minister peer steinbrueck assured that german bank account holders need not worry about losing a " single euro " in the crisis .
" that is an important message intended to create calm and not reactions that would be disproportional and make the current crisis management and crisis prevention even more difficult , " steinbrueck said .
finance ministry spokesman torsten albig told business daily handelsblatt that the estimated value of the guaranteed accounts would total 568 billion euros .
hre management under fire bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german banks have been feeling the fallout of troubles on wall street hypo real estate , germany 's second largest commercial property lender is the first german blue-chip company to seek a government bailout . hre , which mainly lends to commercial projects and to build public facilities such as airports and roads , is the biggest german casualty of the crisis that has spread from new york in the last month . steinbrueck had earlier said he was " outraged " at the management of the hre group because a " further liquidity gap in billions -lrb- of euros -rrb- " had materialized . " the german government refuses to be forced into any co-responsibility by this banking institute , " he said . hre ran into trouble mid-september after a credit freeze following the collapse of us investment bank lehman brothers .

that 's the message german politicians gave private depositors .
the government guaranteed savings in german accounts .
according to the finance ministry , the federal government is vouching for " more than 1 trillion euros . "
but even such a guarantee would n't be worth a cent if everyone ran to the bank for their money - not even the government could pay such a huge sum of money .
the core of the guarantee serves a psychological purpose : despite all the talk about the financial crisis ' dimensions , citizens should n't get any more worried than they already are .
by giving a guarantee , the state is hoping to avoid a situation where it would have to pay anything back .
but there 's a different problem : no german bank has yet faced difficulties in this crisis due to private customers wanting their money back .
even at britain 's northern rock , customers did n't start demanding their money back until the bank was already deep in the crisis .
there are two reasons for the difficulties banks are facing .
either they have too many financial products based on junk us mortgages that needed to be written off on their books or they have n't been successful in receiving short-term capital from money markets to keep up with running commitments because skeptical banks are hardly lending to each other .
the state 's guarantee for private savings does not solve either of these problems .
it is a preventative relaxant for the possibility that additional institutions take a tumble .
to deal with the actual problem , politicians are now talking about a " national protective umbrella . "
there is a possibility that individual governments will put together bail-out packages which , like the united states , buy rotten debts from banks .
politicians in at an emergency summit in paris could n't agree non a billion-euro package for a european solution , and by the end of the meeting the leaders denied even having the idea of creating one .
they did , however , agree to coordinate their actions better in the future , though it will still be up to each country to decide on the best way to protect its banks .
but the example of state guarantees for private deposits shows that there wo n't be any national answers to this financial crisis .
chancellor angela merkel criticized the irish government for guaranteeing private deposits , and then , a few days later , does the same thing .
the more countries offer such guarantees , the greater the pressure will be on the remaining governments to do the same . otherwise their banks will risk losing customers - and capital - to other european countries .
the end result will be a european solution - even if it 's not one member states agreed to after a set of negotiations .
officially , financial policy is left up to national governments , but the reality has long been a different story .
the same is true for " national protective umbrellas " and other safeguards .
when a country buys its banks bad debts in a big way , other countries are forced to act in the same way .
as europe 's biggest economy , germany has a special role in this regard .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de finance -pipe- 06.10.2008 european leaders commit to tackling financial crisis großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : european leaders said they will take all necessary steps to protect euro zone banks european union leaders will take " all the necessary steps " to ensure the stability of the bloc 's financial system and protect citizens ' savings , an eu statement said monday , oct .
6 . such measures would include the injection of liquidity by european central banks , bail-outs for troubled banks and guarantees for deposits , the joint statement said .
noting that no european depositor had lost their savings so far , the eu leaders called for " coordination and close cooperation " in dealing with the effects of the global credit crunch .
the unprecedented statement came as european stock markets tumbled and as finance ministers from the 15 eu countries that share the euro were holding talks in luxembourg on ways to deal with the continent 's exploding financial crisis .
member states have hitherto reacted individually to events in their own countries , but the urgency of the crisis has sparked a rising chorus of calls for coordinated action .
" i think it 's extremely important that european countries use similar principles in how they treat banks in problems -lrb- sic -rrb- , for example , how they intervene , what time they intervene , what policy measures they are prepared to apply , " dutch finance minister wouter bos said ahead of the meeting in luxembourg .
europe works towards a common approach bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : almunia was confident of a eu coordinated action officials from the eu 's executive echoed that call , with eu economic and monetary affairs commissioner joaquin almunia saying : " we should have a common approach , coordinated action , to avoid unilateral decisions that create negative spillovers . "
but the decision by the german government on sunday to offer a blanket savings guarantee to private depositors has piled the pressure on other eu member states to follow suit .
austria , for instance , raised its guarantees on savings deposits late sunday , just hours after the german plan was announced .
sweden and denmark raised their guarantees on monday morning .
while insisting that austrian banks were sound , austrian finance minister wilhelm molterer said the government had taken the decision " to avoid a competitive disadvantage with germany , so that savings deposits do not flow off to germany . "
german plan up for discussion bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel 's government has pledged to protect investors german officials appeared under pressure to explain their actions after earlier criticizing an irish guarantee , with bos saying that the german plan " is one of the issues on the table here . "
but german deputy finance minister joerg asmussen stressed that " germany 's approach is fundamentally different from the irish one .
they set up a rescue shield which basically discriminates in the internal market , while germany 's approach is aimed at making sure that no depositor loses a single euro . "
about a third of the 15 eu countries that share the common currency have already moved to safeguard bank deposits in some way or other - among them germany , austria , greece , ireland and belgium .
but after a meeting of the leaders of the eu 's four biggest economies in paris on saturday , proposals for setting up an eu-wide rescue fund appeared to have been taken off the table .
" i do n't think there 's going to be anything near consensus about a european fund .
i hope there is going to be a consensus about a common approach , on principles that should be applied whenever we want to intervene or whenever we want to help banks in problems -lrb- sic -rrb- , " bos said . dpa news agency send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

6 . such measures would include the injection of liquidity by european central banks , bail-outs for troubled banks and guarantees for deposits , the joint statement said .
noting that no european depositor had lost their savings so far , the eu leaders called for " coordination and close cooperation " in dealing with the effects of the global credit crunch .
the unprecedented statement came as european stock markets tumbled and as finance ministers from the 15 eu countries that share the euro were holding talks in luxembourg on ways to deal with the continent 's exploding financial crisis .
member states have hitherto reacted individually to events in their own countries , but the urgency of the crisis has sparked a rising chorus of calls for coordinated action .
" i think it 's extremely important that european countries use similar principles in how they treat banks in problems -lrb- sic -rrb- , for example , how they intervene , what time they intervene , what policy measures they are prepared to apply , " dutch finance minister wouter bos said ahead of the meeting in luxembourg .

"
but the decision by the german government on sunday to offer a blanket savings guarantee to private depositors has piled the pressure on other eu member states to follow suit .
austria , for instance , raised its guarantees on savings deposits late sunday , just hours after the german plan was announced .
sweden and denmark raised their guarantees on monday morning .
while insisting that austrian banks were sound , austrian finance minister wilhelm molterer said the government had taken the decision " to avoid a competitive disadvantage with germany , so that savings deposits do not flow off to germany . "

but german deputy finance minister joerg asmussen stressed that " germany 's approach is fundamentally different from the irish one .
they set up a rescue shield which basically discriminates in the internal market , while germany 's approach is aimed at making sure that no depositor loses a single euro . "
about a third of the 15 eu countries that share the common currency have already moved to safeguard bank deposits in some way or other - among them germany , austria , greece , ireland and belgium .
but after a meeting of the leaders of the eu 's four biggest economies in paris on saturday , proposals for setting up an eu-wide rescue fund appeared to have been taken off the table .
" i do n't think there 's going to be anything near consensus about a european fund .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de finance -pipe- 06.10.2008 european leaders commit to tackling financial crisis großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : european leaders said they will take all necessary steps to protect euro zone banks european union leaders will take " all the necessary steps " to ensure the stability of the bloc 's financial system and protect citizens ' savings , an eu statement said monday , oct .
6 . such measures would include the injection of liquidity by european central banks , bail-outs for troubled banks and guarantees for deposits , the joint statement said .
noting that no european depositor had lost their savings so far , the eu leaders called for " coordination and close cooperation " in dealing with the effects of the global credit crunch .
the unprecedented statement came as european stock markets tumbled and as finance ministers from the 15 eu countries that share the euro were holding talks in luxembourg on ways to deal with the continent 's exploding financial crisis .
member states have hitherto reacted individually to events in their own countries , but the urgency of the crisis has sparked a rising chorus of calls for coordinated action .
" i think it 's extremely important that european countries use similar principles in how they treat banks in problems -lrb- sic -rrb- , for example , how they intervene , what time they intervene , what policy measures they are prepared to apply , " dutch finance minister wouter bos said ahead of the meeting in luxembourg .
europe works towards a common approach bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : almunia was confident of a eu coordinated action officials from the eu 's executive echoed that call , with eu economic and monetary affairs commissioner joaquin almunia saying : " we should have a common approach , coordinated action , to avoid unilateral decisions that create negative spillovers . "
but the decision by the german government on sunday to offer a blanket savings guarantee to private depositors has piled the pressure on other eu member states to follow suit .
austria , for instance , raised its guarantees on savings deposits late sunday , just hours after the german plan was announced .
sweden and denmark raised their guarantees on monday morning .
while insisting that austrian banks were sound , austrian finance minister wilhelm molterer said the government had taken the decision " to avoid a competitive disadvantage with germany , so that savings deposits do not flow off to germany . "
german plan up for discussion bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel 's government has pledged to protect investors german officials appeared under pressure to explain their actions after earlier criticizing an irish guarantee , with bos saying that the german plan " is one of the issues on the table here . "
but german deputy finance minister joerg asmussen stressed that " germany 's approach is fundamentally different from the irish one .
they set up a rescue shield which basically discriminates in the internal market , while germany 's approach is aimed at making sure that no depositor loses a single euro . "
about a third of the 15 eu countries that share the common currency have already moved to safeguard bank deposits in some way or other - among them germany , austria , greece , ireland and belgium .
but after a meeting of the leaders of the eu 's four biggest economies in paris on saturday , proposals for setting up an eu-wide rescue fund appeared to have been taken off the table .
" i do n't think there 's going to be anything near consensus about a european fund .
i hope there is going to be a consensus about a common approach , on principles that should be applied whenever we want to intervene or whenever we want to help banks in problems -lrb- sic -rrb- , " bos said . dpa news agency send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

that 's the message german politicians gave private depositors .
the government guaranteed savings in german accounts .
according to the finance ministry , the federal government is vouching for " more than 1 trillion euros . "
but even such a guarantee would n't be worth a cent if everyone ran to the bank for their money - not even the government could pay such a huge sum of money .
the core of the guarantee serves a psychological purpose : despite all the talk about the financial crisis ' dimensions , citizens should n't get any more worried than they already are .
by giving a guarantee , the state is hoping to avoid a situation where it would have to pay anything back .
but there 's a different problem : no german bank has yet faced difficulties in this crisis due to private customers wanting their money back .
even at britain 's northern rock , customers did n't start demanding their money back until the bank was already deep in the crisis .
there are two reasons for the difficulties banks are facing .
either they have too many financial products based on junk us mortgages that needed to be written off on their books or they have n't been successful in receiving short-term capital from money markets to keep up with running commitments because skeptical banks are hardly lending to each other .
the state 's guarantee for private savings does not solve either of these problems .
it is a preventative relaxant for the possibility that additional institutions take a tumble .
to deal with the actual problem , politicians are now talking about a " national protective umbrella . "
there is a possibility that individual governments will put together bail-out packages which , like the united states , buy rotten debts from banks .
politicians in at an emergency summit in paris could n't agree non a billion-euro package for a european solution , and by the end of the meeting the leaders denied even having the idea of creating one .
they did , however , agree to coordinate their actions better in the future , though it will still be up to each country to decide on the best way to protect its banks .
but the example of state guarantees for private deposits shows that there wo n't be any national answers to this financial crisis .
chancellor angela merkel criticized the irish government for guaranteeing private deposits , and then , a few days later , does the same thing .
the more countries offer such guarantees , the greater the pressure will be on the remaining governments to do the same . otherwise their banks will risk losing customers - and capital - to other european countries .
the end result will be a european solution - even if it 's not one member states agreed to after a set of negotiations .
officially , financial policy is left up to national governments , but the reality has long been a different story .
the same is true for " national protective umbrellas " and other safeguards .
when a country buys its banks bad debts in a big way , other countries are forced to act in the same way .
as europe 's biggest economy , germany has a special role in this regard .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de finance -pipe- 06.10.2008 german government under pressure to deliver on crisis promise großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : doom and gloom : germany has not escaped the financial storm sweeping in from the us the german government is under pressure to deliver as it races to reassure investors and individual savers that it will protect europe 's biggest economy from falling victim to the global financial crisis . the stock exchange may not have got the message however as shares tumbled seven percent monday in line with heavy losses elsewhere in europe and asia as wall street plunged too .
berlin hoped a new 50-billion-euro -lrb- $ 68-billion -rrb- rescue plan for the distressed mortgage lender hypo real estate -lrb- hre -rrb- , a munich-based company that lends to commercial developers and municipalities to build hotels , offices , roads , airports and the like , and a blanket guarantee on private bank accounts would prevent panic from seizing a nation of savers .
finance minister peer steinbrueck said he did not rule out raising state guarantees on hre credit lines and that there was " a plan b in the drawer " to ensure the banking sector did not collapse .
steinbrueck did not provide details but told a press conference : " we are aware that we will not get very far with case-by-case solutions . "
the bank is now to be provided with credit lines worth a total 50 billion euros , of which a little more than half was to be guaranteed by the state .
hre shares were hammered in afternoon trading on the frankfurt stock exchange however , losing 35.15 percent to 4.87 euros .
meanwhile , the government said it would guarantee private bank accounts , estimated to be worth 1.6 trillion euros .
economics professor hans-peter burghof of the university of hohenheim told german radio that amount represented " the biggest guarantee in history .
" never has anyone anywhere in the world guaranteed such a sum in two simple sentences , " he said , while noting that in principle the idea of giving guarantees was to ensure they would not be needed .
merkel pledges to protect financial system bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel tried to instill calm in investors and savers chancellor angela merkel told reporters on sunday that the government " will not allow an institution 's crisis to become a crisis for the entire system . "
" we are saying to women and men savers that their deposits are safe .
the federal government promises that , " merkel said .
questions about the german government assurance of an estimated 1 trillion euros -lrb- $ 1.4 trillion -rrb- of personal savings at german banks meanwhile were being raised on monday .
neighbouring nations came under pressure to follow germany 's lead .
berlin described the assurance to savers , issued by chancellor merkel in two sentences in front of television cameras on sunday , as " able to be relied on . "
berlin has not announced any legislation on a deposit-insurance scheme beyond existing bank-industry guarantees .
officials said they were still talking to banks on how to shape the guarantee .
merkel 's spokesman ulrich wilhelm said in berlin , " it 's a political statement that can be relied on and is decisive . "
the german government and its capabilities stood behind this assurance , he added .
jonathan todd , spokesman for european competition commissioner neelie kroes , said : " we were informed by the german authorities of their intentions .
" the commission notes that the measures seem to be limited to retail bank deposits , and so less liable to give rise to distortions of competition . "
todd added , " in general , retail deposit guarantee schemes for savers can be an appropriate policy response to fears regarding the stability of the banking system . "
the crisis reached germany with the stumble by hre and the embarrassment which followed a 35-billion-euro bail-out a week ago which proved inadequate .
global insight senior economist timo klein told reporters : " since they were unable to correct themselves , financial markets looked to the german government -lrb- for help -rrb- .
the dax is now looking for a general plan for the banks , maybe as early as wednesday . "
brussels sees no problem with german plan bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the commission is keeping an eye on developments in brussels , the european commission said the german decision regarding private accounts appeared to conform to eu competition rules and did not pose the same problems as a similar announcement by ireland .
" the commission notes that the measures seem to be limited to retail bank deposits , so -lrb- it is -rrb- less liable to give rise to distortion of competition , " said commission spokesman todd .
in britain , prime minister gordon brown 's spokesman said london understood that berlin did not plan to pass legislation on the guarantees and added : " we have been in the process of seeking clarification from germany as to what they have committed themselves to . "
an initial guarantee issued by the irish government to banks has drawn criticism from several european union countries which feared it could distort competition by making irish bank accounts more attractive to eu savers .
hre management under fire bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the hre has tottered on the verge of collapse for days meanwhile , as germany sought to calm the public with a " decisive " pledge about savings , property lender hre was under further pressure from other banks and berlin to sack its chief executive .
german finance minister peer steinbrueck said it was " unthinkable " to keep dealing with the same hre top management .

berlin hoped a new 50-billion-euro -lrb- $ 68-billion -rrb- rescue plan for the distressed mortgage lender hypo real estate -lrb- hre -rrb- , a munich-based company that lends to commercial developers and municipalities to build hotels , offices , roads , airports and the like , and a blanket guarantee on private bank accounts would prevent panic from seizing a nation of savers .
finance minister peer steinbrueck said he did not rule out raising state guarantees on hre credit lines and that there was " a plan b in the drawer " to ensure the banking sector did not collapse .
steinbrueck did not provide details but told a press conference : " we are aware that we will not get very far with case-by-case solutions . "
the bank is now to be provided with credit lines worth a total 50 billion euros , of which a little more than half was to be guaranteed by the state .
hre shares were hammered in afternoon trading on the frankfurt stock exchange however , losing 35.15 percent to 4.87 euros .
meanwhile , the government said it would guarantee private bank accounts , estimated to be worth 1.6 trillion euros .
economics professor hans-peter burghof of the university of hohenheim told german radio that amount represented " the biggest guarantee in history .
" never has anyone anywhere in the world guaranteed such a sum in two simple sentences , " he said , while noting that in principle the idea of giving guarantees was to ensure they would not be needed .
merkel pledges to protect financial system bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel tried to instill calm in investors and savers chancellor angela merkel told reporters on sunday that the government " will not allow an institution 's crisis to become a crisis for the entire system . "
" we are saying to women and men savers that their deposits are safe .
the federal government promises that , " merkel said .
questions about the german government assurance of an estimated 1 trillion euros -lrb- $ 1.4 trillion -rrb- of personal savings at german banks meanwhile were being raised on monday .
neighbouring nations came under pressure to follow germany 's lead .
berlin described the assurance to savers , issued by chancellor merkel in two sentences in front of television cameras on sunday , as " able to be relied on . "
berlin has not announced any legislation on a deposit-insurance scheme beyond existing bank-industry guarantees .
officials said they were still talking to banks on how to shape the guarantee .
merkel 's spokesman ulrich wilhelm said in berlin , " it 's a political statement that can be relied on and is decisive . "
the german government and its capabilities stood behind this assurance , he added .
jonathan todd , spokesman for european competition commissioner neelie kroes , said : " we were informed by the german authorities of their intentions .
" the commission notes that the measures seem to be limited to retail bank deposits , and so less liable to give rise to distortions of competition . "
todd added , " in general , retail deposit guarantee schemes for savers can be an appropriate policy response to fears regarding the stability of the banking system . "
the crisis reached germany with the stumble by hre and the embarrassment which followed a 35-billion-euro bail-out a week ago which proved inadequate .
global insight senior economist timo klein told reporters : " since they were unable to correct themselves , financial markets looked to the german government -lrb- for help -rrb- .
the dax is now looking for a general plan for the banks , maybe as early as wednesday . "
brussels sees no problem with german plan bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the commission is keeping an eye on developments in brussels , the european commission said the german decision regarding private accounts appeared to conform to eu competition rules and did not pose the same problems as a similar announcement by ireland .
" the commission notes that the measures seem to be limited to retail bank deposits , so -lrb- it is -rrb- less liable to give rise to distortion of competition , " said commission spokesman todd .
in britain , prime minister gordon brown 's spokesman said london understood that berlin did not plan to pass legislation on the guarantees and added : " we have been in the process of seeking clarification from germany as to what they have committed themselves to . "
an initial guarantee issued by the irish government to banks has drawn criticism from several european union countries which feared it could distort competition by making irish bank accounts more attractive to eu savers .
hre management under fire bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the hre has tottered on the verge of collapse for days meanwhile , as germany sought to calm the public with a " decisive " pledge about savings , property lender hre was under further pressure from other banks and berlin to sack its chief executive .
german finance minister peer steinbrueck said it was " unthinkable " to keep dealing with the same hre top management .
he charged that hre , at the same time as seeking state aid , had used lawyers against the government so as to " escape its responsibilities . "
in monday trading , hre stock declined as much as 40 percent from friday 's close as investors worried that the new bail-out might also prove inadequate .
in brussels , the eu commission 's todd , said , " as soon as the details are notified to us we will assess very quickly whether the new measures are compatible with -lrb- the eu 's -rrb- state aid rules . "

that 's the message german politicians gave private depositors .
the government guaranteed savings in german accounts .
according to the finance ministry , the federal government is vouching for " more than 1 trillion euros . "
but even such a guarantee would n't be worth a cent if everyone ran to the bank for their money - not even the government could pay such a huge sum of money .
the core of the guarantee serves a psychological purpose : despite all the talk about the financial crisis ' dimensions , citizens should n't get any more worried than they already are .
by giving a guarantee , the state is hoping to avoid a situation where it would have to pay anything back .
but there 's a different problem : no german bank has yet faced difficulties in this crisis due to private customers wanting their money back .
even at britain 's northern rock , customers did n't start demanding their money back until the bank was already deep in the crisis .
there are two reasons for the difficulties banks are facing .
either they have too many financial products based on junk us mortgages that needed to be written off on their books or they have n't been successful in receiving short-term capital from money markets to keep up with running commitments because skeptical banks are hardly lending to each other .
the state 's guarantee for private savings does not solve either of these problems .
it is a preventative relaxant for the possibility that additional institutions take a tumble .
to deal with the actual problem , politicians are now talking about a " national protective umbrella . "
there is a possibility that individual governments will put together bail-out packages which , like the united states , buy rotten debts from banks .
politicians in at an emergency summit in paris could n't agree non a billion-euro package for a european solution , and by the end of the meeting the leaders denied even having the idea of creating one .
they did , however , agree to coordinate their actions better in the future , though it will still be up to each country to decide on the best way to protect its banks .
but the example of state guarantees for private deposits shows that there wo n't be any national answers to this financial crisis .
chancellor angela merkel criticized the irish government for guaranteeing private deposits , and then , a few days later , does the same thing .
the more countries offer such guarantees , the greater the pressure will be on the remaining governments to do the same . otherwise their banks will risk losing customers - and capital - to other european countries .
the end result will be a european solution - even if it 's not one member states agreed to after a set of negotiations .
officially , financial policy is left up to national governments , but the reality has long been a different story .
the same is true for " national protective umbrellas " and other safeguards .
when a country buys its banks bad debts in a big way , other countries are forced to act in the same way .
as europe 's biggest economy , germany has a special role in this regard .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de finance -pipe- 06.10.2008 german government under pressure to deliver on crisis promise großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : doom and gloom : germany has not escaped the financial storm sweeping in from the us the german government is under pressure to deliver as it races to reassure investors and individual savers that it will protect europe 's biggest economy from falling victim to the global financial crisis . the stock exchange may not have got the message however as shares tumbled seven percent monday in line with heavy losses elsewhere in europe and asia as wall street plunged too .
berlin hoped a new 50-billion-euro -lrb- $ 68-billion -rrb- rescue plan for the distressed mortgage lender hypo real estate -lrb- hre -rrb- , a munich-based company that lends to commercial developers and municipalities to build hotels , offices , roads , airports and the like , and a blanket guarantee on private bank accounts would prevent panic from seizing a nation of savers .
finance minister peer steinbrueck said he did not rule out raising state guarantees on hre credit lines and that there was " a plan b in the drawer " to ensure the banking sector did not collapse .
steinbrueck did not provide details but told a press conference : " we are aware that we will not get very far with case-by-case solutions . "
the bank is now to be provided with credit lines worth a total 50 billion euros , of which a little more than half was to be guaranteed by the state .
hre shares were hammered in afternoon trading on the frankfurt stock exchange however , losing 35.15 percent to 4.87 euros .
meanwhile , the government said it would guarantee private bank accounts , estimated to be worth 1.6 trillion euros .
economics professor hans-peter burghof of the university of hohenheim told german radio that amount represented " the biggest guarantee in history .
" never has anyone anywhere in the world guaranteed such a sum in two simple sentences , " he said , while noting that in principle the idea of giving guarantees was to ensure they would not be needed .
merkel pledges to protect financial system bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel tried to instill calm in investors and savers chancellor angela merkel told reporters on sunday that the government " will not allow an institution 's crisis to become a crisis for the entire system . "
" we are saying to women and men savers that their deposits are safe .
the federal government promises that , " merkel said .
questions about the german government assurance of an estimated 1 trillion euros -lrb- $ 1.4 trillion -rrb- of personal savings at german banks meanwhile were being raised on monday .
neighbouring nations came under pressure to follow germany 's lead .
berlin described the assurance to savers , issued by chancellor merkel in two sentences in front of television cameras on sunday , as " able to be relied on . "
berlin has not announced any legislation on a deposit-insurance scheme beyond existing bank-industry guarantees .
officials said they were still talking to banks on how to shape the guarantee .
merkel 's spokesman ulrich wilhelm said in berlin , " it 's a political statement that can be relied on and is decisive . "
the german government and its capabilities stood behind this assurance , he added .
jonathan todd , spokesman for european competition commissioner neelie kroes , said : " we were informed by the german authorities of their intentions .
" the commission notes that the measures seem to be limited to retail bank deposits , and so less liable to give rise to distortions of competition . "
todd added , " in general , retail deposit guarantee schemes for savers can be an appropriate policy response to fears regarding the stability of the banking system . "
the crisis reached germany with the stumble by hre and the embarrassment which followed a 35-billion-euro bail-out a week ago which proved inadequate .
global insight senior economist timo klein told reporters : " since they were unable to correct themselves , financial markets looked to the german government -lrb- for help -rrb- .
the dax is now looking for a general plan for the banks , maybe as early as wednesday . "
brussels sees no problem with german plan bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the commission is keeping an eye on developments in brussels , the european commission said the german decision regarding private accounts appeared to conform to eu competition rules and did not pose the same problems as a similar announcement by ireland .
" the commission notes that the measures seem to be limited to retail bank deposits , so -lrb- it is -rrb- less liable to give rise to distortion of competition , " said commission spokesman todd .
in britain , prime minister gordon brown 's spokesman said london understood that berlin did not plan to pass legislation on the guarantees and added : " we have been in the process of seeking clarification from germany as to what they have committed themselves to . "
an initial guarantee issued by the irish government to banks has drawn criticism from several european union countries which feared it could distort competition by making irish bank accounts more attractive to eu savers .
hre management under fire bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the hre has tottered on the verge of collapse for days meanwhile , as germany sought to calm the public with a " decisive " pledge about savings , property lender hre was under further pressure from other banks and berlin to sack its chief executive .
german finance minister peer steinbrueck said it was " unthinkable " to keep dealing with the same hre top management .
he charged that hre , at the same time as seeking state aid , had used lawyers against the government so as to " escape its responsibilities . "
in monday trading , hre stock declined as much as 40 percent from friday 's close as investors worried that the new bail-out might also prove inadequate .

berlin hoped a new 50-billion-euro -lrb- $ 68-billion -rrb- rescue plan for the distressed mortgage lender hypo real estate -lrb- hre -rrb- , a munich-based company that lends to commercial developers and municipalities to build hotels , offices , roads , airports and the like , and a blanket guarantee on private bank accounts would prevent panic from seizing a nation of savers .
finance minister peer steinbrueck said he did not rule out raising state guarantees on hre credit lines and that there was " a plan b in the drawer " to ensure the banking sector did not collapse .
steinbrueck did not provide details but told a press conference : " we are aware that we will not get very far with case-by-case solutions . "
the bank is now to be provided with credit lines worth a total 50 billion euros , of which a little more than half was to be guaranteed by the state .
hre shares were hammered in afternoon trading on the frankfurt stock exchange however , losing 35.15 percent to 4.87 euros .
meanwhile , the government said it would guarantee private bank accounts , estimated to be worth 1.6 trillion euros .
economics professor hans-peter burghof of the university of hohenheim told german radio that amount represented " the biggest guarantee in history .
" never has anyone anywhere in the world guaranteed such a sum in two simple sentences , " he said , while noting that in principle the idea of giving guarantees was to ensure they would not be needed .
merkel pledges to protect financial system bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel tried to instill calm in investors and savers chancellor angela merkel told reporters on sunday that the government " will not allow an institution 's crisis to become a crisis for the entire system . "
" we are saying to women and men savers that their deposits are safe .
the federal government promises that , " merkel said .
questions about the german government assurance of an estimated 1 trillion euros -lrb- $ 1.4 trillion -rrb- of personal savings at german banks meanwhile were being raised on monday .
neighbouring nations came under pressure to follow germany 's lead .
berlin described the assurance to savers , issued by chancellor merkel in two sentences in front of television cameras on sunday , as " able to be relied on . "
berlin has not announced any legislation on a deposit-insurance scheme beyond existing bank-industry guarantees .
officials said they were still talking to banks on how to shape the guarantee .
merkel 's spokesman ulrich wilhelm said in berlin , " it 's a political statement that can be relied on and is decisive . "
the german government and its capabilities stood behind this assurance , he added .
jonathan todd , spokesman for european competition commissioner neelie kroes , said : " we were informed by the german authorities of their intentions .
" the commission notes that the measures seem to be limited to retail bank deposits , and so less liable to give rise to distortions of competition . "
todd added , " in general , retail deposit guarantee schemes for savers can be an appropriate policy response to fears regarding the stability of the banking system . "
the crisis reached germany with the stumble by hre and the embarrassment which followed a 35-billion-euro bail-out a week ago which proved inadequate .
global insight senior economist timo klein told reporters : " since they were unable to correct themselves , financial markets looked to the german government -lrb- for help -rrb- .
the dax is now looking for a general plan for the banks , maybe as early as wednesday . "
brussels sees no problem with german plan bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the commission is keeping an eye on developments in brussels , the european commission said the german decision regarding private accounts appeared to conform to eu competition rules and did not pose the same problems as a similar announcement by ireland .
" the commission notes that the measures seem to be limited to retail bank deposits , so -lrb- it is -rrb- less liable to give rise to distortion of competition , " said commission spokesman todd .
in britain , prime minister gordon brown 's spokesman said london understood that berlin did not plan to pass legislation on the guarantees and added : " we have been in the process of seeking clarification from germany as to what they have committed themselves to . "
an initial guarantee issued by the irish government to banks has drawn criticism from several european union countries which feared it could distort competition by making irish bank accounts more attractive to eu savers .
hre management under fire bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the hre has tottered on the verge of collapse for days meanwhile , as germany sought to calm the public with a " decisive " pledge about savings , property lender hre was under further pressure from other banks and berlin to sack its chief executive .
german finance minister peer steinbrueck said it was " unthinkable " to keep dealing with the same hre top management .
he charged that hre , at the same time as seeking state aid , had used lawyers against the government so as to " escape its responsibilities . "
in monday trading , hre stock declined as much as 40 percent from friday 's close as investors worried that the new bail-out might also prove inadequate .
in brussels , the eu commission 's todd , said , " as soon as the details are notified to us we will assess very quickly whether the new measures are compatible with -lrb- the eu 's -rrb- state aid rules . "
a newspaper , die welt , was to appear tuesday with a report that hre was blaming its plunge from grace on a downgrading by ratings agencies that allowed creditors to call up loans .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de finance -pipe- 06.10.2008 european leaders commit to tackling financial crisis großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : european leaders said they will take all necessary steps to protect euro zone banks european union leaders will take " all the necessary steps " to ensure the stability of the bloc 's financial system and protect citizens ' savings , an eu statement said monday , oct .
6 . such measures would include the injection of liquidity by european central banks , bail-outs for troubled banks and guarantees for deposits , the joint statement said .
noting that no european depositor had lost their savings so far , the eu leaders called for " coordination and close cooperation " in dealing with the effects of the global credit crunch .
the unprecedented statement came as european stock markets tumbled and as finance ministers from the 15 eu countries that share the euro were holding talks in luxembourg on ways to deal with the continent 's exploding financial crisis .
member states have hitherto reacted individually to events in their own countries , but the urgency of the crisis has sparked a rising chorus of calls for coordinated action .
" i think it 's extremely important that european countries use similar principles in how they treat banks in problems -lrb- sic -rrb- , for example , how they intervene , what time they intervene , what policy measures they are prepared to apply , " dutch finance minister wouter bos said ahead of the meeting in luxembourg .
europe works towards a common approach bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : almunia was confident of a eu coordinated action officials from the eu 's executive echoed that call , with eu economic and monetary affairs commissioner joaquin almunia saying : " we should have a common approach , coordinated action , to avoid unilateral decisions that create negative spillovers . "
but the decision by the german government on sunday to offer a blanket savings guarantee to private depositors has piled the pressure on other eu member states to follow suit .
austria , for instance , raised its guarantees on savings deposits late sunday , just hours after the german plan was announced .
sweden and denmark raised their guarantees on monday morning .
while insisting that austrian banks were sound , austrian finance minister wilhelm molterer said the government had taken the decision " to avoid a competitive disadvantage with germany , so that savings deposits do not flow off to germany . "
german plan up for discussion bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel 's government has pledged to protect investors german officials appeared under pressure to explain their actions after earlier criticizing an irish guarantee , with bos saying that the german plan " is one of the issues on the table here . "
but german deputy finance minister joerg asmussen stressed that " germany 's approach is fundamentally different from the irish one .
they set up a rescue shield which basically discriminates in the internal market , while germany 's approach is aimed at making sure that no depositor loses a single euro . "
about a third of the 15 eu countries that share the common currency have already moved to safeguard bank deposits in some way or other - among them germany , austria , greece , ireland and belgium .
but after a meeting of the leaders of the eu 's four biggest economies in paris on saturday , proposals for setting up an eu-wide rescue fund appeared to have been taken off the table .
" i do n't think there 's going to be anything near consensus about a european fund .
i hope there is going to be a consensus about a common approach , on principles that should be applied whenever we want to intervene or whenever we want to help banks in problems -lrb- sic -rrb- , " bos said . dpa news agency send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de finance -pipe- 06.10.2008 european leaders commit to tackling financial crisis großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : european leaders said they will take all necessary steps to protect euro zone banks european union leaders will take " all the necessary steps " to ensure the stability of the bloc 's financial system and protect citizens ' savings , an eu statement said monday , oct .
6 . such measures would include the injection of liquidity by european central banks , bail-outs for troubled banks and guarantees for deposits , the joint statement said .
noting that no european depositor had lost their savings so far , the eu leaders called for " coordination and close cooperation " in dealing with the effects of the global credit crunch .
the unprecedented statement came as european stock markets tumbled and as finance ministers from the 15 eu countries that share the euro were holding talks in luxembourg on ways to deal with the continent 's exploding financial crisis .
member states have hitherto reacted individually to events in their own countries , but the urgency of the crisis has sparked a rising chorus of calls for coordinated action .
" i think it 's extremely important that european countries use similar principles in how they treat banks in problems -lrb- sic -rrb- , for example , how they intervene , what time they intervene , what policy measures they are prepared to apply , " dutch finance minister wouter bos said ahead of the meeting in luxembourg .
europe works towards a common approach bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : almunia was confident of a eu coordinated action officials from the eu 's executive echoed that call , with eu economic and monetary affairs commissioner joaquin almunia saying : " we should have a common approach , coordinated action , to avoid unilateral decisions that create negative spillovers . "
but the decision by the german government on sunday to offer a blanket savings guarantee to private depositors has piled the pressure on other eu member states to follow suit .
austria , for instance , raised its guarantees on savings deposits late sunday , just hours after the german plan was announced .
sweden and denmark raised their guarantees on monday morning .
while insisting that austrian banks were sound , austrian finance minister wilhelm molterer said the government had taken the decision " to avoid a competitive disadvantage with germany , so that savings deposits do not flow off to germany . "
german plan up for discussion bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel 's government has pledged to protect investors german officials appeared under pressure to explain their actions after earlier criticizing an irish guarantee , with bos saying that the german plan " is one of the issues on the table here . "
but german deputy finance minister joerg asmussen stressed that " germany 's approach is fundamentally different from the irish one .
they set up a rescue shield which basically discriminates in the internal market , while germany 's approach is aimed at making sure that no depositor loses a single euro . "
about a third of the 15 eu countries that share the common currency have already moved to safeguard bank deposits in some way or other - among them germany , austria , greece , ireland and belgium .
but after a meeting of the leaders of the eu 's four biggest economies in paris on saturday , proposals for setting up an eu-wide rescue fund appeared to have been taken off the table .
" i do n't think there 's going to be anything near consensus about a european fund .
i hope there is going to be a consensus about a common approach , on principles that should be applied whenever we want to intervene or whenever we want to help banks in problems -lrb- sic -rrb- , " bos said . dpa news agency send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

6 , three days after a pkk attack on a border post killed 15 turkish soldiers . according to a statement released by the turkish general staff , the warplanes bombed pkk positions in the mountainous avasin region of northern iraq .
" the planes returned safely to base after successfully completing their mission , " the statement said .
turkish jets also attacked positions in the same area on sunday night .
the attack on friday night on the aktutun border post in the south-eastern province of hakkari that left 15 soldiers and 23 pkk separatists dead has shocked turkey and led to the general staff on sunday announcing that it was to relocate five military border posts .
a spokesman for the military said the administration of the kurdish autonomous area in iraq had not helped in the fight against the pkk , despite overtures by iraq 's kurdish president jalal talabani .
after the attack talabani called his turkish counterpart abdullah gul to propose a meeting of high-ranking security experts from both sides , suggesting iraqi willingness to help turkey de-escalate the situation .
the turkish air force has conducted a number of airstrikes against pkk targets in northern iraq since a week-long cross-border incursion into northern iraq was launched in february .
ankara blames the separatist group for the deaths of more than 35,000 people since the early 1980s when the pkk began its fight for independence or autonomy for the mainly kurdish-populated south-east of turkey .
turkish dead laid to rest as tensions heighten bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : angry crowds protested the deaths of turkish soldiers the 15 turkish soldiers killed in saturday 's attack on an iraq border post were borne to their graves on sunday by a crowd of thousands shouting angry slogans against the perpetrators - the outlawed kurdish workers party , or pkk .
the attack , which claimed 38 lives in total , was launched by the guerrilla group , which operates from inside iraq , after a week of turkish air force raids on their positions .
turkish government and military leaders have vowed to escalate the campaign against the pkk .
" we will now conduct our campaign against terrorism even more decisively , " said turkish prime minister recep tayyip erdogan , after he broke off his journey to central asia in response to the attack .
but turkey can not win the war against the pkk by military force alone .
one day before the aktutun border post attack , the worst pkk assault this year , the turkish air force had bombarded suspected pkk positions in the qandil mountains of iraq , close to the iranian border .

according to turkish media reports , more than 300 pkk fighters assembled for the raid on the border post .
at daybreak on saturday they opened fire with heavy weapons from iraq as other fighters moved in on the ground .
the battle at aktutun lasted for five hours .
it was the fifth attack on the post since 1992 .
turkey hit back with combat helicopters and special forces .
after the attack , iraqi president jalal talabani , himself a kurd , called his turkish counterpart abdullah gul to propose a meeting of high-ranking security experts from both sides , suggesting iraqi willingness to help turkey de-escalate the situation .
however , turkish daily millyet commented on sunday that " long- range weapons can not be brought into position without those responsible for security in iraq noticing . "
also under question is the value of us support in informing turkey of pkk movements within iraq .
the turkish parliament is due to vote monday on whether to allow the army to extend its mandate for operations in northern iraq for a further year .
the approval of the mandate was not in doubt even before saturday 's attack , as evidently turkey 's operations in northern iraq had not brought the pkk to its knees .
in february , turkey launched a ground offensive in iraq , although us criticism brought it to a rapid end .
us defense secretary robert gates has suggested the military struggle against the pkk be conducted together with economic and political means .

a spokesman for the military said the administration of the kurdish autonomous area in iraq had not helped in the fight against the pkk , despite overtures by iraq 's kurdish president jalal talabani .
after the attack talabani called his turkish counterpart abdullah gul to propose a meeting of high-ranking security experts from both sides , suggesting iraqi willingness to help turkey de-escalate the situation .
the turkish air force has conducted a number of airstrikes against pkk targets in northern iraq since a week-long cross-border incursion into northern iraq was launched in february .
ankara blames the separatist group for the deaths of more than 35,000 people since the early 1980s when the pkk began its fight for independence or autonomy for the mainly kurdish-populated south-east of turkey .

the attack , which claimed 38 lives in total , was launched by the guerrilla group , which operates from inside iraq , after a week of turkish air force raids on their positions .
turkish government and military leaders have vowed to escalate the campaign against the pkk .
" we will now conduct our campaign against terrorism even more decisively , " said turkish prime minister recep tayyip erdogan , after he broke off his journey to central asia in response to the attack .
but turkey can not win the war against the pkk by military force alone .

that package had a price tag of 35 billion euros . the german finance ministry said in a statement that the new deal will see the financial sector topping up that sum with an additional 15 billion euros .
" with this mutually agreed solution , the institution -lrb- hypo real estate -rrb- will be stabilized and with it , germany strengthened as a place to conduct finance in difficult times , " the statement said . on monday , german finance minister peer steinbrueck said he would not rule out increasing the government 's gurantee for hypo real estate -lrb- hre -rrb- which is worth almost 27 billion euros .
hre on monday hailed the bailout , saying it would allow the company to keep functioning amidst the ongoing financial crisis .
" we are very thankful for the backing of all those involved , " hre boss georg funke said in a statement .
" the solution guarantees the stability of the hypo real estate group , which will have enough liqudity and will be able to continue functioning even as the financial crisis continues , " funke added .
government keen to avoid knock-on effect , panic bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the government is unhappy about what it sees as poor management decisions speaking to reporters before the deal was announced , merkel said the government was " pulling out all the stops " to save hypo real estate -lrb- hre -rrb- . " the government says today that we will not allow an institution 's crisis to become a crisis for the entire system , " merkel said . merkel 's government had scrambled to reach a deal before asian markets opened monday , fearing the company would not last long for more than a few days without a rescue package .
the chancellor also warned that managers at financial institutions should be held accountable for what she termed irresponsible behavior .
" we owe that to the taxpayers in germany , " she said .
in a further move to shore up the german banking system , the government issued a guarantee for all savings in german banks . in a bid to stave off panic withdrawals , finance minister peer steinbrueck assured that german bank account holders need not worry about losing a " single euro " in the crisis .
" that is an important message intended to create calm and not reactions that would be disproportional and make the current crisis management and crisis prevention even more difficult , " steinbrueck said .
finance ministry spokesman torsten albig told business daily handelsblatt that the estimated value of the guaranteed accounts would total 568 billion euros .
hre management under fire bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german banks have been feeling the fallout of troubles on wall street hypo real estate , germany 's second largest commercial property lender is the first german blue-chip company to seek a government bailout . hre , which mainly lends to commercial projects and to build public facilities such as airports and roads , is the biggest german casualty of the crisis that has spread from new york in the last month . steinbrueck had earlier said he was " outraged " at the management of the hre group because a " further liquidity gap in billions -lrb- of euros -rrb- " had materialized . " the german government refuses to be forced into any co-responsibility by this banking institute , " he said . hre ran into trouble mid-september after a credit freeze following the collapse of us investment bank lehman brothers .

smaller teams are now losing their respect for the champions , who are only 11th in the table after two wins in seven matches , beckenbauer wrote in his column for bild newspaper on monday .
" the mythos that in the end bayern -lrb- almost -rrb- always win has taken a break ... the league senses that we are vulnerable , " he said .
team needs to work it out bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : another one of those days bayern followed up two successive league defeats by with a 3-3 draw at home saturday by bochum who scored two late goals to earn a point .
there were jeers from bayern fans .
coach juergen klinsmann said the performance was unacceptable .
beckenbauer said the team gave bochum far too much room to play .
he also hoped goalkeeper michael rensing would soon radiate the same assurance between the posts as the now retired oliver kahn .
" bayern will only be able to recapture the mythos with hard work , " he said .
can they shape up ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : klinsmann still has the dressing room on side " i keep my fingers crossed for juergen klinsmann .
it may be the case that he upset many fans with radical changes .
the criticism from the stands and the media is something he will have to tolerate . "
however beckenbauer said the bayern board would need to be remain calm , and that the relationship between klinsmann and the team was " intact . "
" that was not for example the case in the end with felix magath -lrb- dismissed in early 2007 before ottmar hitzfeld took charge -rrb- .
with klinsmann i see no rift .
he needs time for his ideas to take effect .
" we have to have patience and analyze in the winter break what needs to be done . "
coach sees reasons for optimism bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : do they need to play harder ?
klinsmann said sunday he was determined to correct the mistakes and get bayern moving back up the league table .
" we understand the fans ' dismay and disappointment .
they have every right to voice it , " he told the bayern munich internet television channel fcb.tv.
" seven games into the bundesliga season , what bayern have achieved is not acceptable , and i wo n't accept it either . "

that package had a price tag of 35 billion euros . the german finance ministry said in a statement that the new deal will see the financial sector topping up that sum with an additional 15 billion euros .
" with this mutually agreed solution , the institution -lrb- hypo real estate -rrb- will be stabilized and with it , germany strengthened as a place to conduct finance in difficult times , " the statement said . on monday , german finance minister peer steinbrueck said he would not rule out increasing the government 's gurantee for hypo real estate -lrb- hre -rrb- which is worth almost 27 billion euros .
hre on monday hailed the bailout , saying it would allow the company to keep functioning amidst the ongoing financial crisis .
" we are very thankful for the backing of all those involved , " hre boss georg funke said in a statement .
" the solution guarantees the stability of the hypo real estate group , which will have enough liqudity and will be able to continue functioning even as the financial crisis continues , " funke added .
government keen to avoid knock-on effect , panic bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the government is unhappy about what it sees as poor management decisions speaking to reporters before the deal was announced , merkel said the government was " pulling out all the stops " to save hypo real estate -lrb- hre -rrb- . " the government says today that we will not allow an institution 's crisis to become a crisis for the entire system , " merkel said . merkel 's government had scrambled to reach a deal before asian markets opened monday , fearing the company would not last long for more than a few days without a rescue package .
the chancellor also warned that managers at financial institutions should be held accountable for what she termed irresponsible behavior .
" we owe that to the taxpayers in germany , " she said .
in a further move to shore up the german banking system , the government issued a guarantee for all savings in german banks . in a bid to stave off panic withdrawals , finance minister peer steinbrueck assured that german bank account holders need not worry about losing a " single euro " in the crisis .
" that is an important message intended to create calm and not reactions that would be disproportional and make the current crisis management and crisis prevention even more difficult , " steinbrueck said .
finance ministry spokesman torsten albig told business daily handelsblatt that the estimated value of the guaranteed accounts would total 568 billion euros .
hre management under fire bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german banks have been feeling the fallout of troubles on wall street hypo real estate , germany 's second largest commercial property lender is the first german blue-chip company to seek a government bailout . hre , which mainly lends to commercial projects and to build public facilities such as airports and roads , is the biggest german casualty of the crisis that has spread from new york in the last month . steinbrueck had earlier said he was " outraged " at the management of the hre group because a " further liquidity gap in billions -lrb- of euros -rrb- " had materialized . " the german government refuses to be forced into any co-responsibility by this banking institute , " he said . hre ran into trouble mid-september after a credit freeze following the collapse of us investment bank lehman brothers .

that package had a price tag of 35 billion euros . the german finance ministry said in a statement that the new deal will see the financial sector topping up that sum with an additional 15 billion euros .
" with this mutually agreed solution , the institution -lrb- hypo real estate -rrb- will be stabilized and with it , germany strengthened as a place to conduct finance in difficult times , " the statement said . on monday , german finance minister peer steinbrueck said he would not rule out increasing the government 's gurantee for hypo real estate -lrb- hre -rrb- which is worth almost 27 billion euros .
hre on monday hailed the bailout , saying it would allow the company to keep functioning amidst the ongoing financial crisis .
" we are very thankful for the backing of all those involved , " hre boss georg funke said in a statement .
" the solution guarantees the stability of the hypo real estate group , which will have enough liqudity and will be able to continue functioning even as the financial crisis continues , " funke added .

" the government says today that we will not allow an institution 's crisis to become a crisis for the entire system , " merkel said . merkel 's government had scrambled to reach a deal before asian markets opened monday , fearing the company would not last long for more than a few days without a rescue package .
the chancellor also warned that managers at financial institutions should be held accountable for what she termed irresponsible behavior .
" we owe that to the taxpayers in germany , " she said .
in a further move to shore up the german banking system , the government issued a guarantee for all savings in german banks . in a bid to stave off panic withdrawals , finance minister peer steinbrueck assured that german bank account holders need not worry about losing a " single euro " in the crisis .
" that is an important message intended to create calm and not reactions that would be disproportional and make the current crisis management and crisis prevention even more difficult , " steinbrueck said .
finance ministry spokesman torsten albig told business daily handelsblatt that the estimated value of the guaranteed accounts would total 568 billion euros .
hre management under fire bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german banks have been feeling the fallout of troubles on wall street hypo real estate , germany 's second largest commercial property lender is the first german blue-chip company to seek a government bailout . hre , which mainly lends to commercial projects and to build public facilities such as airports and roads , is the biggest german casualty of the crisis that has spread from new york in the last month . steinbrueck had earlier said he was " outraged " at the management of the hre group because a " further liquidity gap in billions -lrb- of euros -rrb- " had materialized . " the german government refuses to be forced into any co-responsibility by this banking institute , " he said . hre ran into trouble mid-september after a credit freeze following the collapse of us investment bank lehman brothers .

that package had a price tag of 35 billion euros . the german finance ministry said in a statement that the new deal will see the financial sector topping up that sum with an additional 15 billion euros .

yet investors remained skittish about europe 's financial future . calls for a common european approach to the banking crisis continued on monday as both the european and asian stock markets were down sharply in early trading .
up until this weekend , germany had stoically opposed issuing a blanket guarantee on all bank deposits despite other countries moving to do so .
yet with confidence deeply shaken after a first bailout for hypo real estate fell through , the german government abruptly changed course on sunday .
in an attempt to prevent a run on banks , germany announced it will guarantee all personal bank deposits in the country .
“ we tell all savings account holders that your deposits are safe .
the federal government assures it , ” german chancellor angela merkel said after an emergency government meeting in a bid to prevent a panic run on banks .

besides the german rescue of hypo , there were more signs over the weekend that european governments were scrambling to rescue struggling banks .
french bank bnp paribas agreed on sunday to take control of ailing finance group fortis 's operations in belgium and luxembourg through a share issue , saying the operation valued the company at 14.7 billion euros .
the belgian and luxembourg governments had partially nationalized the bank a week ago , but after the dutch government took over full control of fortis ' operations in the netherlands , they began looking for a suitor .

yet investors remained skittish about europe 's financial future . calls for a common european approach to the banking crisis continued on monday as both the european and asian stock markets were down sharply in early trading .
up until this weekend , germany had stoically opposed issuing a blanket guarantee on all bank deposits despite other countries moving to do so .
yet with confidence deeply shaken after a first bailout for hypo real estate fell through , the german government abruptly changed course on sunday .
in an attempt to prevent a run on banks , germany announced it will guarantee all personal bank deposits in the country .
“ we tell all savings account holders that your deposits are safe .
the federal government assures it , ” german chancellor angela merkel said after an emergency government meeting in a bid to prevent a panic run on banks .
now britain is reportedly under pressure to change its stance .
britain had criticized recent decisions by ireland and greece to guarantee savings accounts , worrying that the moves could shift money away from british banks .
germany leads , others follow bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : fortis is getting help from a french bank british finance minister alistair darling is expected to address the issue in a speech to lawmakers on monday .
britain has already promised to increase the level of private savings guaranteed by the government to 50,000 pounds -lrb- $ 88,000 -rrb- per person .
the government has hesitated to go any higher than that due to the potential costs involved .
darling is reportedly considering using public funds to take stakes in banks .
the plan is a middle course between nationalizing banks and handing out further loans .
" germany is europe 's economic superpower , " said nick clegg , leader of the liberal democrats , britain 's third-largest party .
" where it leads , others are bound to follow . ”
clegg said a common european approach to deposit guarantees is necessary .
denmark on sunday announced the country 's banks had agreed to contribute 35 billion kronor -lrb- 4.8 billion euros -rrb- to help ailing banks and guarantee deposits .
italy wanted an even more united response , calling for an overarching european bailout plan .
investors remain skittish bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : eu leaders are grappling with how to best handle the banking crisis investors seemed spooked at signs of escalating problems in europe 's banking sector .
frankfurt 's stock market fell sharply on monday , with stocks down 3.29 percent at the opening .
asian stocks also dropped , with tokyo at a four-year low .
frankfurt 's blue chip dax slumped 4.54 per cent to 5,533.57 , its lowest level since july 2006 .
besides the german rescue of hypo , there were more signs over the weekend that european governments were scrambling to rescue struggling banks .
french bank bnp paribas agreed on sunday to take control of ailing finance group fortis 's operations in belgium and luxembourg through a share issue , saying the operation valued the company at 14.7 billion euros .
the belgian and luxembourg governments had partially nationalized the bank a week ago , but after the dutch government took over full control of fortis ' operations in the netherlands , they began looking for a suitor .
on saturday , leaders of britain , france , germany and italy said they would protect fragile banks , but would not copy the blanket $ 700 billion bailout agreed in the us last week .
eu finance ministers will try to put together plans on monday and tuesday for restoring confidence in the banking system .
germany looks to restore confidence germany had previously guaranteed 20,000 euros -lrb- $ 28,400 -rrb- savings per person .
finance ministry spokesman torsten albig told the business daily handelsblatt that the estimated value of the guaranteed all accounts would total 568 billion euros .
handelsblatt said the state was the only " fire brigade " that could come to the rescue in the face of a crisis of this size .
" this means the government and the banks will have to bite the bullet , " it said .
" this is an important signal intended to bring a calming , instead of reactions that are disproportionate and make crisis resolution and crisis prevention more difficult , " finance minister peer steinbrueck said . dw staff -lrb- th -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?
dw-world.de germany rescues hypo real estate the german government , together with banks and insurance companies , agreed late sunday on a new 50-billion-euro -lrb- $ 68 billion -rrb- deal to bail out the country 's stricken commercial property lender , hypo real estate .

meanwhile , berlin called for a solution after the collapse of hypo real estate 's bailout .

" the government 's plans are not grand strategy that we need to protect consumers , " social democrat sebastian edathy told the daily neue osdnabruecker zeitung on monday . companies that know their customers ' private information has been stolen or lost should be legally required to inform the public on the scope of the abuse , edathy added .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de finance -pipe- 06.10.2008 german government under pressure to deliver on crisis promise großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : doom and gloom : germany has not escaped the financial storm sweeping in from the us the german government is under pressure to deliver as it races to reassure investors and individual savers that it will protect europe 's biggest economy from falling victim to the global financial crisis . the stock exchange may not have got the message however as shares tumbled seven percent monday in line with heavy losses elsewhere in europe and asia as wall street plunged too .
berlin hoped a new 50-billion-euro -lrb- $ 68-billion -rrb- rescue plan for the distressed mortgage lender hypo real estate -lrb- hre -rrb- , a munich-based company that lends to commercial developers and municipalities to build hotels , offices , roads , airports and the like , and a blanket guarantee on private bank accounts would prevent panic from seizing a nation of savers .
finance minister peer steinbrueck said he did not rule out raising state guarantees on hre credit lines and that there was " a plan b in the drawer " to ensure the banking sector did not collapse .
steinbrueck did not provide details but told a press conference : " we are aware that we will not get very far with case-by-case solutions . "
the bank is now to be provided with credit lines worth a total 50 billion euros , of which a little more than half was to be guaranteed by the state .
hre shares were hammered in afternoon trading on the frankfurt stock exchange however , losing 35.15 percent to 4.87 euros .
meanwhile , the government said it would guarantee private bank accounts , estimated to be worth 1.6 trillion euros .
economics professor hans-peter burghof of the university of hohenheim told german radio that amount represented " the biggest guarantee in history .
" never has anyone anywhere in the world guaranteed such a sum in two simple sentences , " he said , while noting that in principle the idea of giving guarantees was to ensure they would not be needed .
merkel pledges to protect financial system bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel tried to instill calm in investors and savers chancellor angela merkel told reporters on sunday that the government " will not allow an institution 's crisis to become a crisis for the entire system . "
" we are saying to women and men savers that their deposits are safe .
the federal government promises that , " merkel said .
questions about the german government assurance of an estimated 1 trillion euros -lrb- $ 1.4 trillion -rrb- of personal savings at german banks meanwhile were being raised on monday .
neighbouring nations came under pressure to follow germany 's lead .
berlin described the assurance to savers , issued by chancellor merkel in two sentences in front of television cameras on sunday , as " able to be relied on . "
berlin has not announced any legislation on a deposit-insurance scheme beyond existing bank-industry guarantees .
officials said they were still talking to banks on how to shape the guarantee .
merkel 's spokesman ulrich wilhelm said in berlin , " it 's a political statement that can be relied on and is decisive . "
the german government and its capabilities stood behind this assurance , he added .
jonathan todd , spokesman for european competition commissioner neelie kroes , said : " we were informed by the german authorities of their intentions .
" the commission notes that the measures seem to be limited to retail bank deposits , and so less liable to give rise to distortions of competition . "
todd added , " in general , retail deposit guarantee schemes for savers can be an appropriate policy response to fears regarding the stability of the banking system . "
the crisis reached germany with the stumble by hre and the embarrassment which followed a 35-billion-euro bail-out a week ago which proved inadequate .
global insight senior economist timo klein told reporters : " since they were unable to correct themselves , financial markets looked to the german government -lrb- for help -rrb- .
the dax is now looking for a general plan for the banks , maybe as early as wednesday . "
brussels sees no problem with german plan bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the commission is keeping an eye on developments in brussels , the european commission said the german decision regarding private accounts appeared to conform to eu competition rules and did not pose the same problems as a similar announcement by ireland .
" the commission notes that the measures seem to be limited to retail bank deposits , so -lrb- it is -rrb- less liable to give rise to distortion of competition , " said commission spokesman todd .
in britain , prime minister gordon brown 's spokesman said london understood that berlin did not plan to pass legislation on the guarantees and added : " we have been in the process of seeking clarification from germany as to what they have committed themselves to . "
an initial guarantee issued by the irish government to banks has drawn criticism from several european union countries which feared it could distort competition by making irish bank accounts more attractive to eu savers .
hre management under fire bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the hre has tottered on the verge of collapse for days meanwhile , as germany sought to calm the public with a " decisive " pledge about savings , property lender hre was under further pressure from other banks and berlin to sack its chief executive .
german finance minister peer steinbrueck said it was " unthinkable " to keep dealing with the same hre top management .
he charged that hre , at the same time as seeking state aid , had used lawyers against the government so as to " escape its responsibilities . "
in monday trading , hre stock declined as much as 40 percent from friday 's close as investors worried that the new bail-out might also prove inadequate .
in brussels , the eu commission 's todd , said , " as soon as the details are notified to us we will assess very quickly whether the new measures are compatible with -lrb- the eu 's -rrb- state aid rules . "
a newspaper , die welt , was to appear tuesday with a report that hre was blaming its plunge from grace on a downgrading by ratings agencies that allowed creditors to call up loans .
berlin has refused demands by the banking industry to nationalize hre , a lender seen in germany as too important to let fail .
steinbrueck said financial securities that have been disdained in the past by central banks would be used as security for much of the 15-billion-euro expansion of the hre bail-out .
the european central bank -lrb- ecb -rrb- had agreed to this , he said .
" nobody can forecast just yet how much this paper is actually worth , " he added .
the government and banking-industry guarantee that backstops the new bail-out remains limited to 35 billion euros , as announced one week ago . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

that 's the message german politicians gave private depositors .
the government guaranteed savings in german accounts .
according to the finance ministry , the federal government is vouching for " more than 1 trillion euros . "
but even such a guarantee would n't be worth a cent if everyone ran to the bank for their money - not even the government could pay such a huge sum of money .
the core of the guarantee serves a psychological purpose : despite all the talk about the financial crisis ' dimensions , citizens should n't get any more worried than they already are .
by giving a guarantee , the state is hoping to avoid a situation where it would have to pay anything back .
but there 's a different problem : no german bank has yet faced difficulties in this crisis due to private customers wanting their money back .
even at britain 's northern rock , customers did n't start demanding their money back until the bank was already deep in the crisis .
there are two reasons for the difficulties banks are facing .
either they have too many financial products based on junk us mortgages that needed to be written off on their books or they have n't been successful in receiving short-term capital from money markets to keep up with running commitments because skeptical banks are hardly lending to each other .
the state 's guarantee for private savings does not solve either of these problems .
it is a preventative relaxant for the possibility that additional institutions take a tumble .
to deal with the actual problem , politicians are now talking about a " national protective umbrella . "
there is a possibility that individual governments will put together bail-out packages which , like the united states , buy rotten debts from banks .
politicians in at an emergency summit in paris could n't agree non a billion-euro package for a european solution , and by the end of the meeting the leaders denied even having the idea of creating one .
they did , however , agree to coordinate their actions better in the future , though it will still be up to each country to decide on the best way to protect its banks .
but the example of state guarantees for private deposits shows that there wo n't be any national answers to this financial crisis .
chancellor angela merkel criticized the irish government for guaranteeing private deposits , and then , a few days later , does the same thing .
the more countries offer such guarantees , the greater the pressure will be on the remaining governments to do the same . otherwise their banks will risk losing customers - and capital - to other european countries .
the end result will be a european solution - even if it 's not one member states agreed to after a set of negotiations .
officially , financial policy is left up to national governments , but the reality has long been a different story .
the same is true for " national protective umbrellas " and other safeguards .
when a country buys its banks bad debts in a big way , other countries are forced to act in the same way .
as europe 's biggest economy , germany has a special role in this regard .

6 , three days after a pkk attack on a border post killed 15 turkish soldiers . according to a statement released by the turkish general staff , the warplanes bombed pkk positions in the mountainous avasin region of northern iraq .
" the planes returned safely to base after successfully completing their mission , " the statement said .
turkish jets also attacked positions in the same area on sunday night .
the attack on friday night on the aktutun border post in the south-eastern province of hakkari that left 15 soldiers and 23 pkk separatists dead has shocked turkey and led to the general staff on sunday announcing that it was to relocate five military border posts .
a spokesman for the military said the administration of the kurdish autonomous area in iraq had not helped in the fight against the pkk , despite overtures by iraq 's kurdish president jalal talabani .
after the attack talabani called his turkish counterpart abdullah gul to propose a meeting of high-ranking security experts from both sides , suggesting iraqi willingness to help turkey de-escalate the situation .
the turkish air force has conducted a number of airstrikes against pkk targets in northern iraq since a week-long cross-border incursion into northern iraq was launched in february .
ankara blames the separatist group for the deaths of more than 35,000 people since the early 1980s when the pkk began its fight for independence or autonomy for the mainly kurdish-populated south-east of turkey .
turkish dead laid to rest as tensions heighten bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : angry crowds protested the deaths of turkish soldiers the 15 turkish soldiers killed in saturday 's attack on an iraq border post were borne to their graves on sunday by a crowd of thousands shouting angry slogans against the perpetrators - the outlawed kurdish workers party , or pkk .
the attack , which claimed 38 lives in total , was launched by the guerrilla group , which operates from inside iraq , after a week of turkish air force raids on their positions .
turkish government and military leaders have vowed to escalate the campaign against the pkk .
" we will now conduct our campaign against terrorism even more decisively , " said turkish prime minister recep tayyip erdogan , after he broke off his journey to central asia in response to the attack .
but turkey can not win the war against the pkk by military force alone .

according to turkish media reports , more than 300 pkk fighters assembled for the raid on the border post .
at daybreak on saturday they opened fire with heavy weapons from iraq as other fighters moved in on the ground .
the battle at aktutun lasted for five hours .
it was the fifth attack on the post since 1992 .
turkey hit back with combat helicopters and special forces .
after the attack , iraqi president jalal talabani , himself a kurd , called his turkish counterpart abdullah gul to propose a meeting of high-ranking security experts from both sides , suggesting iraqi willingness to help turkey de-escalate the situation .
however , turkish daily millyet commented on sunday that " long- range weapons can not be brought into position without those responsible for security in iraq noticing . "
also under question is the value of us support in informing turkey of pkk movements within iraq .
the turkish parliament is due to vote monday on whether to allow the army to extend its mandate for operations in northern iraq for a further year .
the approval of the mandate was not in doubt even before saturday 's attack , as evidently turkey 's operations in northern iraq had not brought the pkk to its knees .
in february , turkey launched a ground offensive in iraq , although us criticism brought it to a rapid end .

smaller teams are now losing their respect for the champions , who are only 11th in the table after two wins in seven matches , beckenbauer wrote in his column for bild newspaper on monday .
" the mythos that in the end bayern -lrb- almost -rrb- always win has taken a break ... the league senses that we are vulnerable , " he said .
team needs to work it out bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : another one of those days bayern followed up two successive league defeats by with a 3-3 draw at home saturday by bochum who scored two late goals to earn a point .
there were jeers from bayern fans .
coach juergen klinsmann said the performance was unacceptable .
beckenbauer said the team gave bochum far too much room to play .
he also hoped goalkeeper michael rensing would soon radiate the same assurance between the posts as the now retired oliver kahn .
" bayern will only be able to recapture the mythos with hard work , " he said .
can they shape up ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : klinsmann still has the dressing room on side " i keep my fingers crossed for juergen klinsmann .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de opinion -pipe- 06.10.2008 opinion : national safeguards wo n't solve financial crisis großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the german government 's decision to guarantee private deposits is nothing more than a psychological gesture intended to calm markets and investors , writes dw 's andreas becker . do n't worry , you 're money is perfectly safe .
that 's the message german politicians gave private depositors .
the government guaranteed savings in german accounts .
according to the finance ministry , the federal government is vouching for " more than 1 trillion euros . "
but even such a guarantee would n't be worth a cent if everyone ran to the bank for their money - not even the government could pay such a huge sum of money .
the core of the guarantee serves a psychological purpose : despite all the talk about the financial crisis ' dimensions , citizens should n't get any more worried than they already are .
by giving a guarantee , the state is hoping to avoid a situation where it would have to pay anything back .
but there 's a different problem : no german bank has yet faced difficulties in this crisis due to private customers wanting their money back .
even at britain 's northern rock , customers did n't start demanding their money back until the bank was already deep in the crisis .
there are two reasons for the difficulties banks are facing .
either they have too many financial products based on junk us mortgages that needed to be written off on their books or they have n't been successful in receiving short-term capital from money markets to keep up with running commitments because skeptical banks are hardly lending to each other .
the state 's guarantee for private savings does not solve either of these problems .
it is a preventative relaxant for the possibility that additional institutions take a tumble .
to deal with the actual problem , politicians are now talking about a " national protective umbrella . "
there is a possibility that individual governments will put together bail-out packages which , like the united states , buy rotten debts from banks .
politicians in at an emergency summit in paris could n't agree non a billion-euro package for a european solution , and by the end of the meeting the leaders denied even having the idea of creating one .
they did , however , agree to coordinate their actions better in the future , though it will still be up to each country to decide on the best way to protect its banks .
but the example of state guarantees for private deposits shows that there wo n't be any national answers to this financial crisis .
chancellor angela merkel criticized the irish government for guaranteeing private deposits , and then , a few days later , does the same thing .
the more countries offer such guarantees , the greater the pressure will be on the remaining governments to do the same . otherwise their banks will risk losing customers - and capital - to other european countries .
the end result will be a european solution - even if it 's not one member states agreed to after a set of negotiations .
officially , financial policy is left up to national governments , but the reality has long been a different story .
the same is true for " national protective umbrellas " and other safeguards .
when a country buys its banks bad debts in a big way , other countries are forced to act in the same way .
as europe 's biggest economy , germany has a special role in this regard .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de finance -pipe- 06.10.2008 german government under pressure to deliver on crisis promise großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : doom and gloom : germany has not escaped the financial storm sweeping in from the us the german government is under pressure to deliver as it races to reassure investors and individual savers that it will protect europe 's biggest economy from falling victim to the global financial crisis . the stock exchange may not have got the message however as shares tumbled seven percent monday in line with heavy losses elsewhere in europe and asia as wall street plunged too .
berlin hoped a new 50-billion-euro -lrb- $ 68-billion -rrb- rescue plan for the distressed mortgage lender hypo real estate -lrb- hre -rrb- , a munich-based company that lends to commercial developers and municipalities to build hotels , offices , roads , airports and the like , and a blanket guarantee on private bank accounts would prevent panic from seizing a nation of savers .
finance minister peer steinbrueck said he did not rule out raising state guarantees on hre credit lines and that there was " a plan b in the drawer " to ensure the banking sector did not collapse .
steinbrueck did not provide details but told a press conference : " we are aware that we will not get very far with case-by-case solutions . "
the bank is now to be provided with credit lines worth a total 50 billion euros , of which a little more than half was to be guaranteed by the state .
hre shares were hammered in afternoon trading on the frankfurt stock exchange however , losing 35.15 percent to 4.87 euros .
meanwhile , the government said it would guarantee private bank accounts , estimated to be worth 1.6 trillion euros .
economics professor hans-peter burghof of the university of hohenheim told german radio that amount represented " the biggest guarantee in history .
" never has anyone anywhere in the world guaranteed such a sum in two simple sentences , " he said , while noting that in principle the idea of giving guarantees was to ensure they would not be needed .
merkel pledges to protect financial system bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel tried to instill calm in investors and savers chancellor angela merkel told reporters on sunday that the government " will not allow an institution 's crisis to become a crisis for the entire system . "
" we are saying to women and men savers that their deposits are safe .
the federal government promises that , " merkel said .
questions about the german government assurance of an estimated 1 trillion euros -lrb- $ 1.4 trillion -rrb- of personal savings at german banks meanwhile were being raised on monday .
neighbouring nations came under pressure to follow germany 's lead .
berlin described the assurance to savers , issued by chancellor merkel in two sentences in front of television cameras on sunday , as " able to be relied on . "
berlin has not announced any legislation on a deposit-insurance scheme beyond existing bank-industry guarantees .
officials said they were still talking to banks on how to shape the guarantee .
merkel 's spokesman ulrich wilhelm said in berlin , " it 's a political statement that can be relied on and is decisive . "

todd added , " in general , retail deposit guarantee schemes for savers can be an appropriate policy response to fears regarding the stability of the banking system . "
the crisis reached germany with the stumble by hre and the embarrassment which followed a 35-billion-euro bail-out a week ago which proved inadequate .

in britain , prime minister gordon brown 's spokesman said london understood that berlin did not plan to pass legislation on the guarantees and added : " we have been in the process of seeking clarification from germany as to what they have committed themselves to . "
an initial guarantee issued by the irish government to banks has drawn criticism from several european union countries which feared it could distort competition by making irish bank accounts more attractive to eu savers .

in brussels , the eu commission 's todd , said , " as soon as the details are notified to us we will assess very quickly whether the new measures are compatible with -lrb- the eu 's -rrb- state aid rules . "

berlin hoped a new 50-billion-euro -lrb- $ 68-billion -rrb- rescue plan for the distressed mortgage lender hypo real estate -lrb- hre -rrb- , a munich-based company that lends to commercial developers and municipalities to build hotels , offices , roads , airports and the like , and a blanket guarantee on private bank accounts would prevent panic from seizing a nation of savers .
finance minister peer steinbrueck said he did not rule out raising state guarantees on hre credit lines and that there was " a plan b in the drawer " to ensure the banking sector did not collapse .
steinbrueck did not provide details but told a press conference : " we are aware that we will not get very far with case-by-case solutions . "
the bank is now to be provided with credit lines worth a total 50 billion euros , of which a little more than half was to be guaranteed by the state .
hre shares were hammered in afternoon trading on the frankfurt stock exchange however , losing 35.15 percent to 4.87 euros .
meanwhile , the government said it would guarantee private bank accounts , estimated to be worth 1.6 trillion euros .
economics professor hans-peter burghof of the university of hohenheim told german radio that amount represented " the biggest guarantee in history .
" never has anyone anywhere in the world guaranteed such a sum in two simple sentences , " he said , while noting that in principle the idea of giving guarantees was to ensure they would not be needed .
merkel pledges to protect financial system bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel tried to instill calm in investors and savers chancellor angela merkel told reporters on sunday that the government " will not allow an institution 's crisis to become a crisis for the entire system . "
" we are saying to women and men savers that their deposits are safe .
the federal government promises that , " merkel said .
questions about the german government assurance of an estimated 1 trillion euros -lrb- $ 1.4 trillion -rrb- of personal savings at german banks meanwhile were being raised on monday .
neighbouring nations came under pressure to follow germany 's lead .
berlin described the assurance to savers , issued by chancellor merkel in two sentences in front of television cameras on sunday , as " able to be relied on . "
berlin has not announced any legislation on a deposit-insurance scheme beyond existing bank-industry guarantees .
officials said they were still talking to banks on how to shape the guarantee .
merkel 's spokesman ulrich wilhelm said in berlin , " it 's a political statement that can be relied on and is decisive . "
the german government and its capabilities stood behind this assurance , he added .
jonathan todd , spokesman for european competition commissioner neelie kroes , said : " we were informed by the german authorities of their intentions .
" the commission notes that the measures seem to be limited to retail bank deposits , and so less liable to give rise to distortions of competition . "

" in any case , he is no longer acceptable . " obermann apologized to customers in an interview on sunday and said the company had terminated two employees ' contracts over the matter .

5 , that it held on to information related to mobile phone calls made by some supervisory board members , german business daily handelsblatt reported . telekom offers to pay private telephone and internet costs for its supervisory board members as well as those of it subsidiaries .
because some board members had requested detailed connection data including the numbers dialed , when a call was placed as well as call duration , that information was filed with other paid bills in the supervisory board 's office , telekom said .

" the government 's plans are not grand strategy that we need to protect consumers , " social democrat sebastian edathy told the daily neue osdnabruecker zeitung on monday . companies that know their customers ' private information has been stolen or lost should be legally required to inform the public on the scope of the abuse , edathy added . " customers have to be informed immediately when their information lands in the wrong hands , " said christian democrat wolfgang brosbach .
" this is a company responsibility that we should put into law . " the german association of criminal investigators -lrb- bdk -rrb- called for the resignation of telekom head rene obermann . " either he did not know that 17 million mobile phone numbers were stolen from his company or he consciously remained silent about what he knew , " bdk head klaus jansen told the neue osdnabruecker zeitung .
" in any case , he is no longer acceptable . " obermann apologized to customers in an interview on sunday and said the company had terminated two employees ' contracts over the matter .
he added that authorities had begun an investigation into how details on nearly half of deutsche telekom 's mobile phone customers were stolen . dw staff -lrb- sms -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de finance -pipe- 06.10.2008 european leaders commit to tackling financial crisis großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : european leaders said they will take all necessary steps to protect euro zone banks european union leaders will take " all the necessary steps " to ensure the stability of the bloc 's financial system and protect citizens ' savings , an eu statement said monday , oct .
6 . such measures would include the injection of liquidity by european central banks , bail-outs for troubled banks and guarantees for deposits , the joint statement said .
noting that no european depositor had lost their savings so far , the eu leaders called for " coordination and close cooperation " in dealing with the effects of the global credit crunch .
the unprecedented statement came as european stock markets tumbled and as finance ministers from the 15 eu countries that share the euro were holding talks in luxembourg on ways to deal with the continent 's exploding financial crisis .
member states have hitherto reacted individually to events in their own countries , but the urgency of the crisis has sparked a rising chorus of calls for coordinated action .
" i think it 's extremely important that european countries use similar principles in how they treat banks in problems -lrb- sic -rrb- , for example , how they intervene , what time they intervene , what policy measures they are prepared to apply , " dutch finance minister wouter bos said ahead of the meeting in luxembourg .
europe works towards a common approach bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : almunia was confident of a eu coordinated action officials from the eu 's executive echoed that call , with eu economic and monetary affairs commissioner joaquin almunia saying : " we should have a common approach , coordinated action , to avoid unilateral decisions that create negative spillovers . "
but the decision by the german government on sunday to offer a blanket savings guarantee to private depositors has piled the pressure on other eu member states to follow suit .
austria , for instance , raised its guarantees on savings deposits late sunday , just hours after the german plan was announced .
sweden and denmark raised their guarantees on monday morning .
while insisting that austrian banks were sound , austrian finance minister wilhelm molterer said the government had taken the decision " to avoid a competitive disadvantage with germany , so that savings deposits do not flow off to germany . "
german plan up for discussion bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel 's government has pledged to protect investors german officials appeared under pressure to explain their actions after earlier criticizing an irish guarantee , with bos saying that the german plan " is one of the issues on the table here . "
but german deputy finance minister joerg asmussen stressed that " germany 's approach is fundamentally different from the irish one .
they set up a rescue shield which basically discriminates in the internal market , while germany 's approach is aimed at making sure that no depositor loses a single euro . "
about a third of the 15 eu countries that share the common currency have already moved to safeguard bank deposits in some way or other - among them germany , austria , greece , ireland and belgium .
but after a meeting of the leaders of the eu 's four biggest economies in paris on saturday , proposals for setting up an eu-wide rescue fund appeared to have been taken off the table .
" i do n't think there 's going to be anything near consensus about a european fund .
i hope there is going to be a consensus about a common approach , on principles that should be applied whenever we want to intervene or whenever we want to help banks in problems -lrb- sic -rrb- , " bos said . dpa news agency send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de finance -pipe- 06.10.2008 german government under pressure to deliver on crisis promise großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : doom and gloom : germany has not escaped the financial storm sweeping in from the us the german government is under pressure to deliver as it races to reassure investors and individual savers that it will protect europe 's biggest economy from falling victim to the global financial crisis . the stock exchange may not have got the message however as shares tumbled seven percent monday in line with heavy losses elsewhere in europe and asia as wall street plunged too .
berlin hoped a new 50-billion-euro -lrb- $ 68-billion -rrb- rescue plan for the distressed mortgage lender hypo real estate -lrb- hre -rrb- , a munich-based company that lends to commercial developers and municipalities to build hotels , offices , roads , airports and the like , and a blanket guarantee on private bank accounts would prevent panic from seizing a nation of savers .
finance minister peer steinbrueck said he did not rule out raising state guarantees on hre credit lines and that there was " a plan b in the drawer " to ensure the banking sector did not collapse .
steinbrueck did not provide details but told a press conference : " we are aware that we will not get very far with case-by-case solutions . "
the bank is now to be provided with credit lines worth a total 50 billion euros , of which a little more than half was to be guaranteed by the state .
hre shares were hammered in afternoon trading on the frankfurt stock exchange however , losing 35.15 percent to 4.87 euros .
meanwhile , the government said it would guarantee private bank accounts , estimated to be worth 1.6 trillion euros .
economics professor hans-peter burghof of the university of hohenheim told german radio that amount represented " the biggest guarantee in history .
" never has anyone anywhere in the world guaranteed such a sum in two simple sentences , " he said , while noting that in principle the idea of giving guarantees was to ensure they would not be needed .
merkel pledges to protect financial system bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel tried to instill calm in investors and savers chancellor angela merkel told reporters on sunday that the government " will not allow an institution 's crisis to become a crisis for the entire system . "
" we are saying to women and men savers that their deposits are safe .
the federal government promises that , " merkel said .
questions about the german government assurance of an estimated 1 trillion euros -lrb- $ 1.4 trillion -rrb- of personal savings at german banks meanwhile were being raised on monday .
neighbouring nations came under pressure to follow germany 's lead .
berlin described the assurance to savers , issued by chancellor merkel in two sentences in front of television cameras on sunday , as " able to be relied on . "
berlin has not announced any legislation on a deposit-insurance scheme beyond existing bank-industry guarantees .
officials said they were still talking to banks on how to shape the guarantee .
merkel 's spokesman ulrich wilhelm said in berlin , " it 's a political statement that can be relied on and is decisive . "
the german government and its capabilities stood behind this assurance , he added .
jonathan todd , spokesman for european competition commissioner neelie kroes , said : " we were informed by the german authorities of their intentions .
" the commission notes that the measures seem to be limited to retail bank deposits , and so less liable to give rise to distortions of competition . "
todd added , " in general , retail deposit guarantee schemes for savers can be an appropriate policy response to fears regarding the stability of the banking system . "
the crisis reached germany with the stumble by hre and the embarrassment which followed a 35-billion-euro bail-out a week ago which proved inadequate .
global insight senior economist timo klein told reporters : " since they were unable to correct themselves , financial markets looked to the german government -lrb- for help -rrb- .
the dax is now looking for a general plan for the banks , maybe as early as wednesday . "
brussels sees no problem with german plan bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the commission is keeping an eye on developments in brussels , the european commission said the german decision regarding private accounts appeared to conform to eu competition rules and did not pose the same problems as a similar announcement by ireland .
" the commission notes that the measures seem to be limited to retail bank deposits , so -lrb- it is -rrb- less liable to give rise to distortion of competition , " said commission spokesman todd .
in britain , prime minister gordon brown 's spokesman said london understood that berlin did not plan to pass legislation on the guarantees and added : " we have been in the process of seeking clarification from germany as to what they have committed themselves to . "
an initial guarantee issued by the irish government to banks has drawn criticism from several european union countries which feared it could distort competition by making irish bank accounts more attractive to eu savers .
hre management under fire bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the hre has tottered on the verge of collapse for days meanwhile , as germany sought to calm the public with a " decisive " pledge about savings , property lender hre was under further pressure from other banks and berlin to sack its chief executive .
german finance minister peer steinbrueck said it was " unthinkable " to keep dealing with the same hre top management .
he charged that hre , at the same time as seeking state aid , had used lawyers against the government so as to " escape its responsibilities . "
in monday trading , hre stock declined as much as 40 percent from friday 's close as investors worried that the new bail-out might also prove inadequate .
in brussels , the eu commission 's todd , said , " as soon as the details are notified to us we will assess very quickly whether the new measures are compatible with -lrb- the eu 's -rrb- state aid rules . "
a newspaper , die welt , was to appear tuesday with a report that hre was blaming its plunge from grace on a downgrading by ratings agencies that allowed creditors to call up loans .
berlin has refused demands by the banking industry to nationalize hre , a lender seen in germany as too important to let fail .
steinbrueck said financial securities that have been disdained in the past by central banks would be used as security for much of the 15-billion-euro expansion of the hre bail-out .
the european central bank -lrb- ecb -rrb- had agreed to this , he said .
" nobody can forecast just yet how much this paper is actually worth , " he added .
the government and banking-industry guarantee that backstops the new bail-out remains limited to 35 billion euros , as announced one week ago . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

berlin hoped a new 50-billion-euro -lrb- $ 68-billion -rrb- rescue plan for the distressed mortgage lender hypo real estate -lrb- hre -rrb- , a munich-based company that lends to commercial developers and municipalities to build hotels , offices , roads , airports and the like , and a blanket guarantee on private bank accounts would prevent panic from seizing a nation of savers .
finance minister peer steinbrueck said he did not rule out raising state guarantees on hre credit lines and that there was " a plan b in the drawer " to ensure the banking sector did not collapse .
steinbrueck did not provide details but told a press conference : " we are aware that we will not get very far with case-by-case solutions . "
the bank is now to be provided with credit lines worth a total 50 billion euros , of which a little more than half was to be guaranteed by the state .
hre shares were hammered in afternoon trading on the frankfurt stock exchange however , losing 35.15 percent to 4.87 euros .
meanwhile , the government said it would guarantee private bank accounts , estimated to be worth 1.6 trillion euros .
economics professor hans-peter burghof of the university of hohenheim told german radio that amount represented " the biggest guarantee in history .
" never has anyone anywhere in the world guaranteed such a sum in two simple sentences , " he said , while noting that in principle the idea of giving guarantees was to ensure they would not be needed .
merkel pledges to protect financial system bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel tried to instill calm in investors and savers chancellor angela merkel told reporters on sunday that the government " will not allow an institution 's crisis to become a crisis for the entire system . "
" we are saying to women and men savers that their deposits are safe .
the federal government promises that , " merkel said .
questions about the german government assurance of an estimated 1 trillion euros -lrb- $ 1.4 trillion -rrb- of personal savings at german banks meanwhile were being raised on monday .
neighbouring nations came under pressure to follow germany 's lead .
berlin described the assurance to savers , issued by chancellor merkel in two sentences in front of television cameras on sunday , as " able to be relied on . "
berlin has not announced any legislation on a deposit-insurance scheme beyond existing bank-industry guarantees .
officials said they were still talking to banks on how to shape the guarantee .
merkel 's spokesman ulrich wilhelm said in berlin , " it 's a political statement that can be relied on and is decisive . "
the german government and its capabilities stood behind this assurance , he added .
jonathan todd , spokesman for european competition commissioner neelie kroes , said : " we were informed by the german authorities of their intentions .
" the commission notes that the measures seem to be limited to retail bank deposits , and so less liable to give rise to distortions of competition . "
todd added , " in general , retail deposit guarantee schemes for savers can be an appropriate policy response to fears regarding the stability of the banking system . "
the crisis reached germany with the stumble by hre and the embarrassment which followed a 35-billion-euro bail-out a week ago which proved inadequate .
global insight senior economist timo klein told reporters : " since they were unable to correct themselves , financial markets looked to the german government -lrb- for help -rrb- .
the dax is now looking for a general plan for the banks , maybe as early as wednesday . "
brussels sees no problem with german plan bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the commission is keeping an eye on developments in brussels , the european commission said the german decision regarding private accounts appeared to conform to eu competition rules and did not pose the same problems as a similar announcement by ireland .
" the commission notes that the measures seem to be limited to retail bank deposits , so -lrb- it is -rrb- less liable to give rise to distortion of competition , " said commission spokesman todd .
in britain , prime minister gordon brown 's spokesman said london understood that berlin did not plan to pass legislation on the guarantees and added : " we have been in the process of seeking clarification from germany as to what they have committed themselves to . "
an initial guarantee issued by the irish government to banks has drawn criticism from several european union countries which feared it could distort competition by making irish bank accounts more attractive to eu savers .
hre management under fire bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the hre has tottered on the verge of collapse for days meanwhile , as germany sought to calm the public with a " decisive " pledge about savings , property lender hre was under further pressure from other banks and berlin to sack its chief executive .
german finance minister peer steinbrueck said it was " unthinkable " to keep dealing with the same hre top management .
he charged that hre , at the same time as seeking state aid , had used lawyers against the government so as to " escape its responsibilities . "
in monday trading , hre stock declined as much as 40 percent from friday 's close as investors worried that the new bail-out might also prove inadequate .
in brussels , the eu commission 's todd , said , " as soon as the details are notified to us we will assess very quickly whether the new measures are compatible with -lrb- the eu 's -rrb- state aid rules . "
a newspaper , die welt , was to appear tuesday with a report that hre was blaming its plunge from grace on a downgrading by ratings agencies that allowed creditors to call up loans .
berlin has refused demands by the banking industry to nationalize hre , a lender seen in germany as too important to let fail .
steinbrueck said financial securities that have been disdained in the past by central banks would be used as security for much of the 15-billion-euro expansion of the hre bail-out .
the european central bank -lrb- ecb -rrb- had agreed to this , he said .
" nobody can forecast just yet how much this paper is actually worth , " he added .
the government and banking-industry guarantee that backstops the new bail-out remains limited to 35 billion euros , as announced one week ago . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

that 's the message german politicians gave private depositors .
the government guaranteed savings in german accounts .
according to the finance ministry , the federal government is vouching for " more than 1 trillion euros . "
but even such a guarantee would n't be worth a cent if everyone ran to the bank for their money - not even the government could pay such a huge sum of money .
the core of the guarantee serves a psychological purpose : despite all the talk about the financial crisis ' dimensions , citizens should n't get any more worried than they already are .
by giving a guarantee , the state is hoping to avoid a situation where it would have to pay anything back .
but there 's a different problem : no german bank has yet faced difficulties in this crisis due to private customers wanting their money back .
even at britain 's northern rock , customers did n't start demanding their money back until the bank was already deep in the crisis .
there are two reasons for the difficulties banks are facing .
either they have too many financial products based on junk us mortgages that needed to be written off on their books or they have n't been successful in receiving short-term capital from money markets to keep up with running commitments because skeptical banks are hardly lending to each other .
the state 's guarantee for private savings does not solve either of these problems .
it is a preventative relaxant for the possibility that additional institutions take a tumble .
to deal with the actual problem , politicians are now talking about a " national protective umbrella . "
there is a possibility that individual governments will put together bail-out packages which , like the united states , buy rotten debts from banks .
politicians in at an emergency summit in paris could n't agree non a billion-euro package for a european solution , and by the end of the meeting the leaders denied even having the idea of creating one .
they did , however , agree to coordinate their actions better in the future , though it will still be up to each country to decide on the best way to protect its banks .
but the example of state guarantees for private deposits shows that there wo n't be any national answers to this financial crisis .
chancellor angela merkel criticized the irish government for guaranteeing private deposits , and then , a few days later , does the same thing .
the more countries offer such guarantees , the greater the pressure will be on the remaining governments to do the same . otherwise their banks will risk losing customers - and capital - to other european countries .
the end result will be a european solution - even if it 's not one member states agreed to after a set of negotiations .
officially , financial policy is left up to national governments , but the reality has long been a different story .
the same is true for " national protective umbrellas " and other safeguards .
when a country buys its banks bad debts in a big way , other countries are forced to act in the same way .
as europe 's biggest economy , germany has a special role in this regard .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de finance -pipe- 06.10.2008 european leaders commit to tackling financial crisis großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : european leaders said they will take all necessary steps to protect euro zone banks european union leaders will take " all the necessary steps " to ensure the stability of the bloc 's financial system and protect citizens ' savings , an eu statement said monday , oct .
6 . such measures would include the injection of liquidity by european central banks , bail-outs for troubled banks and guarantees for deposits , the joint statement said .
noting that no european depositor had lost their savings so far , the eu leaders called for " coordination and close cooperation " in dealing with the effects of the global credit crunch .
the unprecedented statement came as european stock markets tumbled and as finance ministers from the 15 eu countries that share the euro were holding talks in luxembourg on ways to deal with the continent 's exploding financial crisis .
member states have hitherto reacted individually to events in their own countries , but the urgency of the crisis has sparked a rising chorus of calls for coordinated action .
" i think it 's extremely important that european countries use similar principles in how they treat banks in problems -lrb- sic -rrb- , for example , how they intervene , what time they intervene , what policy measures they are prepared to apply , " dutch finance minister wouter bos said ahead of the meeting in luxembourg .
europe works towards a common approach bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : almunia was confident of a eu coordinated action officials from the eu 's executive echoed that call , with eu economic and monetary affairs commissioner joaquin almunia saying : " we should have a common approach , coordinated action , to avoid unilateral decisions that create negative spillovers . "
but the decision by the german government on sunday to offer a blanket savings guarantee to private depositors has piled the pressure on other eu member states to follow suit .
austria , for instance , raised its guarantees on savings deposits late sunday , just hours after the german plan was announced .
sweden and denmark raised their guarantees on monday morning .
while insisting that austrian banks were sound , austrian finance minister wilhelm molterer said the government had taken the decision " to avoid a competitive disadvantage with germany , so that savings deposits do not flow off to germany . "
german plan up for discussion bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel 's government has pledged to protect investors german officials appeared under pressure to explain their actions after earlier criticizing an irish guarantee , with bos saying that the german plan " is one of the issues on the table here . "
but german deputy finance minister joerg asmussen stressed that " germany 's approach is fundamentally different from the irish one .
they set up a rescue shield which basically discriminates in the internal market , while germany 's approach is aimed at making sure that no depositor loses a single euro . "
about a third of the 15 eu countries that share the common currency have already moved to safeguard bank deposits in some way or other - among them germany , austria , greece , ireland and belgium .
but after a meeting of the leaders of the eu 's four biggest economies in paris on saturday , proposals for setting up an eu-wide rescue fund appeared to have been taken off the table .
" i do n't think there 's going to be anything near consensus about a european fund .
i hope there is going to be a consensus about a common approach , on principles that should be applied whenever we want to intervene or whenever we want to help banks in problems -lrb- sic -rrb- , " bos said . dpa news agency send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

6 , three days after a pkk attack on a border post killed 15 turkish soldiers . according to a statement released by the turkish general staff , the warplanes bombed pkk positions in the mountainous avasin region of northern iraq .
" the planes returned safely to base after successfully completing their mission , " the statement said .
turkish jets also attacked positions in the same area on sunday night .
the attack on friday night on the aktutun border post in the south-eastern province of hakkari that left 15 soldiers and 23 pkk separatists dead has shocked turkey and led to the general staff on sunday announcing that it was to relocate five military border posts .
a spokesman for the military said the administration of the kurdish autonomous area in iraq had not helped in the fight against the pkk , despite overtures by iraq 's kurdish president jalal talabani .
after the attack talabani called his turkish counterpart abdullah gul to propose a meeting of high-ranking security experts from both sides , suggesting iraqi willingness to help turkey de-escalate the situation .
the turkish air force has conducted a number of airstrikes against pkk targets in northern iraq since a week-long cross-border incursion into northern iraq was launched in february .
ankara blames the separatist group for the deaths of more than 35,000 people since the early 1980s when the pkk began its fight for independence or autonomy for the mainly kurdish-populated south-east of turkey .
turkish dead laid to rest as tensions heighten bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : angry crowds protested the deaths of turkish soldiers the 15 turkish soldiers killed in saturday 's attack on an iraq border post were borne to their graves on sunday by a crowd of thousands shouting angry slogans against the perpetrators - the outlawed kurdish workers party , or pkk .
the attack , which claimed 38 lives in total , was launched by the guerrilla group , which operates from inside iraq , after a week of turkish air force raids on their positions .
turkish government and military leaders have vowed to escalate the campaign against the pkk .
" we will now conduct our campaign against terrorism even more decisively , " said turkish prime minister recep tayyip erdogan , after he broke off his journey to central asia in response to the attack .
but turkey can not win the war against the pkk by military force alone .
one day before the aktutun border post attack , the worst pkk assault this year , the turkish air force had bombarded suspected pkk positions in the qandil mountains of iraq , close to the iranian border .
large pkk operation targets border post bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : kurdish troops hit the turkish post on the iraq border at the same time , the attack on the troops stationed at aktutun was about to be launched , although they did n't know it .
according to turkish media reports , more than 300 pkk fighters assembled for the raid on the border post .
at daybreak on saturday they opened fire with heavy weapons from iraq as other fighters moved in on the ground .
the battle at aktutun lasted for five hours .
it was the fifth attack on the post since 1992 .
turkey hit back with combat helicopters and special forces .
after the attack , iraqi president jalal talabani , himself a kurd , called his turkish counterpart abdullah gul to propose a meeting of high-ranking security experts from both sides , suggesting iraqi willingness to help turkey de-escalate the situation .
however , turkish daily millyet commented on sunday that " long- range weapons can not be brought into position without those responsible for security in iraq noticing . "
also under question is the value of us support in informing turkey of pkk movements within iraq .
the turkish parliament is due to vote monday on whether to allow the army to extend its mandate for operations in northern iraq for a further year .
the approval of the mandate was not in doubt even before saturday 's attack , as evidently turkey 's operations in northern iraq had not brought the pkk to its knees .
in february , turkey launched a ground offensive in iraq , although us criticism brought it to a rapid end .
us defense secretary robert gates has suggested the military struggle against the pkk be conducted together with economic and political means .
" only this way can terrorism be stopped , " he said .

the attack on friday night on the aktutun border post in the south-eastern province of hakkari that left 15 soldiers and 23 pkk separatists dead has shocked turkey and led to the general staff on sunday announcing that it was to relocate five military border posts .
a spokesman for the military said the administration of the kurdish autonomous area in iraq had not helped in the fight against the pkk , despite overtures by iraq 's kurdish president jalal talabani .
after the attack talabani called his turkish counterpart abdullah gul to propose a meeting of high-ranking security experts from both sides , suggesting iraqi willingness to help turkey de-escalate the situation .
the turkish air force has conducted a number of airstrikes against pkk targets in northern iraq since a week-long cross-border incursion into northern iraq was launched in february .
ankara blames the separatist group for the deaths of more than 35,000 people since the early 1980s when the pkk began its fight for independence or autonomy for the mainly kurdish-populated south-east of turkey .
turkish dead laid to rest as tensions heighten bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : angry crowds protested the deaths of turkish soldiers the 15 turkish soldiers killed in saturday 's attack on an iraq border post were borne to their graves on sunday by a crowd of thousands shouting angry slogans against the perpetrators - the outlawed kurdish workers party , or pkk .
the attack , which claimed 38 lives in total , was launched by the guerrilla group , which operates from inside iraq , after a week of turkish air force raids on their positions .
turkish government and military leaders have vowed to escalate the campaign against the pkk .
" we will now conduct our campaign against terrorism even more decisively , " said turkish prime minister recep tayyip erdogan , after he broke off his journey to central asia in response to the attack .
but turkey can not win the war against the pkk by military force alone .
one day before the aktutun border post attack , the worst pkk assault this year , the turkish air force had bombarded suspected pkk positions in the qandil mountains of iraq , close to the iranian border .
large pkk operation targets border post bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : kurdish troops hit the turkish post on the iraq border at the same time , the attack on the troops stationed at aktutun was about to be launched , although they did n't know it .
according to turkish media reports , more than 300 pkk fighters assembled for the raid on the border post .
at daybreak on saturday they opened fire with heavy weapons from iraq as other fighters moved in on the ground .
the battle at aktutun lasted for five hours .
it was the fifth attack on the post since 1992 .
turkey hit back with combat helicopters and special forces .
after the attack , iraqi president jalal talabani , himself a kurd , called his turkish counterpart abdullah gul to propose a meeting of high-ranking security experts from both sides , suggesting iraqi willingness to help turkey de-escalate the situation .
however , turkish daily millyet commented on sunday that " long- range weapons can not be brought into position without those responsible for security in iraq noticing . "
also under question is the value of us support in informing turkey of pkk movements within iraq .
the turkish parliament is due to vote monday on whether to allow the army to extend its mandate for operations in northern iraq for a further year .
the approval of the mandate was not in doubt even before saturday 's attack , as evidently turkey 's operations in northern iraq had not brought the pkk to its knees .
in february , turkey launched a ground offensive in iraq , although us criticism brought it to a rapid end .
us defense secretary robert gates has suggested the military struggle against the pkk be conducted together with economic and political means .
" only this way can terrorism be stopped , " he said .
the pkk is considered by the united states and the european union to be a terrorist group . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

that package had a price tag of 35 billion euros . the german finance ministry said in a statement that the new deal will see the financial sector topping up that sum with an additional 15 billion euros .
" with this mutually agreed solution , the institution -lrb- hypo real estate -rrb- will be stabilized and with it , germany strengthened as a place to conduct finance in difficult times , " the statement said . on monday , german finance minister peer steinbrueck said he would not rule out increasing the government 's gurantee for hypo real estate -lrb- hre -rrb- which is worth almost 27 billion euros .
hre on monday hailed the bailout , saying it would allow the company to keep functioning amidst the ongoing financial crisis .
" we are very thankful for the backing of all those involved , " hre boss georg funke said in a statement .
" the solution guarantees the stability of the hypo real estate group , which will have enough liqudity and will be able to continue functioning even as the financial crisis continues , " funke added .
government keen to avoid knock-on effect , panic bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the government is unhappy about what it sees as poor management decisions speaking to reporters before the deal was announced , merkel said the government was " pulling out all the stops " to save hypo real estate -lrb- hre -rrb- . " the government says today that we will not allow an institution 's crisis to become a crisis for the entire system , " merkel said . merkel 's government had scrambled to reach a deal before asian markets opened monday , fearing the company would not last long for more than a few days without a rescue package .
the chancellor also warned that managers at financial institutions should be held accountable for what she termed irresponsible behavior .
" we owe that to the taxpayers in germany , " she said .
in a further move to shore up the german banking system , the government issued a guarantee for all savings in german banks . in a bid to stave off panic withdrawals , finance minister peer steinbrueck assured that german bank account holders need not worry about losing a " single euro " in the crisis .
" that is an important message intended to create calm and not reactions that would be disproportional and make the current crisis management and crisis prevention even more difficult , " steinbrueck said .
finance ministry spokesman torsten albig told business daily handelsblatt that the estimated value of the guaranteed accounts would total 568 billion euros .
hre management under fire bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german banks have been feeling the fallout of troubles on wall street hypo real estate , germany 's second largest commercial property lender is the first german blue-chip company to seek a government bailout . hre , which mainly lends to commercial projects and to build public facilities such as airports and roads , is the biggest german casualty of the crisis that has spread from new york in the last month . steinbrueck had earlier said he was " outraged " at the management of the hre group because a " further liquidity gap in billions -lrb- of euros -rrb- " had materialized . " the german government refuses to be forced into any co-responsibility by this banking institute , " he said . hre ran into trouble mid-september after a credit freeze following the collapse of us investment bank lehman brothers .

" i am still in favor of individual decisions because i think we ca n't make things too easy for bank managers , " conservative finance expert otto bernhard told german television channel n-tv on monday . he added that he opposed general safeguards because they would protect mangers who had lost customers ' money in risky investments . savings guaranteed bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german leaders wanted the public to know its savings were safe over the weekend , germany also guaranteed all the country 's personal savings deposits , estimated at 568 billion euros , as other european governments moved to make similar promises after ireland and greece had already done so . steinbrueck and chancellor angela merkel said sunday that the move would reassure a skittish public that its savings were safe . " it was a signal from the chancellor and me , that savers understand they must n't be worried about their savings , " steinbrueck said .
" that 's important in this situation because we do n't want them to run to their banks filled with fear and withdraw money . " dw staff -lrb- sms -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

smaller teams are now losing their respect for the champions , who are only 11th in the table after two wins in seven matches , beckenbauer wrote in his column for bild newspaper on monday .

beckenbauer said the team gave bochum far too much room to play .

that 's the message german politicians gave private depositors .
the government guaranteed savings in german accounts .
according to the finance ministry , the federal government is vouching for " more than 1 trillion euros . "
but even such a guarantee would n't be worth a cent if everyone ran to the bank for their money - not even the government could pay such a huge sum of money .
the core of the guarantee serves a psychological purpose : despite all the talk about the financial crisis ' dimensions , citizens should n't get any more worried than they already are .
by giving a guarantee , the state is hoping to avoid a situation where it would have to pay anything back .
but there 's a different problem : no german bank has yet faced difficulties in this crisis due to private customers wanting their money back .
even at britain 's northern rock , customers did n't start demanding their money back until the bank was already deep in the crisis .
there are two reasons for the difficulties banks are facing .
either they have too many financial products based on junk us mortgages that needed to be written off on their books or they have n't been successful in receiving short-term capital from money markets to keep up with running commitments because skeptical banks are hardly lending to each other .
the state 's guarantee for private savings does not solve either of these problems .
it is a preventative relaxant for the possibility that additional institutions take a tumble .
to deal with the actual problem , politicians are now talking about a " national protective umbrella . "
there is a possibility that individual governments will put together bail-out packages which , like the united states , buy rotten debts from banks .
politicians in at an emergency summit in paris could n't agree non a billion-euro package for a european solution , and by the end of the meeting the leaders denied even having the idea of creating one .
they did , however , agree to coordinate their actions better in the future , though it will still be up to each country to decide on the best way to protect its banks .
but the example of state guarantees for private deposits shows that there wo n't be any national answers to this financial crisis .
chancellor angela merkel criticized the irish government for guaranteeing private deposits , and then , a few days later , does the same thing .
the more countries offer such guarantees , the greater the pressure will be on the remaining governments to do the same . otherwise their banks will risk losing customers - and capital - to other european countries .
the end result will be a european solution - even if it 's not one member states agreed to after a set of negotiations .
officially , financial policy is left up to national governments , but the reality has long been a different story .
the same is true for " national protective umbrellas " and other safeguards .
when a country buys its banks bad debts in a big way , other countries are forced to act in the same way .
as europe 's biggest economy , germany has a special role in this regard .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de finance -pipe- 06.10.2008 european leaders commit to tackling financial crisis großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : european leaders said they will take all necessary steps to protect euro zone banks european union leaders will take " all the necessary steps " to ensure the stability of the bloc 's financial system and protect citizens ' savings , an eu statement said monday , oct .
6 . such measures would include the injection of liquidity by european central banks , bail-outs for troubled banks and guarantees for deposits , the joint statement said .
noting that no european depositor had lost their savings so far , the eu leaders called for " coordination and close cooperation " in dealing with the effects of the global credit crunch .
the unprecedented statement came as european stock markets tumbled and as finance ministers from the 15 eu countries that share the euro were holding talks in luxembourg on ways to deal with the continent 's exploding financial crisis .
member states have hitherto reacted individually to events in their own countries , but the urgency of the crisis has sparked a rising chorus of calls for coordinated action .
" i think it 's extremely important that european countries use similar principles in how they treat banks in problems -lrb- sic -rrb- , for example , how they intervene , what time they intervene , what policy measures they are prepared to apply , " dutch finance minister wouter bos said ahead of the meeting in luxembourg .
europe works towards a common approach bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : almunia was confident of a eu coordinated action officials from the eu 's executive echoed that call , with eu economic and monetary affairs commissioner joaquin almunia saying : " we should have a common approach , coordinated action , to avoid unilateral decisions that create negative spillovers . "
but the decision by the german government on sunday to offer a blanket savings guarantee to private depositors has piled the pressure on other eu member states to follow suit .
austria , for instance , raised its guarantees on savings deposits late sunday , just hours after the german plan was announced .
sweden and denmark raised their guarantees on monday morning .
while insisting that austrian banks were sound , austrian finance minister wilhelm molterer said the government had taken the decision " to avoid a competitive disadvantage with germany , so that savings deposits do not flow off to germany . "
german plan up for discussion bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel 's government has pledged to protect investors german officials appeared under pressure to explain their actions after earlier criticizing an irish guarantee , with bos saying that the german plan " is one of the issues on the table here . "
but german deputy finance minister joerg asmussen stressed that " germany 's approach is fundamentally different from the irish one .
they set up a rescue shield which basically discriminates in the internal market , while germany 's approach is aimed at making sure that no depositor loses a single euro . "
about a third of the 15 eu countries that share the common currency have already moved to safeguard bank deposits in some way or other - among them germany , austria , greece , ireland and belgium .
but after a meeting of the leaders of the eu 's four biggest economies in paris on saturday , proposals for setting up an eu-wide rescue fund appeared to have been taken off the table .
" i do n't think there 's going to be anything near consensus about a european fund .
i hope there is going to be a consensus about a common approach , on principles that should be applied whenever we want to intervene or whenever we want to help banks in problems -lrb- sic -rrb- , " bos said . dpa news agency send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de finance -pipe- 06.10.2008 europe follows germany 's financial guarantee plan großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany wants to shore up confidence of savers and investors after germany ’ s surprise decision to protect all personal bank deposits , britain and other european countries could follow suit .
yet investors remained skittish about europe 's financial future . calls for a common european approach to the banking crisis continued on monday as both the european and asian stock markets were down sharply in early trading .
up until this weekend , germany had stoically opposed issuing a blanket guarantee on all bank deposits despite other countries moving to do so .
yet with confidence deeply shaken after a first bailout for hypo real estate fell through , the german government abruptly changed course on sunday .
in an attempt to prevent a run on banks , germany announced it will guarantee all personal bank deposits in the country .
“ we tell all savings account holders that your deposits are safe .
the federal government assures it , ” german chancellor angela merkel said after an emergency government meeting in a bid to prevent a panic run on banks .
now britain is reportedly under pressure to change its stance .
britain had criticized recent decisions by ireland and greece to guarantee savings accounts , worrying that the moves could shift money away from british banks .
germany leads , others follow bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : fortis is getting help from a french bank british finance minister alistair darling is expected to address the issue in a speech to lawmakers on monday .
britain has already promised to increase the level of private savings guaranteed by the government to 50,000 pounds -lrb- $ 88,000 -rrb- per person .
the government has hesitated to go any higher than that due to the potential costs involved .
darling is reportedly considering using public funds to take stakes in banks .
the plan is a middle course between nationalizing banks and handing out further loans .
" germany is europe 's economic superpower , " said nick clegg , leader of the liberal democrats , britain 's third-largest party .
" where it leads , others are bound to follow . ”
clegg said a common european approach to deposit guarantees is necessary .
denmark on sunday announced the country 's banks had agreed to contribute 35 billion kronor -lrb- 4.8 billion euros -rrb- to help ailing banks and guarantee deposits .
italy wanted an even more united response , calling for an overarching european bailout plan .
investors remain skittish bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : eu leaders are grappling with how to best handle the banking crisis investors seemed spooked at signs of escalating problems in europe 's banking sector .
frankfurt 's stock market fell sharply on monday , with stocks down 3.29 percent at the opening .
asian stocks also dropped , with tokyo at a four-year low .
frankfurt 's blue chip dax slumped 4.54 per cent to 5,533.57 , its lowest level since july 2006 .
besides the german rescue of hypo , there were more signs over the weekend that european governments were scrambling to rescue struggling banks .
french bank bnp paribas agreed on sunday to take control of ailing finance group fortis 's operations in belgium and luxembourg through a share issue , saying the operation valued the company at 14.7 billion euros .
the belgian and luxembourg governments had partially nationalized the bank a week ago , but after the dutch government took over full control of fortis ' operations in the netherlands , they began looking for a suitor .
on saturday , leaders of britain , france , germany and italy said they would protect fragile banks , but would not copy the blanket $ 700 billion bailout agreed in the us last week .
eu finance ministers will try to put together plans on monday and tuesday for restoring confidence in the banking system .
germany looks to restore confidence germany had previously guaranteed 20,000 euros -lrb- $ 28,400 -rrb- savings per person .
finance ministry spokesman torsten albig told the business daily handelsblatt that the estimated value of the guaranteed all accounts would total 568 billion euros .
handelsblatt said the state was the only " fire brigade " that could come to the rescue in the face of a crisis of this size .
" this means the government and the banks will have to bite the bullet , " it said .
" this is an important signal intended to bring a calming , instead of reactions that are disproportionate and make crisis resolution and crisis prevention more difficult , " finance minister peer steinbrueck said . dw staff -lrb- th -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de finance -pipe- 06.10.2008 european leaders commit to tackling financial crisis großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : european leaders said they will take all necessary steps to protect euro zone banks european union leaders will take " all the necessary steps " to ensure the stability of the bloc 's financial system and protect citizens ' savings , an eu statement said monday , oct .
6 . such measures would include the injection of liquidity by european central banks , bail-outs for troubled banks and guarantees for deposits , the joint statement said .
noting that no european depositor had lost their savings so far , the eu leaders called for " coordination and close cooperation " in dealing with the effects of the global credit crunch .
the unprecedented statement came as european stock markets tumbled and as finance ministers from the 15 eu countries that share the euro were holding talks in luxembourg on ways to deal with the continent 's exploding financial crisis .
member states have hitherto reacted individually to events in their own countries , but the urgency of the crisis has sparked a rising chorus of calls for coordinated action .
" i think it 's extremely important that european countries use similar principles in how they treat banks in problems -lrb- sic -rrb- , for example , how they intervene , what time they intervene , what policy measures they are prepared to apply , " dutch finance minister wouter bos said ahead of the meeting in luxembourg .
europe works towards a common approach bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : almunia was confident of a eu coordinated action officials from the eu 's executive echoed that call , with eu economic and monetary affairs commissioner joaquin almunia saying : " we should have a common approach , coordinated action , to avoid unilateral decisions that create negative spillovers . "
but the decision by the german government on sunday to offer a blanket savings guarantee to private depositors has piled the pressure on other eu member states to follow suit .
austria , for instance , raised its guarantees on savings deposits late sunday , just hours after the german plan was announced .
sweden and denmark raised their guarantees on monday morning .
while insisting that austrian banks were sound , austrian finance minister wilhelm molterer said the government had taken the decision " to avoid a competitive disadvantage with germany , so that savings deposits do not flow off to germany . "
german plan up for discussion bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel 's government has pledged to protect investors german officials appeared under pressure to explain their actions after earlier criticizing an irish guarantee , with bos saying that the german plan " is one of the issues on the table here . "
but german deputy finance minister joerg asmussen stressed that " germany 's approach is fundamentally different from the irish one .
they set up a rescue shield which basically discriminates in the internal market , while germany 's approach is aimed at making sure that no depositor loses a single euro . "
about a third of the 15 eu countries that share the common currency have already moved to safeguard bank deposits in some way or other - among them germany , austria , greece , ireland and belgium .
but after a meeting of the leaders of the eu 's four biggest economies in paris on saturday , proposals for setting up an eu-wide rescue fund appeared to have been taken off the table .
" i do n't think there 's going to be anything near consensus about a european fund .
i hope there is going to be a consensus about a common approach , on principles that should be applied whenever we want to intervene or whenever we want to help banks in problems -lrb- sic -rrb- , " bos said . dpa news agency send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

6 , three days after a pkk attack on a border post killed 15 turkish soldiers . according to a statement released by the turkish general staff , the warplanes bombed pkk positions in the mountainous avasin region of northern iraq .
" the planes returned safely to base after successfully completing their mission , " the statement said .
turkish jets also attacked positions in the same area on sunday night .
the attack on friday night on the aktutun border post in the south-eastern province of hakkari that left 15 soldiers and 23 pkk separatists dead has shocked turkey and led to the general staff on sunday announcing that it was to relocate five military border posts .
a spokesman for the military said the administration of the kurdish autonomous area in iraq had not helped in the fight against the pkk , despite overtures by iraq 's kurdish president jalal talabani .
after the attack talabani called his turkish counterpart abdullah gul to propose a meeting of high-ranking security experts from both sides , suggesting iraqi willingness to help turkey de-escalate the situation .
the turkish air force has conducted a number of airstrikes against pkk targets in northern iraq since a week-long cross-border incursion into northern iraq was launched in february .
ankara blames the separatist group for the deaths of more than 35,000 people since the early 1980s when the pkk began its fight for independence or autonomy for the mainly kurdish-populated south-east of turkey .

the attack , which claimed 38 lives in total , was launched by the guerrilla group , which operates from inside iraq , after a week of turkish air force raids on their positions .
turkish government and military leaders have vowed to escalate the campaign against the pkk .
" we will now conduct our campaign against terrorism even more decisively , " said turkish prime minister recep tayyip erdogan , after he broke off his journey to central asia in response to the attack .
but turkey can not win the war against the pkk by military force alone .
one day before the aktutun border post attack , the worst pkk assault this year , the turkish air force had bombarded suspected pkk positions in the qandil mountains of iraq , close to the iranian border .

according to turkish media reports , more than 300 pkk fighters assembled for the raid on the border post .
at daybreak on saturday they opened fire with heavy weapons from iraq as other fighters moved in on the ground .
the battle at aktutun lasted for five hours .
it was the fifth attack on the post since 1992 .
turkey hit back with combat helicopters and special forces .
after the attack , iraqi president jalal talabani , himself a kurd , called his turkish counterpart abdullah gul to propose a meeting of high-ranking security experts from both sides , suggesting iraqi willingness to help turkey de-escalate the situation .
however , turkish daily millyet commented on sunday that " long- range weapons can not be brought into position without those responsible for security in iraq noticing . "
also under question is the value of us support in informing turkey of pkk movements within iraq .
the turkish parliament is due to vote monday on whether to allow the army to extend its mandate for operations in northern iraq for a further year .
the approval of the mandate was not in doubt even before saturday 's attack , as evidently turkey 's operations in northern iraq had not brought the pkk to its knees .
in february , turkey launched a ground offensive in iraq , although us criticism brought it to a rapid end .
us defense secretary robert gates has suggested the military struggle against the pkk be conducted together with economic and political means .

the attack on friday night on the aktutun border post in the south-eastern province of hakkari that left 15 soldiers and 23 pkk separatists dead has shocked turkey and led to the general staff on sunday announcing that it was to relocate five military border posts .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de finance -pipe- 06.10.2008 european leaders commit to tackling financial crisis großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : european leaders said they will take all necessary steps to protect euro zone banks european union leaders will take " all the necessary steps " to ensure the stability of the bloc 's financial system and protect citizens ' savings , an eu statement said monday , oct .
6 . such measures would include the injection of liquidity by european central banks , bail-outs for troubled banks and guarantees for deposits , the joint statement said .
noting that no european depositor had lost their savings so far , the eu leaders called for " coordination and close cooperation " in dealing with the effects of the global credit crunch .
the unprecedented statement came as european stock markets tumbled and as finance ministers from the 15 eu countries that share the euro were holding talks in luxembourg on ways to deal with the continent 's exploding financial crisis .
member states have hitherto reacted individually to events in their own countries , but the urgency of the crisis has sparked a rising chorus of calls for coordinated action .
" i think it 's extremely important that european countries use similar principles in how they treat banks in problems -lrb- sic -rrb- , for example , how they intervene , what time they intervene , what policy measures they are prepared to apply , " dutch finance minister wouter bos said ahead of the meeting in luxembourg .
europe works towards a common approach bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : almunia was confident of a eu coordinated action officials from the eu 's executive echoed that call , with eu economic and monetary affairs commissioner joaquin almunia saying : " we should have a common approach , coordinated action , to avoid unilateral decisions that create negative spillovers . "
but the decision by the german government on sunday to offer a blanket savings guarantee to private depositors has piled the pressure on other eu member states to follow suit .
austria , for instance , raised its guarantees on savings deposits late sunday , just hours after the german plan was announced .
sweden and denmark raised their guarantees on monday morning .
while insisting that austrian banks were sound , austrian finance minister wilhelm molterer said the government had taken the decision " to avoid a competitive disadvantage with germany , so that savings deposits do not flow off to germany . "
german plan up for discussion bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel 's government has pledged to protect investors german officials appeared under pressure to explain their actions after earlier criticizing an irish guarantee , with bos saying that the german plan " is one of the issues on the table here . "
but german deputy finance minister joerg asmussen stressed that " germany 's approach is fundamentally different from the irish one .
they set up a rescue shield which basically discriminates in the internal market , while germany 's approach is aimed at making sure that no depositor loses a single euro . "
about a third of the 15 eu countries that share the common currency have already moved to safeguard bank deposits in some way or other - among them germany , austria , greece , ireland and belgium .
but after a meeting of the leaders of the eu 's four biggest economies in paris on saturday , proposals for setting up an eu-wide rescue fund appeared to have been taken off the table .
" i do n't think there 's going to be anything near consensus about a european fund .
i hope there is going to be a consensus about a common approach , on principles that should be applied whenever we want to intervene or whenever we want to help banks in problems -lrb- sic -rrb- , " bos said . dpa news agency send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

berlin hoped a new 50-billion-euro -lrb- $ 68-billion -rrb- rescue plan for the distressed mortgage lender hypo real estate -lrb- hre -rrb- , a munich-based company that lends to commercial developers and municipalities to build hotels , offices , roads , airports and the like , and a blanket guarantee on private bank accounts would prevent panic from seizing a nation of savers .
finance minister peer steinbrueck said he did not rule out raising state guarantees on hre credit lines and that there was " a plan b in the drawer " to ensure the banking sector did not collapse .
steinbrueck did not provide details but told a press conference : " we are aware that we will not get very far with case-by-case solutions . "
the bank is now to be provided with credit lines worth a total 50 billion euros , of which a little more than half was to be guaranteed by the state .
hre shares were hammered in afternoon trading on the frankfurt stock exchange however , losing 35.15 percent to 4.87 euros .
meanwhile , the government said it would guarantee private bank accounts , estimated to be worth 1.6 trillion euros .
economics professor hans-peter burghof of the university of hohenheim told german radio that amount represented " the biggest guarantee in history .
" never has anyone anywhere in the world guaranteed such a sum in two simple sentences , " he said , while noting that in principle the idea of giving guarantees was to ensure they would not be needed .
merkel pledges to protect financial system bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel tried to instill calm in investors and savers chancellor angela merkel told reporters on sunday that the government " will not allow an institution 's crisis to become a crisis for the entire system . "
" we are saying to women and men savers that their deposits are safe .
the federal government promises that , " merkel said .
questions about the german government assurance of an estimated 1 trillion euros -lrb- $ 1.4 trillion -rrb- of personal savings at german banks meanwhile were being raised on monday .
neighbouring nations came under pressure to follow germany 's lead .
berlin described the assurance to savers , issued by chancellor merkel in two sentences in front of television cameras on sunday , as " able to be relied on . "
berlin has not announced any legislation on a deposit-insurance scheme beyond existing bank-industry guarantees .
officials said they were still talking to banks on how to shape the guarantee .
merkel 's spokesman ulrich wilhelm said in berlin , " it 's a political statement that can be relied on and is decisive . "
the german government and its capabilities stood behind this assurance , he added .
jonathan todd , spokesman for european competition commissioner neelie kroes , said : " we were informed by the german authorities of their intentions .
" the commission notes that the measures seem to be limited to retail bank deposits , and so less liable to give rise to distortions of competition . "
todd added , " in general , retail deposit guarantee schemes for savers can be an appropriate policy response to fears regarding the stability of the banking system . "
the crisis reached germany with the stumble by hre and the embarrassment which followed a 35-billion-euro bail-out a week ago which proved inadequate .
global insight senior economist timo klein told reporters : " since they were unable to correct themselves , financial markets looked to the german government -lrb- for help -rrb- .
the dax is now looking for a general plan for the banks , maybe as early as wednesday . "
brussels sees no problem with german plan bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the commission is keeping an eye on developments in brussels , the european commission said the german decision regarding private accounts appeared to conform to eu competition rules and did not pose the same problems as a similar announcement by ireland .
" the commission notes that the measures seem to be limited to retail bank deposits , so -lrb- it is -rrb- less liable to give rise to distortion of competition , " said commission spokesman todd .
in britain , prime minister gordon brown 's spokesman said london understood that berlin did not plan to pass legislation on the guarantees and added : " we have been in the process of seeking clarification from germany as to what they have committed themselves to . "
an initial guarantee issued by the irish government to banks has drawn criticism from several european union countries which feared it could distort competition by making irish bank accounts more attractive to eu savers .
hre management under fire bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the hre has tottered on the verge of collapse for days meanwhile , as germany sought to calm the public with a " decisive " pledge about savings , property lender hre was under further pressure from other banks and berlin to sack its chief executive .
german finance minister peer steinbrueck said it was " unthinkable " to keep dealing with the same hre top management .
he charged that hre , at the same time as seeking state aid , had used lawyers against the government so as to " escape its responsibilities . "
in monday trading , hre stock declined as much as 40 percent from friday 's close as investors worried that the new bail-out might also prove inadequate .
in brussels , the eu commission 's todd , said , " as soon as the details are notified to us we will assess very quickly whether the new measures are compatible with -lrb- the eu 's -rrb- state aid rules . "
a newspaper , die welt , was to appear tuesday with a report that hre was blaming its plunge from grace on a downgrading by ratings agencies that allowed creditors to call up loans .
berlin has refused demands by the banking industry to nationalize hre , a lender seen in germany as too important to let fail .
steinbrueck said financial securities that have been disdained in the past by central banks would be used as security for much of the 15-billion-euro expansion of the hre bail-out .
the european central bank -lrb- ecb -rrb- had agreed to this , he said .
" nobody can forecast just yet how much this paper is actually worth , " he added .
the government and banking-industry guarantee that backstops the new bail-out remains limited to 35 billion euros , as announced one week ago . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de finance -pipe- 06.10.2008 german government under pressure to deliver on crisis promise großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : doom and gloom : germany has not escaped the financial storm sweeping in from the us the german government is under pressure to deliver as it races to reassure investors and individual savers that it will protect europe 's biggest economy from falling victim to the global financial crisis . the stock exchange may not have got the message however as shares tumbled seven percent monday in line with heavy losses elsewhere in europe and asia as wall street plunged too .
berlin hoped a new 50-billion-euro -lrb- $ 68-billion -rrb- rescue plan for the distressed mortgage lender hypo real estate -lrb- hre -rrb- , a munich-based company that lends to commercial developers and municipalities to build hotels , offices , roads , airports and the like , and a blanket guarantee on private bank accounts would prevent panic from seizing a nation of savers .
finance minister peer steinbrueck said he did not rule out raising state guarantees on hre credit lines and that there was " a plan b in the drawer " to ensure the banking sector did not collapse .
steinbrueck did not provide details but told a press conference : " we are aware that we will not get very far with case-by-case solutions . "
the bank is now to be provided with credit lines worth a total 50 billion euros , of which a little more than half was to be guaranteed by the state .
hre shares were hammered in afternoon trading on the frankfurt stock exchange however , losing 35.15 percent to 4.87 euros .
meanwhile , the government said it would guarantee private bank accounts , estimated to be worth 1.6 trillion euros .
economics professor hans-peter burghof of the university of hohenheim told german radio that amount represented " the biggest guarantee in history .
" never has anyone anywhere in the world guaranteed such a sum in two simple sentences , " he said , while noting that in principle the idea of giving guarantees was to ensure they would not be needed .
merkel pledges to protect financial system bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel tried to instill calm in investors and savers chancellor angela merkel told reporters on sunday that the government " will not allow an institution 's crisis to become a crisis for the entire system . "
" we are saying to women and men savers that their deposits are safe .
the federal government promises that , " merkel said .
questions about the german government assurance of an estimated 1 trillion euros -lrb- $ 1.4 trillion -rrb- of personal savings at german banks meanwhile were being raised on monday .
neighbouring nations came under pressure to follow germany 's lead .
berlin described the assurance to savers , issued by chancellor merkel in two sentences in front of television cameras on sunday , as " able to be relied on . "
berlin has not announced any legislation on a deposit-insurance scheme beyond existing bank-industry guarantees .
officials said they were still talking to banks on how to shape the guarantee .
merkel 's spokesman ulrich wilhelm said in berlin , " it 's a political statement that can be relied on and is decisive . "
the german government and its capabilities stood behind this assurance , he added .
jonathan todd , spokesman for european competition commissioner neelie kroes , said : " we were informed by the german authorities of their intentions .
" the commission notes that the measures seem to be limited to retail bank deposits , and so less liable to give rise to distortions of competition . "
todd added , " in general , retail deposit guarantee schemes for savers can be an appropriate policy response to fears regarding the stability of the banking system . "
the crisis reached germany with the stumble by hre and the embarrassment which followed a 35-billion-euro bail-out a week ago which proved inadequate .
global insight senior economist timo klein told reporters : " since they were unable to correct themselves , financial markets looked to the german government -lrb- for help -rrb- .
the dax is now looking for a general plan for the banks , maybe as early as wednesday . "
brussels sees no problem with german plan bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the commission is keeping an eye on developments in brussels , the european commission said the german decision regarding private accounts appeared to conform to eu competition rules and did not pose the same problems as a similar announcement by ireland .
" the commission notes that the measures seem to be limited to retail bank deposits , so -lrb- it is -rrb- less liable to give rise to distortion of competition , " said commission spokesman todd .
in britain , prime minister gordon brown 's spokesman said london understood that berlin did not plan to pass legislation on the guarantees and added : " we have been in the process of seeking clarification from germany as to what they have committed themselves to . "
an initial guarantee issued by the irish government to banks has drawn criticism from several european union countries which feared it could distort competition by making irish bank accounts more attractive to eu savers .
hre management under fire bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the hre has tottered on the verge of collapse for days meanwhile , as germany sought to calm the public with a " decisive " pledge about savings , property lender hre was under further pressure from other banks and berlin to sack its chief executive .
german finance minister peer steinbrueck said it was " unthinkable " to keep dealing with the same hre top management .
he charged that hre , at the same time as seeking state aid , had used lawyers against the government so as to " escape its responsibilities . "
in monday trading , hre stock declined as much as 40 percent from friday 's close as investors worried that the new bail-out might also prove inadequate .
in brussels , the eu commission 's todd , said , " as soon as the details are notified to us we will assess very quickly whether the new measures are compatible with -lrb- the eu 's -rrb- state aid rules . "
a newspaper , die welt , was to appear tuesday with a report that hre was blaming its plunge from grace on a downgrading by ratings agencies that allowed creditors to call up loans .
berlin has refused demands by the banking industry to nationalize hre , a lender seen in germany as too important to let fail .
steinbrueck said financial securities that have been disdained in the past by central banks would be used as security for much of the 15-billion-euro expansion of the hre bail-out .
the european central bank -lrb- ecb -rrb- had agreed to this , he said .
" nobody can forecast just yet how much this paper is actually worth , " he added .
the government and banking-industry guarantee that backstops the new bail-out remains limited to 35 billion euros , as announced one week ago . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

jonathan todd , spokesman for european competition commissioner neelie kroes , said : " we were informed by the german authorities of their intentions .
" the commission notes that the measures seem to be limited to retail bank deposits , and so less liable to give rise to distortions of competition . "
todd added , " in general , retail deposit guarantee schemes for savers can be an appropriate policy response to fears regarding the stability of the banking system . "
the crisis reached germany with the stumble by hre and the embarrassment which followed a 35-billion-euro bail-out a week ago which proved inadequate .
global insight senior economist timo klein told reporters : " since they were unable to correct themselves , financial markets looked to the german government -lrb- for help -rrb- .

brussels sees no problem with german plan bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the commission is keeping an eye on developments in brussels , the european commission said the german decision regarding private accounts appeared to conform to eu competition rules and did not pose the same problems as a similar announcement by ireland .
" the commission notes that the measures seem to be limited to retail bank deposits , so -lrb- it is -rrb- less liable to give rise to distortion of competition , " said commission spokesman todd .
in britain , prime minister gordon brown 's spokesman said london understood that berlin did not plan to pass legislation on the guarantees and added : " we have been in the process of seeking clarification from germany as to what they have committed themselves to . "
an initial guarantee issued by the irish government to banks has drawn criticism from several european union countries which feared it could distort competition by making irish bank accounts more attractive to eu savers .
hre management under fire bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the hre has tottered on the verge of collapse for days meanwhile , as germany sought to calm the public with a " decisive " pledge about savings , property lender hre was under further pressure from other banks and berlin to sack its chief executive .
german finance minister peer steinbrueck said it was " unthinkable " to keep dealing with the same hre top management .
he charged that hre , at the same time as seeking state aid , had used lawyers against the government so as to " escape its responsibilities . "
in monday trading , hre stock declined as much as 40 percent from friday 's close as investors worried that the new bail-out might also prove inadequate .
in brussels , the eu commission 's todd , said , " as soon as the details are notified to us we will assess very quickly whether the new measures are compatible with -lrb- the eu 's -rrb- state aid rules . "
a newspaper , die welt , was to appear tuesday with a report that hre was blaming its plunge from grace on a downgrading by ratings agencies that allowed creditors to call up loans .
berlin has refused demands by the banking industry to nationalize hre , a lender seen in germany as too important to let fail .
steinbrueck said financial securities that have been disdained in the past by central banks would be used as security for much of the 15-billion-euro expansion of the hre bail-out .
the european central bank -lrb- ecb -rrb- had agreed to this , he said .

finance minister peer steinbrueck said he did not rule out raising state guarantees on hre credit lines and that there was " a plan b in the drawer " to ensure the banking sector did not collapse .
steinbrueck did not provide details but told a press conference : " we are aware that we will not get very far with case-by-case solutions . "
the bank is now to be provided with credit lines worth a total 50 billion euros , of which a little more than half was to be guaranteed by the state .
hre shares were hammered in afternoon trading on the frankfurt stock exchange however , losing 35.15 percent to 4.87 euros .
meanwhile , the government said it would guarantee private bank accounts , estimated to be worth 1.6 trillion euros .
economics professor hans-peter burghof of the university of hohenheim told german radio that amount represented " the biggest guarantee in history .
" never has anyone anywhere in the world guaranteed such a sum in two simple sentences , " he said , while noting that in principle the idea of giving guarantees was to ensure they would not be needed .
merkel pledges to protect financial system bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel tried to instill calm in investors and savers chancellor angela merkel told reporters on sunday that the government " will not allow an institution 's crisis to become a crisis for the entire system . "
" we are saying to women and men savers that their deposits are safe .
the federal government promises that , " merkel said .
questions about the german government assurance of an estimated 1 trillion euros -lrb- $ 1.4 trillion -rrb- of personal savings at german banks meanwhile were being raised on monday .
neighbouring nations came under pressure to follow germany 's lead .
berlin described the assurance to savers , issued by chancellor merkel in two sentences in front of television cameras on sunday , as " able to be relied on . "
berlin has not announced any legislation on a deposit-insurance scheme beyond existing bank-industry guarantees .
officials said they were still talking to banks on how to shape the guarantee .
merkel 's spokesman ulrich wilhelm said in berlin , " it 's a political statement that can be relied on and is decisive . "
the german government and its capabilities stood behind this assurance , he added .
jonathan todd , spokesman for european competition commissioner neelie kroes , said : " we were informed by the german authorities of their intentions .
" the commission notes that the measures seem to be limited to retail bank deposits , and so less liable to give rise to distortions of competition . "
todd added , " in general , retail deposit guarantee schemes for savers can be an appropriate policy response to fears regarding the stability of the banking system . "
the crisis reached germany with the stumble by hre and the embarrassment which followed a 35-billion-euro bail-out a week ago which proved inadequate .
global insight senior economist timo klein told reporters : " since they were unable to correct themselves , financial markets looked to the german government -lrb- for help -rrb- .
the dax is now looking for a general plan for the banks , maybe as early as wednesday . "
brussels sees no problem with german plan bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the commission is keeping an eye on developments in brussels , the european commission said the german decision regarding private accounts appeared to conform to eu competition rules and did not pose the same problems as a similar announcement by ireland .
" the commission notes that the measures seem to be limited to retail bank deposits , so -lrb- it is -rrb- less liable to give rise to distortion of competition , " said commission spokesman todd .
in britain , prime minister gordon brown 's spokesman said london understood that berlin did not plan to pass legislation on the guarantees and added : " we have been in the process of seeking clarification from germany as to what they have committed themselves to . "
an initial guarantee issued by the irish government to banks has drawn criticism from several european union countries which feared it could distort competition by making irish bank accounts more attractive to eu savers .
hre management under fire bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the hre has tottered on the verge of collapse for days meanwhile , as germany sought to calm the public with a " decisive " pledge about savings , property lender hre was under further pressure from other banks and berlin to sack its chief executive .
german finance minister peer steinbrueck said it was " unthinkable " to keep dealing with the same hre top management .
he charged that hre , at the same time as seeking state aid , had used lawyers against the government so as to " escape its responsibilities . "
in monday trading , hre stock declined as much as 40 percent from friday 's close as investors worried that the new bail-out might also prove inadequate .
in brussels , the eu commission 's todd , said , " as soon as the details are notified to us we will assess very quickly whether the new measures are compatible with -lrb- the eu 's -rrb- state aid rules . "
a newspaper , die welt , was to appear tuesday with a report that hre was blaming its plunge from grace on a downgrading by ratings agencies that allowed creditors to call up loans .
berlin has refused demands by the banking industry to nationalize hre , a lender seen in germany as too important to let fail .
steinbrueck said financial securities that have been disdained in the past by central banks would be used as security for much of the 15-billion-euro expansion of the hre bail-out .
the european central bank -lrb- ecb -rrb- had agreed to this , he said .
" nobody can forecast just yet how much this paper is actually worth , " he added .
the government and banking-industry guarantee that backstops the new bail-out remains limited to 35 billion euros , as announced one week ago . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

that 's the message german politicians gave private depositors .
the government guaranteed savings in german accounts .
according to the finance ministry , the federal government is vouching for " more than 1 trillion euros . "
but even such a guarantee would n't be worth a cent if everyone ran to the bank for their money - not even the government could pay such a huge sum of money .
the core of the guarantee serves a psychological purpose : despite all the talk about the financial crisis ' dimensions , citizens should n't get any more worried than they already are .
by giving a guarantee , the state is hoping to avoid a situation where it would have to pay anything back .
but there 's a different problem : no german bank has yet faced difficulties in this crisis due to private customers wanting their money back .
even at britain 's northern rock , customers did n't start demanding their money back until the bank was already deep in the crisis .
there are two reasons for the difficulties banks are facing .
either they have too many financial products based on junk us mortgages that needed to be written off on their books or they have n't been successful in receiving short-term capital from money markets to keep up with running commitments because skeptical banks are hardly lending to each other .
the state 's guarantee for private savings does not solve either of these problems .
it is a preventative relaxant for the possibility that additional institutions take a tumble .
to deal with the actual problem , politicians are now talking about a " national protective umbrella . "
there is a possibility that individual governments will put together bail-out packages which , like the united states , buy rotten debts from banks .
politicians in at an emergency summit in paris could n't agree non a billion-euro package for a european solution , and by the end of the meeting the leaders denied even having the idea of creating one .
they did , however , agree to coordinate their actions better in the future , though it will still be up to each country to decide on the best way to protect its banks .
but the example of state guarantees for private deposits shows that there wo n't be any national answers to this financial crisis .
chancellor angela merkel criticized the irish government for guaranteeing private deposits , and then , a few days later , does the same thing .
the more countries offer such guarantees , the greater the pressure will be on the remaining governments to do the same . otherwise their banks will risk losing customers - and capital - to other european countries .
the end result will be a european solution - even if it 's not one member states agreed to after a set of negotiations .
officially , financial policy is left up to national governments , but the reality has long been a different story .
the same is true for " national protective umbrellas " and other safeguards .
when a country buys its banks bad debts in a big way , other countries are forced to act in the same way .
as europe 's biggest economy , germany has a special role in this regard .

berlin hoped a new 50-billion-euro -lrb- $ 68-billion -rrb- rescue plan for the distressed mortgage lender hypo real estate -lrb- hre -rrb- , a munich-based company that lends to commercial developers and municipalities to build hotels , offices , roads , airports and the like , and a blanket guarantee on private bank accounts would prevent panic from seizing a nation of savers .
finance minister peer steinbrueck said he did not rule out raising state guarantees on hre credit lines and that there was " a plan b in the drawer " to ensure the banking sector did not collapse .
steinbrueck did not provide details but told a press conference : " we are aware that we will not get very far with case-by-case solutions . "
the bank is now to be provided with credit lines worth a total 50 billion euros , of which a little more than half was to be guaranteed by the state .
hre shares were hammered in afternoon trading on the frankfurt stock exchange however , losing 35.15 percent to 4.87 euros .
meanwhile , the government said it would guarantee private bank accounts , estimated to be worth 1.6 trillion euros .
economics professor hans-peter burghof of the university of hohenheim told german radio that amount represented " the biggest guarantee in history .
" never has anyone anywhere in the world guaranteed such a sum in two simple sentences , " he said , while noting that in principle the idea of giving guarantees was to ensure they would not be needed .
merkel pledges to protect financial system bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel tried to instill calm in investors and savers chancellor angela merkel told reporters on sunday that the government " will not allow an institution 's crisis to become a crisis for the entire system . "
" we are saying to women and men savers that their deposits are safe .
the federal government promises that , " merkel said .
questions about the german government assurance of an estimated 1 trillion euros -lrb- $ 1.4 trillion -rrb- of personal savings at german banks meanwhile were being raised on monday .
neighbouring nations came under pressure to follow germany 's lead .
berlin described the assurance to savers , issued by chancellor merkel in two sentences in front of television cameras on sunday , as " able to be relied on . "
berlin has not announced any legislation on a deposit-insurance scheme beyond existing bank-industry guarantees .
officials said they were still talking to banks on how to shape the guarantee .
merkel 's spokesman ulrich wilhelm said in berlin , " it 's a political statement that can be relied on and is decisive . "
the german government and its capabilities stood behind this assurance , he added .
jonathan todd , spokesman for european competition commissioner neelie kroes , said : " we were informed by the german authorities of their intentions .
" the commission notes that the measures seem to be limited to retail bank deposits , and so less liable to give rise to distortions of competition . "
todd added , " in general , retail deposit guarantee schemes for savers can be an appropriate policy response to fears regarding the stability of the banking system . "
the crisis reached germany with the stumble by hre and the embarrassment which followed a 35-billion-euro bail-out a week ago which proved inadequate .
global insight senior economist timo klein told reporters : " since they were unable to correct themselves , financial markets looked to the german government -lrb- for help -rrb- .
the dax is now looking for a general plan for the banks , maybe as early as wednesday . "
brussels sees no problem with german plan bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the commission is keeping an eye on developments in brussels , the european commission said the german decision regarding private accounts appeared to conform to eu competition rules and did not pose the same problems as a similar announcement by ireland .
" the commission notes that the measures seem to be limited to retail bank deposits , so -lrb- it is -rrb- less liable to give rise to distortion of competition , " said commission spokesman todd .
in britain , prime minister gordon brown 's spokesman said london understood that berlin did not plan to pass legislation on the guarantees and added : " we have been in the process of seeking clarification from germany as to what they have committed themselves to . "
an initial guarantee issued by the irish government to banks has drawn criticism from several european union countries which feared it could distort competition by making irish bank accounts more attractive to eu savers .
hre management under fire bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the hre has tottered on the verge of collapse for days meanwhile , as germany sought to calm the public with a " decisive " pledge about savings , property lender hre was under further pressure from other banks and berlin to sack its chief executive .
german finance minister peer steinbrueck said it was " unthinkable " to keep dealing with the same hre top management .
he charged that hre , at the same time as seeking state aid , had used lawyers against the government so as to " escape its responsibilities . "
in monday trading , hre stock declined as much as 40 percent from friday 's close as investors worried that the new bail-out might also prove inadequate .
in brussels , the eu commission 's todd , said , " as soon as the details are notified to us we will assess very quickly whether the new measures are compatible with -lrb- the eu 's -rrb- state aid rules . "
a newspaper , die welt , was to appear tuesday with a report that hre was blaming its plunge from grace on a downgrading by ratings agencies that allowed creditors to call up loans .
berlin has refused demands by the banking industry to nationalize hre , a lender seen in germany as too important to let fail .
steinbrueck said financial securities that have been disdained in the past by central banks would be used as security for much of the 15-billion-euro expansion of the hre bail-out .
the european central bank -lrb- ecb -rrb- had agreed to this , he said .
" nobody can forecast just yet how much this paper is actually worth , " he added .
the government and banking-industry guarantee that backstops the new bail-out remains limited to 35 billion euros , as announced one week ago . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de finance -pipe- 06.10.2008 europe follows germany 's financial guarantee plan großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany wants to shore up confidence of savers and investors after germany ’ s surprise decision to protect all personal bank deposits , britain and other european countries could follow suit .
yet investors remained skittish about europe 's financial future . calls for a common european approach to the banking crisis continued on monday as both the european and asian stock markets were down sharply in early trading .
up until this weekend , germany had stoically opposed issuing a blanket guarantee on all bank deposits despite other countries moving to do so .
yet with confidence deeply shaken after a first bailout for hypo real estate fell through , the german government abruptly changed course on sunday .
in an attempt to prevent a run on banks , germany announced it will guarantee all personal bank deposits in the country .
“ we tell all savings account holders that your deposits are safe .
the federal government assures it , ” german chancellor angela merkel said after an emergency government meeting in a bid to prevent a panic run on banks .
now britain is reportedly under pressure to change its stance .
britain had criticized recent decisions by ireland and greece to guarantee savings accounts , worrying that the moves could shift money away from british banks .
germany leads , others follow bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : fortis is getting help from a french bank british finance minister alistair darling is expected to address the issue in a speech to lawmakers on monday .
britain has already promised to increase the level of private savings guaranteed by the government to 50,000 pounds -lrb- $ 88,000 -rrb- per person .
the government has hesitated to go any higher than that due to the potential costs involved .
darling is reportedly considering using public funds to take stakes in banks .
the plan is a middle course between nationalizing banks and handing out further loans .
" germany is europe 's economic superpower , " said nick clegg , leader of the liberal democrats , britain 's third-largest party .
" where it leads , others are bound to follow . ”
clegg said a common european approach to deposit guarantees is necessary .
denmark on sunday announced the country 's banks had agreed to contribute 35 billion kronor -lrb- 4.8 billion euros -rrb- to help ailing banks and guarantee deposits .
italy wanted an even more united response , calling for an overarching european bailout plan .
investors remain skittish bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : eu leaders are grappling with how to best handle the banking crisis investors seemed spooked at signs of escalating problems in europe 's banking sector .
frankfurt 's stock market fell sharply on monday , with stocks down 3.29 percent at the opening .
asian stocks also dropped , with tokyo at a four-year low .
frankfurt 's blue chip dax slumped 4.54 per cent to 5,533.57 , its lowest level since july 2006 .
besides the german rescue of hypo , there were more signs over the weekend that european governments were scrambling to rescue struggling banks .
french bank bnp paribas agreed on sunday to take control of ailing finance group fortis 's operations in belgium and luxembourg through a share issue , saying the operation valued the company at 14.7 billion euros .
the belgian and luxembourg governments had partially nationalized the bank a week ago , but after the dutch government took over full control of fortis ' operations in the netherlands , they began looking for a suitor .
on saturday , leaders of britain , france , germany and italy said they would protect fragile banks , but would not copy the blanket $ 700 billion bailout agreed in the us last week .
eu finance ministers will try to put together plans on monday and tuesday for restoring confidence in the banking system .
germany looks to restore confidence germany had previously guaranteed 20,000 euros -lrb- $ 28,400 -rrb- savings per person .
finance ministry spokesman torsten albig told the business daily handelsblatt that the estimated value of the guaranteed all accounts would total 568 billion euros .
handelsblatt said the state was the only " fire brigade " that could come to the rescue in the face of a crisis of this size .
" this means the government and the banks will have to bite the bullet , " it said .
" this is an important signal intended to bring a calming , instead of reactions that are disproportionate and make crisis resolution and crisis prevention more difficult , " finance minister peer steinbrueck said . dw staff -lrb- th -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

yet investors remained skittish about europe 's financial future . calls for a common european approach to the banking crisis continued on monday as both the european and asian stock markets were down sharply in early trading .
up until this weekend , germany had stoically opposed issuing a blanket guarantee on all bank deposits despite other countries moving to do so .
yet with confidence deeply shaken after a first bailout for hypo real estate fell through , the german government abruptly changed course on sunday .
in an attempt to prevent a run on banks , germany announced it will guarantee all personal bank deposits in the country .
“ we tell all savings account holders that your deposits are safe .
the federal government assures it , ” german chancellor angela merkel said after an emergency government meeting in a bid to prevent a panic run on banks .
now britain is reportedly under pressure to change its stance .
britain had criticized recent decisions by ireland and greece to guarantee savings accounts , worrying that the moves could shift money away from british banks .
germany leads , others follow bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : fortis is getting help from a french bank british finance minister alistair darling is expected to address the issue in a speech to lawmakers on monday .
britain has already promised to increase the level of private savings guaranteed by the government to 50,000 pounds -lrb- $ 88,000 -rrb- per person .
the government has hesitated to go any higher than that due to the potential costs involved .
darling is reportedly considering using public funds to take stakes in banks .
the plan is a middle course between nationalizing banks and handing out further loans .
" germany is europe 's economic superpower , " said nick clegg , leader of the liberal democrats , britain 's third-largest party .
" where it leads , others are bound to follow . ”
clegg said a common european approach to deposit guarantees is necessary .
denmark on sunday announced the country 's banks had agreed to contribute 35 billion kronor -lrb- 4.8 billion euros -rrb- to help ailing banks and guarantee deposits .
italy wanted an even more united response , calling for an overarching european bailout plan .
investors remain skittish bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : eu leaders are grappling with how to best handle the banking crisis investors seemed spooked at signs of escalating problems in europe 's banking sector .
frankfurt 's stock market fell sharply on monday , with stocks down 3.29 percent at the opening .
asian stocks also dropped , with tokyo at a four-year low .
frankfurt 's blue chip dax slumped 4.54 per cent to 5,533.57 , its lowest level since july 2006 .
besides the german rescue of hypo , there were more signs over the weekend that european governments were scrambling to rescue struggling banks .
french bank bnp paribas agreed on sunday to take control of ailing finance group fortis 's operations in belgium and luxembourg through a share issue , saying the operation valued the company at 14.7 billion euros .
the belgian and luxembourg governments had partially nationalized the bank a week ago , but after the dutch government took over full control of fortis ' operations in the netherlands , they began looking for a suitor .
on saturday , leaders of britain , france , germany and italy said they would protect fragile banks , but would not copy the blanket $ 700 billion bailout agreed in the us last week .
eu finance ministers will try to put together plans on monday and tuesday for restoring confidence in the banking system .
germany looks to restore confidence germany had previously guaranteed 20,000 euros -lrb- $ 28,400 -rrb- savings per person .
finance ministry spokesman torsten albig told the business daily handelsblatt that the estimated value of the guaranteed all accounts would total 568 billion euros .
handelsblatt said the state was the only " fire brigade " that could come to the rescue in the face of a crisis of this size .
" this means the government and the banks will have to bite the bullet , " it said .
" this is an important signal intended to bring a calming , instead of reactions that are disproportionate and make crisis resolution and crisis prevention more difficult , " finance minister peer steinbrueck said . dw staff -lrb- th -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

smaller teams are now losing their respect for the champions , who are only 11th in the table after two wins in seven matches , beckenbauer wrote in his column for bild newspaper on monday .
" the mythos that in the end bayern -lrb- almost -rrb- always win has taken a break ... the league senses that we are vulnerable , " he said .
team needs to work it out bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : another one of those days bayern followed up two successive league defeats by with a 3-3 draw at home saturday by bochum who scored two late goals to earn a point .
there were jeers from bayern fans .
coach juergen klinsmann said the performance was unacceptable .
beckenbauer said the team gave bochum far too much room to play .
he also hoped goalkeeper michael rensing would soon radiate the same assurance between the posts as the now retired oliver kahn .
" bayern will only be able to recapture the mythos with hard work , " he said .
can they shape up ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : klinsmann still has the dressing room on side " i keep my fingers crossed for juergen klinsmann .
it may be the case that he upset many fans with radical changes .
the criticism from the stands and the media is something he will have to tolerate . "
however beckenbauer said the bayern board would need to be remain calm , and that the relationship between klinsmann and the team was " intact . "
" that was not for example the case in the end with felix magath -lrb- dismissed in early 2007 before ottmar hitzfeld took charge -rrb- .
with klinsmann i see no rift .
he needs time for his ideas to take effect .
" we have to have patience and analyze in the winter break what needs to be done . "
coach sees reasons for optimism bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : do they need to play harder ?
klinsmann said sunday he was determined to correct the mistakes and get bayern moving back up the league table .
" we understand the fans ' dismay and disappointment .
they have every right to voice it , " he told the bayern munich internet television channel fcb.tv.
" seven games into the bundesliga season , what bayern have achieved is not acceptable , and i wo n't accept it either . "
however the coach said he was still optimistic for the season .
" we can still hit all our targets .
we 're through in the dfb cup , we 're top of our champions league group , and in the bundesliga , we fortunately have enough games to put things right step by step - although we obviously need more determination , and the players have to start living up to expectations .

that 's the message german politicians gave private depositors .
the government guaranteed savings in german accounts .
according to the finance ministry , the federal government is vouching for " more than 1 trillion euros . "
but even such a guarantee would n't be worth a cent if everyone ran to the bank for their money - not even the government could pay such a huge sum of money .
the core of the guarantee serves a psychological purpose : despite all the talk about the financial crisis ' dimensions , citizens should n't get any more worried than they already are .
by giving a guarantee , the state is hoping to avoid a situation where it would have to pay anything back .
but there 's a different problem : no german bank has yet faced difficulties in this crisis due to private customers wanting their money back .
even at britain 's northern rock , customers did n't start demanding their money back until the bank was already deep in the crisis .
there are two reasons for the difficulties banks are facing .
either they have too many financial products based on junk us mortgages that needed to be written off on their books or they have n't been successful in receiving short-term capital from money markets to keep up with running commitments because skeptical banks are hardly lending to each other .
the state 's guarantee for private savings does not solve either of these problems .
it is a preventative relaxant for the possibility that additional institutions take a tumble .
to deal with the actual problem , politicians are now talking about a " national protective umbrella . "
there is a possibility that individual governments will put together bail-out packages which , like the united states , buy rotten debts from banks .
politicians in at an emergency summit in paris could n't agree non a billion-euro package for a european solution , and by the end of the meeting the leaders denied even having the idea of creating one .
they did , however , agree to coordinate their actions better in the future , though it will still be up to each country to decide on the best way to protect its banks .
but the example of state guarantees for private deposits shows that there wo n't be any national answers to this financial crisis .
chancellor angela merkel criticized the irish government for guaranteeing private deposits , and then , a few days later , does the same thing .
the more countries offer such guarantees , the greater the pressure will be on the remaining governments to do the same . otherwise their banks will risk losing customers - and capital - to other european countries .
the end result will be a european solution - even if it 's not one member states agreed to after a set of negotiations .
officially , financial policy is left up to national governments , but the reality has long been a different story .
the same is true for " national protective umbrellas " and other safeguards .
when a country buys its banks bad debts in a big way , other countries are forced to act in the same way .
as europe 's biggest economy , germany has a special role in this regard .

berlin hoped a new 50-billion-euro -lrb- $ 68-billion -rrb- rescue plan for the distressed mortgage lender hypo real estate -lrb- hre -rrb- , a munich-based company that lends to commercial developers and municipalities to build hotels , offices , roads , airports and the like , and a blanket guarantee on private bank accounts would prevent panic from seizing a nation of savers .
finance minister peer steinbrueck said he did not rule out raising state guarantees on hre credit lines and that there was " a plan b in the drawer " to ensure the banking sector did not collapse .
steinbrueck did not provide details but told a press conference : " we are aware that we will not get very far with case-by-case solutions . "
the bank is now to be provided with credit lines worth a total 50 billion euros , of which a little more than half was to be guaranteed by the state .
hre shares were hammered in afternoon trading on the frankfurt stock exchange however , losing 35.15 percent to 4.87 euros .
meanwhile , the government said it would guarantee private bank accounts , estimated to be worth 1.6 trillion euros .
economics professor hans-peter burghof of the university of hohenheim told german radio that amount represented " the biggest guarantee in history .
" never has anyone anywhere in the world guaranteed such a sum in two simple sentences , " he said , while noting that in principle the idea of giving guarantees was to ensure they would not be needed .
merkel pledges to protect financial system bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel tried to instill calm in investors and savers chancellor angela merkel told reporters on sunday that the government " will not allow an institution 's crisis to become a crisis for the entire system . "
" we are saying to women and men savers that their deposits are safe .
the federal government promises that , " merkel said .
questions about the german government assurance of an estimated 1 trillion euros -lrb- $ 1.4 trillion -rrb- of personal savings at german banks meanwhile were being raised on monday .
neighbouring nations came under pressure to follow germany 's lead .
berlin described the assurance to savers , issued by chancellor merkel in two sentences in front of television cameras on sunday , as " able to be relied on . "
berlin has not announced any legislation on a deposit-insurance scheme beyond existing bank-industry guarantees .
officials said they were still talking to banks on how to shape the guarantee .
merkel 's spokesman ulrich wilhelm said in berlin , " it 's a political statement that can be relied on and is decisive . "
the german government and its capabilities stood behind this assurance , he added .
jonathan todd , spokesman for european competition commissioner neelie kroes , said : " we were informed by the german authorities of their intentions .

todd added , " in general , retail deposit guarantee schemes for savers can be an appropriate policy response to fears regarding the stability of the banking system . "
the crisis reached germany with the stumble by hre and the embarrassment which followed a 35-billion-euro bail-out a week ago which proved inadequate .

" the commission notes that the measures seem to be limited to retail bank deposits , so -lrb- it is -rrb- less liable to give rise to distortion of competition , " said commission spokesman todd .
in britain , prime minister gordon brown 's spokesman said london understood that berlin did not plan to pass legislation on the guarantees and added : " we have been in the process of seeking clarification from germany as to what they have committed themselves to . "
an initial guarantee issued by the irish government to banks has drawn criticism from several european union countries which feared it could distort competition by making irish bank accounts more attractive to eu savers .

german finance minister peer steinbrueck said it was " unthinkable " to keep dealing with the same hre top management .
he charged that hre , at the same time as seeking state aid , had used lawyers against the government so as to " escape its responsibilities . "

in brussels , the eu commission 's todd , said , " as soon as the details are notified to us we will assess very quickly whether the new measures are compatible with -lrb- the eu 's -rrb- state aid rules . "
a newspaper , die welt , was to appear tuesday with a report that hre was blaming its plunge from grace on a downgrading by ratings agencies that allowed creditors to call up loans .
berlin has refused demands by the banking industry to nationalize hre , a lender seen in germany as too important to let fail .
steinbrueck said financial securities that have been disdained in the past by central banks would be used as security for much of the 15-billion-euro expansion of the hre bail-out .

berlin hoped a new 50-billion-euro -lrb- $ 68-billion -rrb- rescue plan for the distressed mortgage lender hypo real estate -lrb- hre -rrb- , a munich-based company that lends to commercial developers and municipalities to build hotels , offices , roads , airports and the like , and a blanket guarantee on private bank accounts would prevent panic from seizing a nation of savers .
finance minister peer steinbrueck said he did not rule out raising state guarantees on hre credit lines and that there was " a plan b in the drawer " to ensure the banking sector did not collapse .
steinbrueck did not provide details but told a press conference : " we are aware that we will not get very far with case-by-case solutions . "
the bank is now to be provided with credit lines worth a total 50 billion euros , of which a little more than half was to be guaranteed by the state .
hre shares were hammered in afternoon trading on the frankfurt stock exchange however , losing 35.15 percent to 4.87 euros .
meanwhile , the government said it would guarantee private bank accounts , estimated to be worth 1.6 trillion euros .
economics professor hans-peter burghof of the university of hohenheim told german radio that amount represented " the biggest guarantee in history .
" never has anyone anywhere in the world guaranteed such a sum in two simple sentences , " he said , while noting that in principle the idea of giving guarantees was to ensure they would not be needed .
merkel pledges to protect financial system bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel tried to instill calm in investors and savers chancellor angela merkel told reporters on sunday that the government " will not allow an institution 's crisis to become a crisis for the entire system . "
" we are saying to women and men savers that their deposits are safe .
the federal government promises that , " merkel said .
questions about the german government assurance of an estimated 1 trillion euros -lrb- $ 1.4 trillion -rrb- of personal savings at german banks meanwhile were being raised on monday .
neighbouring nations came under pressure to follow germany 's lead .
berlin described the assurance to savers , issued by chancellor merkel in two sentences in front of television cameras on sunday , as " able to be relied on . "
berlin has not announced any legislation on a deposit-insurance scheme beyond existing bank-industry guarantees .
officials said they were still talking to banks on how to shape the guarantee .
merkel 's spokesman ulrich wilhelm said in berlin , " it 's a political statement that can be relied on and is decisive . "
the german government and its capabilities stood behind this assurance , he added .
jonathan todd , spokesman for european competition commissioner neelie kroes , said : " we were informed by the german authorities of their intentions .
" the commission notes that the measures seem to be limited to retail bank deposits , and so less liable to give rise to distortions of competition . "
todd added , " in general , retail deposit guarantee schemes for savers can be an appropriate policy response to fears regarding the stability of the banking system . "

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de finance -pipe- 06.10.2008 europe follows germany 's financial guarantee plan großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany wants to shore up confidence of savers and investors after germany ’ s surprise decision to protect all personal bank deposits , britain and other european countries could follow suit .
yet investors remained skittish about europe 's financial future . calls for a common european approach to the banking crisis continued on monday as both the european and asian stock markets were down sharply in early trading .
up until this weekend , germany had stoically opposed issuing a blanket guarantee on all bank deposits despite other countries moving to do so .
yet with confidence deeply shaken after a first bailout for hypo real estate fell through , the german government abruptly changed course on sunday .
in an attempt to prevent a run on banks , germany announced it will guarantee all personal bank deposits in the country .
“ we tell all savings account holders that your deposits are safe .
the federal government assures it , ” german chancellor angela merkel said after an emergency government meeting in a bid to prevent a panic run on banks .
now britain is reportedly under pressure to change its stance .
britain had criticized recent decisions by ireland and greece to guarantee savings accounts , worrying that the moves could shift money away from british banks .
germany leads , others follow bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : fortis is getting help from a french bank british finance minister alistair darling is expected to address the issue in a speech to lawmakers on monday .
britain has already promised to increase the level of private savings guaranteed by the government to 50,000 pounds -lrb- $ 88,000 -rrb- per person .
the government has hesitated to go any higher than that due to the potential costs involved .
darling is reportedly considering using public funds to take stakes in banks .
the plan is a middle course between nationalizing banks and handing out further loans .
" germany is europe 's economic superpower , " said nick clegg , leader of the liberal democrats , britain 's third-largest party .
" where it leads , others are bound to follow . ”
clegg said a common european approach to deposit guarantees is necessary .
denmark on sunday announced the country 's banks had agreed to contribute 35 billion kronor -lrb- 4.8 billion euros -rrb- to help ailing banks and guarantee deposits .
italy wanted an even more united response , calling for an overarching european bailout plan .
investors remain skittish bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : eu leaders are grappling with how to best handle the banking crisis investors seemed spooked at signs of escalating problems in europe 's banking sector .
frankfurt 's stock market fell sharply on monday , with stocks down 3.29 percent at the opening .
asian stocks also dropped , with tokyo at a four-year low .
frankfurt 's blue chip dax slumped 4.54 per cent to 5,533.57 , its lowest level since july 2006 .
besides the german rescue of hypo , there were more signs over the weekend that european governments were scrambling to rescue struggling banks .
french bank bnp paribas agreed on sunday to take control of ailing finance group fortis 's operations in belgium and luxembourg through a share issue , saying the operation valued the company at 14.7 billion euros .
the belgian and luxembourg governments had partially nationalized the bank a week ago , but after the dutch government took over full control of fortis ' operations in the netherlands , they began looking for a suitor .
on saturday , leaders of britain , france , germany and italy said they would protect fragile banks , but would not copy the blanket $ 700 billion bailout agreed in the us last week .
eu finance ministers will try to put together plans on monday and tuesday for restoring confidence in the banking system .
germany looks to restore confidence germany had previously guaranteed 20,000 euros -lrb- $ 28,400 -rrb- savings per person .
finance ministry spokesman torsten albig told the business daily handelsblatt that the estimated value of the guaranteed all accounts would total 568 billion euros .
handelsblatt said the state was the only " fire brigade " that could come to the rescue in the face of a crisis of this size .
" this means the government and the banks will have to bite the bullet , " it said .
" this is an important signal intended to bring a calming , instead of reactions that are disproportionate and make crisis resolution and crisis prevention more difficult , " finance minister peer steinbrueck said . dw staff -lrb- th -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

6 , three days after a pkk attack on a border post killed 15 turkish soldiers . according to a statement released by the turkish general staff , the warplanes bombed pkk positions in the mountainous avasin region of northern iraq .
" the planes returned safely to base after successfully completing their mission , " the statement said .
turkish jets also attacked positions in the same area on sunday night .
the attack on friday night on the aktutun border post in the south-eastern province of hakkari that left 15 soldiers and 23 pkk separatists dead has shocked turkey and led to the general staff on sunday announcing that it was to relocate five military border posts .
a spokesman for the military said the administration of the kurdish autonomous area in iraq had not helped in the fight against the pkk , despite overtures by iraq 's kurdish president jalal talabani .
after the attack talabani called his turkish counterpart abdullah gul to propose a meeting of high-ranking security experts from both sides , suggesting iraqi willingness to help turkey de-escalate the situation .
the turkish air force has conducted a number of airstrikes against pkk targets in northern iraq since a week-long cross-border incursion into northern iraq was launched in february .
ankara blames the separatist group for the deaths of more than 35,000 people since the early 1980s when the pkk began its fight for independence or autonomy for the mainly kurdish-populated south-east of turkey .
turkish dead laid to rest as tensions heighten bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : angry crowds protested the deaths of turkish soldiers the 15 turkish soldiers killed in saturday 's attack on an iraq border post were borne to their graves on sunday by a crowd of thousands shouting angry slogans against the perpetrators - the outlawed kurdish workers party , or pkk .
the attack , which claimed 38 lives in total , was launched by the guerrilla group , which operates from inside iraq , after a week of turkish air force raids on their positions .
turkish government and military leaders have vowed to escalate the campaign against the pkk .
" we will now conduct our campaign against terrorism even more decisively , " said turkish prime minister recep tayyip erdogan , after he broke off his journey to central asia in response to the attack .
but turkey can not win the war against the pkk by military force alone .
one day before the aktutun border post attack , the worst pkk assault this year , the turkish air force had bombarded suspected pkk positions in the qandil mountains of iraq , close to the iranian border .
large pkk operation targets border post bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : kurdish troops hit the turkish post on the iraq border at the same time , the attack on the troops stationed at aktutun was about to be launched , although they did n't know it .
according to turkish media reports , more than 300 pkk fighters assembled for the raid on the border post .
at daybreak on saturday they opened fire with heavy weapons from iraq as other fighters moved in on the ground .
the battle at aktutun lasted for five hours .
it was the fifth attack on the post since 1992 .
turkey hit back with combat helicopters and special forces .
after the attack , iraqi president jalal talabani , himself a kurd , called his turkish counterpart abdullah gul to propose a meeting of high-ranking security experts from both sides , suggesting iraqi willingness to help turkey de-escalate the situation .
however , turkish daily millyet commented on sunday that " long- range weapons can not be brought into position without those responsible for security in iraq noticing . "
also under question is the value of us support in informing turkey of pkk movements within iraq .
the turkish parliament is due to vote monday on whether to allow the army to extend its mandate for operations in northern iraq for a further year .
the approval of the mandate was not in doubt even before saturday 's attack , as evidently turkey 's operations in northern iraq had not brought the pkk to its knees .
in february , turkey launched a ground offensive in iraq , although us criticism brought it to a rapid end .
us defense secretary robert gates has suggested the military struggle against the pkk be conducted together with economic and political means .
" only this way can terrorism be stopped , " he said .

6 . such measures would include the injection of liquidity by european central banks , bail-outs for troubled banks and guarantees for deposits , the joint statement said .
noting that no european depositor had lost their savings so far , the eu leaders called for " coordination and close cooperation " in dealing with the effects of the global credit crunch .
the unprecedented statement came as european stock markets tumbled and as finance ministers from the 15 eu countries that share the euro were holding talks in luxembourg on ways to deal with the continent 's exploding financial crisis .
member states have hitherto reacted individually to events in their own countries , but the urgency of the crisis has sparked a rising chorus of calls for coordinated action .
" i think it 's extremely important that european countries use similar principles in how they treat banks in problems -lrb- sic -rrb- , for example , how they intervene , what time they intervene , what policy measures they are prepared to apply , " dutch finance minister wouter bos said ahead of the meeting in luxembourg .
europe works towards a common approach bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : almunia was confident of a eu coordinated action officials from the eu 's executive echoed that call , with eu economic and monetary affairs commissioner joaquin almunia saying : " we should have a common approach , coordinated action , to avoid unilateral decisions that create negative spillovers . "
but the decision by the german government on sunday to offer a blanket savings guarantee to private depositors has piled the pressure on other eu member states to follow suit .
austria , for instance , raised its guarantees on savings deposits late sunday , just hours after the german plan was announced .
sweden and denmark raised their guarantees on monday morning .
while insisting that austrian banks were sound , austrian finance minister wilhelm molterer said the government had taken the decision " to avoid a competitive disadvantage with germany , so that savings deposits do not flow off to germany . "
german plan up for discussion bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel 's government has pledged to protect investors german officials appeared under pressure to explain their actions after earlier criticizing an irish guarantee , with bos saying that the german plan " is one of the issues on the table here . "
but german deputy finance minister joerg asmussen stressed that " germany 's approach is fundamentally different from the irish one .
they set up a rescue shield which basically discriminates in the internal market , while germany 's approach is aimed at making sure that no depositor loses a single euro . "
about a third of the 15 eu countries that share the common currency have already moved to safeguard bank deposits in some way or other - among them germany , austria , greece , ireland and belgium .
but after a meeting of the leaders of the eu 's four biggest economies in paris on saturday , proposals for setting up an eu-wide rescue fund appeared to have been taken off the table .
" i do n't think there 's going to be anything near consensus about a european fund .
i hope there is going to be a consensus about a common approach , on principles that should be applied whenever we want to intervene or whenever we want to help banks in problems -lrb- sic -rrb- , " bos said . dpa news agency send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

6 , three days after a pkk attack on a border post killed 15 turkish soldiers . according to a statement released by the turkish general staff , the warplanes bombed pkk positions in the mountainous avasin region of northern iraq .
" the planes returned safely to base after successfully completing their mission , " the statement said .
turkish jets also attacked positions in the same area on sunday night .
the attack on friday night on the aktutun border post in the south-eastern province of hakkari that left 15 soldiers and 23 pkk separatists dead has shocked turkey and led to the general staff on sunday announcing that it was to relocate five military border posts .
a spokesman for the military said the administration of the kurdish autonomous area in iraq had not helped in the fight against the pkk , despite overtures by iraq 's kurdish president jalal talabani .
after the attack talabani called his turkish counterpart abdullah gul to propose a meeting of high-ranking security experts from both sides , suggesting iraqi willingness to help turkey de-escalate the situation .
the turkish air force has conducted a number of airstrikes against pkk targets in northern iraq since a week-long cross-border incursion into northern iraq was launched in february .
ankara blames the separatist group for the deaths of more than 35,000 people since the early 1980s when the pkk began its fight for independence or autonomy for the mainly kurdish-populated south-east of turkey .
turkish dead laid to rest as tensions heighten bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : angry crowds protested the deaths of turkish soldiers the 15 turkish soldiers killed in saturday 's attack on an iraq border post were borne to their graves on sunday by a crowd of thousands shouting angry slogans against the perpetrators - the outlawed kurdish workers party , or pkk .
the attack , which claimed 38 lives in total , was launched by the guerrilla group , which operates from inside iraq , after a week of turkish air force raids on their positions .
turkish government and military leaders have vowed to escalate the campaign against the pkk .
" we will now conduct our campaign against terrorism even more decisively , " said turkish prime minister recep tayyip erdogan , after he broke off his journey to central asia in response to the attack .
but turkey can not win the war against the pkk by military force alone .
one day before the aktutun border post attack , the worst pkk assault this year , the turkish air force had bombarded suspected pkk positions in the qandil mountains of iraq , close to the iranian border .
large pkk operation targets border post bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : kurdish troops hit the turkish post on the iraq border at the same time , the attack on the troops stationed at aktutun was about to be launched , although they did n't know it .
according to turkish media reports , more than 300 pkk fighters assembled for the raid on the border post .
at daybreak on saturday they opened fire with heavy weapons from iraq as other fighters moved in on the ground .
the battle at aktutun lasted for five hours .
it was the fifth attack on the post since 1992 .
turkey hit back with combat helicopters and special forces .
after the attack , iraqi president jalal talabani , himself a kurd , called his turkish counterpart abdullah gul to propose a meeting of high-ranking security experts from both sides , suggesting iraqi willingness to help turkey de-escalate the situation .
however , turkish daily millyet commented on sunday that " long- range weapons can not be brought into position without those responsible for security in iraq noticing . "
also under question is the value of us support in informing turkey of pkk movements within iraq .
the turkish parliament is due to vote monday on whether to allow the army to extend its mandate for operations in northern iraq for a further year .
the approval of the mandate was not in doubt even before saturday 's attack , as evidently turkey 's operations in northern iraq had not brought the pkk to its knees .
in february , turkey launched a ground offensive in iraq , although us criticism brought it to a rapid end .
us defense secretary robert gates has suggested the military struggle against the pkk be conducted together with economic and political means .
" only this way can terrorism be stopped , " he said .
the pkk is considered by the united states and the european union to be a terrorist group . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

6 , three days after a pkk attack on a border post killed 15 turkish soldiers . according to a statement released by the turkish general staff , the warplanes bombed pkk positions in the mountainous avasin region of northern iraq .
" the planes returned safely to base after successfully completing their mission , " the statement said .
turkish jets also attacked positions in the same area on sunday night .
the attack on friday night on the aktutun border post in the south-eastern province of hakkari that left 15 soldiers and 23 pkk separatists dead has shocked turkey and led to the general staff on sunday announcing that it was to relocate five military border posts .
a spokesman for the military said the administration of the kurdish autonomous area in iraq had not helped in the fight against the pkk , despite overtures by iraq 's kurdish president jalal talabani .
after the attack talabani called his turkish counterpart abdullah gul to propose a meeting of high-ranking security experts from both sides , suggesting iraqi willingness to help turkey de-escalate the situation .
the turkish air force has conducted a number of airstrikes against pkk targets in northern iraq since a week-long cross-border incursion into northern iraq was launched in february .
ankara blames the separatist group for the deaths of more than 35,000 people since the early 1980s when the pkk began its fight for independence or autonomy for the mainly kurdish-populated south-east of turkey .
turkish dead laid to rest as tensions heighten bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : angry crowds protested the deaths of turkish soldiers the 15 turkish soldiers killed in saturday 's attack on an iraq border post were borne to their graves on sunday by a crowd of thousands shouting angry slogans against the perpetrators - the outlawed kurdish workers party , or pkk .
the attack , which claimed 38 lives in total , was launched by the guerrilla group , which operates from inside iraq , after a week of turkish air force raids on their positions .
turkish government and military leaders have vowed to escalate the campaign against the pkk .
" we will now conduct our campaign against terrorism even more decisively , " said turkish prime minister recep tayyip erdogan , after he broke off his journey to central asia in response to the attack .
but turkey can not win the war against the pkk by military force alone .
one day before the aktutun border post attack , the worst pkk assault this year , the turkish air force had bombarded suspected pkk positions in the qandil mountains of iraq , close to the iranian border .
large pkk operation targets border post bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : kurdish troops hit the turkish post on the iraq border at the same time , the attack on the troops stationed at aktutun was about to be launched , although they did n't know it .
according to turkish media reports , more than 300 pkk fighters assembled for the raid on the border post .
at daybreak on saturday they opened fire with heavy weapons from iraq as other fighters moved in on the ground .
the battle at aktutun lasted for five hours .
it was the fifth attack on the post since 1992 .
turkey hit back with combat helicopters and special forces .
after the attack , iraqi president jalal talabani , himself a kurd , called his turkish counterpart abdullah gul to propose a meeting of high-ranking security experts from both sides , suggesting iraqi willingness to help turkey de-escalate the situation .
however , turkish daily millyet commented on sunday that " long- range weapons can not be brought into position without those responsible for security in iraq noticing . "
also under question is the value of us support in informing turkey of pkk movements within iraq .
the turkish parliament is due to vote monday on whether to allow the army to extend its mandate for operations in northern iraq for a further year .
the approval of the mandate was not in doubt even before saturday 's attack , as evidently turkey 's operations in northern iraq had not brought the pkk to its knees .
in february , turkey launched a ground offensive in iraq , although us criticism brought it to a rapid end .
us defense secretary robert gates has suggested the military struggle against the pkk be conducted together with economic and political means .
" only this way can terrorism be stopped , " he said .
the pkk is considered by the united states and the european union to be a terrorist group . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

that 's the message german politicians gave private depositors .
the government guaranteed savings in german accounts .
according to the finance ministry , the federal government is vouching for " more than 1 trillion euros . "
but even such a guarantee would n't be worth a cent if everyone ran to the bank for their money - not even the government could pay such a huge sum of money .
the core of the guarantee serves a psychological purpose : despite all the talk about the financial crisis ' dimensions , citizens should n't get any more worried than they already are .
by giving a guarantee , the state is hoping to avoid a situation where it would have to pay anything back .
but there 's a different problem : no german bank has yet faced difficulties in this crisis due to private customers wanting their money back .
even at britain 's northern rock , customers did n't start demanding their money back until the bank was already deep in the crisis .
there are two reasons for the difficulties banks are facing .
either they have too many financial products based on junk us mortgages that needed to be written off on their books or they have n't been successful in receiving short-term capital from money markets to keep up with running commitments because skeptical banks are hardly lending to each other .
the state 's guarantee for private savings does not solve either of these problems .
it is a preventative relaxant for the possibility that additional institutions take a tumble .
to deal with the actual problem , politicians are now talking about a " national protective umbrella . "
there is a possibility that individual governments will put together bail-out packages which , like the united states , buy rotten debts from banks .
politicians in at an emergency summit in paris could n't agree non a billion-euro package for a european solution , and by the end of the meeting the leaders denied even having the idea of creating one .
they did , however , agree to coordinate their actions better in the future , though it will still be up to each country to decide on the best way to protect its banks .
but the example of state guarantees for private deposits shows that there wo n't be any national answers to this financial crisis .
chancellor angela merkel criticized the irish government for guaranteeing private deposits , and then , a few days later , does the same thing .
the more countries offer such guarantees , the greater the pressure will be on the remaining governments to do the same . otherwise their banks will risk losing customers - and capital - to other european countries .
the end result will be a european solution - even if it 's not one member states agreed to after a set of negotiations .
officially , financial policy is left up to national governments , but the reality has long been a different story .
the same is true for " national protective umbrellas " and other safeguards .
when a country buys its banks bad debts in a big way , other countries are forced to act in the same way .
as europe 's biggest economy , germany has a special role in this regard .

the leaders of germany 's ruling coalition agreed sunday to push for a constitutional change allowing the military to help out local law enforcement in certain cases .
germany places strict limits on its military given the excesses committed during the nazi era .
yet politicians have argued that the military could fill an important role in the case of a terrorist attack , acting as a backup to police .
german defense minister franz josef jung welcomed the decision to “ protect citizens in germany ” according to his spokesman .
ruling parties find compromise bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some are concerned that the military will be used against protestors germany 's interior minister wolfgang schaeuble had originally called for an even broader use of the military to respond to domestic terrorist threats .
many of these demands were scrapped in reaching the final compromise .
volker kauder , of chancellor angela merkel 's christian democratic union -lrb- cdu -rrb- , emphasized sunday that the military would only be used in extraordinary circumstances .
“ we have finally found a way to deploy the bundeswehr in specific , confined cases , ” kauder said .
peter struck , head of the social democratic party -lrb- spd -rrb- , said he could imagine a scenario where german marines would help the coast guard during an emergency .
worries over abuses of power bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : schaeuble has called for broader use of the miltary domestically left party parliamentarian petra pau criticized the plans , saying that the coalition wanted to officially condone what was already allowed “ through the back door . ”
germany 's koelner stadt-anzeiger newspaper also warned in an editorial in its monday edition that demonstrators and terrorists are often seen as being one in the same by law enforcement .
the newspaper warned against the " militarization of domestic politics . " and called for more " intensive discussion " before the constitutional change goes forward . dw staff -lrb- th -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

berlin hoped a new 50-billion-euro -lrb- $ 68-billion -rrb- rescue plan for the distressed mortgage lender hypo real estate -lrb- hre -rrb- , a munich-based company that lends to commercial developers and municipalities to build hotels , offices , roads , airports and the like , and a blanket guarantee on private bank accounts would prevent panic from seizing a nation of savers .
finance minister peer steinbrueck said he did not rule out raising state guarantees on hre credit lines and that there was " a plan b in the drawer " to ensure the banking sector did not collapse .
steinbrueck did not provide details but told a press conference : " we are aware that we will not get very far with case-by-case solutions . "
the bank is now to be provided with credit lines worth a total 50 billion euros , of which a little more than half was to be guaranteed by the state .
hre shares were hammered in afternoon trading on the frankfurt stock exchange however , losing 35.15 percent to 4.87 euros .
meanwhile , the government said it would guarantee private bank accounts , estimated to be worth 1.6 trillion euros .
economics professor hans-peter burghof of the university of hohenheim told german radio that amount represented " the biggest guarantee in history .
" never has anyone anywhere in the world guaranteed such a sum in two simple sentences , " he said , while noting that in principle the idea of giving guarantees was to ensure they would not be needed .
merkel pledges to protect financial system bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel tried to instill calm in investors and savers chancellor angela merkel told reporters on sunday that the government " will not allow an institution 's crisis to become a crisis for the entire system . "
" we are saying to women and men savers that their deposits are safe .
the federal government promises that , " merkel said .
questions about the german government assurance of an estimated 1 trillion euros -lrb- $ 1.4 trillion -rrb- of personal savings at german banks meanwhile were being raised on monday .
neighbouring nations came under pressure to follow germany 's lead .
berlin described the assurance to savers , issued by chancellor merkel in two sentences in front of television cameras on sunday , as " able to be relied on . "
berlin has not announced any legislation on a deposit-insurance scheme beyond existing bank-industry guarantees .
officials said they were still talking to banks on how to shape the guarantee .
merkel 's spokesman ulrich wilhelm said in berlin , " it 's a political statement that can be relied on and is decisive . "
the german government and its capabilities stood behind this assurance , he added .
jonathan todd , spokesman for european competition commissioner neelie kroes , said : " we were informed by the german authorities of their intentions .
" the commission notes that the measures seem to be limited to retail bank deposits , and so less liable to give rise to distortions of competition . "
todd added , " in general , retail deposit guarantee schemes for savers can be an appropriate policy response to fears regarding the stability of the banking system . "
the crisis reached germany with the stumble by hre and the embarrassment which followed a 35-billion-euro bail-out a week ago which proved inadequate .
global insight senior economist timo klein told reporters : " since they were unable to correct themselves , financial markets looked to the german government -lrb- for help -rrb- .
the dax is now looking for a general plan for the banks , maybe as early as wednesday . "
brussels sees no problem with german plan bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the commission is keeping an eye on developments in brussels , the european commission said the german decision regarding private accounts appeared to conform to eu competition rules and did not pose the same problems as a similar announcement by ireland .
" the commission notes that the measures seem to be limited to retail bank deposits , so -lrb- it is -rrb- less liable to give rise to distortion of competition , " said commission spokesman todd .
in britain , prime minister gordon brown 's spokesman said london understood that berlin did not plan to pass legislation on the guarantees and added : " we have been in the process of seeking clarification from germany as to what they have committed themselves to . "
an initial guarantee issued by the irish government to banks has drawn criticism from several european union countries which feared it could distort competition by making irish bank accounts more attractive to eu savers .
hre management under fire bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the hre has tottered on the verge of collapse for days meanwhile , as germany sought to calm the public with a " decisive " pledge about savings , property lender hre was under further pressure from other banks and berlin to sack its chief executive .
german finance minister peer steinbrueck said it was " unthinkable " to keep dealing with the same hre top management .
he charged that hre , at the same time as seeking state aid , had used lawyers against the government so as to " escape its responsibilities . "
in monday trading , hre stock declined as much as 40 percent from friday 's close as investors worried that the new bail-out might also prove inadequate .
in brussels , the eu commission 's todd , said , " as soon as the details are notified to us we will assess very quickly whether the new measures are compatible with -lrb- the eu 's -rrb- state aid rules . "
a newspaper , die welt , was to appear tuesday with a report that hre was blaming its plunge from grace on a downgrading by ratings agencies that allowed creditors to call up loans .
berlin has refused demands by the banking industry to nationalize hre , a lender seen in germany as too important to let fail .
steinbrueck said financial securities that have been disdained in the past by central banks would be used as security for much of the 15-billion-euro expansion of the hre bail-out .
the european central bank -lrb- ecb -rrb- had agreed to this , he said .
" nobody can forecast just yet how much this paper is actually worth , " he added .

merkel 's spokesman ulrich wilhelm said in berlin , " it 's a political statement that can be relied on and is decisive . "
the german government and its capabilities stood behind this assurance , he added .
jonathan todd , spokesman for european competition commissioner neelie kroes , said : " we were informed by the german authorities of their intentions .
" the commission notes that the measures seem to be limited to retail bank deposits , and so less liable to give rise to distortions of competition . "
todd added , " in general , retail deposit guarantee schemes for savers can be an appropriate policy response to fears regarding the stability of the banking system . "
the crisis reached germany with the stumble by hre and the embarrassment which followed a 35-billion-euro bail-out a week ago which proved inadequate .
global insight senior economist timo klein told reporters : " since they were unable to correct themselves , financial markets looked to the german government -lrb- for help -rrb- .
the dax is now looking for a general plan for the banks , maybe as early as wednesday . "
brussels sees no problem with german plan bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the commission is keeping an eye on developments in brussels , the european commission said the german decision regarding private accounts appeared to conform to eu competition rules and did not pose the same problems as a similar announcement by ireland .
" the commission notes that the measures seem to be limited to retail bank deposits , so -lrb- it is -rrb- less liable to give rise to distortion of competition , " said commission spokesman todd .
in britain , prime minister gordon brown 's spokesman said london understood that berlin did not plan to pass legislation on the guarantees and added : " we have been in the process of seeking clarification from germany as to what they have committed themselves to . "
an initial guarantee issued by the irish government to banks has drawn criticism from several european union countries which feared it could distort competition by making irish bank accounts more attractive to eu savers .
hre management under fire bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the hre has tottered on the verge of collapse for days meanwhile , as germany sought to calm the public with a " decisive " pledge about savings , property lender hre was under further pressure from other banks and berlin to sack its chief executive .
german finance minister peer steinbrueck said it was " unthinkable " to keep dealing with the same hre top management .
he charged that hre , at the same time as seeking state aid , had used lawyers against the government so as to " escape its responsibilities . "
in monday trading , hre stock declined as much as 40 percent from friday 's close as investors worried that the new bail-out might also prove inadequate .
in brussels , the eu commission 's todd , said , " as soon as the details are notified to us we will assess very quickly whether the new measures are compatible with -lrb- the eu 's -rrb- state aid rules . "
a newspaper , die welt , was to appear tuesday with a report that hre was blaming its plunge from grace on a downgrading by ratings agencies that allowed creditors to call up loans .
berlin has refused demands by the banking industry to nationalize hre , a lender seen in germany as too important to let fail .
steinbrueck said financial securities that have been disdained in the past by central banks would be used as security for much of the 15-billion-euro expansion of the hre bail-out .
the european central bank -lrb- ecb -rrb- had agreed to this , he said .
" nobody can forecast just yet how much this paper is actually worth , " he added .

berlin hoped a new 50-billion-euro -lrb- $ 68-billion -rrb- rescue plan for the distressed mortgage lender hypo real estate -lrb- hre -rrb- , a munich-based company that lends to commercial developers and municipalities to build hotels , offices , roads , airports and the like , and a blanket guarantee on private bank accounts would prevent panic from seizing a nation of savers .
finance minister peer steinbrueck said he did not rule out raising state guarantees on hre credit lines and that there was " a plan b in the drawer " to ensure the banking sector did not collapse .
steinbrueck did not provide details but told a press conference : " we are aware that we will not get very far with case-by-case solutions . "
the bank is now to be provided with credit lines worth a total 50 billion euros , of which a little more than half was to be guaranteed by the state .
hre shares were hammered in afternoon trading on the frankfurt stock exchange however , losing 35.15 percent to 4.87 euros .
meanwhile , the government said it would guarantee private bank accounts , estimated to be worth 1.6 trillion euros .
economics professor hans-peter burghof of the university of hohenheim told german radio that amount represented " the biggest guarantee in history .
" never has anyone anywhere in the world guaranteed such a sum in two simple sentences , " he said , while noting that in principle the idea of giving guarantees was to ensure they would not be needed .
merkel pledges to protect financial system bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel tried to instill calm in investors and savers chancellor angela merkel told reporters on sunday that the government " will not allow an institution 's crisis to become a crisis for the entire system . "
" we are saying to women and men savers that their deposits are safe .
the federal government promises that , " merkel said .
questions about the german government assurance of an estimated 1 trillion euros -lrb- $ 1.4 trillion -rrb- of personal savings at german banks meanwhile were being raised on monday .
neighbouring nations came under pressure to follow germany 's lead .
berlin described the assurance to savers , issued by chancellor merkel in two sentences in front of television cameras on sunday , as " able to be relied on . "
berlin has not announced any legislation on a deposit-insurance scheme beyond existing bank-industry guarantees .
officials said they were still talking to banks on how to shape the guarantee .
merkel 's spokesman ulrich wilhelm said in berlin , " it 's a political statement that can be relied on and is decisive . "

noting that no european depositor had lost their savings so far , the eu leaders called for " coordination and close cooperation " in dealing with the effects of the global credit crunch .
the unprecedented statement came as european stock markets tumbled and as finance ministers from the 15 eu countries that share the euro were holding talks in luxembourg on ways to deal with the continent 's exploding financial crisis .
member states have hitherto reacted individually to events in their own countries , but the urgency of the crisis has sparked a rising chorus of calls for coordinated action .
" i think it 's extremely important that european countries use similar principles in how they treat banks in problems -lrb- sic -rrb- , for example , how they intervene , what time they intervene , what policy measures they are prepared to apply , " dutch finance minister wouter bos said ahead of the meeting in luxembourg .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de finance -pipe- 06.10.2008 european leaders commit to tackling financial crisis großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : european leaders said they will take all necessary steps to protect euro zone banks european union leaders will take " all the necessary steps " to ensure the stability of the bloc 's financial system and protect citizens ' savings , an eu statement said monday , oct .
6 . such measures would include the injection of liquidity by european central banks , bail-outs for troubled banks and guarantees for deposits , the joint statement said .
noting that no european depositor had lost their savings so far , the eu leaders called for " coordination and close cooperation " in dealing with the effects of the global credit crunch .
the unprecedented statement came as european stock markets tumbled and as finance ministers from the 15 eu countries that share the euro were holding talks in luxembourg on ways to deal with the continent 's exploding financial crisis .
member states have hitherto reacted individually to events in their own countries , but the urgency of the crisis has sparked a rising chorus of calls for coordinated action .
" i think it 's extremely important that european countries use similar principles in how they treat banks in problems -lrb- sic -rrb- , for example , how they intervene , what time they intervene , what policy measures they are prepared to apply , " dutch finance minister wouter bos said ahead of the meeting in luxembourg .
europe works towards a common approach bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : almunia was confident of a eu coordinated action officials from the eu 's executive echoed that call , with eu economic and monetary affairs commissioner joaquin almunia saying : " we should have a common approach , coordinated action , to avoid unilateral decisions that create negative spillovers . "
but the decision by the german government on sunday to offer a blanket savings guarantee to private depositors has piled the pressure on other eu member states to follow suit .
austria , for instance , raised its guarantees on savings deposits late sunday , just hours after the german plan was announced .
sweden and denmark raised their guarantees on monday morning .
while insisting that austrian banks were sound , austrian finance minister wilhelm molterer said the government had taken the decision " to avoid a competitive disadvantage with germany , so that savings deposits do not flow off to germany . "
german plan up for discussion bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel 's government has pledged to protect investors german officials appeared under pressure to explain their actions after earlier criticizing an irish guarantee , with bos saying that the german plan " is one of the issues on the table here .

smaller teams are now losing their respect for the champions , who are only 11th in the table after two wins in seven matches , beckenbauer wrote in his column for bild newspaper on monday .
" the mythos that in the end bayern -lrb- almost -rrb- always win has taken a break ... the league senses that we are vulnerable , " he said .
team needs to work it out bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : another one of those days bayern followed up two successive league defeats by with a 3-3 draw at home saturday by bochum who scored two late goals to earn a point .
there were jeers from bayern fans .
coach juergen klinsmann said the performance was unacceptable .
beckenbauer said the team gave bochum far too much room to play .
he also hoped goalkeeper michael rensing would soon radiate the same assurance between the posts as the now retired oliver kahn .
" bayern will only be able to recapture the mythos with hard work , " he said .
can they shape up ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : klinsmann still has the dressing room on side " i keep my fingers crossed for juergen klinsmann .
it may be the case that he upset many fans with radical changes .
the criticism from the stands and the media is something he will have to tolerate . "
however beckenbauer said the bayern board would need to be remain calm , and that the relationship between klinsmann and the team was " intact . "
" that was not for example the case in the end with felix magath -lrb- dismissed in early 2007 before ottmar hitzfeld took charge -rrb- .
with klinsmann i see no rift .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de turkey -pipe- 06.10.2008 turkey steps up new campaign against pkk in northern iraq großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : turkey has reacted to new attacks by the pkk by mou ting a new military campaign turkish warplanes bombed suspected kurdish workers ' party -lrb- pkk -rrb- positions in northern iraq on monday , oct .
6 , three days after a pkk attack on a border post killed 15 turkish soldiers . according to a statement released by the turkish general staff , the warplanes bombed pkk positions in the mountainous avasin region of northern iraq .
" the planes returned safely to base after successfully completing their mission , " the statement said .
turkish jets also attacked positions in the same area on sunday night .
the attack on friday night on the aktutun border post in the south-eastern province of hakkari that left 15 soldiers and 23 pkk separatists dead has shocked turkey and led to the general staff on sunday announcing that it was to relocate five military border posts .
a spokesman for the military said the administration of the kurdish autonomous area in iraq had not helped in the fight against the pkk , despite overtures by iraq 's kurdish president jalal talabani .
after the attack talabani called his turkish counterpart abdullah gul to propose a meeting of high-ranking security experts from both sides , suggesting iraqi willingness to help turkey de-escalate the situation .
the turkish air force has conducted a number of airstrikes against pkk targets in northern iraq since a week-long cross-border incursion into northern iraq was launched in february .
ankara blames the separatist group for the deaths of more than 35,000 people since the early 1980s when the pkk began its fight for independence or autonomy for the mainly kurdish-populated south-east of turkey .
turkish dead laid to rest as tensions heighten bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : angry crowds protested the deaths of turkish soldiers the 15 turkish soldiers killed in saturday 's attack on an iraq border post were borne to their graves on sunday by a crowd of thousands shouting angry slogans against the perpetrators - the outlawed kurdish workers party , or pkk .
the attack , which claimed 38 lives in total , was launched by the guerrilla group , which operates from inside iraq , after a week of turkish air force raids on their positions .
turkish government and military leaders have vowed to escalate the campaign against the pkk .
" we will now conduct our campaign against terrorism even more decisively , " said turkish prime minister recep tayyip erdogan , after he broke off his journey to central asia in response to the attack .
but turkey can not win the war against the pkk by military force alone .
one day before the aktutun border post attack , the worst pkk assault this year , the turkish air force had bombarded suspected pkk positions in the qandil mountains of iraq , close to the iranian border .

according to turkish media reports , more than 300 pkk fighters assembled for the raid on the border post .
at daybreak on saturday they opened fire with heavy weapons from iraq as other fighters moved in on the ground .
the battle at aktutun lasted for five hours .
it was the fifth attack on the post since 1992 .
turkey hit back with combat helicopters and special forces .
after the attack , iraqi president jalal talabani , himself a kurd , called his turkish counterpart abdullah gul to propose a meeting of high-ranking security experts from both sides , suggesting iraqi willingness to help turkey de-escalate the situation .
however , turkish daily millyet commented on sunday that " long- range weapons can not be brought into position without those responsible for security in iraq noticing . "
also under question is the value of us support in informing turkey of pkk movements within iraq .
the turkish parliament is due to vote monday on whether to allow the army to extend its mandate for operations in northern iraq for a further year .
the approval of the mandate was not in doubt even before saturday 's attack , as evidently turkey 's operations in northern iraq had not brought the pkk to its knees .
in february , turkey launched a ground offensive in iraq , although us criticism brought it to a rapid end .
us defense secretary robert gates has suggested the military struggle against the pkk be conducted together with economic and political means .

turkish government and military leaders have vowed to escalate the campaign against the pkk .
" we will now conduct our campaign against terrorism even more decisively , " said turkish prime minister recep tayyip erdogan , after he broke off his journey to central asia in response to the attack .
but turkey can not win the war against the pkk by military force alone .
one day before the aktutun border post attack , the worst pkk assault this year , the turkish air force had bombarded suspected pkk positions in the qandil mountains of iraq , close to the iranian border .

according to turkish media reports , more than 300 pkk fighters assembled for the raid on the border post .
at daybreak on saturday they opened fire with heavy weapons from iraq as other fighters moved in on the ground .
the battle at aktutun lasted for five hours .
it was the fifth attack on the post since 1992 .
turkey hit back with combat helicopters and special forces .
after the attack , iraqi president jalal talabani , himself a kurd , called his turkish counterpart abdullah gul to propose a meeting of high-ranking security experts from both sides , suggesting iraqi willingness to help turkey de-escalate the situation .
however , turkish daily millyet commented on sunday that " long- range weapons can not be brought into position without those responsible for security in iraq noticing . "
also under question is the value of us support in informing turkey of pkk movements within iraq .
the turkish parliament is due to vote monday on whether to allow the army to extend its mandate for operations in northern iraq for a further year .
the approval of the mandate was not in doubt even before saturday 's attack , as evidently turkey 's operations in northern iraq had not brought the pkk to its knees .
in february , turkey launched a ground offensive in iraq , although us criticism brought it to a rapid end .
us defense secretary robert gates has suggested the military struggle against the pkk be conducted together with economic and political means .

6 , three days after a pkk attack on a border post killed 15 turkish soldiers . according to a statement released by the turkish general staff , the warplanes bombed pkk positions in the mountainous avasin region of northern iraq .
" the planes returned safely to base after successfully completing their mission , " the statement said .
turkish jets also attacked positions in the same area on sunday night .
the attack on friday night on the aktutun border post in the south-eastern province of hakkari that left 15 soldiers and 23 pkk separatists dead has shocked turkey and led to the general staff on sunday announcing that it was to relocate five military border posts .
a spokesman for the military said the administration of the kurdish autonomous area in iraq had not helped in the fight against the pkk , despite overtures by iraq 's kurdish president jalal talabani .
after the attack talabani called his turkish counterpart abdullah gul to propose a meeting of high-ranking security experts from both sides , suggesting iraqi willingness to help turkey de-escalate the situation .
the turkish air force has conducted a number of airstrikes against pkk targets in northern iraq since a week-long cross-border incursion into northern iraq was launched in february .
ankara blames the separatist group for the deaths of more than 35,000 people since the early 1980s when the pkk began its fight for independence or autonomy for the mainly kurdish-populated south-east of turkey .

smaller teams are now losing their respect for the champions , who are only 11th in the table after two wins in seven matches , beckenbauer wrote in his column for bild newspaper on monday .
" the mythos that in the end bayern -lrb- almost -rrb- always win has taken a break ... the league senses that we are vulnerable , " he said .
team needs to work it out bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : another one of those days bayern followed up two successive league defeats by with a 3-3 draw at home saturday by bochum who scored two late goals to earn a point .
there were jeers from bayern fans .
coach juergen klinsmann said the performance was unacceptable .
beckenbauer said the team gave bochum far too much room to play .
he also hoped goalkeeper michael rensing would soon radiate the same assurance between the posts as the now retired oliver kahn .
" bayern will only be able to recapture the mythos with hard work , " he said .
can they shape up ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : klinsmann still has the dressing room on side " i keep my fingers crossed for juergen klinsmann .
it may be the case that he upset many fans with radical changes .
the criticism from the stands and the media is something he will have to tolerate . "
however beckenbauer said the bayern board would need to be remain calm , and that the relationship between klinsmann and the team was " intact . "
" that was not for example the case in the end with felix magath -lrb- dismissed in early 2007 before ottmar hitzfeld took charge -rrb- .
with klinsmann i see no rift .
he needs time for his ideas to take effect .
" we have to have patience and analyze in the winter break what needs to be done . "
coach sees reasons for optimism bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : do they need to play harder ?
klinsmann said sunday he was determined to correct the mistakes and get bayern moving back up the league table .
" we understand the fans ' dismay and disappointment .
they have every right to voice it , " he told the bayern munich internet television channel fcb.tv.
" seven games into the bundesliga season , what bayern have achieved is not acceptable , and i wo n't accept it either . "
however the coach said he was still optimistic for the season .
" we can still hit all our targets .
we 're through in the dfb cup , we 're top of our champions league group , and in the bundesliga , we fortunately have enough games to put things right step by step - although we obviously need more determination , and the players have to start living up to expectations .
we have a lot of work ahead of us , " he said . dpa news agency -lrb- th -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the leaders of germany 's ruling coalition agreed sunday to push for a constitutional change allowing the military to help out local law enforcement in certain cases .
germany places strict limits on its military given the excesses committed during the nazi era .
yet politicians have argued that the military could fill an important role in the case of a terrorist attack , acting as a backup to police .
german defense minister franz josef jung welcomed the decision to “ protect citizens in germany ” according to his spokesman .
ruling parties find compromise bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some are concerned that the military will be used against protestors germany 's interior minister wolfgang schaeuble had originally called for an even broader use of the military to respond to domestic terrorist threats .
many of these demands were scrapped in reaching the final compromise .
volker kauder , of chancellor angela merkel 's christian democratic union -lrb- cdu -rrb- , emphasized sunday that the military would only be used in extraordinary circumstances .
“ we have finally found a way to deploy the bundeswehr in specific , confined cases , ” kauder said .
peter struck , head of the social democratic party -lrb- spd -rrb- , said he could imagine a scenario where german marines would help the coast guard during an emergency .
worries over abuses of power bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : schaeuble has called for broader use of the miltary domestically left party parliamentarian petra pau criticized the plans , saying that the coalition wanted to officially condone what was already allowed “ through the back door . ”
germany 's koelner stadt-anzeiger newspaper also warned in an editorial in its monday edition that demonstrators and terrorists are often seen as being one in the same by law enforcement .
the newspaper warned against the " militarization of domestic politics . " and called for more " intensive discussion " before the constitutional change goes forward . dw staff -lrb- th -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de finance -pipe- 06.10.2008 europe follows germany 's financial guarantee plan großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany wants to shore up confidence of savers and investors after germany ’ s surprise decision to protect all personal bank deposits , britain and other european countries could follow suit .
yet investors remained skittish about europe 's financial future . calls for a common european approach to the banking crisis continued on monday as both the european and asian stock markets were down sharply in early trading .
up until this weekend , germany had stoically opposed issuing a blanket guarantee on all bank deposits despite other countries moving to do so .
yet with confidence deeply shaken after a first bailout for hypo real estate fell through , the german government abruptly changed course on sunday .
in an attempt to prevent a run on banks , germany announced it will guarantee all personal bank deposits in the country .
“ we tell all savings account holders that your deposits are safe .
the federal government assures it , ” german chancellor angela merkel said after an emergency government meeting in a bid to prevent a panic run on banks .
now britain is reportedly under pressure to change its stance .
britain had criticized recent decisions by ireland and greece to guarantee savings accounts , worrying that the moves could shift money away from british banks .
germany leads , others follow bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : fortis is getting help from a french bank british finance minister alistair darling is expected to address the issue in a speech to lawmakers on monday .
britain has already promised to increase the level of private savings guaranteed by the government to 50,000 pounds -lrb- $ 88,000 -rrb- per person .
the government has hesitated to go any higher than that due to the potential costs involved .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de finance -pipe- 06.10.2008 europe follows germany 's financial guarantee plan großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany wants to shore up confidence of savers and investors after germany ’ s surprise decision to protect all personal bank deposits , britain and other european countries could follow suit .
yet investors remained skittish about europe 's financial future . calls for a common european approach to the banking crisis continued on monday as both the european and asian stock markets were down sharply in early trading .
up until this weekend , germany had stoically opposed issuing a blanket guarantee on all bank deposits despite other countries moving to do so .
yet with confidence deeply shaken after a first bailout for hypo real estate fell through , the german government abruptly changed course on sunday .
in an attempt to prevent a run on banks , germany announced it will guarantee all personal bank deposits in the country .
“ we tell all savings account holders that your deposits are safe .
the federal government assures it , ” german chancellor angela merkel said after an emergency government meeting in a bid to prevent a panic run on banks .
now britain is reportedly under pressure to change its stance .
britain had criticized recent decisions by ireland and greece to guarantee savings accounts , worrying that the moves could shift money away from british banks .
germany leads , others follow bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : fortis is getting help from a french bank british finance minister alistair darling is expected to address the issue in a speech to lawmakers on monday .
britain has already promised to increase the level of private savings guaranteed by the government to 50,000 pounds -lrb- $ 88,000 -rrb- per person .
the government has hesitated to go any higher than that due to the potential costs involved .
darling is reportedly considering using public funds to take stakes in banks .
the plan is a middle course between nationalizing banks and handing out further loans .
" germany is europe 's economic superpower , " said nick clegg , leader of the liberal democrats , britain 's third-largest party .
" where it leads , others are bound to follow . ”
clegg said a common european approach to deposit guarantees is necessary .
denmark on sunday announced the country 's banks had agreed to contribute 35 billion kronor -lrb- 4.8 billion euros -rrb- to help ailing banks and guarantee deposits .
italy wanted an even more united response , calling for an overarching european bailout plan .
investors remain skittish bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : eu leaders are grappling with how to best handle the banking crisis investors seemed spooked at signs of escalating problems in europe 's banking sector .
frankfurt 's stock market fell sharply on monday , with stocks down 3.29 percent at the opening .
asian stocks also dropped , with tokyo at a four-year low .
frankfurt 's blue chip dax slumped 4.54 per cent to 5,533.57 , its lowest level since july 2006 .
besides the german rescue of hypo , there were more signs over the weekend that european governments were scrambling to rescue struggling banks .
french bank bnp paribas agreed on sunday to take control of ailing finance group fortis 's operations in belgium and luxembourg through a share issue , saying the operation valued the company at 14.7 billion euros .
the belgian and luxembourg governments had partially nationalized the bank a week ago , but after the dutch government took over full control of fortis ' operations in the netherlands , they began looking for a suitor .
on saturday , leaders of britain , france , germany and italy said they would protect fragile banks , but would not copy the blanket $ 700 billion bailout agreed in the us last week .
eu finance ministers will try to put together plans on monday and tuesday for restoring confidence in the banking system .
germany looks to restore confidence germany had previously guaranteed 20,000 euros -lrb- $ 28,400 -rrb- savings per person .
finance ministry spokesman torsten albig told the business daily handelsblatt that the estimated value of the guaranteed all accounts would total 568 billion euros .
handelsblatt said the state was the only " fire brigade " that could come to the rescue in the face of a crisis of this size .
" this means the government and the banks will have to bite the bullet , " it said .
" this is an important signal intended to bring a calming , instead of reactions that are disproportionate and make crisis resolution and crisis prevention more difficult , " finance minister peer steinbrueck said . dw staff -lrb- th -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the chancellor also warned that managers at financial institutions should be held accountable for what she termed irresponsible behavior .
" we owe that to the taxpayers in germany , " she said .
in a further move to shore up the german banking system , the government issued a guarantee for all savings in german banks . in a bid to stave off panic withdrawals , finance minister peer steinbrueck assured that german bank account holders need not worry about losing a " single euro " in the crisis .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de opinion -pipe- 06.10.2008 opinion : national safeguards wo n't solve financial crisis großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the german government 's decision to guarantee private deposits is nothing more than a psychological gesture intended to calm markets and investors , writes dw 's andreas becker . do n't worry , you 're money is perfectly safe .
that 's the message german politicians gave private depositors .
the government guaranteed savings in german accounts .
according to the finance ministry , the federal government is vouching for " more than 1 trillion euros . "
but even such a guarantee would n't be worth a cent if everyone ran to the bank for their money - not even the government could pay such a huge sum of money .
the core of the guarantee serves a psychological purpose : despite all the talk about the financial crisis ' dimensions , citizens should n't get any more worried than they already are .
by giving a guarantee , the state is hoping to avoid a situation where it would have to pay anything back .
but there 's a different problem : no german bank has yet faced difficulties in this crisis due to private customers wanting their money back .
even at britain 's northern rock , customers did n't start demanding their money back until the bank was already deep in the crisis .
there are two reasons for the difficulties banks are facing .
either they have too many financial products based on junk us mortgages that needed to be written off on their books or they have n't been successful in receiving short-term capital from money markets to keep up with running commitments because skeptical banks are hardly lending to each other .
the state 's guarantee for private savings does not solve either of these problems .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de finance -pipe- 06.10.2008 europe follows germany 's financial guarantee plan großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany wants to shore up confidence of savers and investors after germany ’ s surprise decision to protect all personal bank deposits , britain and other european countries could follow suit .
yet investors remained skittish about europe 's financial future . calls for a common european approach to the banking crisis continued on monday as both the european and asian stock markets were down sharply in early trading .
up until this weekend , germany had stoically opposed issuing a blanket guarantee on all bank deposits despite other countries moving to do so .
yet with confidence deeply shaken after a first bailout for hypo real estate fell through , the german government abruptly changed course on sunday .
in an attempt to prevent a run on banks , germany announced it will guarantee all personal bank deposits in the country .
“ we tell all savings account holders that your deposits are safe .
the federal government assures it , ” german chancellor angela merkel said after an emergency government meeting in a bid to prevent a panic run on banks .
now britain is reportedly under pressure to change its stance .
britain had criticized recent decisions by ireland and greece to guarantee savings accounts , worrying that the moves could shift money away from british banks .
germany leads , others follow bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : fortis is getting help from a french bank british finance minister alistair darling is expected to address the issue in a speech to lawmakers on monday .
britain has already promised to increase the level of private savings guaranteed by the government to 50,000 pounds -lrb- $ 88,000 -rrb- per person .
the government has hesitated to go any higher than that due to the potential costs involved .
darling is reportedly considering using public funds to take stakes in banks .
the plan is a middle course between nationalizing banks and handing out further loans .
" germany is europe 's economic superpower , " said nick clegg , leader of the liberal democrats , britain 's third-largest party .
" where it leads , others are bound to follow . ”
clegg said a common european approach to deposit guarantees is necessary .
denmark on sunday announced the country 's banks had agreed to contribute 35 billion kronor -lrb- 4.8 billion euros -rrb- to help ailing banks and guarantee deposits .
italy wanted an even more united response , calling for an overarching european bailout plan .
investors remain skittish bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : eu leaders are grappling with how to best handle the banking crisis investors seemed spooked at signs of escalating problems in europe 's banking sector .
frankfurt 's stock market fell sharply on monday , with stocks down 3.29 percent at the opening .
asian stocks also dropped , with tokyo at a four-year low .
frankfurt 's blue chip dax slumped 4.54 per cent to 5,533.57 , its lowest level since july 2006 .
besides the german rescue of hypo , there were more signs over the weekend that european governments were scrambling to rescue struggling banks .
french bank bnp paribas agreed on sunday to take control of ailing finance group fortis 's operations in belgium and luxembourg through a share issue , saying the operation valued the company at 14.7 billion euros .
the belgian and luxembourg governments had partially nationalized the bank a week ago , but after the dutch government took over full control of fortis ' operations in the netherlands , they began looking for a suitor .
on saturday , leaders of britain , france , germany and italy said they would protect fragile banks , but would not copy the blanket $ 700 billion bailout agreed in the us last week .
eu finance ministers will try to put together plans on monday and tuesday for restoring confidence in the banking system .
germany looks to restore confidence germany had previously guaranteed 20,000 euros -lrb- $ 28,400 -rrb- savings per person .
finance ministry spokesman torsten albig told the business daily handelsblatt that the estimated value of the guaranteed all accounts would total 568 billion euros .
handelsblatt said the state was the only " fire brigade " that could come to the rescue in the face of a crisis of this size .
" this means the government and the banks will have to bite the bullet , " it said .
" this is an important signal intended to bring a calming , instead of reactions that are disproportionate and make crisis resolution and crisis prevention more difficult , " finance minister peer steinbrueck said . dw staff -lrb- th -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

that 's the message german politicians gave private depositors .
the government guaranteed savings in german accounts .
according to the finance ministry , the federal government is vouching for " more than 1 trillion euros . "
but even such a guarantee would n't be worth a cent if everyone ran to the bank for their money - not even the government could pay such a huge sum of money .
the core of the guarantee serves a psychological purpose : despite all the talk about the financial crisis ' dimensions , citizens should n't get any more worried than they already are .
by giving a guarantee , the state is hoping to avoid a situation where it would have to pay anything back .
but there 's a different problem : no german bank has yet faced difficulties in this crisis due to private customers wanting their money back .
even at britain 's northern rock , customers did n't start demanding their money back until the bank was already deep in the crisis .
there are two reasons for the difficulties banks are facing .
either they have too many financial products based on junk us mortgages that needed to be written off on their books or they have n't been successful in receiving short-term capital from money markets to keep up with running commitments because skeptical banks are hardly lending to each other .
the state 's guarantee for private savings does not solve either of these problems .

6 . such measures would include the injection of liquidity by european central banks , bail-outs for troubled banks and guarantees for deposits , the joint statement said .
noting that no european depositor had lost their savings so far , the eu leaders called for " coordination and close cooperation " in dealing with the effects of the global credit crunch .
the unprecedented statement came as european stock markets tumbled and as finance ministers from the 15 eu countries that share the euro were holding talks in luxembourg on ways to deal with the continent 's exploding financial crisis .
member states have hitherto reacted individually to events in their own countries , but the urgency of the crisis has sparked a rising chorus of calls for coordinated action .
" i think it 's extremely important that european countries use similar principles in how they treat banks in problems -lrb- sic -rrb- , for example , how they intervene , what time they intervene , what policy measures they are prepared to apply , " dutch finance minister wouter bos said ahead of the meeting in luxembourg .
europe works towards a common approach bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : almunia was confident of a eu coordinated action officials from the eu 's executive echoed that call , with eu economic and monetary affairs commissioner joaquin almunia saying : " we should have a common approach , coordinated action , to avoid unilateral decisions that create negative spillovers . "
but the decision by the german government on sunday to offer a blanket savings guarantee to private depositors has piled the pressure on other eu member states to follow suit .
austria , for instance , raised its guarantees on savings deposits late sunday , just hours after the german plan was announced .
sweden and denmark raised their guarantees on monday morning .
while insisting that austrian banks were sound , austrian finance minister wilhelm molterer said the government had taken the decision " to avoid a competitive disadvantage with germany , so that savings deposits do not flow off to germany . "
german plan up for discussion bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel 's government has pledged to protect investors german officials appeared under pressure to explain their actions after earlier criticizing an irish guarantee , with bos saying that the german plan " is one of the issues on the table here . "
but german deputy finance minister joerg asmussen stressed that " germany 's approach is fundamentally different from the irish one .
they set up a rescue shield which basically discriminates in the internal market , while germany 's approach is aimed at making sure that no depositor loses a single euro . "
about a third of the 15 eu countries that share the common currency have already moved to safeguard bank deposits in some way or other - among them germany , austria , greece , ireland and belgium .
but after a meeting of the leaders of the eu 's four biggest economies in paris on saturday , proposals for setting up an eu-wide rescue fund appeared to have been taken off the table .
" i do n't think there 's going to be anything near consensus about a european fund .
i hope there is going to be a consensus about a common approach , on principles that should be applied whenever we want to intervene or whenever we want to help banks in problems -lrb- sic -rrb- , " bos said . dpa news agency send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

that package had a price tag of 35 billion euros . the german finance ministry said in a statement that the new deal will see the financial sector topping up that sum with an additional 15 billion euros .
" with this mutually agreed solution , the institution -lrb- hypo real estate -rrb- will be stabilized and with it , germany strengthened as a place to conduct finance in difficult times , " the statement said . on monday , german finance minister peer steinbrueck said he would not rule out increasing the government 's gurantee for hypo real estate -lrb- hre -rrb- which is worth almost 27 billion euros .
hre on monday hailed the bailout , saying it would allow the company to keep functioning amidst the ongoing financial crisis .
" we are very thankful for the backing of all those involved , " hre boss georg funke said in a statement .
" the solution guarantees the stability of the hypo real estate group , which will have enough liqudity and will be able to continue functioning even as the financial crisis continues , " funke added .
government keen to avoid knock-on effect , panic bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the government is unhappy about what it sees as poor management decisions speaking to reporters before the deal was announced , merkel said the government was " pulling out all the stops " to save hypo real estate -lrb- hre -rrb- . " the government says today that we will not allow an institution 's crisis to become a crisis for the entire system , " merkel said . merkel 's government had scrambled to reach a deal before asian markets opened monday , fearing the company would not last long for more than a few days without a rescue package .
the chancellor also warned that managers at financial institutions should be held accountable for what she termed irresponsible behavior .
" we owe that to the taxpayers in germany , " she said .
in a further move to shore up the german banking system , the government issued a guarantee for all savings in german banks . in a bid to stave off panic withdrawals , finance minister peer steinbrueck assured that german bank account holders need not worry about losing a " single euro " in the crisis .
" that is an important message intended to create calm and not reactions that would be disproportional and make the current crisis management and crisis prevention even more difficult , " steinbrueck said .
finance ministry spokesman torsten albig told business daily handelsblatt that the estimated value of the guaranteed accounts would total 568 billion euros .
hre management under fire bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german banks have been feeling the fallout of troubles on wall street hypo real estate , germany 's second largest commercial property lender is the first german blue-chip company to seek a government bailout . hre , which mainly lends to commercial projects and to build public facilities such as airports and roads , is the biggest german casualty of the crisis that has spread from new york in the last month . steinbrueck had earlier said he was " outraged " at the management of the hre group because a " further liquidity gap in billions -lrb- of euros -rrb- " had materialized . " the german government refuses to be forced into any co-responsibility by this banking institute , " he said . hre ran into trouble mid-september after a credit freeze following the collapse of us investment bank lehman brothers .

at its heart are tensions between the country 's north and south .
in the second of a series of articles on belgium , henri astier looks at french-speaking wallonia 's efforts to change its fortunes and prosper within a united belgium .
many in belgium 's dutch-speaking north regard french-speaking southerners as a work-shy lot trapped in a sclerotic rust belt .
they contrast flanders ' entrepreneurial , service-led economy to wallonia 's struggle to overcome the collapse of its smokestack industries .
if wallonia has a serious image problem , charleroi , the region 's second-largest city , has an even worse one .
a quarter of its workforce is out of work .
and following a string of scandals in the past three years , the city has become a byword for corruption in wallonia itself .
" whenever a minor scandal arises in a small town , it is nicknamed ' charleroi ' , " says olivier chastel , a centre-right politician who made his mark fighting mismanagement there and is now belgium 's deputy foreign minister .
hard times arriving in the city by rail does little to dispel the stereotypes .
in the distance , a disused steel factory offers a dantesque picture of industrial blight .
outside the station , the rattling tramways appear to have been built in eastern europe circa 1962 .
you reach the city centre after hurrying past beggars and a red-light district .
sitting at a cafe , murielle de gerlache , 34 , and valom idrizaz , 25 , a couple from viroinval further south , mull over a bleak future .
the mother of two has been unemployed for three years and social services are threatening to cut off her benefits .
" they say i 'm not trying hard enough to find work .
but job hunting is hell for me , " she says .
there is no regular bus service from her village - and ms de gerlache blames the penny-pinching flemish for this .
" they try to keep their wealth but forget the time when they came here for jobs . "
what about moving to an area with better transport ?
" we have the right to live where we choose , " objects mr idrizaz , who is also unemployed .
hopelessness and urban decay may be in evidence in central charleroi , but on the outskirts the picture is changing .
the old slag heaps dotted over the landscape are overgrown with greenery .
" we used to be called the ' black country ' because we had heavy industry and mines , but this no longer reflects economic reality in the region , " says nathalie czerniatynski of igretec , a body that promotes development in the area .
" our phone is always ringing ; the companies keep coming , " she says .
her main problem , she says , is turning farmland into business estates fast enough .
rust never sleeps charleroi is home to such international giants as caterpillar and johnson & johnson 's .
its corporate showcase is the aeropole , a business park-cum-research hub built in the 1990s near the airport .
with ponds and futuristic buildings , it looks more like silicon valley than satanic mills .
belgian devolution federal government : foreign affairs , defence , justice , health , welfare language-based communities : education , culture regional governments : economic policy , labour , housing , environment , energy , transport belgium 's federal conundrum most of the aeropole 's 138 companies are local firms that belie wallonia 's reputation as an entrepreneurial black hole .
one of them , ecoplast technology , has found a revolutionary way to make car parts , which it sells to automakers worldwide .
" here in wallonia big companies find the small specialists that add something to their products , " says bernard gonsette , ecoplast 's managing director .
he says he ignores flemish slights about wallonia 's business culture : " i do n't have time for arguments when i 'm busy selling to iran and romania , and taking on the american market . "
the aeropole exemplifies a walloon turnaround that began a decade ago .
the region phased out subsidies to doomed industries , streamlined business paperwork , and wooed investors with tax breaks and other incentives .
support from trade unions was crucial to the transition , in a country where 80 % of the workforce is unionised .
" we could have chosen a purely welfare approach , but we chose reform , " says antonio di santo , head of the charleroi branch of the fgtb union federation .
" we try very hard to shake off the region 's rotten image , as well as stereotypes about lazy walloons , " he adds , pointing out that fewer days are lost to strikes in wallonia than in flanders .
need work , wo n't travel wallonia 's economy may not be the basket case many think it is , but it still has a long way to go .
the region still lags behind flanders by almost every measure - productivity , exports , income , etc .
most painfully , unemployment tops 17 % - while the flemish have labour shortages .
" walloons have problems travelling a few dozen kilometres to find jobs in flanders , " olivier chastel says .
and while the idea of southerners living off the industrious north can be overstated by some flemish politicians , it is not utterly baseless .
a belgian economist recently calculated that if wallonia was on its own - without flanders or brussels - each of its residents would earn 1,200 euros less a year -lrb- $ 1,600 , £ 900 -rrb- .
this enduring economic gap between north and south is a key reason behind walloon resistance to flemish devolution plans .
left to its own devices - notably for welfare - the south would be much poorer .
but economic fears alone do not explain wallonia 's fervent attachment to the belgian state .
you do not encounter there the profound sense of national identity that is ubiquitous in flanders .
" there is no walloon nation , " says historian vincent dujardin , from the catholic university of louvain .
looking south most southerners are proud of their region , but feel it needs to be part of a larger whole . "
culturally i feel french .
i do n't see the difference between a ' chti ' -lrb- french northerner -rrb- and me " thibault de la motte this was highlighted by a recent poll , which indicated that a tiny minority of walloons wanted belgium to break up - but that if secession was forced on them , about half wanted to be attached to france .
some are already calling for such a move - particularly in wallonia 's economic capital , liege .
a free principality for 800 years before joining belgium , liege has strong historic links to france and to this day holds fireworks displays on 14 july .
" a mere two centuries of belgium have not severed those bonds , " says thibault de la motte , a law student from liege .
" culturally i feel french .
i do n't see the difference between a ' chti ' -lrb- french northerner -rrb- and me . "
at present walloons calling for union with france are very much in the minority .
but their numbers could be boosted if nationalists continue to do well in flanders .
whether france would agree to take in wallonia , of course , is another matter .
the last time the french tried to expand their territory - almost two centuries ago - the rest of europe descended on them near a small walloon town called waterloo .

a quarter of its workforce is out of work .
and following a string of scandals in the past three years , the city has become a byword for corruption in wallonia itself .
" whenever a minor scandal arises in a small town , it is nicknamed ' charleroi ' , " says olivier chastel , a centre-right politician who made his mark fighting mismanagement there and is now belgium 's deputy foreign minister .
hard times arriving in the city by rail does little to dispel the stereotypes .

there is no regular bus service from her village - and ms de gerlache blames the penny-pinching flemish for this .

one of them , ecoplast technology , has found a revolutionary way to make car parts , which it sells to automakers worldwide .
" here in wallonia big companies find the small specialists that add something to their products , " says bernard gonsette , ecoplast 's managing director .
he says he ignores flemish slights about wallonia 's business culture : " i do n't have time for arguments when i 'm busy selling to iran and romania , and taking on the american market . "
the aeropole exemplifies a walloon turnaround that began a decade ago .
the region phased out subsidies to doomed industries , streamlined business paperwork , and wooed investors with tax breaks and other incentives .
support from trade unions was crucial to the transition , in a country where 80 % of the workforce is unionised .
" we could have chosen a purely welfare approach , but we chose reform , " says antonio di santo , head of the charleroi branch of the fgtb union federation .
" we try very hard to shake off the region 's rotten image , as well as stereotypes about lazy walloons , " he adds , pointing out that fewer days are lost to strikes in wallonia than in flanders .
need work , wo n't travel wallonia 's economy may not be the basket case many think it is , but it still has a long way to go .
flemish and walloons give their views on tensions in belgium in pictures the region still lags behind flanders by almost every measure - productivity , exports , income , etc .
most painfully , unemployment tops 17 % - while the flemish have labour shortages .
" walloons have problems travelling a few dozen kilometres to find jobs in flanders , " olivier chastel says .
and while the idea of southerners living off the industrious north can be overstated by some flemish politicians , it is not utterly baseless .
a belgian economist recently calculated that if wallonia was on its own - without flanders or brussels - each of its residents would earn 1,200 euros less a year -lrb- $ 1,600 , £ 900 -rrb- .
this enduring economic gap between north and south is a key reason behind walloon resistance to flemish devolution plans .
left to its own devices - notably for welfare - the south would be much poorer .
but economic fears alone do not explain wallonia 's fervent attachment to the belgian state .
you do not encounter there the profound sense of national identity that is ubiquitous in flanders .
" there is no walloon nation , " says historian vincent dujardin , from the catholic university of louvain .
looking south most southerners are proud of their region , but feel it needs to be part of a larger whole .
culturally i feel french .
i do n't see the difference between a ' chti ' -lrb- french northerner -rrb- and me thibault de la motte this was highlighted by a recent poll , which indicated that a tiny minority of walloons wanted belgium to break up - but that if secession was forced on them , about half wanted to be attached to france .
some are already calling for such a move - particularly in wallonia 's economic capital , liege .
a free principality for 800 years before joining belgium , liege has strong historic links to france and to this day holds fireworks displays on 14 july .
" a mere two centuries of belgium have not severed those bonds , " says thibault de la motte , a law student from liege .
" culturally i feel french .
i do n't see the difference between a ' chti ' -lrb- french northerner -rrb- and me . "
at present walloons calling for union with france are very much in the minority .
but their numbers could be boosted if nationalists continue to do well in flanders .
whether france would agree to take in wallonia , of course , is another matter .
the last time the french tried to expand their territory - almost two centuries ago - the rest of europe descended on them near a small walloon town called waterloo .

the old slag heaps dotted over the landscape are overgrown with greenery .
" we used to be called the ' black country ' because we had heavy industry and mines , but this no longer reflects economic reality in the region , " says nathalie czerniatynski of igretec , a body that promotes development in the area .
" our phone is always ringing ; the companies keep coming , " she says .
her main problem , she says , is turning farmland into business estates fast enough .
rust never sleeps charleroi is home to such international giants as caterpillar and johnson & johnson 's .
its corporate showcase is the aeropole , a business park-cum-research hub built in the 1990s near the airport .
with ponds and futuristic buildings , it looks more like silicon valley than satanic mills .
belgian devolution federal government : foreign affairs , defence , justice , health , welfare language-based communities : education , culture regional governments : economic policy , labour , housing , environment , energy , transport belgium 's federal conundrum most of the aeropole 's 138 companies are local firms that belie wallonia 's reputation as an entrepreneurial black hole .
one of them , ecoplast technology , has found a revolutionary way to make car parts , which it sells to automakers worldwide .
" here in wallonia big companies find the small specialists that add something to their products , " says bernard gonsette , ecoplast 's managing director .
he says he ignores flemish slights about wallonia 's business culture : " i do n't have time for arguments when i 'm busy selling to iran and romania , and taking on the american market . "
the aeropole exemplifies a walloon turnaround that began a decade ago .
the region phased out subsidies to doomed industries , streamlined business paperwork , and wooed investors with tax breaks and other incentives .
support from trade unions was crucial to the transition , in a country where 80 % of the workforce is unionised .
" we could have chosen a purely welfare approach , but we chose reform , " says antonio di santo , head of the charleroi branch of the fgtb union federation .
" we try very hard to shake off the region 's rotten image , as well as stereotypes about lazy walloons , " he adds , pointing out that fewer days are lost to strikes in wallonia than in flanders .
need work , wo n't travel wallonia 's economy may not be the basket case many think it is , but it still has a long way to go .
flemish and walloons give their views on tensions in belgium in pictures the region still lags behind flanders by almost every measure - productivity , exports , income , etc .
most painfully , unemployment tops 17 % - while the flemish have labour shortages .
" walloons have problems travelling a few dozen kilometres to find jobs in flanders , " olivier chastel says .
and while the idea of southerners living off the industrious north can be overstated by some flemish politicians , it is not utterly baseless .
a belgian economist recently calculated that if wallonia was on its own - without flanders or brussels - each of its residents would earn 1,200 euros less a year -lrb- $ 1,600 , £ 900 -rrb- .
this enduring economic gap between north and south is a key reason behind walloon resistance to flemish devolution plans .
left to its own devices - notably for welfare - the south would be much poorer .
but economic fears alone do not explain wallonia 's fervent attachment to the belgian state .
you do not encounter there the profound sense of national identity that is ubiquitous in flanders .
" there is no walloon nation , " says historian vincent dujardin , from the catholic university of louvain .
looking south most southerners are proud of their region , but feel it needs to be part of a larger whole .
culturally i feel french .
i do n't see the difference between a ' chti ' -lrb- french northerner -rrb- and me thibault de la motte this was highlighted by a recent poll , which indicated that a tiny minority of walloons wanted belgium to break up - but that if secession was forced on them , about half wanted to be attached to france .
some are already calling for such a move - particularly in wallonia 's economic capital , liege .
a free principality for 800 years before joining belgium , liege has strong historic links to france and to this day holds fireworks displays on 14 july .
" a mere two centuries of belgium have not severed those bonds , " says thibault de la motte , a law student from liege .
" culturally i feel french .
i do n't see the difference between a ' chti ' -lrb- french northerner -rrb- and me . "
at present walloons calling for union with france are very much in the minority .
but their numbers could be boosted if nationalists continue to do well in flanders .
whether france would agree to take in wallonia , of course , is another matter .
the last time the french tried to expand their territory - almost two centuries ago - the rest of europe descended on them near a small walloon town called waterloo .

at its heart are tensions between the country 's north and south .
in the second of a series of articles on belgium , henri astier looks at french-speaking wallonia 's efforts to change its fortunes and prosper within a united belgium .
brownfield sites are the old face of charleroi enlarge image many in belgium 's dutch-speaking north regard french-speaking southerners as a work-shy lot trapped in a sclerotic rust belt .
they contrast flanders ' entrepreneurial , service-led economy to wallonia 's struggle to overcome the collapse of its smokestack industries .
if wallonia has a serious image problem , charleroi , the region 's second-largest city , has an even worse one .
a quarter of its workforce is out of work .
and following a string of scandals in the past three years , the city has become a byword for corruption in wallonia itself .
" whenever a minor scandal arises in a small town , it is nicknamed ' charleroi ' , " says olivier chastel , a centre-right politician who made his mark fighting mismanagement there and is now belgium 's deputy foreign minister .
hard times arriving in the city by rail does little to dispel the stereotypes .
in the distance , a disused steel factory offers a dantesque picture of industrial blight .
the aeropole is the new face of charleroi 's economy outside the station , the rattling tramways appear to have been built in eastern europe circa 1962 .
you reach the city centre after hurrying past beggars and a red-light district .
sitting at a cafe , murielle de gerlache , 34 , and valom idrizaz , 25 , a couple from viroinval further south , mull over a bleak future .
the mother of two has been unemployed for three years and social services are threatening to cut off her benefits .
" they say i 'm not trying hard enough to find work .
but job hunting is hell for me , " she says .
there is no regular bus service from her village - and ms de gerlache blames the penny-pinching flemish for this .
" they try to keep their wealth but forget the time when they came here for jobs . "
what about moving to an area with better transport ?
" we have the right to live where we choose , " objects mr idrizaz , who is also unemployed .
hopelessness and urban decay may be in evidence in central charleroi , but on the outskirts the picture is changing .
the old slag heaps dotted over the landscape are overgrown with greenery .

the deal to save hypo real estate , reached with private banks , is worth 15bn euros more than the first rescue attempt , which fell apart on saturday .
germany earlier appeared to announce an unlimited guarantee for private savings and denmark later followed suit .
the steps brought little comfort to asian markets , where tokyo 's nikkei index tumbled 4.7 % to a four-year low .
from the today programme more from today programme the problems of hypo real estate have put further strain on other financial institutions struggling against a crisis of confidence in the global financial system .
in other developments : the turmoil in europe pushed markets in japan , hong kong and india down by more than 3 % in the first trading sessions since the us agreed a $ 700bn -lrb- £ 394bn -rrb- bail-out for its beleaguered financial sector on friday .
french giant bnp paribas confirmed it had agreed to buy 75 % of fortis 's operations in belgium and luxembourg .
in return , the governments of belgium and luxembourg will take a minority stake in bnp .
the dutch arm of fortis has been nationalised by the government of the netherlands .
the icelandic government agreed measures for the country 's banks to sell off some foreign assets in a bid to shore up its entire financial system .
iceland 's currency last week plummeted 20 % against the dollar and the government was forced to bail out the country 's third-largest bank , glitnir . "
we tell all savings account holders that your deposits are safe .
the federal government assures it " angela merkel ' irresponsible behaviour ' berlin 's finance ministry said it had acted to stop hypo real estate 's collapse in order to avoid " incalculably large " damage to germany and financial services providers in europe .
german chancellor angela merkel said managers at financial institutions should be held accountable for " irresponsible behaviour " .
earlier , she moved to reassure german savers all their deposits would be safe .
similar unilateral guarantees issued by the irish and greek governments last week were criticised in berlin and other european capitals .
but after an emergency meeting with the central bank , ms merkel said : " we tell all savings account holders that your deposits are safe .
the federal government assures it . "
" european governments are as dazed and confused by the mayhem in the global banking system as most of the rest of us " robert peston bbc business editor peston : momentous monday send us your comments iceland shores up economy the bbc 's tristana moore in berlin says germany 's move will relieve investors and send an important message to the german public that banks will not be allowed to go under .
bbc business editor robert peston said the uk treasury was attempting to clarify the details of germany 's guarantee .
other eu states - including the uk - may feel they have to follow suit , our correspondent says .
denmark 's government announced just after midnight it would also guarantee all deposits , after its banks agreed to pay into a liquidation fund to take over distressed banks .
deposits in danish banks have in the past been guaranteed up to 300,000 crowns -lrb- $ 55,000 ; £ 31,000 -rrb- .
the uk finance minister , alistair darling , has said he is ready to take " pretty big steps that we would n't take in ordinary times " to help the british economy .
on saturday , leaders of europe 's four biggest economies - germany , france , britain and italy - stopped short of a co-ordinated us-style bank bail-out but vowed to stabilise markets .

the relaunch follows the decision to drop its iconic butler at the beginning of 2006 and the introduction of new applications last year .
ask will be refocusing on its ability to act as the search engine of choice for those asking questions .
rivals are increasingly looking at ways to set themselves apart from google in the competitive world of search .
data from net measurement firm comscore found that ask is more often used by people searching for specific answers to questions .
while such questions account for about 5 % of queries to google , yahoo and microsoft live search , it accounts for 15 % of ask 's searches .
four wheels ask claims the re-designed site will be faster , produce more relevant search results and improved search technology .
the site , which goes live in the us from 6 october and in the uk from 20 october , borrows design ideas from rival google .
cesar mascaraque , european managing director of ask , believes it is inevitable that there will be similarities with google .
" all cars have four wheels .
no-one wants a car with one wheel , " he said .
he is convinced that ask is chasing a very specific customer - 35 to 55-year-olds .
" the 20 year-old is never going to use us and , you know what , i do n't care , " he said .
ask acknowledged that last year 's tv campaign , which portrayed it as an underground alternative to google , was not as successful as it hoped .
" the ad brought them in but the product let us down , " said a spokeswoman . " this time around we have done a lot of work on the back end . "
ask will be launching a scaled-down tv ad campaign , confined initially to the midlands area .
it will focus on the tricky questions to which people want answers .
lifeblood google 's rivals have a marathon task if they want to cut into its market share , said alex burmaster , an analyst with market research firm nielsen netratings .
" for anyone coming to the net in the last few years google is the lifeblood of their online behaviour , " he said .
" despite changes to the technology and marketing the figures suggest that ask has n't made a difference , " he said .
in the uk , google dominates with an 80 % market share compared to 2 % for ask .
in the us , google 's share is slightly less at 60 % but ask 's share remains the same .
but searching on ask remains relatively healthy .
during august 46 million searches were conducted via ask in the uk which accounts for one in five of all people using a search engine .
