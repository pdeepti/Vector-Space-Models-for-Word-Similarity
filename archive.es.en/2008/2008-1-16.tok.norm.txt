17 , came after street protests by anti-clerical students and professors on tuesday afternoon . it is the first cancellation of an appearance by the pontiff in the face of hostility since his election in april 2005 . " following the well-known events of these days ... it was considered appropriate to cancel the event , " the vatican said in a statement . benedict , who had been scheduled to deliver a speech at the start of la sapienza 's academic year , would still send his text to the university , the statement said . escalating dissent while tensions around the pontiff 's visit had escalated throughout the day with some 100 students staging a sit-in at la sapienza 's main hall , the vatican 's evening announcement came as a surprise . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : pope benedict xvi is no stranger to controversy earlier on tuesday afternoon , giovanni maria vian , the editor of the vatican 's mouthpiece newspaper l 'osservatore romano , lamented the controversy stirred by the pontiff 's planned visit , but predicted it would go ahead . and university rector renato guarini said that while opponents of the visit would be allowed to hold a demonstration on campus on thursday , the pontiff 's invitation was still valid . " the pope is a man of culture and great thinker " who should be allowed to have his say , guarini said in an interview with private news television news channel skytg24 . academics oppose pope 's stance the opposition to the planned visit began when a group of 67 academics signed a letter requesting that guarini withdraw the invitation to the pope . in the letter , the academics said they opposed the pontiff 's " incongruous " visit to a secular university , and called on the university to revoke the " disconcerting invitation " to benedict , whom they accuse of being a reactionary and an opponent of free thought and research . many scientists fault the intellectual , conservative and tradition-minded pope for a series of positions he has taken that they say subordinate science and reason to faith . the faculty protest against the visit was spearheaded by a well-known physicist , marcello cini , a professor emeritus at la sapienza . pope " is playing the victim " on learning of the cancellation , cini told afp news service , " i 'm satisfied , that 's what i was asking for .
i thought , and i continue to think , that this visit was ambiguous and an attack on the independence of culture and the university . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some protesters wore benedict masks he added : " by cancelling , he is playing the victim , which is very intelligent .
it will be a pretext for accusing us of refusing dialogue . " in their letter , the academics cited a 1990 speech made by benedict when he was still a cardinal , in which he allegedly justified the catholic church 's actions against galileo , the 17th-century physicist who ran afoul of church doctrine by insisting that the earth orbits the sun . during the 1990 speech delivered in parma , italy , the then-cardinal joseph ratzinger had quoted austrian-born philosopher paul feyerabend as saying that the church 's 1633 heresy trial against galileo had been " reasonable and fair . " in court , galileo was forced to recant his theories . students focus on galileo comments benedict " condemns centuries of scientific and cultural growth by affirming anachronistic dogmas such as creationism , while attacking scientific free-thought and promoting mandatory heterosexuality , " students opposed to the visit , using the name physics collective , said on their web site . the students opposed to the visit kicked off an " anti-clergy week " on monday by showing a film on galileo . on monday , vatican radio said attempts to prevent benedict from speaking at the campus amounted to censorship . catholic and conservative politicians have condemned the university 's actions as a sign of intolerance , while opinions in the country 's governing center-left have been split , with some saying the pontiff 's opponents have the right to show their dissent . dw staff -lrb- jen -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de health -pipe- 16.01.2008 eu raids drug firms in industry-competition probe großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : color me skeptical : eu regulators thought it best to arrive unannounced the eu raided pharmaceutical companies across europe , amid concerns over uncompetitive behavior in the industry .
regulators worry the big drug makers are acting to keep generics off the market , among other issues . the dawn raids and sector inquiry , which the eu commission said was not based on specific suspected violations , could lead to cartel charges against companies and potentially huge fines .
patents are the life blood of the pharmaceutical industry but critics allege some companies misuse patent rights to delay the introduction of generic medicines in unjustified ways .
the cost of medicines is a hot-button issue in europe , where governments are seeking to trim health care costs at the same time as encouraging the development of the pharmaceutical and biotechnology sectors .
three of europe 's biggest drug makers - astrazeneca , glaxosmithkline and sanofi-aventis - acknowledged they had been approached by eu regulators as part of the antitrust probe .
us-based pfizer , the world 's top drug maker , also confirmed it was being investigated .
looking for " something rotten " regulators said they suspect the firms involved may be protecting their own market shares at the expense of introducing better drugs .
" a sector inquiry is something we engage in if we have the feeling that the sector is not working optimally ... "
eu competition commissioner neelie kroes said .
" if there is a feeling that something is rotten in the state , or something could be rotten , let 's take the opportunity to find out , " she added .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : eu commissioner kroes takes on a hot-button issue european citizens spend some 200 billion euros -lrb- $ 297 billion -rrb- a year on pharmaceutical products - the equivalent of 400 euros for every man , woman and child in the eu , kroes said .
unexplained drop in product launches but over the last decade , the number of new components launched on the market has fallen from an average of 40 per year between 1995 and 1999 , to just 28 per year between 2000 and 2004 .
" if innovative products are n't being produced , and cheaper generic alternatives are being delayed , we need to find out why , " kroes said .
the raids were carried out in a number of eu states with the help of local authorities , and targeted both firms based in europe and those based outside the continent who are active in its market .
kroes would not comment on which specific countries and companies were involved .
major concerns confirm probe however , astrazeneca said in a statement on wednesday : " we confirm that we are part of a sector inquiry instituted by the european commission on jan .
15 , 2008 into aspects of the pharmaceutical industry . "
the company added it was fully cooperating with the probe .
" the inquiry relates to the introduction of innovative and generic medicines for human consumption onto the market and covers commercial practices , including the use of patents , " the statement added .
" we understand that several companies have been similarly approached in connection with the inquiry . "
a spokesman for glaxosmithkline said the british group had also been visited by eu regulators as part of the investigation .
" we have been contacted by them , " the gsk spokesman said .
" i can not say the date or which site or where but we can confirm we have been visited by them . "
patent disputes at heart of issue the inquiry will pay particular attention to deals between drugs firms , such as settlements in patent disputes , and to the question of whether some companies could have abused their patent and legal rights to keep rivals out of the market .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : pfizer also got a visit from eu regulators given that such questions deal with highly-sensitive information which " may be easily withheld , concealed or destroyed , " the use of unannounced inspections was " considered appropriate , " kroes said .
the primary aim of the inquiry is to gather and analyze information on the operation of the pharmaceuticals market .
however , if it brings to light evidence of specific wrong-doing , such cases will be dealt with as they arise , she said .
the commission is tasked with ensuring that eu states and companies obey eu laws , including those on competition .
in the last year alone , it imposed fines of over 3 billion euros -lrb- $ 4.5 billion -rrb- on firms which had broken competition law .
unlike in those cartel cases , the raids on the drugs sector were not prompted by specific indications of illegal activity , but by a more general sense that the eu market is not working , kroes stressed .
" the inquiry is not investigating specific companies and is not based on specific evidence , " she said .
however , it would focus on " a couple of issues where we are not feeling safe that it is pro-competitive , " she added .
astrazeneca previously faced fines but during a news conference , kroes cited astrazeneca as a clear example of a company in which competition was not functioning optimally , referring to a 2005 decision in which the commission fined the company 60 million euros .
the commission found that astrazeneca had misused the patent system to delay market entry of rivals to its ulcer drug losec .
other companies , including merck , bayer schering pharma and roche holding , said they were not aware that they were involved or had not received inquiries from officials . dw staff / dpa -lrb- jen -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" if there were only re-runs i 'd probably do something besides watch tv , because i would n't want to have to watch something else .

" right now , i keep monday nights free of other commitments , " the 32-year old said from her home in cologne .
" if there were only re-runs i 'd probably do something besides watch tv , because i would n't want to have to watch something else . " but kern and other german viewers are unlikely to be faced with re-runs of " lost " as the prosieben channel still has 15 of season three 's 22 episodes and can fall back on the eight episodes of season four that were already produced before the us writers ' strike began on nov .
5 . " the gap between the broadcast dates has kept us from feeling any real effects of the strike , " prosieben spokeswoman katja pichler said . germans hoping for an agreement - soon bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the writers ' strike turned the golden globes into little more than a press conference but the gap is n't as large for other series .
the fourth , and newest , season of " grey 's anatomy , " also shown on prosieben , is set to start in germany in february .
while the 11 shows produced before the strike began are waiting to be broadcast in germany , pichler said the channel has not decided what it will do if no new episodes arrive from the us . " we are hoping the strike will end , and that we do n't have to change our schedule , " she said , adding that prosieben needs six months to dub an episode of an american series into german . rtl , another major commercial german tv station , also said it has not yet determined how it will react if it runs out of " csi , " " house m.d. " or " law and order " episodes , according to spokesman claus richter . " we do n't have to be worried until autumn 2008 , " richter said .
" half the episodes for rtl 's series are ready and will be aired .
after that , we 'll have to decide if we show re-runs or something completely different . " sticking with us staples bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : complex dialog in fox 's house m.d. makes it difficult to dub , richter said but neither prosieben nor rtl , which regularly compete for the best ratings in the lucrative 14-49 age group , said they are planning to make any long-term changes to their programming based on the strike , and that they would continue buying and broadcasting us series . " we are happy with the strength of our us series and think viewers will come back when there are new episodes , " pichler said . prosieben and rtl are the two german broadcasters that rely most on us programming . according to a 2006 program analysis , 78 percent of prosieben 's and 47 percent of rtl 's fictional programming came from the united states . a matter of taste germany 's publicly funded stations rely less on us productions , with the top two , ard and zdf , buying 21 percent and 22 percent of their fiction programming from the us .
the two channels have also successfully invested in british , scandinavian and french mystery series , according to wolfgang seufert , a professor at the university of jena . " in all , there is a clear preference for german series , followed by us productions and then series from other countries , " he said , adding that a few us series beat out local productions to earn top ratings in germany . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : kern said german series do n't hold her interest as well as american ones but kern said german series just do n't hold her attention . " when i watch a german mystery i know who the murderer is in the first 10 minutes and change the channel , " kern said .
" but i get sucked into the us shows and have to see what 's going to happen next . " viewers will wait it out that 's good news for german broadcasters , since home-grown productions cost more than purchasing and dubbing foreign series , seufert said , he added that broadcasters can relax in knowing that viewers will be back whenever new episodes are ready to air . " overall tv use is relatively independent of what 's being shown , " he said , adding that the average german household has a choice of 30 channels .
" when people 's favorite show is n't on , they 'll watch something else and then switch back when their favorite show is back . " possible benefits for german writers bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german scriptwriters took to berlin 's streets to show solidarity with their us counterparts viewers who are willing to sit through repeats or watch another program lower the chances that the writers guild of america strike - especially if it ends soon - will help german writers sell more scripts , according to katharina uppenbrink , head of the german scriptwriters ' association . " if the strike ends soon , i do n't expect much of a change in stations ' policies , " she said . but if the us writers ' demands are met , it could help germans ' negotiating position when marketing their work , uppenbrink said . though differences in german and us labor structure make a direct comparisons difficult , the average pay for all the rights to an episode of a german series , which can take between weeks and months to complete depending on the author , is between 23,000 euros and 24,000 euros -lrb- $ 34,200 and $ 35,700 -rrb- , she said .

" right now , i keep monday nights free of other commitments , " the 32-year old said from her home in cologne .
" if there were only re-runs i 'd probably do something besides watch tv , because i would n't want to have to watch something else . " but kern and other german viewers are unlikely to be faced with re-runs of " lost " as the prosieben channel still has 15 of season three 's 22 episodes and can fall back on the eight episodes of season four that were already produced before the us writers ' strike began on nov .
5 . " the gap between the broadcast dates has kept us from feeling any real effects of the strike , " prosieben spokeswoman katja pichler said . germans hoping for an agreement - soon bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the writers ' strike turned the golden globes into little more than a press conference but the gap is n't as large for other series .
the fourth , and newest , season of " grey 's anatomy , " also shown on prosieben , is set to start in germany in february .
while the 11 shows produced before the strike began are waiting to be broadcast in germany , pichler said the channel has not decided what it will do if no new episodes arrive from the us . " we are hoping the strike will end , and that we do n't have to change our schedule , " she said , adding that prosieben needs six months to dub an episode of an american series into german . rtl , another major commercial german tv station , also said it has not yet determined how it will react if it runs out of " csi , " " house m.d. " or " law and order " episodes , according to spokesman claus richter . " we do n't have to be worried until autumn 2008 , " richter said .
" half the episodes for rtl 's series are ready and will be aired .
after that , we 'll have to decide if we show re-runs or something completely different . " sticking with us staples bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : complex dialog in fox 's house m.d. makes it difficult to dub , richter said but neither prosieben nor rtl , which regularly compete for the best ratings in the lucrative 14-49 age group , said they are planning to make any long-term changes to their programming based on the strike , and that they would continue buying and broadcasting us series . " we are happy with the strength of our us series and think viewers will come back when there are new episodes , " pichler said . prosieben and rtl are the two german broadcasters that rely most on us programming . according to a 2006 program analysis , 78 percent of prosieben 's and 47 percent of rtl 's fictional programming came from the united states . a matter of taste germany 's publicly funded stations rely less on us productions , with the top two , ard and zdf , buying 21 percent and 22 percent of their fiction programming from the us .
the two channels have also successfully invested in british , scandinavian and french mystery series , according to wolfgang seufert , a professor at the university of jena . " in all , there is a clear preference for german series , followed by us productions and then series from other countries , " he said , adding that a few us series beat out local productions to earn top ratings in germany . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : kern said german series do n't hold her interest as well as american ones but kern said german series just do n't hold her attention . " when i watch a german mystery i know who the murderer is in the first 10 minutes and change the channel , " kern said .
" but i get sucked into the us shows and have to see what 's going to happen next . " viewers will wait it out that 's good news for german broadcasters , since home-grown productions cost more than purchasing and dubbing foreign series , seufert said , he added that broadcasters can relax in knowing that viewers will be back whenever new episodes are ready to air . " overall tv use is relatively independent of what 's being shown , " he said , adding that the average german household has a choice of 30 channels .
" when people 's favorite show is n't on , they 'll watch something else and then switch back when their favorite show is back . " possible benefits for german writers bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german scriptwriters took to berlin 's streets to show solidarity with their us counterparts viewers who are willing to sit through repeats or watch another program lower the chances that the writers guild of america strike - especially if it ends soon - will help german writers sell more scripts , according to katharina uppenbrink , head of the german scriptwriters ' association . " if the strike ends soon , i do n't expect much of a change in stations ' policies , " she said . but if the us writers ' demands are met , it could help germans ' negotiating position when marketing their work , uppenbrink said . though differences in german and us labor structure make a direct comparisons difficult , the average pay for all the rights to an episode of a german series , which can take between weeks and months to complete depending on the author , is between 23,000 euros and 24,000 euros -lrb- $ 34,200 and $ 35,700 -rrb- , she said .
over a five-year period , us writers earn an average annual income of $ 62,000 , according to the writers guild of america . " we 're really watching what happens in the us because it would serve as a guide for germans and europeans , " she said .
" but right now it 's still too early to tell what will happen . " sean sinico send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

leading social democrats are calling for sport to become a constitutional objective in germany .
some applaud the idea , but legal experts say it 's not the way to beef up federal funding for sports . after meeting with members of the german football association -lrb- dfb -rrb- and organizers for the women 's soccer world championship , manfred schaub , a member of the social democrats ' executive , said having sport as a constitutional objective would help resolve urban space issues , and make sure sport did n't always suffer when state coffers were empty . spd head kurt beck added that he recognized the contribution of the dfb in combating racism and integrating young immigrants . however , in an interview with the taz newspaper earlier in january , former constitutional court judge udo steiner advised against the move to make sport a national objective on the grounds that such objectives only required the government to act , but did n't specify in what way . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : clubs hope inclusion in the constitution will mean more financial support " as a general rule , there is always going to be controversy about what measures are appropriate , " steiner told the taz .
" if sport becomes a national objective , it probably would n't receive one single euro more .
political priorities determine how government money is distributed , and that is how it should be . " but the general director of the german olympic committee , michael vesper , said late last year that he welcomed the social democrats ' support for the initiative . " it is good news for sport , especially for the 7.5 million volunteers involved , " he said in a statement . a private matter ? nearly 30 percent of germany 's population is a member in a sports association . " there are more than 90,000 sports clubs and they help to keep our communities together , " vesper said .
" the inclusion of sport as national objective … can back community-spirited sports and give greater power to promote its aims . " however , speaking at a government hearing on the subject in 2007 , friedhelm hufen , a constitutional expert at the university of mainz , emphasized that the purpose of the constitution was not to recognize the efforts of volunteers and organizations . objectives currently in the german constitution include democracy , rule of law , environmental protection and animal protection , which , in 2002 , was the most recent addition .
a recent proposal also called for special protection of children in the constitution . most states support sport bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : sport is part of nearly all state constitutions fifteen of germany 's 16 states have already added sport to their list of objectives in their state constitutions .
under the federal constitution , the german government is responsible for supporting top-level sports . the social democrats have said before they wanted culture to be included as a new constitutional objective , along with sport .
the initiative also has the support of the left party and the free-market liberal free democrats , who originally called for the constitutional changes back in 2006 . as constitutional amendments require a two-thirds majority , they need the backing of chancellor angela merkel 's christian democrats .
however , the party made it clear in december 2007 that it would n't support any constitution changes within the current legislature period , which runs to may 2009 . dw staff -lrb- kh -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

but some in say the move may endanger lives in germany . the deployment of 250 combat troops , who would join in the search for and fight against terrorists , would mark a departure from the bundeswehr 's current mission .
to date only stabilization forces have been deployed to the main german base at masar-i-sharif . the social democratic party 's defense spokesman , rainer arnold , told the passauer neue presse on wednesday , jan .
16 , that the german army had begun making preparations for the deployment . " this task falls to germany in the summer , " he said , adding that the mission , slated to start in july , signaled a " new quality " in the german engagement in afghanistan .

" if other countries are no longer available to do this task after september , then we will do it ourselves , " the head of the german federal armed forces association , bernhard gertz , told the mitteldeutsche zeitung .
" it 's in the interest of our own soldiers . " in a separate interview with the daily der tagesspiegel , gertz added : " it is clear that we will take over this task . " government spokesman ulrich wilhelm , however , said that the nato decision on which country takes over the quick response force is not expected to be made before the end of january . the defense ministry in berlin also confirmed that planning was underway and said that the deployment fell under the mandate for german forces in afghanistan renewed by parliament last year . mission covered by mandate ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany also has reconnaissance jets stationed in afghanistan but the ministry denied that the deployment would add a " new quality " to the bundeswehr 's mission in afghanistan . spokesman thomas raab said the army 's current mission already included " infantry-like components , " and that it was already possible for germans to escort convoys and help other nations ' troops or nationals . but some in germany have questioned whether the new deployment makes sense for the bundeswehr . " with the planned deployment of bundeswehr combat units , the german government is , against all better judgment , bringing terror into the country , " opposition left party leader oskar lafontaine said . new dangers bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : polls show most german oppose the bundeswehr 's deployment to afghanistan greens party defense expert winfried nachtwei told tagesschau.de that " the risk of slipping into hard situations would be unavoidable " should germany join the quick reaction force . that 's a fact gertz said germany would have to get used to since the soldiers would be called on to fight if their comrades or the people they are protecting are in danger . " you have to assume that these situations will arise , " he told the mitteldeutsche zeitung .
" and you can not expect from the outset that it will all occur without any victims . " pacifist organizations have said they intend to protest the bundeswehr 's plans . in october , the bundestag renewed the mandate for 3,500 german troops in afghanistan , combining two previous mandates .
up to 3,000 troops , part of nato 's forces in the country , are deployed in a training , reconstruction and security mission in afghanistan 's relatively peaceful north . dw staff -lrb- sms -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

16 , that the finnish company was a " locust which got money in germany and then said without warning ' we are going to romania ' to maybe get more public funds there . " he also said he would attempt to recover the 60 million euros -lrb- $ 89 million -rrb- in subsidies the state had paid the company .
nokia also received about 28 million euros from the federal government . " we are not simply going to accept this - this is not yet the end of the debate , " he added . german politicians have accused international companies of behaving like " locusts " to describe what they deem an excessive greed for profits . but getting any payments from nokia is likely to prove difficult .
north rhine-westphalia 's finance minister , christa thoben , said a deal holding the company to bochum , where it employed some 2,000 people , in exchange for subsidies ran out before nokia announced its plans to leave . subsidies lure hi-tech companies bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germans are calling on the eu to show nokia received no money from the bloc to relocate " you ca n't help but notice that the required period of retention ran out in september 2006 and half a year later nokia makes the decision to build a new plant romania , " she said . but german deputy economy minister hartmut schauerte told reporters berlin would request that the eu look into charges that nokia is profiting from european union subsidies in its decision to move production from germany to hungry and romania . " we are going to check with the european commission if the relocation of this site is being supported financially by european structural funds , " he said . " that must not be the case . " schauerte added germany was prepared for " intense talks " with nokia to try to strike a deal to keep the bochum plant open . hungarian support for move bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : sundbäck announced the bochum plant 's closure on tuesday nokia board member veli sundbäck said the company did not cash in on any eu subsidies in moving production to romania and hungry , both of which are eu members .
he added that the company , like any other , did register for financial support from the hungarian government .
hungary pays for up to 50 percent of costs for hi-tech companies that settle there . since 2005 , when the eu was accused of paying for aeg to move production within the eu from germany to poland , the bloc has issued guidelines that prohibit the subsidization of manufacturing shifts among member states . eu commission president jose manuel barroso said wednesday that there was little to criticize in nokia 's decision to move production to other eu member states . " if a shift from finland to germany is possible , then a shift from germany to romania also has to be possible , " he said . nokia the last to leave bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : nokia employees demonstrated to protest the plant 's closure the decision to close the bochum plant by the middle of the year makes nokia the last cell phone manufacturer to leave germany .
since 2006 , some 6,000 jobs at cell phone plants have been cut in germany as benq , once part of siemens , and motorola stopped german production . sundbäck said nokia could not convince supplier to setup shop near bochum and that the factory was not " internationally competitive . " " we are following nokia 's global strategy , which focuses on cost-effectiveness and logistics flexibility , " he said . german labor leaders , however , saying the factory was in the black . " the location is running really well , profits are being made here , " said ulrike kleinebrahm , the head of bochum 's ig-metall union , adding that the plant 's closure was a " catastrophe for bochum . " politicians and union leaders also said germany 's high labor costs , another reason cited by nokia for closing the plant , make up only 5 percent of production expenses , but salary costs in romania are a 10th of what companies pay in germany . nokia booked record results in the third quarter of 2007 .
its revenues climbed 28 percent to 12.9 billion euros compared to the same time the year before .
cell phone business is responsible for about 25 percent of the finnish company 's 1.56 billion euros in profits . dw staff -lrb- sms -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

regulators worry the big drug makers are acting to keep generics off the market , among other issues . the dawn raids and sector inquiry , which the eu commission said was not based on specific suspected violations , could lead to cartel charges against companies and potentially huge fines .
patents are the life blood of the pharmaceutical industry but critics allege some companies misuse patent rights to delay the introduction of generic medicines in unjustified ways .
the cost of medicines is a hot-button issue in europe , where governments are seeking to trim health care costs at the same time as encouraging the development of the pharmaceutical and biotechnology sectors .
three of europe 's biggest drug makers - astrazeneca , glaxosmithkline and sanofi-aventis - acknowledged they had been approached by eu regulators as part of the antitrust probe .
us-based pfizer , the world 's top drug maker , also confirmed it was being investigated .
looking for " something rotten " regulators said they suspect the firms involved may be protecting their own market shares at the expense of introducing better drugs .
" a sector inquiry is something we engage in if we have the feeling that the sector is not working optimally ... "
eu competition commissioner neelie kroes said .
" if there is a feeling that something is rotten in the state , or something could be rotten , let 's take the opportunity to find out , " she added .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : eu commissioner kroes takes on a hot-button issue european citizens spend some 200 billion euros -lrb- $ 297 billion -rrb- a year on pharmaceutical products - the equivalent of 400 euros for every man , woman and child in the eu , kroes said .
unexplained drop in product launches but over the last decade , the number of new components launched on the market has fallen from an average of 40 per year between 1995 and 1999 , to just 28 per year between 2000 and 2004 .
" if innovative products are n't being produced , and cheaper generic alternatives are being delayed , we need to find out why , " kroes said .
the raids were carried out in a number of eu states with the help of local authorities , and targeted both firms based in europe and those based outside the continent who are active in its market .
kroes would not comment on which specific countries and companies were involved .
major concerns confirm probe however , astrazeneca said in a statement on wednesday : " we confirm that we are part of a sector inquiry instituted by the european commission on jan .
15 , 2008 into aspects of the pharmaceutical industry . "
the company added it was fully cooperating with the probe .
" the inquiry relates to the introduction of innovative and generic medicines for human consumption onto the market and covers commercial practices , including the use of patents , " the statement added .
" we understand that several companies have been similarly approached in connection with the inquiry . "
a spokesman for glaxosmithkline said the british group had also been visited by eu regulators as part of the investigation .
" we have been contacted by them , " the gsk spokesman said .
" i can not say the date or which site or where but we can confirm we have been visited by them . "
patent disputes at heart of issue the inquiry will pay particular attention to deals between drugs firms , such as settlements in patent disputes , and to the question of whether some companies could have abused their patent and legal rights to keep rivals out of the market .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : pfizer also got a visit from eu regulators given that such questions deal with highly-sensitive information which " may be easily withheld , concealed or destroyed , " the use of unannounced inspections was " considered appropriate , " kroes said .
the primary aim of the inquiry is to gather and analyze information on the operation of the pharmaceuticals market .
however , if it brings to light evidence of specific wrong-doing , such cases will be dealt with as they arise , she said .
the commission is tasked with ensuring that eu states and companies obey eu laws , including those on competition .
in the last year alone , it imposed fines of over 3 billion euros -lrb- $ 4.5 billion -rrb- on firms which had broken competition law .
unlike in those cartel cases , the raids on the drugs sector were not prompted by specific indications of illegal activity , but by a more general sense that the eu market is not working , kroes stressed .
" the inquiry is not investigating specific companies and is not based on specific evidence , " she said .
however , it would focus on " a couple of issues where we are not feeling safe that it is pro-competitive , " she added .
astrazeneca previously faced fines but during a news conference , kroes cited astrazeneca as a clear example of a company in which competition was not functioning optimally , referring to a 2005 decision in which the commission fined the company 60 million euros .
the commission found that astrazeneca had misused the patent system to delay market entry of rivals to its ulcer drug losec .

regulators worry the big drug makers are acting to keep generics off the market , among other issues . the dawn raids and sector inquiry , which the eu commission said was not based on specific suspected violations , could lead to cartel charges against companies and potentially huge fines .
patents are the life blood of the pharmaceutical industry but critics allege some companies misuse patent rights to delay the introduction of generic medicines in unjustified ways .
the cost of medicines is a hot-button issue in europe , where governments are seeking to trim health care costs at the same time as encouraging the development of the pharmaceutical and biotechnology sectors .
three of europe 's biggest drug makers - astrazeneca , glaxosmithkline and sanofi-aventis - acknowledged they had been approached by eu regulators as part of the antitrust probe .
us-based pfizer , the world 's top drug maker , also confirmed it was being investigated .
looking for " something rotten " regulators said they suspect the firms involved may be protecting their own market shares at the expense of introducing better drugs .
" a sector inquiry is something we engage in if we have the feeling that the sector is not working optimally ... "
eu competition commissioner neelie kroes said .
" if there is a feeling that something is rotten in the state , or something could be rotten , let 's take the opportunity to find out , " she added .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : eu commissioner kroes takes on a hot-button issue european citizens spend some 200 billion euros -lrb- $ 297 billion -rrb- a year on pharmaceutical products - the equivalent of 400 euros for every man , woman and child in the eu , kroes said .
unexplained drop in product launches but over the last decade , the number of new components launched on the market has fallen from an average of 40 per year between 1995 and 1999 , to just 28 per year between 2000 and 2004 .
" if innovative products are n't being produced , and cheaper generic alternatives are being delayed , we need to find out why , " kroes said .
the raids were carried out in a number of eu states with the help of local authorities , and targeted both firms based in europe and those based outside the continent who are active in its market .
kroes would not comment on which specific countries and companies were involved .
major concerns confirm probe however , astrazeneca said in a statement on wednesday : " we confirm that we are part of a sector inquiry instituted by the european commission on jan .
15 , 2008 into aspects of the pharmaceutical industry . "
the company added it was fully cooperating with the probe .
" the inquiry relates to the introduction of innovative and generic medicines for human consumption onto the market and covers commercial practices , including the use of patents , " the statement added .
" we understand that several companies have been similarly approached in connection with the inquiry . "
a spokesman for glaxosmithkline said the british group had also been visited by eu regulators as part of the investigation .
" we have been contacted by them , " the gsk spokesman said .
" i can not say the date or which site or where but we can confirm we have been visited by them . "
patent disputes at heart of issue the inquiry will pay particular attention to deals between drugs firms , such as settlements in patent disputes , and to the question of whether some companies could have abused their patent and legal rights to keep rivals out of the market .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : pfizer also got a visit from eu regulators given that such questions deal with highly-sensitive information which " may be easily withheld , concealed or destroyed , " the use of unannounced inspections was " considered appropriate , " kroes said .
the primary aim of the inquiry is to gather and analyze information on the operation of the pharmaceuticals market .
however , if it brings to light evidence of specific wrong-doing , such cases will be dealt with as they arise , she said .
the commission is tasked with ensuring that eu states and companies obey eu laws , including those on competition .
in the last year alone , it imposed fines of over 3 billion euros -lrb- $ 4.5 billion -rrb- on firms which had broken competition law .
unlike in those cartel cases , the raids on the drugs sector were not prompted by specific indications of illegal activity , but by a more general sense that the eu market is not working , kroes stressed .
" the inquiry is not investigating specific companies and is not based on specific evidence , " she said .
however , it would focus on " a couple of issues where we are not feeling safe that it is pro-competitive , " she added .
astrazeneca previously faced fines but during a news conference , kroes cited astrazeneca as a clear example of a company in which competition was not functioning optimally , referring to a 2005 decision in which the commission fined the company 60 million euros .
the commission found that astrazeneca had misused the patent system to delay market entry of rivals to its ulcer drug losec .

but if germany fails , a nuclear renaissance may result , says dw 's jens thurau . german environment minister sigmar gabriel had his chance to shine in december at the bali climate conference .
no country , the energetic social democratic politician says , is similarly engaged in protecting the climate as germany . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : by 2020 the country will reduce its emissions of greenhouse gasses by 40 percent by producing more energy from renewable sources , by saving energy , by investing billions in building renovations , by using energy from clean coal and gas power stations .
and without using nuclear power .
by 2021 all 17 of germany 's nuclear power plants - one after another - will be shut down . when compared to other industrialized nations , that decision makes germany more and more of an outsider .
a new nuclear power plant is being built in finland .
france , the united states and japan also have plans for new nuclear power stations .
great britain recently decided to put more of an emphasis on nuclear power .
these governments argue that the international community 's goals , which climate change researchers still call insufficient , to reduce greenhouse gas emissions can only be met with co2-free nuclear power . still , there are good reasons for german to turn its back on nuclear power .
some 440 nuclear power stations in 31 countries create about 16 percent of electricity worldwide .
more than 1,000 new nuclear power stations would have to be built to order to reduce the greenhouse effect with nuclear power - that 's not foreseeable . but even more importantly , investment in new nuclear power stations is expensive , though the necessary raw material - uranium - is cheap .
the expense means that nuclear power plants require long operating times to be profitable for investors , which sets the means of decades-worth of energy production in stone and hinders investment in non-fossil energy production . but if what climate researchers are saying is true , then there need to be recognizable reductions in greenhouse gasses by 2020 in order to save the climate .
this is exactly where many countries see a role for nuclear energy : as a transition to a solar age offering co2-free energy production in the next 20 to 50 years . germany has , at least for the moment , taken an uncompromising path : for lots of environmental technology and against nuclear power . the next few years will be decisive .
if germany proves that both an engaged climate policy and phasing out nuclear power are not mutually exclusive , then other countries will follow .
if germany fails , there will be an increasing nuclear energy , at least in industrialized nations , india , china and brazil .
in the world 's poorer countries , particularly in africa , nuclear power is still too expensive anyway . jens thurau is a dw-tv correspondent and environment expert -lrb- sms -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

little surprise , then , that a key investment-confidence indicator has plunged . peter bofinger and wolfgang franz , two of the five so-called " wise men " who act as economic advisers to the german government , said the peak of the financial market crisis has not yet been reached . " i expect the peak of the financial crisis to be reached at mid-year , " bofinger told the berliner zeitung newspaper .
bofinger said he was n't surprised by an overall sell-off on the dax on tuesday , jan .
15 , after german real-estate investment firm hypo real estate plunged a dizzying 35 percent - the steepest one-day price drop the dax has seen to date .
the fall came after the company announced it was writing off 390 million euros -lrb- $ 580 million -rrb- on us subprime debt losses .
shares had made back some gains in early wednesday trading .
effects of us real-estate pressure investors were taken by surprise by the write-off , because hypo real estate 's management had repeatedly said that the firm would be unscathed by the credit crunch , which has swept world markets .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hypo real estate took one of the biggest falls in dax history " the interest rate adjustments for buyers of us real estate are now coming into effect , and that is steadily increasing pressure on real estate markets , " bofinger told the berliner zeitung .
meanwhile , franz said the financial market crisis is not yet over , adding that interest-rate increases for mortgages , which are now coming into effect , will " create problems for some debtors , increasing the likelihood of defaults at banks and also here in germany . "
investors eye us for recession signals hypo real estate 's announcement on tuesday came in the wake of more grim news out of the us financial sector ; america 's biggest bank , citigroup , reported that it suffered a record $ 9.83 billion fourth-quarter loss .
meanwhile , concerns that a possible us recession will deepen the slowdown in europe 's largest economy pushed down a key german investor-confidence index .
a study by the zew center for european economic research published on tuesday showed investor confidence in germany fell to its lowest point in 15 years .
investor confidence was at minus 41.6 , from minus 37.2 a month earlier - the eighth straight decline .
it was a greater drop than analysts had expected . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hope for better days even as investor confidence slumped in germany in january goldman sachs and merrill lynch have forecast that the us will slip into recession this year for the first time since 2001 , as the housing slump , which has driven up credit costs globally , curbs consumer spending .

german growth is slowing " the bad news flow from the us banking sector has n't abated , " alexander koch , an economist at unicredit markets and investments in munich , told bloomberg news service .
" there are real concerns about a us recession dragging down german economic growth . "
german economic growth slowed to 2.5 percent last year from 2.9 percent in 2006 , which was the fastest expansion since the turn of the decade , the federal statistics office said on wednesday .

little surprise , then , that a key investment-confidence indicator has plunged . peter bofinger and wolfgang franz , two of the five so-called " wise men " who act as economic advisers to the german government , said the peak of the financial market crisis has not yet been reached . " i expect the peak of the financial crisis to be reached at mid-year , " bofinger told the berliner zeitung newspaper .
bofinger said he was n't surprised by an overall sell-off on the dax on tuesday , jan .
15 , after german real-estate investment firm hypo real estate plunged a dizzying 35 percent - the steepest one-day price drop the dax has seen to date .
the fall came after the company announced it was writing off 390 million euros -lrb- $ 580 million -rrb- on us subprime debt losses .
shares had made back some gains in early wednesday trading .
effects of us real-estate pressure investors were taken by surprise by the write-off , because hypo real estate 's management had repeatedly said that the firm would be unscathed by the credit crunch , which has swept world markets .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hypo real estate took one of the biggest falls in dax history " the interest rate adjustments for buyers of us real estate are now coming into effect , and that is steadily increasing pressure on real estate markets , " bofinger told the berliner zeitung .
meanwhile , franz said the financial market crisis is not yet over , adding that interest-rate increases for mortgages , which are now coming into effect , will " create problems for some debtors , increasing the likelihood of defaults at banks and also here in germany . "
investors eye us for recession signals hypo real estate 's announcement on tuesday came in the wake of more grim news out of the us financial sector ; america 's biggest bank , citigroup , reported that it suffered a record $ 9.83 billion fourth-quarter loss .
meanwhile , concerns that a possible us recession will deepen the slowdown in europe 's largest economy pushed down a key german investor-confidence index .
a study by the zew center for european economic research published on tuesday showed investor confidence in germany fell to its lowest point in 15 years .
investor confidence was at minus 41.6 , from minus 37.2 a month earlier - the eighth straight decline .
it was a greater drop than analysts had expected . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hope for better days even as investor confidence slumped in germany in january goldman sachs and merrill lynch have forecast that the us will slip into recession this year for the first time since 2001 , as the housing slump , which has driven up credit costs globally , curbs consumer spending .

leading social democrats are calling for sport to become a constitutional objective in germany .
some applaud the idea , but legal experts say it 's not the way to beef up federal funding for sports . after meeting with members of the german football association -lrb- dfb -rrb- and organizers for the women 's soccer world championship , manfred schaub , a member of the social democrats ' executive , said having sport as a constitutional objective would help resolve urban space issues , and make sure sport did n't always suffer when state coffers were empty . spd head kurt beck added that he recognized the contribution of the dfb in combating racism and integrating young immigrants . however , in an interview with the taz newspaper earlier in january , former constitutional court judge udo steiner advised against the move to make sport a national objective on the grounds that such objectives only required the government to act , but did n't specify in what way . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : clubs hope inclusion in the constitution will mean more financial support " as a general rule , there is always going to be controversy about what measures are appropriate , " steiner told the taz .

17 , came after street protests by anti-clerical students and professors on tuesday afternoon . it is the first cancellation of an appearance by the pontiff in the face of hostility since his election in april 2005 . " following the well-known events of these days ... it was considered appropriate to cancel the event , " the vatican said in a statement . benedict , who had been scheduled to deliver a speech at the start of la sapienza 's academic year , would still send his text to the university , the statement said . escalating dissent while tensions around the pontiff 's visit had escalated throughout the day with some 100 students staging a sit-in at la sapienza 's main hall , the vatican 's evening announcement came as a surprise . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : pope benedict xvi is no stranger to controversy earlier on tuesday afternoon , giovanni maria vian , the editor of the vatican 's mouthpiece newspaper l 'osservatore romano , lamented the controversy stirred by the pontiff 's planned visit , but predicted it would go ahead . and university rector renato guarini said that while opponents of the visit would be allowed to hold a demonstration on campus on thursday , the pontiff 's invitation was still valid . " the pope is a man of culture and great thinker " who should be allowed to have his say , guarini said in an interview with private news television news channel skytg24 . academics oppose pope 's stance the opposition to the planned visit began when a group of 67 academics signed a letter requesting that guarini withdraw the invitation to the pope . in the letter , the academics said they opposed the pontiff 's " incongruous " visit to a secular university , and called on the university to revoke the " disconcerting invitation " to benedict , whom they accuse of being a reactionary and an opponent of free thought and research . many scientists fault the intellectual , conservative and tradition-minded pope for a series of positions he has taken that they say subordinate science and reason to faith . the faculty protest against the visit was spearheaded by a well-known physicist , marcello cini , a professor emeritus at la sapienza . pope " is playing the victim " on learning of the cancellation , cini told afp news service , " i 'm satisfied , that 's what i was asking for .
i thought , and i continue to think , that this visit was ambiguous and an attack on the independence of culture and the university . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some protesters wore benedict masks he added : " by cancelling , he is playing the victim , which is very intelligent .
it will be a pretext for accusing us of refusing dialogue . " in their letter , the academics cited a 1990 speech made by benedict when he was still a cardinal , in which he allegedly justified the catholic church 's actions against galileo , the 17th-century physicist who ran afoul of church doctrine by insisting that the earth orbits the sun . during the 1990 speech delivered in parma , italy , the then-cardinal joseph ratzinger had quoted austrian-born philosopher paul feyerabend as saying that the church 's 1633 heresy trial against galileo had been " reasonable and fair . " in court , galileo was forced to recant his theories . students focus on galileo comments benedict " condemns centuries of scientific and cultural growth by affirming anachronistic dogmas such as creationism , while attacking scientific free-thought and promoting mandatory heterosexuality , " students opposed to the visit , using the name physics collective , said on their web site . the students opposed to the visit kicked off an " anti-clergy week " on monday by showing a film on galileo . on monday , vatican radio said attempts to prevent benedict from speaking at the campus amounted to censorship . catholic and conservative politicians have condemned the university 's actions as a sign of intolerance , while opinions in the country 's governing center-left have been split , with some saying the pontiff 's opponents have the right to show their dissent . dw staff -lrb- jen -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

leading social democrats are calling for sport to become a constitutional objective in germany .
some applaud the idea , but legal experts say it 's not the way to beef up federal funding for sports . after meeting with members of the german football association -lrb- dfb -rrb- and organizers for the women 's soccer world championship , manfred schaub , a member of the social democrats ' executive , said having sport as a constitutional objective would help resolve urban space issues , and make sure sport did n't always suffer when state coffers were empty . spd head kurt beck added that he recognized the contribution of the dfb in combating racism and integrating young immigrants . however , in an interview with the taz newspaper earlier in january , former constitutional court judge udo steiner advised against the move to make sport a national objective on the grounds that such objectives only required the government to act , but did n't specify in what way . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : clubs hope inclusion in the constitution will mean more financial support " as a general rule , there is always going to be controversy about what measures are appropriate , " steiner told the taz .
" if sport becomes a national objective , it probably would n't receive one single euro more .
political priorities determine how government money is distributed , and that is how it should be . " but the general director of the german olympic committee , michael vesper , said late last year that he welcomed the social democrats ' support for the initiative . " it is good news for sport , especially for the 7.5 million volunteers involved , " he said in a statement . a private matter ? nearly 30 percent of germany 's population is a member in a sports association . " there are more than 90,000 sports clubs and they help to keep our communities together , " vesper said .
" the inclusion of sport as national objective … can back community-spirited sports and give greater power to promote its aims . " however , speaking at a government hearing on the subject in 2007 , friedhelm hufen , a constitutional expert at the university of mainz , emphasized that the purpose of the constitution was not to recognize the efforts of volunteers and organizations . objectives currently in the german constitution include democracy , rule of law , environmental protection and animal protection , which , in 2002 , was the most recent addition .
a recent proposal also called for special protection of children in the constitution . most states support sport bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : sport is part of nearly all state constitutions fifteen of germany 's 16 states have already added sport to their list of objectives in their state constitutions .
under the federal constitution , the german government is responsible for supporting top-level sports . the social democrats have said before they wanted culture to be included as a new constitutional objective , along with sport .
the initiative also has the support of the left party and the free-market liberal free democrats , who originally called for the constitutional changes back in 2006 . as constitutional amendments require a two-thirds majority , they need the backing of chancellor angela merkel 's christian democrats .
however , the party made it clear in december 2007 that it would n't support any constitution changes within the current legislature period , which runs to may 2009 . dw staff -lrb- kh -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

but if germany fails , a nuclear renaissance may result , says dw 's jens thurau . german environment minister sigmar gabriel had his chance to shine in december at the bali climate conference .
no country , the energetic social democratic politician says , is similarly engaged in protecting the climate as germany . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : by 2020 the country will reduce its emissions of greenhouse gasses by 40 percent by producing more energy from renewable sources , by saving energy , by investing billions in building renovations , by using energy from clean coal and gas power stations .
and without using nuclear power .
by 2021 all 17 of germany 's nuclear power plants - one after another - will be shut down . when compared to other industrialized nations , that decision makes germany more and more of an outsider .
a new nuclear power plant is being built in finland .
france , the united states and japan also have plans for new nuclear power stations .
great britain recently decided to put more of an emphasis on nuclear power .
these governments argue that the international community 's goals , which climate change researchers still call insufficient , to reduce greenhouse gas emissions can only be met with co2-free nuclear power . still , there are good reasons for german to turn its back on nuclear power .
some 440 nuclear power stations in 31 countries create about 16 percent of electricity worldwide .
more than 1,000 new nuclear power stations would have to be built to order to reduce the greenhouse effect with nuclear power - that 's not foreseeable . but even more importantly , investment in new nuclear power stations is expensive , though the necessary raw material - uranium - is cheap .
the expense means that nuclear power plants require long operating times to be profitable for investors , which sets the means of decades-worth of energy production in stone and hinders investment in non-fossil energy production . but if what climate researchers are saying is true , then there need to be recognizable reductions in greenhouse gasses by 2020 in order to save the climate .
this is exactly where many countries see a role for nuclear energy : as a transition to a solar age offering co2-free energy production in the next 20 to 50 years . germany has , at least for the moment , taken an uncompromising path : for lots of environmental technology and against nuclear power . the next few years will be decisive .
if germany proves that both an engaged climate policy and phasing out nuclear power are not mutually exclusive , then other countries will follow .
if germany fails , there will be an increasing nuclear energy , at least in industrialized nations , india , china and brazil .
in the world 's poorer countries , particularly in africa , nuclear power is still too expensive anyway . jens thurau is a dw-tv correspondent and environment expert -lrb- sms -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" right now , i keep monday nights free of other commitments , " the 32-year old said from her home in cologne .
" if there were only re-runs i 'd probably do something besides watch tv , because i would n't want to have to watch something else . " but kern and other german viewers are unlikely to be faced with re-runs of " lost " as the prosieben channel still has 15 of season three 's 22 episodes and can fall back on the eight episodes of season four that were already produced before the us writers ' strike began on nov .
5 . " the gap between the broadcast dates has kept us from feeling any real effects of the strike , " prosieben spokeswoman katja pichler said . germans hoping for an agreement - soon bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the writers ' strike turned the golden globes into little more than a press conference but the gap is n't as large for other series .
the fourth , and newest , season of " grey 's anatomy , " also shown on prosieben , is set to start in germany in february .
while the 11 shows produced before the strike began are waiting to be broadcast in germany , pichler said the channel has not decided what it will do if no new episodes arrive from the us . " we are hoping the strike will end , and that we do n't have to change our schedule , " she said , adding that prosieben needs six months to dub an episode of an american series into german . rtl , another major commercial german tv station , also said it has not yet determined how it will react if it runs out of " csi , " " house m.d. " or " law and order " episodes , according to spokesman claus richter . " we do n't have to be worried until autumn 2008 , " richter said .
" half the episodes for rtl 's series are ready and will be aired .
after that , we 'll have to decide if we show re-runs or something completely different . " sticking with us staples bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : complex dialog in fox 's house m.d. makes it difficult to dub , richter said but neither prosieben nor rtl , which regularly compete for the best ratings in the lucrative 14-49 age group , said they are planning to make any long-term changes to their programming based on the strike , and that they would continue buying and broadcasting us series . " we are happy with the strength of our us series and think viewers will come back when there are new episodes , " pichler said . prosieben and rtl are the two german broadcasters that rely most on us programming . according to a 2006 program analysis , 78 percent of prosieben 's and 47 percent of rtl 's fictional programming came from the united states . a matter of taste germany 's publicly funded stations rely less on us productions , with the top two , ard and zdf , buying 21 percent and 22 percent of their fiction programming from the us .
the two channels have also successfully invested in british , scandinavian and french mystery series , according to wolfgang seufert , a professor at the university of jena . " in all , there is a clear preference for german series , followed by us productions and then series from other countries , " he said , adding that a few us series beat out local productions to earn top ratings in germany . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : kern said german series do n't hold her interest as well as american ones but kern said german series just do n't hold her attention . " when i watch a german mystery i know who the murderer is in the first 10 minutes and change the channel , " kern said .
" but i get sucked into the us shows and have to see what 's going to happen next . " viewers will wait it out that 's good news for german broadcasters , since home-grown productions cost more than purchasing and dubbing foreign series , seufert said , he added that broadcasters can relax in knowing that viewers will be back whenever new episodes are ready to air . " overall tv use is relatively independent of what 's being shown , " he said , adding that the average german household has a choice of 30 channels .
" when people 's favorite show is n't on , they 'll watch something else and then switch back when their favorite show is back . " possible benefits for german writers bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german scriptwriters took to berlin 's streets to show solidarity with their us counterparts viewers who are willing to sit through repeats or watch another program lower the chances that the writers guild of america strike - especially if it ends soon - will help german writers sell more scripts , according to katharina uppenbrink , head of the german scriptwriters ' association .

but some in say the move may endanger lives in germany . the deployment of 250 combat troops , who would join in the search for and fight against terrorists , would mark a departure from the bundeswehr 's current mission .
to date only stabilization forces have been deployed to the main german base at masar-i-sharif . the social democratic party 's defense spokesman , rainer arnold , told the passauer neue presse on wednesday , jan .
16 , that the german army had begun making preparations for the deployment . " this task falls to germany in the summer , " he said , adding that the mission , slated to start in july , signaled a " new quality " in the german engagement in afghanistan .
part of the new mission could include pursuing terrorists , arnold told the paper . ready to replace norwegians bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany may be called on to replace other nato troops leaving this year with 350 norwegian troops leaving afghanistan by the middle of the year and germany heading nato 's international security and assistance force -lrb- isaf -rrb- in the country 's north , it is likely that the bundeswehr will have to replace the norwegians . " if other countries are no longer available to do this task after september , then we will do it ourselves , " the head of the german federal armed forces association , bernhard gertz , told the mitteldeutsche zeitung .
" it 's in the interest of our own soldiers . " in a separate interview with the daily der tagesspiegel , gertz added : " it is clear that we will take over this task . " government spokesman ulrich wilhelm , however , said that the nato decision on which country takes over the quick response force is not expected to be made before the end of january . the defense ministry in berlin also confirmed that planning was underway and said that the deployment fell under the mandate for german forces in afghanistan renewed by parliament last year . mission covered by mandate ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany also has reconnaissance jets stationed in afghanistan but the ministry denied that the deployment would add a " new quality " to the bundeswehr 's mission in afghanistan . spokesman thomas raab said the army 's current mission already included " infantry-like components , " and that it was already possible for germans to escort convoys and help other nations ' troops or nationals . but some in germany have questioned whether the new deployment makes sense for the bundeswehr . " with the planned deployment of bundeswehr combat units , the german government is , against all better judgment , bringing terror into the country , " opposition left party leader oskar lafontaine said . new dangers bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : polls show most german oppose the bundeswehr 's deployment to afghanistan greens party defense expert winfried nachtwei told tagesschau.de that " the risk of slipping into hard situations would be unavoidable " should germany join the quick reaction force . that 's a fact gertz said germany would have to get used to since the soldiers would be called on to fight if their comrades or the people they are protecting are in danger . " you have to assume that these situations will arise , " he told the mitteldeutsche zeitung .
" and you can not expect from the outset that it will all occur without any victims . " pacifist organizations have said they intend to protest the bundeswehr 's plans . in october , the bundestag renewed the mandate for 3,500 german troops in afghanistan , combining two previous mandates .
up to 3,000 troops , part of nato 's forces in the country , are deployed in a training , reconstruction and security mission in afghanistan 's relatively peaceful north . dw staff -lrb- sms -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

but if germany fails , a nuclear renaissance may result , says dw 's jens thurau . german environment minister sigmar gabriel had his chance to shine in december at the bali climate conference .
no country , the energetic social democratic politician says , is similarly engaged in protecting the climate as germany . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : by 2020 the country will reduce its emissions of greenhouse gasses by 40 percent by producing more energy from renewable sources , by saving energy , by investing billions in building renovations , by using energy from clean coal and gas power stations .
and without using nuclear power .
by 2021 all 17 of germany 's nuclear power plants - one after another - will be shut down . when compared to other industrialized nations , that decision makes germany more and more of an outsider .
a new nuclear power plant is being built in finland .
france , the united states and japan also have plans for new nuclear power stations .
great britain recently decided to put more of an emphasis on nuclear power .

but if germany fails , a nuclear renaissance may result , says dw 's jens thurau . german environment minister sigmar gabriel had his chance to shine in december at the bali climate conference .
no country , the energetic social democratic politician says , is similarly engaged in protecting the climate as germany . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : by 2020 the country will reduce its emissions of greenhouse gasses by 40 percent by producing more energy from renewable sources , by saving energy , by investing billions in building renovations , by using energy from clean coal and gas power stations .
and without using nuclear power .
by 2021 all 17 of germany 's nuclear power plants - one after another - will be shut down . when compared to other industrialized nations , that decision makes germany more and more of an outsider .
a new nuclear power plant is being built in finland .
france , the united states and japan also have plans for new nuclear power stations .

regulators worry the big drug makers are acting to keep generics off the market , among other issues . the dawn raids and sector inquiry , which the eu commission said was not based on specific suspected violations , could lead to cartel charges against companies and potentially huge fines .
patents are the life blood of the pharmaceutical industry but critics allege some companies misuse patent rights to delay the introduction of generic medicines in unjustified ways .
the cost of medicines is a hot-button issue in europe , where governments are seeking to trim health care costs at the same time as encouraging the development of the pharmaceutical and biotechnology sectors .
three of europe 's biggest drug makers - astrazeneca , glaxosmithkline and sanofi-aventis - acknowledged they had been approached by eu regulators as part of the antitrust probe .
us-based pfizer , the world 's top drug maker , also confirmed it was being investigated .
looking for " something rotten " regulators said they suspect the firms involved may be protecting their own market shares at the expense of introducing better drugs .
" a sector inquiry is something we engage in if we have the feeling that the sector is not working optimally ... "
eu competition commissioner neelie kroes said .
" if there is a feeling that something is rotten in the state , or something could be rotten , let 's take the opportunity to find out , " she added .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : eu commissioner kroes takes on a hot-button issue european citizens spend some 200 billion euros -lrb- $ 297 billion -rrb- a year on pharmaceutical products - the equivalent of 400 euros for every man , woman and child in the eu , kroes said .
unexplained drop in product launches but over the last decade , the number of new components launched on the market has fallen from an average of 40 per year between 1995 and 1999 , to just 28 per year between 2000 and 2004 .
" if innovative products are n't being produced , and cheaper generic alternatives are being delayed , we need to find out why , " kroes said .
the raids were carried out in a number of eu states with the help of local authorities , and targeted both firms based in europe and those based outside the continent who are active in its market .
kroes would not comment on which specific countries and companies were involved .
major concerns confirm probe however , astrazeneca said in a statement on wednesday : " we confirm that we are part of a sector inquiry instituted by the european commission on jan .
15 , 2008 into aspects of the pharmaceutical industry . "
the company added it was fully cooperating with the probe .
" the inquiry relates to the introduction of innovative and generic medicines for human consumption onto the market and covers commercial practices , including the use of patents , " the statement added .
" we understand that several companies have been similarly approached in connection with the inquiry . "
a spokesman for glaxosmithkline said the british group had also been visited by eu regulators as part of the investigation .
" we have been contacted by them , " the gsk spokesman said .
" i can not say the date or which site or where but we can confirm we have been visited by them . "
patent disputes at heart of issue the inquiry will pay particular attention to deals between drugs firms , such as settlements in patent disputes , and to the question of whether some companies could have abused their patent and legal rights to keep rivals out of the market .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : pfizer also got a visit from eu regulators given that such questions deal with highly-sensitive information which " may be easily withheld , concealed or destroyed , " the use of unannounced inspections was " considered appropriate , " kroes said .
the primary aim of the inquiry is to gather and analyze information on the operation of the pharmaceuticals market .
however , if it brings to light evidence of specific wrong-doing , such cases will be dealt with as they arise , she said .
the commission is tasked with ensuring that eu states and companies obey eu laws , including those on competition .
in the last year alone , it imposed fines of over 3 billion euros -lrb- $ 4.5 billion -rrb- on firms which had broken competition law .
unlike in those cartel cases , the raids on the drugs sector were not prompted by specific indications of illegal activity , but by a more general sense that the eu market is not working , kroes stressed .
" the inquiry is not investigating specific companies and is not based on specific evidence , " she said .
however , it would focus on " a couple of issues where we are not feeling safe that it is pro-competitive , " she added .
astrazeneca previously faced fines but during a news conference , kroes cited astrazeneca as a clear example of a company in which competition was not functioning optimally , referring to a 2005 decision in which the commission fined the company 60 million euros .
the commission found that astrazeneca had misused the patent system to delay market entry of rivals to its ulcer drug losec .
other companies , including merck , bayer schering pharma and roche holding , said they were not aware that they were involved or had not received inquiries from officials . dw staff / dpa -lrb- jen -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

leading social democrats are calling for sport to become a constitutional objective in germany .
some applaud the idea , but legal experts say it 's not the way to beef up federal funding for sports . after meeting with members of the german football association -lrb- dfb -rrb- and organizers for the women 's soccer world championship , manfred schaub , a member of the social democrats ' executive , said having sport as a constitutional objective would help resolve urban space issues , and make sure sport did n't always suffer when state coffers were empty . spd head kurt beck added that he recognized the contribution of the dfb in combating racism and integrating young immigrants . however , in an interview with the taz newspaper earlier in january , former constitutional court judge udo steiner advised against the move to make sport a national objective on the grounds that such objectives only required the government to act , but did n't specify in what way . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : clubs hope inclusion in the constitution will mean more financial support " as a general rule , there is always going to be controversy about what measures are appropriate , " steiner told the taz .
" if sport becomes a national objective , it probably would n't receive one single euro more .
political priorities determine how government money is distributed , and that is how it should be . " but the general director of the german olympic committee , michael vesper , said late last year that he welcomed the social democrats ' support for the initiative . " it is good news for sport , especially for the 7.5 million volunteers involved , " he said in a statement . a private matter ? nearly 30 percent of germany 's population is a member in a sports association . " there are more than 90,000 sports clubs and they help to keep our communities together , " vesper said .
" the inclusion of sport as national objective … can back community-spirited sports and give greater power to promote its aims . " however , speaking at a government hearing on the subject in 2007 , friedhelm hufen , a constitutional expert at the university of mainz , emphasized that the purpose of the constitution was not to recognize the efforts of volunteers and organizations . objectives currently in the german constitution include democracy , rule of law , environmental protection and animal protection , which , in 2002 , was the most recent addition .
a recent proposal also called for special protection of children in the constitution . most states support sport bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : sport is part of nearly all state constitutions fifteen of germany 's 16 states have already added sport to their list of objectives in their state constitutions .
under the federal constitution , the german government is responsible for supporting top-level sports . the social democrats have said before they wanted culture to be included as a new constitutional objective , along with sport .
the initiative also has the support of the left party and the free-market liberal free democrats , who originally called for the constitutional changes back in 2006 . as constitutional amendments require a two-thirds majority , they need the backing of chancellor angela merkel 's christian democrats .
however , the party made it clear in december 2007 that it would n't support any constitution changes within the current legislature period , which runs to may 2009 . dw staff -lrb- kh -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

regulators worry the big drug makers are acting to keep generics off the market , among other issues . the dawn raids and sector inquiry , which the eu commission said was not based on specific suspected violations , could lead to cartel charges against companies and potentially huge fines .
patents are the life blood of the pharmaceutical industry but critics allege some companies misuse patent rights to delay the introduction of generic medicines in unjustified ways .
the cost of medicines is a hot-button issue in europe , where governments are seeking to trim health care costs at the same time as encouraging the development of the pharmaceutical and biotechnology sectors .
three of europe 's biggest drug makers - astrazeneca , glaxosmithkline and sanofi-aventis - acknowledged they had been approached by eu regulators as part of the antitrust probe .
us-based pfizer , the world 's top drug maker , also confirmed it was being investigated .
looking for " something rotten " regulators said they suspect the firms involved may be protecting their own market shares at the expense of introducing better drugs .

16 , that the finnish company was a " locust which got money in germany and then said without warning ' we are going to romania ' to maybe get more public funds there . " he also said he would attempt to recover the 60 million euros -lrb- $ 89 million -rrb- in subsidies the state had paid the company .
nokia also received about 28 million euros from the federal government . " we are not simply going to accept this - this is not yet the end of the debate , " he added . german politicians have accused international companies of behaving like " locusts " to describe what they deem an excessive greed for profits . but getting any payments from nokia is likely to prove difficult .
north rhine-westphalia 's finance minister , christa thoben , said a deal holding the company to bochum , where it employed some 2,000 people , in exchange for subsidies ran out before nokia announced its plans to leave . subsidies lure hi-tech companies bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germans are calling on the eu to show nokia received no money from the bloc to relocate " you ca n't help but notice that the required period of retention ran out in september 2006 and half a year later nokia makes the decision to build a new plant romania , " she said . but german deputy economy minister hartmut schauerte told reporters berlin would request that the eu look into charges that nokia is profiting from european union subsidies in its decision to move production from germany to hungry and romania . " we are going to check with the european commission if the relocation of this site is being supported financially by european structural funds , " he said . " that must not be the case . " schauerte added germany was prepared for " intense talks " with nokia to try to strike a deal to keep the bochum plant open . hungarian support for move bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : sundbäck announced the bochum plant 's closure on tuesday nokia board member veli sundbäck said the company did not cash in on any eu subsidies in moving production to romania and hungry , both of which are eu members .
he added that the company , like any other , did register for financial support from the hungarian government .
hungary pays for up to 50 percent of costs for hi-tech companies that settle there . since 2005 , when the eu was accused of paying for aeg to move production within the eu from germany to poland , the bloc has issued guidelines that prohibit the subsidization of manufacturing shifts among member states . eu commission president jose manuel barroso said wednesday that there was little to criticize in nokia 's decision to move production to other eu member states .

since 2006 , some 6,000 jobs at cell phone plants have been cut in germany as benq , once part of siemens , and motorola stopped german production . sundbäck said nokia could not convince supplier to setup shop near bochum and that the factory was not " internationally competitive . " " we are following nokia 's global strategy , which focuses on cost-effectiveness and logistics flexibility , " he said . german labor leaders , however , saying the factory was in the black . " the location is running really well , profits are being made here , " said ulrike kleinebrahm , the head of bochum 's ig-metall union , adding that the plant 's closure was a " catastrophe for bochum . " politicians and union leaders also said germany 's high labor costs , another reason cited by nokia for closing the plant , make up only 5 percent of production expenses , but salary costs in romania are a 10th of what companies pay in germany . nokia booked record results in the third quarter of 2007 .
its revenues climbed 28 percent to 12.9 billion euros compared to the same time the year before .

but some in say the move may endanger lives in germany . the deployment of 250 combat troops , who would join in the search for and fight against terrorists , would mark a departure from the bundeswehr 's current mission .
to date only stabilization forces have been deployed to the main german base at masar-i-sharif . the social democratic party 's defense spokesman , rainer arnold , told the passauer neue presse on wednesday , jan .
16 , that the german army had begun making preparations for the deployment . " this task falls to germany in the summer , " he said , adding that the mission , slated to start in july , signaled a " new quality " in the german engagement in afghanistan .
part of the new mission could include pursuing terrorists , arnold told the paper . ready to replace norwegians bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany may be called on to replace other nato troops leaving this year with 350 norwegian troops leaving afghanistan by the middle of the year and germany heading nato 's international security and assistance force -lrb- isaf -rrb- in the country 's north , it is likely that the bundeswehr will have to replace the norwegians . " if other countries are no longer available to do this task after september , then we will do it ourselves , " the head of the german federal armed forces association , bernhard gertz , told the mitteldeutsche zeitung .
" it 's in the interest of our own soldiers . " in a separate interview with the daily der tagesspiegel , gertz added : " it is clear that we will take over this task . " government spokesman ulrich wilhelm , however , said that the nato decision on which country takes over the quick response force is not expected to be made before the end of january . the defense ministry in berlin also confirmed that planning was underway and said that the deployment fell under the mandate for german forces in afghanistan renewed by parliament last year . mission covered by mandate ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany also has reconnaissance jets stationed in afghanistan but the ministry denied that the deployment would add a " new quality " to the bundeswehr 's mission in afghanistan . spokesman thomas raab said the army 's current mission already included " infantry-like components , " and that it was already possible for germans to escort convoys and help other nations ' troops or nationals . but some in germany have questioned whether the new deployment makes sense for the bundeswehr . " with the planned deployment of bundeswehr combat units , the german government is , against all better judgment , bringing terror into the country , " opposition left party leader oskar lafontaine said . new dangers bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : polls show most german oppose the bundeswehr 's deployment to afghanistan greens party defense expert winfried nachtwei told tagesschau.de that " the risk of slipping into hard situations would be unavoidable " should germany join the quick reaction force . that 's a fact gertz said germany would have to get used to since the soldiers would be called on to fight if their comrades or the people they are protecting are in danger . " you have to assume that these situations will arise , " he told the mitteldeutsche zeitung .
" and you can not expect from the outset that it will all occur without any victims . " pacifist organizations have said they intend to protest the bundeswehr 's plans . in october , the bundestag renewed the mandate for 3,500 german troops in afghanistan , combining two previous mandates .
up to 3,000 troops , part of nato 's forces in the country , are deployed in a training , reconstruction and security mission in afghanistan 's relatively peaceful north . dw staff -lrb- sms -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

but some in say the move may endanger lives in germany . the deployment of 250 combat troops , who would join in the search for and fight against terrorists , would mark a departure from the bundeswehr 's current mission .
to date only stabilization forces have been deployed to the main german base at masar-i-sharif . the social democratic party 's defense spokesman , rainer arnold , told the passauer neue presse on wednesday , jan .
16 , that the german army had begun making preparations for the deployment . " this task falls to germany in the summer , " he said , adding that the mission , slated to start in july , signaled a " new quality " in the german engagement in afghanistan .
part of the new mission could include pursuing terrorists , arnold told the paper . ready to replace norwegians bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany may be called on to replace other nato troops leaving this year with 350 norwegian troops leaving afghanistan by the middle of the year and germany heading nato 's international security and assistance force -lrb- isaf -rrb- in the country 's north , it is likely that the bundeswehr will have to replace the norwegians . " if other countries are no longer available to do this task after september , then we will do it ourselves , " the head of the german federal armed forces association , bernhard gertz , told the mitteldeutsche zeitung .
" it 's in the interest of our own soldiers . " in a separate interview with the daily der tagesspiegel , gertz added : " it is clear that we will take over this task . " government spokesman ulrich wilhelm , however , said that the nato decision on which country takes over the quick response force is not expected to be made before the end of january . the defense ministry in berlin also confirmed that planning was underway and said that the deployment fell under the mandate for german forces in afghanistan renewed by parliament last year . mission covered by mandate ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany also has reconnaissance jets stationed in afghanistan but the ministry denied that the deployment would add a " new quality " to the bundeswehr 's mission in afghanistan . spokesman thomas raab said the army 's current mission already included " infantry-like components , " and that it was already possible for germans to escort convoys and help other nations ' troops or nationals . but some in germany have questioned whether the new deployment makes sense for the bundeswehr . " with the planned deployment of bundeswehr combat units , the german government is , against all better judgment , bringing terror into the country , " opposition left party leader oskar lafontaine said . new dangers bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : polls show most german oppose the bundeswehr 's deployment to afghanistan greens party defense expert winfried nachtwei told tagesschau.de that " the risk of slipping into hard situations would be unavoidable " should germany join the quick reaction force . that 's a fact gertz said germany would have to get used to since the soldiers would be called on to fight if their comrades or the people they are protecting are in danger . " you have to assume that these situations will arise , " he told the mitteldeutsche zeitung .
" and you can not expect from the outset that it will all occur without any victims . " pacifist organizations have said they intend to protest the bundeswehr 's plans . in october , the bundestag renewed the mandate for 3,500 german troops in afghanistan , combining two previous mandates .
up to 3,000 troops , part of nato 's forces in the country , are deployed in a training , reconstruction and security mission in afghanistan 's relatively peaceful north . dw staff -lrb- sms -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

little surprise , then , that a key investment-confidence indicator has plunged . peter bofinger and wolfgang franz , two of the five so-called " wise men " who act as economic advisers to the german government , said the peak of the financial market crisis has not yet been reached . " i expect the peak of the financial crisis to be reached at mid-year , " bofinger told the berliner zeitung newspaper .
bofinger said he was n't surprised by an overall sell-off on the dax on tuesday , jan .
15 , after german real-estate investment firm hypo real estate plunged a dizzying 35 percent - the steepest one-day price drop the dax has seen to date .
the fall came after the company announced it was writing off 390 million euros -lrb- $ 580 million -rrb- on us subprime debt losses .
shares had made back some gains in early wednesday trading .
effects of us real-estate pressure investors were taken by surprise by the write-off , because hypo real estate 's management had repeatedly said that the firm would be unscathed by the credit crunch , which has swept world markets .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hypo real estate took one of the biggest falls in dax history " the interest rate adjustments for buyers of us real estate are now coming into effect , and that is steadily increasing pressure on real estate markets , " bofinger told the berliner zeitung .
meanwhile , franz said the financial market crisis is not yet over , adding that interest-rate increases for mortgages , which are now coming into effect , will " create problems for some debtors , increasing the likelihood of defaults at banks and also here in germany . "
investors eye us for recession signals hypo real estate 's announcement on tuesday came in the wake of more grim news out of the us financial sector ; america 's biggest bank , citigroup , reported that it suffered a record $ 9.83 billion fourth-quarter loss .
meanwhile , concerns that a possible us recession will deepen the slowdown in europe 's largest economy pushed down a key german investor-confidence index .
a study by the zew center for european economic research published on tuesday showed investor confidence in germany fell to its lowest point in 15 years .
investor confidence was at minus 41.6 , from minus 37.2 a month earlier - the eighth straight decline .
it was a greater drop than analysts had expected . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hope for better days even as investor confidence slumped in germany in january goldman sachs and merrill lynch have forecast that the us will slip into recession this year for the first time since 2001 , as the housing slump , which has driven up credit costs globally , curbs consumer spending .
that may hurt european exporters already grappling with oil prices around $ 100 a barrel and an appreciating euro .
german growth is slowing " the bad news flow from the us banking sector has n't abated , " alexander koch , an economist at unicredit markets and investments in munich , told bloomberg news service .
" there are real concerns about a us recession dragging down german economic growth . "
german economic growth slowed to 2.5 percent last year from 2.9 percent in 2006 , which was the fastest expansion since the turn of the decade , the federal statistics office said on wednesday .
the bundesbank predicts growth of just 1.9 percent this year . dw staff -lrb- als / jen -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

leading social democrats are calling for sport to become a constitutional objective in germany .
some applaud the idea , but legal experts say it 's not the way to beef up federal funding for sports . after meeting with members of the german football association -lrb- dfb -rrb- and organizers for the women 's soccer world championship , manfred schaub , a member of the social democrats ' executive , said having sport as a constitutional objective would help resolve urban space issues , and make sure sport did n't always suffer when state coffers were empty . spd head kurt beck added that he recognized the contribution of the dfb in combating racism and integrating young immigrants . however , in an interview with the taz newspaper earlier in january , former constitutional court judge udo steiner advised against the move to make sport a national objective on the grounds that such objectives only required the government to act , but did n't specify in what way . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : clubs hope inclusion in the constitution will mean more financial support " as a general rule , there is always going to be controversy about what measures are appropriate , " steiner told the taz .
" if sport becomes a national objective , it probably would n't receive one single euro more .
political priorities determine how government money is distributed , and that is how it should be . " but the general director of the german olympic committee , michael vesper , said late last year that he welcomed the social democrats ' support for the initiative . " it is good news for sport , especially for the 7.5 million volunteers involved , " he said in a statement . a private matter ? nearly 30 percent of germany 's population is a member in a sports association . " there are more than 90,000 sports clubs and they help to keep our communities together , " vesper said .
" the inclusion of sport as national objective … can back community-spirited sports and give greater power to promote its aims . " however , speaking at a government hearing on the subject in 2007 , friedhelm hufen , a constitutional expert at the university of mainz , emphasized that the purpose of the constitution was not to recognize the efforts of volunteers and organizations . objectives currently in the german constitution include democracy , rule of law , environmental protection and animal protection , which , in 2002 , was the most recent addition .

the initiative also has the support of the left party and the free-market liberal free democrats , who originally called for the constitutional changes back in 2006 . as constitutional amendments require a two-thirds majority , they need the backing of chancellor angela merkel 's christian democrats .

17 , came after street protests by anti-clerical students and professors on tuesday afternoon . it is the first cancellation of an appearance by the pontiff in the face of hostility since his election in april 2005 . " following the well-known events of these days ... it was considered appropriate to cancel the event , " the vatican said in a statement . benedict , who had been scheduled to deliver a speech at the start of la sapienza 's academic year , would still send his text to the university , the statement said . escalating dissent while tensions around the pontiff 's visit had escalated throughout the day with some 100 students staging a sit-in at la sapienza 's main hall , the vatican 's evening announcement came as a surprise . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : pope benedict xvi is no stranger to controversy earlier on tuesday afternoon , giovanni maria vian , the editor of the vatican 's mouthpiece newspaper l 'osservatore romano , lamented the controversy stirred by the pontiff 's planned visit , but predicted it would go ahead . and university rector renato guarini said that while opponents of the visit would be allowed to hold a demonstration on campus on thursday , the pontiff 's invitation was still valid . " the pope is a man of culture and great thinker " who should be allowed to have his say , guarini said in an interview with private news television news channel skytg24 . academics oppose pope 's stance the opposition to the planned visit began when a group of 67 academics signed a letter requesting that guarini withdraw the invitation to the pope . in the letter , the academics said they opposed the pontiff 's " incongruous " visit to a secular university , and called on the university to revoke the " disconcerting invitation " to benedict , whom they accuse of being a reactionary and an opponent of free thought and research . many scientists fault the intellectual , conservative and tradition-minded pope for a series of positions he has taken that they say subordinate science and reason to faith . the faculty protest against the visit was spearheaded by a well-known physicist , marcello cini , a professor emeritus at la sapienza . pope " is playing the victim " on learning of the cancellation , cini told afp news service , " i 'm satisfied , that 's what i was asking for .
i thought , and i continue to think , that this visit was ambiguous and an attack on the independence of culture and the university . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some protesters wore benedict masks he added : " by cancelling , he is playing the victim , which is very intelligent .
it will be a pretext for accusing us of refusing dialogue . " in their letter , the academics cited a 1990 speech made by benedict when he was still a cardinal , in which he allegedly justified the catholic church 's actions against galileo , the 17th-century physicist who ran afoul of church doctrine by insisting that the earth orbits the sun . during the 1990 speech delivered in parma , italy , the then-cardinal joseph ratzinger had quoted austrian-born philosopher paul feyerabend as saying that the church 's 1633 heresy trial against galileo had been " reasonable and fair . " in court , galileo was forced to recant his theories . students focus on galileo comments benedict " condemns centuries of scientific and cultural growth by affirming anachronistic dogmas such as creationism , while attacking scientific free-thought and promoting mandatory heterosexuality , " students opposed to the visit , using the name physics collective , said on their web site . the students opposed to the visit kicked off an " anti-clergy week " on monday by showing a film on galileo . on monday , vatican radio said attempts to prevent benedict from speaking at the campus amounted to censorship . catholic and conservative politicians have condemned the university 's actions as a sign of intolerance , while opinions in the country 's governing center-left have been split , with some saying the pontiff 's opponents have the right to show their dissent . dw staff -lrb- jen -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" if there were only re-runs i 'd probably do something besides watch tv , because i would n't want to have to watch something else . " but kern and other german viewers are unlikely to be faced with re-runs of " lost " as the prosieben channel still has 15 of season three 's 22 episodes and can fall back on the eight episodes of season four that were already produced before the us writers ' strike began on nov .
5 . " the gap between the broadcast dates has kept us from feeling any real effects of the strike , " prosieben spokeswoman katja pichler said . germans hoping for an agreement - soon bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the writers ' strike turned the golden globes into little more than a press conference but the gap is n't as large for other series .
the fourth , and newest , season of " grey 's anatomy , " also shown on prosieben , is set to start in germany in february .
while the 11 shows produced before the strike began are waiting to be broadcast in germany , pichler said the channel has not decided what it will do if no new episodes arrive from the us . " we are hoping the strike will end , and that we do n't have to change our schedule , " she said , adding that prosieben needs six months to dub an episode of an american series into german . rtl , another major commercial german tv station , also said it has not yet determined how it will react if it runs out of " csi , " " house m.d. " or " law and order " episodes , according to spokesman claus richter . " we do n't have to be worried until autumn 2008 , " richter said .
" half the episodes for rtl 's series are ready and will be aired .
after that , we 'll have to decide if we show re-runs or something completely different . " sticking with us staples bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : complex dialog in fox 's house m.d. makes it difficult to dub , richter said but neither prosieben nor rtl , which regularly compete for the best ratings in the lucrative 14-49 age group , said they are planning to make any long-term changes to their programming based on the strike , and that they would continue buying and broadcasting us series . " we are happy with the strength of our us series and think viewers will come back when there are new episodes , " pichler said . prosieben and rtl are the two german broadcasters that rely most on us programming . according to a 2006 program analysis , 78 percent of prosieben 's and 47 percent of rtl 's fictional programming came from the united states . a matter of taste germany 's publicly funded stations rely less on us productions , with the top two , ard and zdf , buying 21 percent and 22 percent of their fiction programming from the us .
the two channels have also successfully invested in british , scandinavian and french mystery series , according to wolfgang seufert , a professor at the university of jena . " in all , there is a clear preference for german series , followed by us productions and then series from other countries , " he said , adding that a few us series beat out local productions to earn top ratings in germany . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : kern said german series do n't hold her interest as well as american ones but kern said german series just do n't hold her attention . " when i watch a german mystery i know who the murderer is in the first 10 minutes and change the channel , " kern said .
" but i get sucked into the us shows and have to see what 's going to happen next . " viewers will wait it out that 's good news for german broadcasters , since home-grown productions cost more than purchasing and dubbing foreign series , seufert said , he added that broadcasters can relax in knowing that viewers will be back whenever new episodes are ready to air . " overall tv use is relatively independent of what 's being shown , " he said , adding that the average german household has a choice of 30 channels .

" right now , i keep monday nights free of other commitments , " the 32-year old said from her home in cologne .
" if there were only re-runs i 'd probably do something besides watch tv , because i would n't want to have to watch something else . " but kern and other german viewers are unlikely to be faced with re-runs of " lost " as the prosieben channel still has 15 of season three 's 22 episodes and can fall back on the eight episodes of season four that were already produced before the us writers ' strike began on nov .
5 . " the gap between the broadcast dates has kept us from feeling any real effects of the strike , " prosieben spokeswoman katja pichler said . germans hoping for an agreement - soon bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the writers ' strike turned the golden globes into little more than a press conference but the gap is n't as large for other series .
the fourth , and newest , season of " grey 's anatomy , " also shown on prosieben , is set to start in germany in february .
while the 11 shows produced before the strike began are waiting to be broadcast in germany , pichler said the channel has not decided what it will do if no new episodes arrive from the us . " we are hoping the strike will end , and that we do n't have to change our schedule , " she said , adding that prosieben needs six months to dub an episode of an american series into german . rtl , another major commercial german tv station , also said it has not yet determined how it will react if it runs out of " csi , " " house m.d. " or " law and order " episodes , according to spokesman claus richter . " we do n't have to be worried until autumn 2008 , " richter said .
" half the episodes for rtl 's series are ready and will be aired .
after that , we 'll have to decide if we show re-runs or something completely different . " sticking with us staples bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : complex dialog in fox 's house m.d. makes it difficult to dub , richter said but neither prosieben nor rtl , which regularly compete for the best ratings in the lucrative 14-49 age group , said they are planning to make any long-term changes to their programming based on the strike , and that they would continue buying and broadcasting us series . " we are happy with the strength of our us series and think viewers will come back when there are new episodes , " pichler said . prosieben and rtl are the two german broadcasters that rely most on us programming . according to a 2006 program analysis , 78 percent of prosieben 's and 47 percent of rtl 's fictional programming came from the united states . a matter of taste germany 's publicly funded stations rely less on us productions , with the top two , ard and zdf , buying 21 percent and 22 percent of their fiction programming from the us .

leading social democrats are calling for sport to become a constitutional objective in germany .
some applaud the idea , but legal experts say it 's not the way to beef up federal funding for sports . after meeting with members of the german football association -lrb- dfb -rrb- and organizers for the women 's soccer world championship , manfred schaub , a member of the social democrats ' executive , said having sport as a constitutional objective would help resolve urban space issues , and make sure sport did n't always suffer when state coffers were empty . spd head kurt beck added that he recognized the contribution of the dfb in combating racism and integrating young immigrants . however , in an interview with the taz newspaper earlier in january , former constitutional court judge udo steiner advised against the move to make sport a national objective on the grounds that such objectives only required the government to act , but did n't specify in what way . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : clubs hope inclusion in the constitution will mean more financial support " as a general rule , there is always going to be controversy about what measures are appropriate , " steiner told the taz .
" if sport becomes a national objective , it probably would n't receive one single euro more .
political priorities determine how government money is distributed , and that is how it should be . " but the general director of the german olympic committee , michael vesper , said late last year that he welcomed the social democrats ' support for the initiative . " it is good news for sport , especially for the 7.5 million volunteers involved , " he said in a statement . a private matter ? nearly 30 percent of germany 's population is a member in a sports association . " there are more than 90,000 sports clubs and they help to keep our communities together , " vesper said .
" the inclusion of sport as national objective … can back community-spirited sports and give greater power to promote its aims . " however , speaking at a government hearing on the subject in 2007 , friedhelm hufen , a constitutional expert at the university of mainz , emphasized that the purpose of the constitution was not to recognize the efforts of volunteers and organizations . objectives currently in the german constitution include democracy , rule of law , environmental protection and animal protection , which , in 2002 , was the most recent addition .
a recent proposal also called for special protection of children in the constitution . most states support sport bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : sport is part of nearly all state constitutions fifteen of germany 's 16 states have already added sport to their list of objectives in their state constitutions .
under the federal constitution , the german government is responsible for supporting top-level sports . the social democrats have said before they wanted culture to be included as a new constitutional objective , along with sport .
the initiative also has the support of the left party and the free-market liberal free democrats , who originally called for the constitutional changes back in 2006 . as constitutional amendments require a two-thirds majority , they need the backing of chancellor angela merkel 's christian democrats .
however , the party made it clear in december 2007 that it would n't support any constitution changes within the current legislature period , which runs to may 2009 . dw staff -lrb- kh -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

some 440 nuclear power stations in 31 countries create about 16 percent of electricity worldwide .
more than 1,000 new nuclear power stations would have to be built to order to reduce the greenhouse effect with nuclear power - that 's not foreseeable . but even more importantly , investment in new nuclear power stations is expensive , though the necessary raw material - uranium - is cheap .
the expense means that nuclear power plants require long operating times to be profitable for investors , which sets the means of decades-worth of energy production in stone and hinders investment in non-fossil energy production . but if what climate researchers are saying is true , then there need to be recognizable reductions in greenhouse gasses by 2020 in order to save the climate .
this is exactly where many countries see a role for nuclear energy : as a transition to a solar age offering co2-free energy production in the next 20 to 50 years . germany has , at least for the moment , taken an uncompromising path : for lots of environmental technology and against nuclear power . the next few years will be decisive .

but if germany fails , a nuclear renaissance may result , says dw 's jens thurau . german environment minister sigmar gabriel had his chance to shine in december at the bali climate conference .
no country , the energetic social democratic politician says , is similarly engaged in protecting the climate as germany . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : by 2020 the country will reduce its emissions of greenhouse gasses by 40 percent by producing more energy from renewable sources , by saving energy , by investing billions in building renovations , by using energy from clean coal and gas power stations .
and without using nuclear power .
by 2021 all 17 of germany 's nuclear power plants - one after another - will be shut down . when compared to other industrialized nations , that decision makes germany more and more of an outsider .
a new nuclear power plant is being built in finland .
france , the united states and japan also have plans for new nuclear power stations .
great britain recently decided to put more of an emphasis on nuclear power .
these governments argue that the international community 's goals , which climate change researchers still call insufficient , to reduce greenhouse gas emissions can only be met with co2-free nuclear power . still , there are good reasons for german to turn its back on nuclear power .
some 440 nuclear power stations in 31 countries create about 16 percent of electricity worldwide .
more than 1,000 new nuclear power stations would have to be built to order to reduce the greenhouse effect with nuclear power - that 's not foreseeable . but even more importantly , investment in new nuclear power stations is expensive , though the necessary raw material - uranium - is cheap .
the expense means that nuclear power plants require long operating times to be profitable for investors , which sets the means of decades-worth of energy production in stone and hinders investment in non-fossil energy production . but if what climate researchers are saying is true , then there need to be recognizable reductions in greenhouse gasses by 2020 in order to save the climate .
this is exactly where many countries see a role for nuclear energy : as a transition to a solar age offering co2-free energy production in the next 20 to 50 years . germany has , at least for the moment , taken an uncompromising path : for lots of environmental technology and against nuclear power . the next few years will be decisive .
if germany proves that both an engaged climate policy and phasing out nuclear power are not mutually exclusive , then other countries will follow .
if germany fails , there will be an increasing nuclear energy , at least in industrialized nations , india , china and brazil .
in the world 's poorer countries , particularly in africa , nuclear power is still too expensive anyway . jens thurau is a dw-tv correspondent and environment expert -lrb- sms -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

17 , came after street protests by anti-clerical students and professors on tuesday afternoon . it is the first cancellation of an appearance by the pontiff in the face of hostility since his election in april 2005 . " following the well-known events of these days ... it was considered appropriate to cancel the event , " the vatican said in a statement . benedict , who had been scheduled to deliver a speech at the start of la sapienza 's academic year , would still send his text to the university , the statement said . escalating dissent while tensions around the pontiff 's visit had escalated throughout the day with some 100 students staging a sit-in at la sapienza 's main hall , the vatican 's evening announcement came as a surprise . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : pope benedict xvi is no stranger to controversy earlier on tuesday afternoon , giovanni maria vian , the editor of the vatican 's mouthpiece newspaper l 'osservatore romano , lamented the controversy stirred by the pontiff 's planned visit , but predicted it would go ahead . and university rector renato guarini said that while opponents of the visit would be allowed to hold a demonstration on campus on thursday , the pontiff 's invitation was still valid . " the pope is a man of culture and great thinker " who should be allowed to have his say , guarini said in an interview with private news television news channel skytg24 . academics oppose pope 's stance the opposition to the planned visit began when a group of 67 academics signed a letter requesting that guarini withdraw the invitation to the pope . in the letter , the academics said they opposed the pontiff 's " incongruous " visit to a secular university , and called on the university to revoke the " disconcerting invitation " to benedict , whom they accuse of being a reactionary and an opponent of free thought and research . many scientists fault the intellectual , conservative and tradition-minded pope for a series of positions he has taken that they say subordinate science and reason to faith . the faculty protest against the visit was spearheaded by a well-known physicist , marcello cini , a professor emeritus at la sapienza . pope " is playing the victim " on learning of the cancellation , cini told afp news service , " i 'm satisfied , that 's what i was asking for .
i thought , and i continue to think , that this visit was ambiguous and an attack on the independence of culture and the university . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some protesters wore benedict masks he added : " by cancelling , he is playing the victim , which is very intelligent .
it will be a pretext for accusing us of refusing dialogue . " in their letter , the academics cited a 1990 speech made by benedict when he was still a cardinal , in which he allegedly justified the catholic church 's actions against galileo , the 17th-century physicist who ran afoul of church doctrine by insisting that the earth orbits the sun . during the 1990 speech delivered in parma , italy , the then-cardinal joseph ratzinger had quoted austrian-born philosopher paul feyerabend as saying that the church 's 1633 heresy trial against galileo had been " reasonable and fair . " in court , galileo was forced to recant his theories . students focus on galileo comments benedict " condemns centuries of scientific and cultural growth by affirming anachronistic dogmas such as creationism , while attacking scientific free-thought and promoting mandatory heterosexuality , " students opposed to the visit , using the name physics collective , said on their web site . the students opposed to the visit kicked off an " anti-clergy week " on monday by showing a film on galileo . on monday , vatican radio said attempts to prevent benedict from speaking at the campus amounted to censorship . catholic and conservative politicians have condemned the university 's actions as a sign of intolerance , while opinions in the country 's governing center-left have been split , with some saying the pontiff 's opponents have the right to show their dissent . dw staff -lrb- jen -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" i expect the peak of the financial crisis to be reached at mid-year , " bofinger told the berliner zeitung newspaper .
bofinger said he was n't surprised by an overall sell-off on the dax on tuesday , jan .

the fall came after the company announced it was writing off 390 million euros -lrb- $ 580 million -rrb- on us subprime debt losses .

meanwhile , concerns that a possible us recession will deepen the slowdown in europe 's largest economy pushed down a key german investor-confidence index .
a study by the zew center for european economic research published on tuesday showed investor confidence in germany fell to its lowest point in 15 years .

regulators worry the big drug makers are acting to keep generics off the market , among other issues . the dawn raids and sector inquiry , which the eu commission said was not based on specific suspected violations , could lead to cartel charges against companies and potentially huge fines .
patents are the life blood of the pharmaceutical industry but critics allege some companies misuse patent rights to delay the introduction of generic medicines in unjustified ways .
the cost of medicines is a hot-button issue in europe , where governments are seeking to trim health care costs at the same time as encouraging the development of the pharmaceutical and biotechnology sectors .
three of europe 's biggest drug makers - astrazeneca , glaxosmithkline and sanofi-aventis - acknowledged they had been approached by eu regulators as part of the antitrust probe .
us-based pfizer , the world 's top drug maker , also confirmed it was being investigated .
looking for " something rotten " regulators said they suspect the firms involved may be protecting their own market shares at the expense of introducing better drugs .
" a sector inquiry is something we engage in if we have the feeling that the sector is not working optimally ... "
eu competition commissioner neelie kroes said .
" if there is a feeling that something is rotten in the state , or something could be rotten , let 's take the opportunity to find out , " she added .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : eu commissioner kroes takes on a hot-button issue european citizens spend some 200 billion euros -lrb- $ 297 billion -rrb- a year on pharmaceutical products - the equivalent of 400 euros for every man , woman and child in the eu , kroes said .
unexplained drop in product launches but over the last decade , the number of new components launched on the market has fallen from an average of 40 per year between 1995 and 1999 , to just 28 per year between 2000 and 2004 .
" if innovative products are n't being produced , and cheaper generic alternatives are being delayed , we need to find out why , " kroes said .
the raids were carried out in a number of eu states with the help of local authorities , and targeted both firms based in europe and those based outside the continent who are active in its market .
kroes would not comment on which specific countries and companies were involved .
major concerns confirm probe however , astrazeneca said in a statement on wednesday : " we confirm that we are part of a sector inquiry instituted by the european commission on jan .
15 , 2008 into aspects of the pharmaceutical industry . "
the company added it was fully cooperating with the probe .
" the inquiry relates to the introduction of innovative and generic medicines for human consumption onto the market and covers commercial practices , including the use of patents , " the statement added .
" we understand that several companies have been similarly approached in connection with the inquiry . "
a spokesman for glaxosmithkline said the british group had also been visited by eu regulators as part of the investigation .

regulators worry the big drug makers are acting to keep generics off the market , among other issues . the dawn raids and sector inquiry , which the eu commission said was not based on specific suspected violations , could lead to cartel charges against companies and potentially huge fines .
patents are the life blood of the pharmaceutical industry but critics allege some companies misuse patent rights to delay the introduction of generic medicines in unjustified ways .
the cost of medicines is a hot-button issue in europe , where governments are seeking to trim health care costs at the same time as encouraging the development of the pharmaceutical and biotechnology sectors .
three of europe 's biggest drug makers - astrazeneca , glaxosmithkline and sanofi-aventis - acknowledged they had been approached by eu regulators as part of the antitrust probe .
us-based pfizer , the world 's top drug maker , also confirmed it was being investigated .
looking for " something rotten " regulators said they suspect the firms involved may be protecting their own market shares at the expense of introducing better drugs .
" a sector inquiry is something we engage in if we have the feeling that the sector is not working optimally ... "
eu competition commissioner neelie kroes said .
" if there is a feeling that something is rotten in the state , or something could be rotten , let 's take the opportunity to find out , " she added .

unexplained drop in product launches but over the last decade , the number of new components launched on the market has fallen from an average of 40 per year between 1995 and 1999 , to just 28 per year between 2000 and 2004 .
" if innovative products are n't being produced , and cheaper generic alternatives are being delayed , we need to find out why , " kroes said .
the raids were carried out in a number of eu states with the help of local authorities , and targeted both firms based in europe and those based outside the continent who are active in its market .
kroes would not comment on which specific countries and companies were involved .
major concerns confirm probe however , astrazeneca said in a statement on wednesday : " we confirm that we are part of a sector inquiry instituted by the european commission on jan .
15 , 2008 into aspects of the pharmaceutical industry . "
the company added it was fully cooperating with the probe .
" the inquiry relates to the introduction of innovative and generic medicines for human consumption onto the market and covers commercial practices , including the use of patents , " the statement added .
" we understand that several companies have been similarly approached in connection with the inquiry . "
a spokesman for glaxosmithkline said the british group had also been visited by eu regulators as part of the investigation .

regulators worry the big drug makers are acting to keep generics off the market , among other issues . the dawn raids and sector inquiry , which the eu commission said was not based on specific suspected violations , could lead to cartel charges against companies and potentially huge fines .
patents are the life blood of the pharmaceutical industry but critics allege some companies misuse patent rights to delay the introduction of generic medicines in unjustified ways .
the cost of medicines is a hot-button issue in europe , where governments are seeking to trim health care costs at the same time as encouraging the development of the pharmaceutical and biotechnology sectors .
three of europe 's biggest drug makers - astrazeneca , glaxosmithkline and sanofi-aventis - acknowledged they had been approached by eu regulators as part of the antitrust probe .
us-based pfizer , the world 's top drug maker , also confirmed it was being investigated .
looking for " something rotten " regulators said they suspect the firms involved may be protecting their own market shares at the expense of introducing better drugs .
" a sector inquiry is something we engage in if we have the feeling that the sector is not working optimally ... "
eu competition commissioner neelie kroes said .
" if there is a feeling that something is rotten in the state , or something could be rotten , let 's take the opportunity to find out , " she added .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : eu commissioner kroes takes on a hot-button issue european citizens spend some 200 billion euros -lrb- $ 297 billion -rrb- a year on pharmaceutical products - the equivalent of 400 euros for every man , woman and child in the eu , kroes said .
unexplained drop in product launches but over the last decade , the number of new components launched on the market has fallen from an average of 40 per year between 1995 and 1999 , to just 28 per year between 2000 and 2004 .
" if innovative products are n't being produced , and cheaper generic alternatives are being delayed , we need to find out why , " kroes said .
the raids were carried out in a number of eu states with the help of local authorities , and targeted both firms based in europe and those based outside the continent who are active in its market .
kroes would not comment on which specific countries and companies were involved .
major concerns confirm probe however , astrazeneca said in a statement on wednesday : " we confirm that we are part of a sector inquiry instituted by the european commission on jan .
15 , 2008 into aspects of the pharmaceutical industry . "
the company added it was fully cooperating with the probe .
" the inquiry relates to the introduction of innovative and generic medicines for human consumption onto the market and covers commercial practices , including the use of patents , " the statement added .
" we understand that several companies have been similarly approached in connection with the inquiry . "

little surprise , then , that a key investment-confidence indicator has plunged . peter bofinger and wolfgang franz , two of the five so-called " wise men " who act as economic advisers to the german government , said the peak of the financial market crisis has not yet been reached . " i expect the peak of the financial crisis to be reached at mid-year , " bofinger told the berliner zeitung newspaper .
bofinger said he was n't surprised by an overall sell-off on the dax on tuesday , jan .
15 , after german real-estate investment firm hypo real estate plunged a dizzying 35 percent - the steepest one-day price drop the dax has seen to date .
the fall came after the company announced it was writing off 390 million euros -lrb- $ 580 million -rrb- on us subprime debt losses .
shares had made back some gains in early wednesday trading .
effects of us real-estate pressure investors were taken by surprise by the write-off , because hypo real estate 's management had repeatedly said that the firm would be unscathed by the credit crunch , which has swept world markets .

meanwhile , franz said the financial market crisis is not yet over , adding that interest-rate increases for mortgages , which are now coming into effect , will " create problems for some debtors , increasing the likelihood of defaults at banks and also here in germany . "
investors eye us for recession signals hypo real estate 's announcement on tuesday came in the wake of more grim news out of the us financial sector ; america 's biggest bank , citigroup , reported that it suffered a record $ 9.83 billion fourth-quarter loss .
meanwhile , concerns that a possible us recession will deepen the slowdown in europe 's largest economy pushed down a key german investor-confidence index .
a study by the zew center for european economic research published on tuesday showed investor confidence in germany fell to its lowest point in 15 years .
investor confidence was at minus 41.6 , from minus 37.2 a month earlier - the eighth straight decline .
it was a greater drop than analysts had expected . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hope for better days even as investor confidence slumped in germany in january goldman sachs and merrill lynch have forecast that the us will slip into recession this year for the first time since 2001 , as the housing slump , which has driven up credit costs globally , curbs consumer spending .

german growth is slowing " the bad news flow from the us banking sector has n't abated , " alexander koch , an economist at unicredit markets and investments in munich , told bloomberg news service .
" there are real concerns about a us recession dragging down german economic growth . "

little surprise , then , that a key investment-confidence indicator has plunged . peter bofinger and wolfgang franz , two of the five so-called " wise men " who act as economic advisers to the german government , said the peak of the financial market crisis has not yet been reached . " i expect the peak of the financial crisis to be reached at mid-year , " bofinger told the berliner zeitung newspaper .
bofinger said he was n't surprised by an overall sell-off on the dax on tuesday , jan .
15 , after german real-estate investment firm hypo real estate plunged a dizzying 35 percent - the steepest one-day price drop the dax has seen to date .
the fall came after the company announced it was writing off 390 million euros -lrb- $ 580 million -rrb- on us subprime debt losses .
shares had made back some gains in early wednesday trading .
effects of us real-estate pressure investors were taken by surprise by the write-off , because hypo real estate 's management had repeatedly said that the firm would be unscathed by the credit crunch , which has swept world markets .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hypo real estate took one of the biggest falls in dax history " the interest rate adjustments for buyers of us real estate are now coming into effect , and that is steadily increasing pressure on real estate markets , " bofinger told the berliner zeitung .
meanwhile , franz said the financial market crisis is not yet over , adding that interest-rate increases for mortgages , which are now coming into effect , will " create problems for some debtors , increasing the likelihood of defaults at banks and also here in germany . "
investors eye us for recession signals hypo real estate 's announcement on tuesday came in the wake of more grim news out of the us financial sector ; america 's biggest bank , citigroup , reported that it suffered a record $ 9.83 billion fourth-quarter loss .
meanwhile , concerns that a possible us recession will deepen the slowdown in europe 's largest economy pushed down a key german investor-confidence index .
a study by the zew center for european economic research published on tuesday showed investor confidence in germany fell to its lowest point in 15 years .
investor confidence was at minus 41.6 , from minus 37.2 a month earlier - the eighth straight decline .
it was a greater drop than analysts had expected . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hope for better days even as investor confidence slumped in germany in january goldman sachs and merrill lynch have forecast that the us will slip into recession this year for the first time since 2001 , as the housing slump , which has driven up credit costs globally , curbs consumer spending .
that may hurt european exporters already grappling with oil prices around $ 100 a barrel and an appreciating euro .
german growth is slowing " the bad news flow from the us banking sector has n't abated , " alexander koch , an economist at unicredit markets and investments in munich , told bloomberg news service .
" there are real concerns about a us recession dragging down german economic growth . "
german economic growth slowed to 2.5 percent last year from 2.9 percent in 2006 , which was the fastest expansion since the turn of the decade , the federal statistics office said on wednesday .
the bundesbank predicts growth of just 1.9 percent this year . dw staff -lrb- als / jen -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

leading social democrats are calling for sport to become a constitutional objective in germany .
some applaud the idea , but legal experts say it 's not the way to beef up federal funding for sports . after meeting with members of the german football association -lrb- dfb -rrb- and organizers for the women 's soccer world championship , manfred schaub , a member of the social democrats ' executive , said having sport as a constitutional objective would help resolve urban space issues , and make sure sport did n't always suffer when state coffers were empty . spd head kurt beck added that he recognized the contribution of the dfb in combating racism and integrating young immigrants . however , in an interview with the taz newspaper earlier in january , former constitutional court judge udo steiner advised against the move to make sport a national objective on the grounds that such objectives only required the government to act , but did n't specify in what way . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : clubs hope inclusion in the constitution will mean more financial support " as a general rule , there is always going to be controversy about what measures are appropriate , " steiner told the taz .
" if sport becomes a national objective , it probably would n't receive one single euro more .
political priorities determine how government money is distributed , and that is how it should be . " but the general director of the german olympic committee , michael vesper , said late last year that he welcomed the social democrats ' support for the initiative . " it is good news for sport , especially for the 7.5 million volunteers involved , " he said in a statement . a private matter ? nearly 30 percent of germany 's population is a member in a sports association . " there are more than 90,000 sports clubs and they help to keep our communities together , " vesper said .
" the inclusion of sport as national objective … can back community-spirited sports and give greater power to promote its aims . " however , speaking at a government hearing on the subject in 2007 , friedhelm hufen , a constitutional expert at the university of mainz , emphasized that the purpose of the constitution was not to recognize the efforts of volunteers and organizations . objectives currently in the german constitution include democracy , rule of law , environmental protection and animal protection , which , in 2002 , was the most recent addition .
a recent proposal also called for special protection of children in the constitution . most states support sport bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : sport is part of nearly all state constitutions fifteen of germany 's 16 states have already added sport to their list of objectives in their state constitutions .
under the federal constitution , the german government is responsible for supporting top-level sports . the social democrats have said before they wanted culture to be included as a new constitutional objective , along with sport .
the initiative also has the support of the left party and the free-market liberal free democrats , who originally called for the constitutional changes back in 2006 . as constitutional amendments require a two-thirds majority , they need the backing of chancellor angela merkel 's christian democrats .
however , the party made it clear in december 2007 that it would n't support any constitution changes within the current legislature period , which runs to may 2009 . dw staff -lrb- kh -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de health -pipe- 16.01.2008 eu raids drug firms in industry-competition probe großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : color me skeptical : eu regulators thought it best to arrive unannounced the eu raided pharmaceutical companies across europe , amid concerns over uncompetitive behavior in the industry .
regulators worry the big drug makers are acting to keep generics off the market , among other issues . the dawn raids and sector inquiry , which the eu commission said was not based on specific suspected violations , could lead to cartel charges against companies and potentially huge fines .
patents are the life blood of the pharmaceutical industry but critics allege some companies misuse patent rights to delay the introduction of generic medicines in unjustified ways .
the cost of medicines is a hot-button issue in europe , where governments are seeking to trim health care costs at the same time as encouraging the development of the pharmaceutical and biotechnology sectors .
three of europe 's biggest drug makers - astrazeneca , glaxosmithkline and sanofi-aventis - acknowledged they had been approached by eu regulators as part of the antitrust probe .
us-based pfizer , the world 's top drug maker , also confirmed it was being investigated .
looking for " something rotten " regulators said they suspect the firms involved may be protecting their own market shares at the expense of introducing better drugs .
" a sector inquiry is something we engage in if we have the feeling that the sector is not working optimally ... "
eu competition commissioner neelie kroes said .
" if there is a feeling that something is rotten in the state , or something could be rotten , let 's take the opportunity to find out , " she added .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : eu commissioner kroes takes on a hot-button issue european citizens spend some 200 billion euros -lrb- $ 297 billion -rrb- a year on pharmaceutical products - the equivalent of 400 euros for every man , woman and child in the eu , kroes said .
unexplained drop in product launches but over the last decade , the number of new components launched on the market has fallen from an average of 40 per year between 1995 and 1999 , to just 28 per year between 2000 and 2004 .
" if innovative products are n't being produced , and cheaper generic alternatives are being delayed , we need to find out why , " kroes said .
the raids were carried out in a number of eu states with the help of local authorities , and targeted both firms based in europe and those based outside the continent who are active in its market .
kroes would not comment on which specific countries and companies were involved .
major concerns confirm probe however , astrazeneca said in a statement on wednesday : " we confirm that we are part of a sector inquiry instituted by the european commission on jan .
15 , 2008 into aspects of the pharmaceutical industry . "
the company added it was fully cooperating with the probe .
" the inquiry relates to the introduction of innovative and generic medicines for human consumption onto the market and covers commercial practices , including the use of patents , " the statement added .
" we understand that several companies have been similarly approached in connection with the inquiry . "
a spokesman for glaxosmithkline said the british group had also been visited by eu regulators as part of the investigation .
" we have been contacted by them , " the gsk spokesman said .
" i can not say the date or which site or where but we can confirm we have been visited by them . "
patent disputes at heart of issue the inquiry will pay particular attention to deals between drugs firms , such as settlements in patent disputes , and to the question of whether some companies could have abused their patent and legal rights to keep rivals out of the market .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : pfizer also got a visit from eu regulators given that such questions deal with highly-sensitive information which " may be easily withheld , concealed or destroyed , " the use of unannounced inspections was " considered appropriate , " kroes said .
the primary aim of the inquiry is to gather and analyze information on the operation of the pharmaceuticals market .
however , if it brings to light evidence of specific wrong-doing , such cases will be dealt with as they arise , she said .
the commission is tasked with ensuring that eu states and companies obey eu laws , including those on competition .
in the last year alone , it imposed fines of over 3 billion euros -lrb- $ 4.5 billion -rrb- on firms which had broken competition law .
unlike in those cartel cases , the raids on the drugs sector were not prompted by specific indications of illegal activity , but by a more general sense that the eu market is not working , kroes stressed .
" the inquiry is not investigating specific companies and is not based on specific evidence , " she said .
however , it would focus on " a couple of issues where we are not feeling safe that it is pro-competitive , " she added .
astrazeneca previously faced fines but during a news conference , kroes cited astrazeneca as a clear example of a company in which competition was not functioning optimally , referring to a 2005 decision in which the commission fined the company 60 million euros .

regulators worry the big drug makers are acting to keep generics off the market , among other issues . the dawn raids and sector inquiry , which the eu commission said was not based on specific suspected violations , could lead to cartel charges against companies and potentially huge fines .
patents are the life blood of the pharmaceutical industry but critics allege some companies misuse patent rights to delay the introduction of generic medicines in unjustified ways .
the cost of medicines is a hot-button issue in europe , where governments are seeking to trim health care costs at the same time as encouraging the development of the pharmaceutical and biotechnology sectors .
three of europe 's biggest drug makers - astrazeneca , glaxosmithkline and sanofi-aventis - acknowledged they had been approached by eu regulators as part of the antitrust probe .
us-based pfizer , the world 's top drug maker , also confirmed it was being investigated .
looking for " something rotten " regulators said they suspect the firms involved may be protecting their own market shares at the expense of introducing better drugs .
" a sector inquiry is something we engage in if we have the feeling that the sector is not working optimally ... "
eu competition commissioner neelie kroes said .
" if there is a feeling that something is rotten in the state , or something could be rotten , let 's take the opportunity to find out , " she added .

16 , that the finnish company was a " locust which got money in germany and then said without warning ' we are going to romania ' to maybe get more public funds there . " he also said he would attempt to recover the 60 million euros -lrb- $ 89 million -rrb- in subsidies the state had paid the company .
nokia also received about 28 million euros from the federal government . " we are not simply going to accept this - this is not yet the end of the debate , " he added . german politicians have accused international companies of behaving like " locusts " to describe what they deem an excessive greed for profits . but getting any payments from nokia is likely to prove difficult .
north rhine-westphalia 's finance minister , christa thoben , said a deal holding the company to bochum , where it employed some 2,000 people , in exchange for subsidies ran out before nokia announced its plans to leave . subsidies lure hi-tech companies bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germans are calling on the eu to show nokia received no money from the bloc to relocate " you ca n't help but notice that the required period of retention ran out in september 2006 and half a year later nokia makes the decision to build a new plant romania , " she said . but german deputy economy minister hartmut schauerte told reporters berlin would request that the eu look into charges that nokia is profiting from european union subsidies in its decision to move production from germany to hungry and romania . " we are going to check with the european commission if the relocation of this site is being supported financially by european structural funds , " he said . " that must not be the case . " schauerte added germany was prepared for " intense talks " with nokia to try to strike a deal to keep the bochum plant open . hungarian support for move bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : sundbäck announced the bochum plant 's closure on tuesday nokia board member veli sundbäck said the company did not cash in on any eu subsidies in moving production to romania and hungry , both of which are eu members .
he added that the company , like any other , did register for financial support from the hungarian government .
hungary pays for up to 50 percent of costs for hi-tech companies that settle there . since 2005 , when the eu was accused of paying for aeg to move production within the eu from germany to poland , the bloc has issued guidelines that prohibit the subsidization of manufacturing shifts among member states . eu commission president jose manuel barroso said wednesday that there was little to criticize in nokia 's decision to move production to other eu member states . " if a shift from finland to germany is possible , then a shift from germany to romania also has to be possible , " he said . nokia the last to leave bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : nokia employees demonstrated to protest the plant 's closure the decision to close the bochum plant by the middle of the year makes nokia the last cell phone manufacturer to leave germany .
since 2006 , some 6,000 jobs at cell phone plants have been cut in germany as benq , once part of siemens , and motorola stopped german production . sundbäck said nokia could not convince supplier to setup shop near bochum and that the factory was not " internationally competitive . " " we are following nokia 's global strategy , which focuses on cost-effectiveness and logistics flexibility , " he said . german labor leaders , however , saying the factory was in the black . " the location is running really well , profits are being made here , " said ulrike kleinebrahm , the head of bochum 's ig-metall union , adding that the plant 's closure was a " catastrophe for bochum . " politicians and union leaders also said germany 's high labor costs , another reason cited by nokia for closing the plant , make up only 5 percent of production expenses , but salary costs in romania are a 10th of what companies pay in germany . nokia booked record results in the third quarter of 2007 .
its revenues climbed 28 percent to 12.9 billion euros compared to the same time the year before .
cell phone business is responsible for about 25 percent of the finnish company 's 1.56 billion euros in profits . dw staff -lrb- sms -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

more than 1,000 new nuclear power stations would have to be built to order to reduce the greenhouse effect with nuclear power - that 's not foreseeable . but even more importantly , investment in new nuclear power stations is expensive , though the necessary raw material - uranium - is cheap .
the expense means that nuclear power plants require long operating times to be profitable for investors , which sets the means of decades-worth of energy production in stone and hinders investment in non-fossil energy production . but if what climate researchers are saying is true , then there need to be recognizable reductions in greenhouse gasses by 2020 in order to save the climate .
this is exactly where many countries see a role for nuclear energy : as a transition to a solar age offering co2-free energy production in the next 20 to 50 years . germany has , at least for the moment , taken an uncompromising path : for lots of environmental technology and against nuclear power . the next few years will be decisive .
if germany proves that both an engaged climate policy and phasing out nuclear power are not mutually exclusive , then other countries will follow .
if germany fails , there will be an increasing nuclear energy , at least in industrialized nations , india , china and brazil .
in the world 's poorer countries , particularly in africa , nuclear power is still too expensive anyway . jens thurau is a dw-tv correspondent and environment expert -lrb- sms -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

little surprise , then , that a key investment-confidence indicator has plunged . peter bofinger and wolfgang franz , two of the five so-called " wise men " who act as economic advisers to the german government , said the peak of the financial market crisis has not yet been reached . " i expect the peak of the financial crisis to be reached at mid-year , " bofinger told the berliner zeitung newspaper .
bofinger said he was n't surprised by an overall sell-off on the dax on tuesday , jan .
15 , after german real-estate investment firm hypo real estate plunged a dizzying 35 percent - the steepest one-day price drop the dax has seen to date .
the fall came after the company announced it was writing off 390 million euros -lrb- $ 580 million -rrb- on us subprime debt losses .
shares had made back some gains in early wednesday trading .
effects of us real-estate pressure investors were taken by surprise by the write-off , because hypo real estate 's management had repeatedly said that the firm would be unscathed by the credit crunch , which has swept world markets .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hypo real estate took one of the biggest falls in dax history " the interest rate adjustments for buyers of us real estate are now coming into effect , and that is steadily increasing pressure on real estate markets , " bofinger told the berliner zeitung .
meanwhile , franz said the financial market crisis is not yet over , adding that interest-rate increases for mortgages , which are now coming into effect , will " create problems for some debtors , increasing the likelihood of defaults at banks and also here in germany . "
investors eye us for recession signals hypo real estate 's announcement on tuesday came in the wake of more grim news out of the us financial sector ; america 's biggest bank , citigroup , reported that it suffered a record $ 9.83 billion fourth-quarter loss .
meanwhile , concerns that a possible us recession will deepen the slowdown in europe 's largest economy pushed down a key german investor-confidence index .
a study by the zew center for european economic research published on tuesday showed investor confidence in germany fell to its lowest point in 15 years .
investor confidence was at minus 41.6 , from minus 37.2 a month earlier - the eighth straight decline .
it was a greater drop than analysts had expected . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hope for better days even as investor confidence slumped in germany in january goldman sachs and merrill lynch have forecast that the us will slip into recession this year for the first time since 2001 , as the housing slump , which has driven up credit costs globally , curbs consumer spending .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de health -pipe- 16.01.2008 eu raids drug firms in industry-competition probe großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : color me skeptical : eu regulators thought it best to arrive unannounced the eu raided pharmaceutical companies across europe , amid concerns over uncompetitive behavior in the industry .
regulators worry the big drug makers are acting to keep generics off the market , among other issues . the dawn raids and sector inquiry , which the eu commission said was not based on specific suspected violations , could lead to cartel charges against companies and potentially huge fines .
patents are the life blood of the pharmaceutical industry but critics allege some companies misuse patent rights to delay the introduction of generic medicines in unjustified ways .
the cost of medicines is a hot-button issue in europe , where governments are seeking to trim health care costs at the same time as encouraging the development of the pharmaceutical and biotechnology sectors .
three of europe 's biggest drug makers - astrazeneca , glaxosmithkline and sanofi-aventis - acknowledged they had been approached by eu regulators as part of the antitrust probe .
us-based pfizer , the world 's top drug maker , also confirmed it was being investigated .
looking for " something rotten " regulators said they suspect the firms involved may be protecting their own market shares at the expense of introducing better drugs .
" a sector inquiry is something we engage in if we have the feeling that the sector is not working optimally ... "
eu competition commissioner neelie kroes said .
" if there is a feeling that something is rotten in the state , or something could be rotten , let 's take the opportunity to find out , " she added .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : eu commissioner kroes takes on a hot-button issue european citizens spend some 200 billion euros -lrb- $ 297 billion -rrb- a year on pharmaceutical products - the equivalent of 400 euros for every man , woman and child in the eu , kroes said .
unexplained drop in product launches but over the last decade , the number of new components launched on the market has fallen from an average of 40 per year between 1995 and 1999 , to just 28 per year between 2000 and 2004 .
" if innovative products are n't being produced , and cheaper generic alternatives are being delayed , we need to find out why , " kroes said .
the raids were carried out in a number of eu states with the help of local authorities , and targeted both firms based in europe and those based outside the continent who are active in its market .
kroes would not comment on which specific countries and companies were involved .
major concerns confirm probe however , astrazeneca said in a statement on wednesday : " we confirm that we are part of a sector inquiry instituted by the european commission on jan .
15 , 2008 into aspects of the pharmaceutical industry . "
the company added it was fully cooperating with the probe .
" the inquiry relates to the introduction of innovative and generic medicines for human consumption onto the market and covers commercial practices , including the use of patents , " the statement added .
" we understand that several companies have been similarly approached in connection with the inquiry . "
a spokesman for glaxosmithkline said the british group had also been visited by eu regulators as part of the investigation .
" we have been contacted by them , " the gsk spokesman said .
" i can not say the date or which site or where but we can confirm we have been visited by them . "
patent disputes at heart of issue the inquiry will pay particular attention to deals between drugs firms , such as settlements in patent disputes , and to the question of whether some companies could have abused their patent and legal rights to keep rivals out of the market .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : pfizer also got a visit from eu regulators given that such questions deal with highly-sensitive information which " may be easily withheld , concealed or destroyed , " the use of unannounced inspections was " considered appropriate , " kroes said .
the primary aim of the inquiry is to gather and analyze information on the operation of the pharmaceuticals market .
however , if it brings to light evidence of specific wrong-doing , such cases will be dealt with as they arise , she said .
the commission is tasked with ensuring that eu states and companies obey eu laws , including those on competition .
in the last year alone , it imposed fines of over 3 billion euros -lrb- $ 4.5 billion -rrb- on firms which had broken competition law .
unlike in those cartel cases , the raids on the drugs sector were not prompted by specific indications of illegal activity , but by a more general sense that the eu market is not working , kroes stressed .
" the inquiry is not investigating specific companies and is not based on specific evidence , " she said .
however , it would focus on " a couple of issues where we are not feeling safe that it is pro-competitive , " she added .
astrazeneca previously faced fines but during a news conference , kroes cited astrazeneca as a clear example of a company in which competition was not functioning optimally , referring to a 2005 decision in which the commission fined the company 60 million euros .
the commission found that astrazeneca had misused the patent system to delay market entry of rivals to its ulcer drug losec .
other companies , including merck , bayer schering pharma and roche holding , said they were not aware that they were involved or had not received inquiries from officials . dw staff / dpa -lrb- jen -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

leading social democrats are calling for sport to become a constitutional objective in germany .
some applaud the idea , but legal experts say it 's not the way to beef up federal funding for sports . after meeting with members of the german football association -lrb- dfb -rrb- and organizers for the women 's soccer world championship , manfred schaub , a member of the social democrats ' executive , said having sport as a constitutional objective would help resolve urban space issues , and make sure sport did n't always suffer when state coffers were empty . spd head kurt beck added that he recognized the contribution of the dfb in combating racism and integrating young immigrants . however , in an interview with the taz newspaper earlier in january , former constitutional court judge udo steiner advised against the move to make sport a national objective on the grounds that such objectives only required the government to act , but did n't specify in what way . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : clubs hope inclusion in the constitution will mean more financial support " as a general rule , there is always going to be controversy about what measures are appropriate , " steiner told the taz .
" if sport becomes a national objective , it probably would n't receive one single euro more .
political priorities determine how government money is distributed , and that is how it should be . " but the general director of the german olympic committee , michael vesper , said late last year that he welcomed the social democrats ' support for the initiative . " it is good news for sport , especially for the 7.5 million volunteers involved , " he said in a statement . a private matter ? nearly 30 percent of germany 's population is a member in a sports association . " there are more than 90,000 sports clubs and they help to keep our communities together , " vesper said .
" the inclusion of sport as national objective … can back community-spirited sports and give greater power to promote its aims . " however , speaking at a government hearing on the subject in 2007 , friedhelm hufen , a constitutional expert at the university of mainz , emphasized that the purpose of the constitution was not to recognize the efforts of volunteers and organizations . objectives currently in the german constitution include democracy , rule of law , environmental protection and animal protection , which , in 2002 , was the most recent addition .
a recent proposal also called for special protection of children in the constitution . most states support sport bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : sport is part of nearly all state constitutions fifteen of germany 's 16 states have already added sport to their list of objectives in their state constitutions .
under the federal constitution , the german government is responsible for supporting top-level sports . the social democrats have said before they wanted culture to be included as a new constitutional objective , along with sport .
the initiative also has the support of the left party and the free-market liberal free democrats , who originally called for the constitutional changes back in 2006 . as constitutional amendments require a two-thirds majority , they need the backing of chancellor angela merkel 's christian democrats .
however , the party made it clear in december 2007 that it would n't support any constitution changes within the current legislature period , which runs to may 2009 . dw staff -lrb- kh -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" right now , i keep monday nights free of other commitments , " the 32-year old said from her home in cologne .
" if there were only re-runs i 'd probably do something besides watch tv , because i would n't want to have to watch something else . " but kern and other german viewers are unlikely to be faced with re-runs of " lost " as the prosieben channel still has 15 of season three 's 22 episodes and can fall back on the eight episodes of season four that were already produced before the us writers ' strike began on nov .
5 . " the gap between the broadcast dates has kept us from feeling any real effects of the strike , " prosieben spokeswoman katja pichler said . germans hoping for an agreement - soon bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the writers ' strike turned the golden globes into little more than a press conference but the gap is n't as large for other series .
the fourth , and newest , season of " grey 's anatomy , " also shown on prosieben , is set to start in germany in february .
while the 11 shows produced before the strike began are waiting to be broadcast in germany , pichler said the channel has not decided what it will do if no new episodes arrive from the us . " we are hoping the strike will end , and that we do n't have to change our schedule , " she said , adding that prosieben needs six months to dub an episode of an american series into german . rtl , another major commercial german tv station , also said it has not yet determined how it will react if it runs out of " csi , " " house m.d. " or " law and order " episodes , according to spokesman claus richter . " we do n't have to be worried until autumn 2008 , " richter said .
" half the episodes for rtl 's series are ready and will be aired .
after that , we 'll have to decide if we show re-runs or something completely different . " sticking with us staples bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : complex dialog in fox 's house m.d. makes it difficult to dub , richter said but neither prosieben nor rtl , which regularly compete for the best ratings in the lucrative 14-49 age group , said they are planning to make any long-term changes to their programming based on the strike , and that they would continue buying and broadcasting us series . " we are happy with the strength of our us series and think viewers will come back when there are new episodes , " pichler said . prosieben and rtl are the two german broadcasters that rely most on us programming . according to a 2006 program analysis , 78 percent of prosieben 's and 47 percent of rtl 's fictional programming came from the united states . a matter of taste germany 's publicly funded stations rely less on us productions , with the top two , ard and zdf , buying 21 percent and 22 percent of their fiction programming from the us .
the two channels have also successfully invested in british , scandinavian and french mystery series , according to wolfgang seufert , a professor at the university of jena . " in all , there is a clear preference for german series , followed by us productions and then series from other countries , " he said , adding that a few us series beat out local productions to earn top ratings in germany . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : kern said german series do n't hold her interest as well as american ones but kern said german series just do n't hold her attention .

" but i get sucked into the us shows and have to see what 's going to happen next . " viewers will wait it out that 's good news for german broadcasters , since home-grown productions cost more than purchasing and dubbing foreign series , seufert said , he added that broadcasters can relax in knowing that viewers will be back whenever new episodes are ready to air . " overall tv use is relatively independent of what 's being shown , " he said , adding that the average german household has a choice of 30 channels .

" right now , i keep monday nights free of other commitments , " the 32-year old said from her home in cologne .
" if there were only re-runs i 'd probably do something besides watch tv , because i would n't want to have to watch something else . " but kern and other german viewers are unlikely to be faced with re-runs of " lost " as the prosieben channel still has 15 of season three 's 22 episodes and can fall back on the eight episodes of season four that were already produced before the us writers ' strike began on nov .
5 . " the gap between the broadcast dates has kept us from feeling any real effects of the strike , " prosieben spokeswoman katja pichler said . germans hoping for an agreement - soon bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the writers ' strike turned the golden globes into little more than a press conference but the gap is n't as large for other series .
the fourth , and newest , season of " grey 's anatomy , " also shown on prosieben , is set to start in germany in february .
while the 11 shows produced before the strike began are waiting to be broadcast in germany , pichler said the channel has not decided what it will do if no new episodes arrive from the us . " we are hoping the strike will end , and that we do n't have to change our schedule , " she said , adding that prosieben needs six months to dub an episode of an american series into german . rtl , another major commercial german tv station , also said it has not yet determined how it will react if it runs out of " csi , " " house m.d. " or " law and order " episodes , according to spokesman claus richter . " we do n't have to be worried until autumn 2008 , " richter said .
" half the episodes for rtl 's series are ready and will be aired .
after that , we 'll have to decide if we show re-runs or something completely different . " sticking with us staples bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : complex dialog in fox 's house m.d. makes it difficult to dub , richter said but neither prosieben nor rtl , which regularly compete for the best ratings in the lucrative 14-49 age group , said they are planning to make any long-term changes to their programming based on the strike , and that they would continue buying and broadcasting us series . " we are happy with the strength of our us series and think viewers will come back when there are new episodes , " pichler said . prosieben and rtl are the two german broadcasters that rely most on us programming . according to a 2006 program analysis , 78 percent of prosieben 's and 47 percent of rtl 's fictional programming came from the united states . a matter of taste germany 's publicly funded stations rely less on us productions , with the top two , ard and zdf , buying 21 percent and 22 percent of their fiction programming from the us .
the two channels have also successfully invested in british , scandinavian and french mystery series , according to wolfgang seufert , a professor at the university of jena . " in all , there is a clear preference for german series , followed by us productions and then series from other countries , " he said , adding that a few us series beat out local productions to earn top ratings in germany . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : kern said german series do n't hold her interest as well as american ones but kern said german series just do n't hold her attention . " when i watch a german mystery i know who the murderer is in the first 10 minutes and change the channel , " kern said .
" but i get sucked into the us shows and have to see what 's going to happen next . " viewers will wait it out that 's good news for german broadcasters , since home-grown productions cost more than purchasing and dubbing foreign series , seufert said , he added that broadcasters can relax in knowing that viewers will be back whenever new episodes are ready to air . " overall tv use is relatively independent of what 's being shown , " he said , adding that the average german household has a choice of 30 channels .
" when people 's favorite show is n't on , they 'll watch something else and then switch back when their favorite show is back .

leading social democrats are calling for sport to become a constitutional objective in germany .
some applaud the idea , but legal experts say it 's not the way to beef up federal funding for sports . after meeting with members of the german football association -lrb- dfb -rrb- and organizers for the women 's soccer world championship , manfred schaub , a member of the social democrats ' executive , said having sport as a constitutional objective would help resolve urban space issues , and make sure sport did n't always suffer when state coffers were empty . spd head kurt beck added that he recognized the contribution of the dfb in combating racism and integrating young immigrants . however , in an interview with the taz newspaper earlier in january , former constitutional court judge udo steiner advised against the move to make sport a national objective on the grounds that such objectives only required the government to act , but did n't specify in what way . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : clubs hope inclusion in the constitution will mean more financial support " as a general rule , there is always going to be controversy about what measures are appropriate , " steiner told the taz .
" if sport becomes a national objective , it probably would n't receive one single euro more .
political priorities determine how government money is distributed , and that is how it should be . " but the general director of the german olympic committee , michael vesper , said late last year that he welcomed the social democrats ' support for the initiative . " it is good news for sport , especially for the 7.5 million volunteers involved , " he said in a statement . a private matter ? nearly 30 percent of germany 's population is a member in a sports association . " there are more than 90,000 sports clubs and they help to keep our communities together , " vesper said .
" the inclusion of sport as national objective … can back community-spirited sports and give greater power to promote its aims . " however , speaking at a government hearing on the subject in 2007 , friedhelm hufen , a constitutional expert at the university of mainz , emphasized that the purpose of the constitution was not to recognize the efforts of volunteers and organizations . objectives currently in the german constitution include democracy , rule of law , environmental protection and animal protection , which , in 2002 , was the most recent addition .
a recent proposal also called for special protection of children in the constitution . most states support sport bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : sport is part of nearly all state constitutions fifteen of germany 's 16 states have already added sport to their list of objectives in their state constitutions .
under the federal constitution , the german government is responsible for supporting top-level sports . the social democrats have said before they wanted culture to be included as a new constitutional objective , along with sport .
the initiative also has the support of the left party and the free-market liberal free democrats , who originally called for the constitutional changes back in 2006 . as constitutional amendments require a two-thirds majority , they need the backing of chancellor angela merkel 's christian democrats .

leading social democrats are calling for sport to become a constitutional objective in germany .
some applaud the idea , but legal experts say it 's not the way to beef up federal funding for sports . after meeting with members of the german football association -lrb- dfb -rrb- and organizers for the women 's soccer world championship , manfred schaub , a member of the social democrats ' executive , said having sport as a constitutional objective would help resolve urban space issues , and make sure sport did n't always suffer when state coffers were empty . spd head kurt beck added that he recognized the contribution of the dfb in combating racism and integrating young immigrants . however , in an interview with the taz newspaper earlier in january , former constitutional court judge udo steiner advised against the move to make sport a national objective on the grounds that such objectives only required the government to act , but did n't specify in what way . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : clubs hope inclusion in the constitution will mean more financial support " as a general rule , there is always going to be controversy about what measures are appropriate , " steiner told the taz .
" if sport becomes a national objective , it probably would n't receive one single euro more .
political priorities determine how government money is distributed , and that is how it should be . " but the general director of the german olympic committee , michael vesper , said late last year that he welcomed the social democrats ' support for the initiative . " it is good news for sport , especially for the 7.5 million volunteers involved , " he said in a statement . a private matter ? nearly 30 percent of germany 's population is a member in a sports association . " there are more than 90,000 sports clubs and they help to keep our communities together , " vesper said .
" the inclusion of sport as national objective … can back community-spirited sports and give greater power to promote its aims . " however , speaking at a government hearing on the subject in 2007 , friedhelm hufen , a constitutional expert at the university of mainz , emphasized that the purpose of the constitution was not to recognize the efforts of volunteers and organizations . objectives currently in the german constitution include democracy , rule of law , environmental protection and animal protection , which , in 2002 , was the most recent addition .
a recent proposal also called for special protection of children in the constitution . most states support sport bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : sport is part of nearly all state constitutions fifteen of germany 's 16 states have already added sport to their list of objectives in their state constitutions .
under the federal constitution , the german government is responsible for supporting top-level sports . the social democrats have said before they wanted culture to be included as a new constitutional objective , along with sport .
the initiative also has the support of the left party and the free-market liberal free democrats , who originally called for the constitutional changes back in 2006 . as constitutional amendments require a two-thirds majority , they need the backing of chancellor angela merkel 's christian democrats .
however , the party made it clear in december 2007 that it would n't support any constitution changes within the current legislature period , which runs to may 2009 . dw staff -lrb- kh -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" if there were only re-runs i 'd probably do something besides watch tv , because i would n't want to have to watch something else .

16 , that the finnish company was a " locust which got money in germany and then said without warning ' we are going to romania ' to maybe get more public funds there . " he also said he would attempt to recover the 60 million euros -lrb- $ 89 million -rrb- in subsidies the state had paid the company .
nokia also received about 28 million euros from the federal government . " we are not simply going to accept this - this is not yet the end of the debate , " he added . german politicians have accused international companies of behaving like " locusts " to describe what they deem an excessive greed for profits . but getting any payments from nokia is likely to prove difficult .
north rhine-westphalia 's finance minister , christa thoben , said a deal holding the company to bochum , where it employed some 2,000 people , in exchange for subsidies ran out before nokia announced its plans to leave . subsidies lure hi-tech companies bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germans are calling on the eu to show nokia received no money from the bloc to relocate " you ca n't help but notice that the required period of retention ran out in september 2006 and half a year later nokia makes the decision to build a new plant romania , " she said . but german deputy economy minister hartmut schauerte told reporters berlin would request that the eu look into charges that nokia is profiting from european union subsidies in its decision to move production from germany to hungry and romania . " we are going to check with the european commission if the relocation of this site is being supported financially by european structural funds , " he said . " that must not be the case . " schauerte added germany was prepared for " intense talks " with nokia to try to strike a deal to keep the bochum plant open . hungarian support for move bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : sundbäck announced the bochum plant 's closure on tuesday nokia board member veli sundbäck said the company did not cash in on any eu subsidies in moving production to romania and hungry , both of which are eu members .
he added that the company , like any other , did register for financial support from the hungarian government .
hungary pays for up to 50 percent of costs for hi-tech companies that settle there . since 2005 , when the eu was accused of paying for aeg to move production within the eu from germany to poland , the bloc has issued guidelines that prohibit the subsidization of manufacturing shifts among member states . eu commission president jose manuel barroso said wednesday that there was little to criticize in nokia 's decision to move production to other eu member states . " if a shift from finland to germany is possible , then a shift from germany to romania also has to be possible , " he said . nokia the last to leave bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : nokia employees demonstrated to protest the plant 's closure the decision to close the bochum plant by the middle of the year makes nokia the last cell phone manufacturer to leave germany .
since 2006 , some 6,000 jobs at cell phone plants have been cut in germany as benq , once part of siemens , and motorola stopped german production . sundbäck said nokia could not convince supplier to setup shop near bochum and that the factory was not " internationally competitive . " " we are following nokia 's global strategy , which focuses on cost-effectiveness and logistics flexibility , " he said . german labor leaders , however , saying the factory was in the black . " the location is running really well , profits are being made here , " said ulrike kleinebrahm , the head of bochum 's ig-metall union , adding that the plant 's closure was a " catastrophe for bochum . " politicians and union leaders also said germany 's high labor costs , another reason cited by nokia for closing the plant , make up only 5 percent of production expenses , but salary costs in romania are a 10th of what companies pay in germany . nokia booked record results in the third quarter of 2007 .
its revenues climbed 28 percent to 12.9 billion euros compared to the same time the year before .
cell phone business is responsible for about 25 percent of the finnish company 's 1.56 billion euros in profits . dw staff -lrb- sms -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

regulators worry the big drug makers are acting to keep generics off the market , among other issues . the dawn raids and sector inquiry , which the eu commission said was not based on specific suspected violations , could lead to cartel charges against companies and potentially huge fines .
patents are the life blood of the pharmaceutical industry but critics allege some companies misuse patent rights to delay the introduction of generic medicines in unjustified ways .
the cost of medicines is a hot-button issue in europe , where governments are seeking to trim health care costs at the same time as encouraging the development of the pharmaceutical and biotechnology sectors .
three of europe 's biggest drug makers - astrazeneca , glaxosmithkline and sanofi-aventis - acknowledged they had been approached by eu regulators as part of the antitrust probe .
us-based pfizer , the world 's top drug maker , also confirmed it was being investigated .
looking for " something rotten " regulators said they suspect the firms involved may be protecting their own market shares at the expense of introducing better drugs .
" a sector inquiry is something we engage in if we have the feeling that the sector is not working optimally ... "
eu competition commissioner neelie kroes said .
" if there is a feeling that something is rotten in the state , or something could be rotten , let 's take the opportunity to find out , " she added .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : eu commissioner kroes takes on a hot-button issue european citizens spend some 200 billion euros -lrb- $ 297 billion -rrb- a year on pharmaceutical products - the equivalent of 400 euros for every man , woman and child in the eu , kroes said .
unexplained drop in product launches but over the last decade , the number of new components launched on the market has fallen from an average of 40 per year between 1995 and 1999 , to just 28 per year between 2000 and 2004 .
" if innovative products are n't being produced , and cheaper generic alternatives are being delayed , we need to find out why , " kroes said .
the raids were carried out in a number of eu states with the help of local authorities , and targeted both firms based in europe and those based outside the continent who are active in its market .
kroes would not comment on which specific countries and companies were involved .
major concerns confirm probe however , astrazeneca said in a statement on wednesday : " we confirm that we are part of a sector inquiry instituted by the european commission on jan .
15 , 2008 into aspects of the pharmaceutical industry . "
the company added it was fully cooperating with the probe .
" the inquiry relates to the introduction of innovative and generic medicines for human consumption onto the market and covers commercial practices , including the use of patents , " the statement added .
" we understand that several companies have been similarly approached in connection with the inquiry . "
a spokesman for glaxosmithkline said the british group had also been visited by eu regulators as part of the investigation .
" we have been contacted by them , " the gsk spokesman said .
" i can not say the date or which site or where but we can confirm we have been visited by them . "
patent disputes at heart of issue the inquiry will pay particular attention to deals between drugs firms , such as settlements in patent disputes , and to the question of whether some companies could have abused their patent and legal rights to keep rivals out of the market .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : pfizer also got a visit from eu regulators given that such questions deal with highly-sensitive information which " may be easily withheld , concealed or destroyed , " the use of unannounced inspections was " considered appropriate , " kroes said .
the primary aim of the inquiry is to gather and analyze information on the operation of the pharmaceuticals market .
however , if it brings to light evidence of specific wrong-doing , such cases will be dealt with as they arise , she said .
the commission is tasked with ensuring that eu states and companies obey eu laws , including those on competition .
in the last year alone , it imposed fines of over 3 billion euros -lrb- $ 4.5 billion -rrb- on firms which had broken competition law .
unlike in those cartel cases , the raids on the drugs sector were not prompted by specific indications of illegal activity , but by a more general sense that the eu market is not working , kroes stressed .
" the inquiry is not investigating specific companies and is not based on specific evidence , " she said .
however , it would focus on " a couple of issues where we are not feeling safe that it is pro-competitive , " she added .
astrazeneca previously faced fines but during a news conference , kroes cited astrazeneca as a clear example of a company in which competition was not functioning optimally , referring to a 2005 decision in which the commission fined the company 60 million euros .
the commission found that astrazeneca had misused the patent system to delay market entry of rivals to its ulcer drug losec .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de television -pipe- 16.01.2008 broadcast gap protects german tv from us writers ' strike großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german tv viewers are n't faced with incessant re-runs - at least for the moment german tv stations are counting on the gap between the us broadcast and the airing of the dubbed versions of american shows to protect them from a scriptwriters ' strike that has plastered us screens with re-runs . to sandra kern , the idea of having being stuck with re-runs rather than new episodes the us-hit series " lost " is very upsetting . " right now , i keep monday nights free of other commitments , " the 32-year old said from her home in cologne .
" if there were only re-runs i 'd probably do something besides watch tv , because i would n't want to have to watch something else . " but kern and other german viewers are unlikely to be faced with re-runs of " lost " as the prosieben channel still has 15 of season three 's 22 episodes and can fall back on the eight episodes of season four that were already produced before the us writers ' strike began on nov .
5 . " the gap between the broadcast dates has kept us from feeling any real effects of the strike , " prosieben spokeswoman katja pichler said . germans hoping for an agreement - soon bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the writers ' strike turned the golden globes into little more than a press conference but the gap is n't as large for other series .
the fourth , and newest , season of " grey 's anatomy , " also shown on prosieben , is set to start in germany in february .
while the 11 shows produced before the strike began are waiting to be broadcast in germany , pichler said the channel has not decided what it will do if no new episodes arrive from the us . " we are hoping the strike will end , and that we do n't have to change our schedule , " she said , adding that prosieben needs six months to dub an episode of an american series into german . rtl , another major commercial german tv station , also said it has not yet determined how it will react if it runs out of " csi , " " house m.d. " or " law and order " episodes , according to spokesman claus richter . " we do n't have to be worried until autumn 2008 , " richter said .
" half the episodes for rtl 's series are ready and will be aired .
after that , we 'll have to decide if we show re-runs or something completely different . " sticking with us staples bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : complex dialog in fox 's house m.d. makes it difficult to dub , richter said but neither prosieben nor rtl , which regularly compete for the best ratings in the lucrative 14-49 age group , said they are planning to make any long-term changes to their programming based on the strike , and that they would continue buying and broadcasting us series . " we are happy with the strength of our us series and think viewers will come back when there are new episodes , " pichler said . prosieben and rtl are the two german broadcasters that rely most on us programming . according to a 2006 program analysis , 78 percent of prosieben 's and 47 percent of rtl 's fictional programming came from the united states . a matter of taste germany 's publicly funded stations rely less on us productions , with the top two , ard and zdf , buying 21 percent and 22 percent of their fiction programming from the us .
the two channels have also successfully invested in british , scandinavian and french mystery series , according to wolfgang seufert , a professor at the university of jena . " in all , there is a clear preference for german series , followed by us productions and then series from other countries , " he said , adding that a few us series beat out local productions to earn top ratings in germany . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : kern said german series do n't hold her interest as well as american ones but kern said german series just do n't hold her attention . " when i watch a german mystery i know who the murderer is in the first 10 minutes and change the channel , " kern said .
" but i get sucked into the us shows and have to see what 's going to happen next . " viewers will wait it out that 's good news for german broadcasters , since home-grown productions cost more than purchasing and dubbing foreign series , seufert said , he added that broadcasters can relax in knowing that viewers will be back whenever new episodes are ready to air . " overall tv use is relatively independent of what 's being shown , " he said , adding that the average german household has a choice of 30 channels .
" when people 's favorite show is n't on , they 'll watch something else and then switch back when their favorite show is back . " possible benefits for german writers bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german scriptwriters took to berlin 's streets to show solidarity with their us counterparts viewers who are willing to sit through repeats or watch another program lower the chances that the writers guild of america strike - especially if it ends soon - will help german writers sell more scripts , according to katharina uppenbrink , head of the german scriptwriters ' association . " if the strike ends soon , i do n't expect much of a change in stations ' policies , " she said . but if the us writers ' demands are met , it could help germans ' negotiating position when marketing their work , uppenbrink said . though differences in german and us labor structure make a direct comparisons difficult , the average pay for all the rights to an episode of a german series , which can take between weeks and months to complete depending on the author , is between 23,000 euros and 24,000 euros -lrb- $ 34,200 and $ 35,700 -rrb- , she said .
over a five-year period , us writers earn an average annual income of $ 62,000 , according to the writers guild of america . " we 're really watching what happens in the us because it would serve as a guide for germans and europeans , " she said .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de health -pipe- 16.01.2008 eu raids drug firms in industry-competition probe großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : color me skeptical : eu regulators thought it best to arrive unannounced the eu raided pharmaceutical companies across europe , amid concerns over uncompetitive behavior in the industry .
regulators worry the big drug makers are acting to keep generics off the market , among other issues . the dawn raids and sector inquiry , which the eu commission said was not based on specific suspected violations , could lead to cartel charges against companies and potentially huge fines .
patents are the life blood of the pharmaceutical industry but critics allege some companies misuse patent rights to delay the introduction of generic medicines in unjustified ways .
the cost of medicines is a hot-button issue in europe , where governments are seeking to trim health care costs at the same time as encouraging the development of the pharmaceutical and biotechnology sectors .
three of europe 's biggest drug makers - astrazeneca , glaxosmithkline and sanofi-aventis - acknowledged they had been approached by eu regulators as part of the antitrust probe .
us-based pfizer , the world 's top drug maker , also confirmed it was being investigated .
looking for " something rotten " regulators said they suspect the firms involved may be protecting their own market shares at the expense of introducing better drugs .
" a sector inquiry is something we engage in if we have the feeling that the sector is not working optimally ... "
eu competition commissioner neelie kroes said .
" if there is a feeling that something is rotten in the state , or something could be rotten , let 's take the opportunity to find out , " she added .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : eu commissioner kroes takes on a hot-button issue european citizens spend some 200 billion euros -lrb- $ 297 billion -rrb- a year on pharmaceutical products - the equivalent of 400 euros for every man , woman and child in the eu , kroes said .
unexplained drop in product launches but over the last decade , the number of new components launched on the market has fallen from an average of 40 per year between 1995 and 1999 , to just 28 per year between 2000 and 2004 .
" if innovative products are n't being produced , and cheaper generic alternatives are being delayed , we need to find out why , " kroes said .
the raids were carried out in a number of eu states with the help of local authorities , and targeted both firms based in europe and those based outside the continent who are active in its market .
kroes would not comment on which specific countries and companies were involved .
major concerns confirm probe however , astrazeneca said in a statement on wednesday : " we confirm that we are part of a sector inquiry instituted by the european commission on jan .
15 , 2008 into aspects of the pharmaceutical industry . "
the company added it was fully cooperating with the probe .
" the inquiry relates to the introduction of innovative and generic medicines for human consumption onto the market and covers commercial practices , including the use of patents , " the statement added .
" we understand that several companies have been similarly approached in connection with the inquiry . "
a spokesman for glaxosmithkline said the british group had also been visited by eu regulators as part of the investigation .
" we have been contacted by them , " the gsk spokesman said .
" i can not say the date or which site or where but we can confirm we have been visited by them . "
patent disputes at heart of issue the inquiry will pay particular attention to deals between drugs firms , such as settlements in patent disputes , and to the question of whether some companies could have abused their patent and legal rights to keep rivals out of the market .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : pfizer also got a visit from eu regulators given that such questions deal with highly-sensitive information which " may be easily withheld , concealed or destroyed , " the use of unannounced inspections was " considered appropriate , " kroes said .
the primary aim of the inquiry is to gather and analyze information on the operation of the pharmaceuticals market .
however , if it brings to light evidence of specific wrong-doing , such cases will be dealt with as they arise , she said .
the commission is tasked with ensuring that eu states and companies obey eu laws , including those on competition .
in the last year alone , it imposed fines of over 3 billion euros -lrb- $ 4.5 billion -rrb- on firms which had broken competition law .
unlike in those cartel cases , the raids on the drugs sector were not prompted by specific indications of illegal activity , but by a more general sense that the eu market is not working , kroes stressed .
" the inquiry is not investigating specific companies and is not based on specific evidence , " she said .
however , it would focus on " a couple of issues where we are not feeling safe that it is pro-competitive , " she added .
astrazeneca previously faced fines but during a news conference , kroes cited astrazeneca as a clear example of a company in which competition was not functioning optimally , referring to a 2005 decision in which the commission fined the company 60 million euros .
the commission found that astrazeneca had misused the patent system to delay market entry of rivals to its ulcer drug losec .
other companies , including merck , bayer schering pharma and roche holding , said they were not aware that they were involved or had not received inquiries from officials . dw staff / dpa -lrb- jen -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de television -pipe- 16.01.2008 broadcast gap protects german tv from us writers ' strike großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german tv viewers are n't faced with incessant re-runs - at least for the moment german tv stations are counting on the gap between the us broadcast and the airing of the dubbed versions of american shows to protect them from a scriptwriters ' strike that has plastered us screens with re-runs . to sandra kern , the idea of having being stuck with re-runs rather than new episodes the us-hit series " lost " is very upsetting . " right now , i keep monday nights free of other commitments , " the 32-year old said from her home in cologne .
" if there were only re-runs i 'd probably do something besides watch tv , because i would n't want to have to watch something else . " but kern and other german viewers are unlikely to be faced with re-runs of " lost " as the prosieben channel still has 15 of season three 's 22 episodes and can fall back on the eight episodes of season four that were already produced before the us writers ' strike began on nov .
5 . " the gap between the broadcast dates has kept us from feeling any real effects of the strike , " prosieben spokeswoman katja pichler said . germans hoping for an agreement - soon bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the writers ' strike turned the golden globes into little more than a press conference but the gap is n't as large for other series .
the fourth , and newest , season of " grey 's anatomy , " also shown on prosieben , is set to start in germany in february .
while the 11 shows produced before the strike began are waiting to be broadcast in germany , pichler said the channel has not decided what it will do if no new episodes arrive from the us . " we are hoping the strike will end , and that we do n't have to change our schedule , " she said , adding that prosieben needs six months to dub an episode of an american series into german . rtl , another major commercial german tv station , also said it has not yet determined how it will react if it runs out of " csi , " " house m.d. " or " law and order " episodes , according to spokesman claus richter . " we do n't have to be worried until autumn 2008 , " richter said .
" half the episodes for rtl 's series are ready and will be aired .
after that , we 'll have to decide if we show re-runs or something completely different . " sticking with us staples bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : complex dialog in fox 's house m.d. makes it difficult to dub , richter said but neither prosieben nor rtl , which regularly compete for the best ratings in the lucrative 14-49 age group , said they are planning to make any long-term changes to their programming based on the strike , and that they would continue buying and broadcasting us series . " we are happy with the strength of our us series and think viewers will come back when there are new episodes , " pichler said . prosieben and rtl are the two german broadcasters that rely most on us programming . according to a 2006 program analysis , 78 percent of prosieben 's and 47 percent of rtl 's fictional programming came from the united states . a matter of taste germany 's publicly funded stations rely less on us productions , with the top two , ard and zdf , buying 21 percent and 22 percent of their fiction programming from the us .
the two channels have also successfully invested in british , scandinavian and french mystery series , according to wolfgang seufert , a professor at the university of jena . " in all , there is a clear preference for german series , followed by us productions and then series from other countries , " he said , adding that a few us series beat out local productions to earn top ratings in germany . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : kern said german series do n't hold her interest as well as american ones but kern said german series just do n't hold her attention .

" right now , i keep monday nights free of other commitments , " the 32-year old said from her home in cologne .
" if there were only re-runs i 'd probably do something besides watch tv , because i would n't want to have to watch something else . " but kern and other german viewers are unlikely to be faced with re-runs of " lost " as the prosieben channel still has 15 of season three 's 22 episodes and can fall back on the eight episodes of season four that were already produced before the us writers ' strike began on nov .
5 . " the gap between the broadcast dates has kept us from feeling any real effects of the strike , " prosieben spokeswoman katja pichler said . germans hoping for an agreement - soon bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the writers ' strike turned the golden globes into little more than a press conference but the gap is n't as large for other series .
the fourth , and newest , season of " grey 's anatomy , " also shown on prosieben , is set to start in germany in february .
while the 11 shows produced before the strike began are waiting to be broadcast in germany , pichler said the channel has not decided what it will do if no new episodes arrive from the us . " we are hoping the strike will end , and that we do n't have to change our schedule , " she said , adding that prosieben needs six months to dub an episode of an american series into german . rtl , another major commercial german tv station , also said it has not yet determined how it will react if it runs out of " csi , " " house m.d. " or " law and order " episodes , according to spokesman claus richter . " we do n't have to be worried until autumn 2008 , " richter said .
" half the episodes for rtl 's series are ready and will be aired .
after that , we 'll have to decide if we show re-runs or something completely different . " sticking with us staples bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : complex dialog in fox 's house m.d. makes it difficult to dub , richter said but neither prosieben nor rtl , which regularly compete for the best ratings in the lucrative 14-49 age group , said they are planning to make any long-term changes to their programming based on the strike , and that they would continue buying and broadcasting us series . " we are happy with the strength of our us series and think viewers will come back when there are new episodes , " pichler said . prosieben and rtl are the two german broadcasters that rely most on us programming . according to a 2006 program analysis , 78 percent of prosieben 's and 47 percent of rtl 's fictional programming came from the united states . a matter of taste germany 's publicly funded stations rely less on us productions , with the top two , ard and zdf , buying 21 percent and 22 percent of their fiction programming from the us .
the two channels have also successfully invested in british , scandinavian and french mystery series , according to wolfgang seufert , a professor at the university of jena . " in all , there is a clear preference for german series , followed by us productions and then series from other countries , " he said , adding that a few us series beat out local productions to earn top ratings in germany . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : kern said german series do n't hold her interest as well as american ones but kern said german series just do n't hold her attention . " when i watch a german mystery i know who the murderer is in the first 10 minutes and change the channel , " kern said .
" but i get sucked into the us shows and have to see what 's going to happen next .

regulators worry the big drug makers are acting to keep generics off the market , among other issues . the dawn raids and sector inquiry , which the eu commission said was not based on specific suspected violations , could lead to cartel charges against companies and potentially huge fines .
patents are the life blood of the pharmaceutical industry but critics allege some companies misuse patent rights to delay the introduction of generic medicines in unjustified ways .
the cost of medicines is a hot-button issue in europe , where governments are seeking to trim health care costs at the same time as encouraging the development of the pharmaceutical and biotechnology sectors .
three of europe 's biggest drug makers - astrazeneca , glaxosmithkline and sanofi-aventis - acknowledged they had been approached by eu regulators as part of the antitrust probe .
us-based pfizer , the world 's top drug maker , also confirmed it was being investigated .
looking for " something rotten " regulators said they suspect the firms involved may be protecting their own market shares at the expense of introducing better drugs .
" a sector inquiry is something we engage in if we have the feeling that the sector is not working optimally ... "
eu competition commissioner neelie kroes said .
" if there is a feeling that something is rotten in the state , or something could be rotten , let 's take the opportunity to find out , " she added .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : eu commissioner kroes takes on a hot-button issue european citizens spend some 200 billion euros -lrb- $ 297 billion -rrb- a year on pharmaceutical products - the equivalent of 400 euros for every man , woman and child in the eu , kroes said .
unexplained drop in product launches but over the last decade , the number of new components launched on the market has fallen from an average of 40 per year between 1995 and 1999 , to just 28 per year between 2000 and 2004 .
" if innovative products are n't being produced , and cheaper generic alternatives are being delayed , we need to find out why , " kroes said .
the raids were carried out in a number of eu states with the help of local authorities , and targeted both firms based in europe and those based outside the continent who are active in its market .
kroes would not comment on which specific countries and companies were involved .
major concerns confirm probe however , astrazeneca said in a statement on wednesday : " we confirm that we are part of a sector inquiry instituted by the european commission on jan .
15 , 2008 into aspects of the pharmaceutical industry . "
the company added it was fully cooperating with the probe .
" the inquiry relates to the introduction of innovative and generic medicines for human consumption onto the market and covers commercial practices , including the use of patents , " the statement added .
" we understand that several companies have been similarly approached in connection with the inquiry . "
a spokesman for glaxosmithkline said the british group had also been visited by eu regulators as part of the investigation .
" we have been contacted by them , " the gsk spokesman said .
" i can not say the date or which site or where but we can confirm we have been visited by them . "
patent disputes at heart of issue the inquiry will pay particular attention to deals between drugs firms , such as settlements in patent disputes , and to the question of whether some companies could have abused their patent and legal rights to keep rivals out of the market .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : pfizer also got a visit from eu regulators given that such questions deal with highly-sensitive information which " may be easily withheld , concealed or destroyed , " the use of unannounced inspections was " considered appropriate , " kroes said .
the primary aim of the inquiry is to gather and analyze information on the operation of the pharmaceuticals market .
however , if it brings to light evidence of specific wrong-doing , such cases will be dealt with as they arise , she said .
the commission is tasked with ensuring that eu states and companies obey eu laws , including those on competition .
in the last year alone , it imposed fines of over 3 billion euros -lrb- $ 4.5 billion -rrb- on firms which had broken competition law .
unlike in those cartel cases , the raids on the drugs sector were not prompted by specific indications of illegal activity , but by a more general sense that the eu market is not working , kroes stressed .
" the inquiry is not investigating specific companies and is not based on specific evidence , " she said .
however , it would focus on " a couple of issues where we are not feeling safe that it is pro-competitive , " she added .
astrazeneca previously faced fines but during a news conference , kroes cited astrazeneca as a clear example of a company in which competition was not functioning optimally , referring to a 2005 decision in which the commission fined the company 60 million euros .
the commission found that astrazeneca had misused the patent system to delay market entry of rivals to its ulcer drug losec .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de europe -pipe- 16.01.2008 us mortgage market takes german victim , clouds outlook großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the frankfurt stock market took a major fall on tuesday the troubled us subprime-mortgage market took another german victim , and top economic advisers say the worst is yet to come .
little surprise , then , that a key investment-confidence indicator has plunged . peter bofinger and wolfgang franz , two of the five so-called " wise men " who act as economic advisers to the german government , said the peak of the financial market crisis has not yet been reached . " i expect the peak of the financial crisis to be reached at mid-year , " bofinger told the berliner zeitung newspaper .
bofinger said he was n't surprised by an overall sell-off on the dax on tuesday , jan .
15 , after german real-estate investment firm hypo real estate plunged a dizzying 35 percent - the steepest one-day price drop the dax has seen to date .
the fall came after the company announced it was writing off 390 million euros -lrb- $ 580 million -rrb- on us subprime debt losses .
shares had made back some gains in early wednesday trading .
effects of us real-estate pressure investors were taken by surprise by the write-off , because hypo real estate 's management had repeatedly said that the firm would be unscathed by the credit crunch , which has swept world markets .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hypo real estate took one of the biggest falls in dax history " the interest rate adjustments for buyers of us real estate are now coming into effect , and that is steadily increasing pressure on real estate markets , " bofinger told the berliner zeitung .
meanwhile , franz said the financial market crisis is not yet over , adding that interest-rate increases for mortgages , which are now coming into effect , will " create problems for some debtors , increasing the likelihood of defaults at banks and also here in germany . "
investors eye us for recession signals hypo real estate 's announcement on tuesday came in the wake of more grim news out of the us financial sector ; america 's biggest bank , citigroup , reported that it suffered a record $ 9.83 billion fourth-quarter loss .
meanwhile , concerns that a possible us recession will deepen the slowdown in europe 's largest economy pushed down a key german investor-confidence index .
a study by the zew center for european economic research published on tuesday showed investor confidence in germany fell to its lowest point in 15 years .
investor confidence was at minus 41.6 , from minus 37.2 a month earlier - the eighth straight decline .
it was a greater drop than analysts had expected . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hope for better days even as investor confidence slumped in germany in january goldman sachs and merrill lynch have forecast that the us will slip into recession this year for the first time since 2001 , as the housing slump , which has driven up credit costs globally , curbs consumer spending .
that may hurt european exporters already grappling with oil prices around $ 100 a barrel and an appreciating euro .

little surprise , then , that a key investment-confidence indicator has plunged . peter bofinger and wolfgang franz , two of the five so-called " wise men " who act as economic advisers to the german government , said the peak of the financial market crisis has not yet been reached . " i expect the peak of the financial crisis to be reached at mid-year , " bofinger told the berliner zeitung newspaper .
bofinger said he was n't surprised by an overall sell-off on the dax on tuesday , jan .
15 , after german real-estate investment firm hypo real estate plunged a dizzying 35 percent - the steepest one-day price drop the dax has seen to date .
the fall came after the company announced it was writing off 390 million euros -lrb- $ 580 million -rrb- on us subprime debt losses .
shares had made back some gains in early wednesday trading .
effects of us real-estate pressure investors were taken by surprise by the write-off , because hypo real estate 's management had repeatedly said that the firm would be unscathed by the credit crunch , which has swept world markets .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hypo real estate took one of the biggest falls in dax history " the interest rate adjustments for buyers of us real estate are now coming into effect , and that is steadily increasing pressure on real estate markets , " bofinger told the berliner zeitung .
meanwhile , franz said the financial market crisis is not yet over , adding that interest-rate increases for mortgages , which are now coming into effect , will " create problems for some debtors , increasing the likelihood of defaults at banks and also here in germany . "
investors eye us for recession signals hypo real estate 's announcement on tuesday came in the wake of more grim news out of the us financial sector ; america 's biggest bank , citigroup , reported that it suffered a record $ 9.83 billion fourth-quarter loss .
meanwhile , concerns that a possible us recession will deepen the slowdown in europe 's largest economy pushed down a key german investor-confidence index .
a study by the zew center for european economic research published on tuesday showed investor confidence in germany fell to its lowest point in 15 years .
investor confidence was at minus 41.6 , from minus 37.2 a month earlier - the eighth straight decline .
it was a greater drop than analysts had expected . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hope for better days even as investor confidence slumped in germany in january goldman sachs and merrill lynch have forecast that the us will slip into recession this year for the first time since 2001 , as the housing slump , which has driven up credit costs globally , curbs consumer spending .
that may hurt european exporters already grappling with oil prices around $ 100 a barrel and an appreciating euro .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de television -pipe- 16.01.2008 broadcast gap protects german tv from us writers ' strike großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german tv viewers are n't faced with incessant re-runs - at least for the moment german tv stations are counting on the gap between the us broadcast and the airing of the dubbed versions of american shows to protect them from a scriptwriters ' strike that has plastered us screens with re-runs . to sandra kern , the idea of having being stuck with re-runs rather than new episodes the us-hit series " lost " is very upsetting . " right now , i keep monday nights free of other commitments , " the 32-year old said from her home in cologne .
" if there were only re-runs i 'd probably do something besides watch tv , because i would n't want to have to watch something else . " but kern and other german viewers are unlikely to be faced with re-runs of " lost " as the prosieben channel still has 15 of season three 's 22 episodes and can fall back on the eight episodes of season four that were already produced before the us writers ' strike began on nov .
5 . " the gap between the broadcast dates has kept us from feeling any real effects of the strike , " prosieben spokeswoman katja pichler said . germans hoping for an agreement - soon bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the writers ' strike turned the golden globes into little more than a press conference but the gap is n't as large for other series .
the fourth , and newest , season of " grey 's anatomy , " also shown on prosieben , is set to start in germany in february .
while the 11 shows produced before the strike began are waiting to be broadcast in germany , pichler said the channel has not decided what it will do if no new episodes arrive from the us . " we are hoping the strike will end , and that we do n't have to change our schedule , " she said , adding that prosieben needs six months to dub an episode of an american series into german . rtl , another major commercial german tv station , also said it has not yet determined how it will react if it runs out of " csi , " " house m.d. " or " law and order " episodes , according to spokesman claus richter . " we do n't have to be worried until autumn 2008 , " richter said .
" half the episodes for rtl 's series are ready and will be aired .
after that , we 'll have to decide if we show re-runs or something completely different . " sticking with us staples bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : complex dialog in fox 's house m.d. makes it difficult to dub , richter said but neither prosieben nor rtl , which regularly compete for the best ratings in the lucrative 14-49 age group , said they are planning to make any long-term changes to their programming based on the strike , and that they would continue buying and broadcasting us series . " we are happy with the strength of our us series and think viewers will come back when there are new episodes , " pichler said . prosieben and rtl are the two german broadcasters that rely most on us programming . according to a 2006 program analysis , 78 percent of prosieben 's and 47 percent of rtl 's fictional programming came from the united states . a matter of taste germany 's publicly funded stations rely less on us productions , with the top two , ard and zdf , buying 21 percent and 22 percent of their fiction programming from the us .
the two channels have also successfully invested in british , scandinavian and french mystery series , according to wolfgang seufert , a professor at the university of jena . " in all , there is a clear preference for german series , followed by us productions and then series from other countries , " he said , adding that a few us series beat out local productions to earn top ratings in germany . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : kern said german series do n't hold her interest as well as american ones but kern said german series just do n't hold her attention . " when i watch a german mystery i know who the murderer is in the first 10 minutes and change the channel , " kern said .
" but i get sucked into the us shows and have to see what 's going to happen next . " viewers will wait it out that 's good news for german broadcasters , since home-grown productions cost more than purchasing and dubbing foreign series , seufert said , he added that broadcasters can relax in knowing that viewers will be back whenever new episodes are ready to air . " overall tv use is relatively independent of what 's being shown , " he said , adding that the average german household has a choice of 30 channels .
" when people 's favorite show is n't on , they 'll watch something else and then switch back when their favorite show is back . " possible benefits for german writers bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german scriptwriters took to berlin 's streets to show solidarity with their us counterparts viewers who are willing to sit through repeats or watch another program lower the chances that the writers guild of america strike - especially if it ends soon - will help german writers sell more scripts , according to katharina uppenbrink , head of the german scriptwriters ' association . " if the strike ends soon , i do n't expect much of a change in stations ' policies , " she said . but if the us writers ' demands are met , it could help germans ' negotiating position when marketing their work , uppenbrink said . though differences in german and us labor structure make a direct comparisons difficult , the average pay for all the rights to an episode of a german series , which can take between weeks and months to complete depending on the author , is between 23,000 euros and 24,000 euros -lrb- $ 34,200 and $ 35,700 -rrb- , she said .
over a five-year period , us writers earn an average annual income of $ 62,000 , according to the writers guild of america . " we 're really watching what happens in the us because it would serve as a guide for germans and europeans , " she said .

little surprise , then , that a key investment-confidence indicator has plunged . peter bofinger and wolfgang franz , two of the five so-called " wise men " who act as economic advisers to the german government , said the peak of the financial market crisis has not yet been reached . " i expect the peak of the financial crisis to be reached at mid-year , " bofinger told the berliner zeitung newspaper .
bofinger said he was n't surprised by an overall sell-off on the dax on tuesday , jan .

the fall came after the company announced it was writing off 390 million euros -lrb- $ 580 million -rrb- on us subprime debt losses .
shares had made back some gains in early wednesday trading .
effects of us real-estate pressure investors were taken by surprise by the write-off , because hypo real estate 's management had repeatedly said that the firm would be unscathed by the credit crunch , which has swept world markets .

investors eye us for recession signals hypo real estate 's announcement on tuesday came in the wake of more grim news out of the us financial sector ; america 's biggest bank , citigroup , reported that it suffered a record $ 9.83 billion fourth-quarter loss .
meanwhile , concerns that a possible us recession will deepen the slowdown in europe 's largest economy pushed down a key german investor-confidence index .
a study by the zew center for european economic research published on tuesday showed investor confidence in germany fell to its lowest point in 15 years .

it was a greater drop than analysts had expected . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hope for better days even as investor confidence slumped in germany in january goldman sachs and merrill lynch have forecast that the us will slip into recession this year for the first time since 2001 , as the housing slump , which has driven up credit costs globally , curbs consumer spending .
that may hurt european exporters already grappling with oil prices around $ 100 a barrel and an appreciating euro .
german growth is slowing " the bad news flow from the us banking sector has n't abated , " alexander koch , an economist at unicredit markets and investments in munich , told bloomberg news service .
" there are real concerns about a us recession dragging down german economic growth . "
german economic growth slowed to 2.5 percent last year from 2.9 percent in 2006 , which was the fastest expansion since the turn of the decade , the federal statistics office said on wednesday .
the bundesbank predicts growth of just 1.9 percent this year . dw staff -lrb- als / jen -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" right now , i keep monday nights free of other commitments , " the 32-year old said from her home in cologne .
" if there were only re-runs i 'd probably do something besides watch tv , because i would n't want to have to watch something else . " but kern and other german viewers are unlikely to be faced with re-runs of " lost " as the prosieben channel still has 15 of season three 's 22 episodes and can fall back on the eight episodes of season four that were already produced before the us writers ' strike began on nov .
5 . " the gap between the broadcast dates has kept us from feeling any real effects of the strike , " prosieben spokeswoman katja pichler said . germans hoping for an agreement - soon bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the writers ' strike turned the golden globes into little more than a press conference but the gap is n't as large for other series .
the fourth , and newest , season of " grey 's anatomy , " also shown on prosieben , is set to start in germany in february .
while the 11 shows produced before the strike began are waiting to be broadcast in germany , pichler said the channel has not decided what it will do if no new episodes arrive from the us . " we are hoping the strike will end , and that we do n't have to change our schedule , " she said , adding that prosieben needs six months to dub an episode of an american series into german . rtl , another major commercial german tv station , also said it has not yet determined how it will react if it runs out of " csi , " " house m.d.

the two channels have also successfully invested in british , scandinavian and french mystery series , according to wolfgang seufert , a professor at the university of jena . " in all , there is a clear preference for german series , followed by us productions and then series from other countries , " he said , adding that a few us series beat out local productions to earn top ratings in germany . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : kern said german series do n't hold her interest as well as american ones but kern said german series just do n't hold her attention .

" but i get sucked into the us shows and have to see what 's going to happen next . " viewers will wait it out that 's good news for german broadcasters , since home-grown productions cost more than purchasing and dubbing foreign series , seufert said , he added that broadcasters can relax in knowing that viewers will be back whenever new episodes are ready to air . " overall tv use is relatively independent of what 's being shown , " he said , adding that the average german household has a choice of 30 channels .

but if germany fails , a nuclear renaissance may result , says dw 's jens thurau . german environment minister sigmar gabriel had his chance to shine in december at the bali climate conference .
no country , the energetic social democratic politician says , is similarly engaged in protecting the climate as germany . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : by 2020 the country will reduce its emissions of greenhouse gasses by 40 percent by producing more energy from renewable sources , by saving energy , by investing billions in building renovations , by using energy from clean coal and gas power stations .
and without using nuclear power .
by 2021 all 17 of germany 's nuclear power plants - one after another - will be shut down . when compared to other industrialized nations , that decision makes germany more and more of an outsider .
a new nuclear power plant is being built in finland .
france , the united states and japan also have plans for new nuclear power stations .
great britain recently decided to put more of an emphasis on nuclear power .
these governments argue that the international community 's goals , which climate change researchers still call insufficient , to reduce greenhouse gas emissions can only be met with co2-free nuclear power . still , there are good reasons for german to turn its back on nuclear power .
some 440 nuclear power stations in 31 countries create about 16 percent of electricity worldwide .
more than 1,000 new nuclear power stations would have to be built to order to reduce the greenhouse effect with nuclear power - that 's not foreseeable . but even more importantly , investment in new nuclear power stations is expensive , though the necessary raw material - uranium - is cheap .
the expense means that nuclear power plants require long operating times to be profitable for investors , which sets the means of decades-worth of energy production in stone and hinders investment in non-fossil energy production . but if what climate researchers are saying is true , then there need to be recognizable reductions in greenhouse gasses by 2020 in order to save the climate .
this is exactly where many countries see a role for nuclear energy : as a transition to a solar age offering co2-free energy production in the next 20 to 50 years . germany has , at least for the moment , taken an uncompromising path : for lots of environmental technology and against nuclear power . the next few years will be decisive .
if germany proves that both an engaged climate policy and phasing out nuclear power are not mutually exclusive , then other countries will follow .
if germany fails , there will be an increasing nuclear energy , at least in industrialized nations , india , china and brazil .
in the world 's poorer countries , particularly in africa , nuclear power is still too expensive anyway . jens thurau is a dw-tv correspondent and environment expert -lrb- sms -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?
dw-world.de green energy booming , but experts warn of cloudy future renewable energy made up more than 14 percent of germany 's electricity consumption in 2007 , but further progress may be hindered if government support is cut back , according to new statistics .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de health -pipe- 16.01.2008 eu raids drug firms in industry-competition probe großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : color me skeptical : eu regulators thought it best to arrive unannounced the eu raided pharmaceutical companies across europe , amid concerns over uncompetitive behavior in the industry .
regulators worry the big drug makers are acting to keep generics off the market , among other issues . the dawn raids and sector inquiry , which the eu commission said was not based on specific suspected violations , could lead to cartel charges against companies and potentially huge fines .
patents are the life blood of the pharmaceutical industry but critics allege some companies misuse patent rights to delay the introduction of generic medicines in unjustified ways .
the cost of medicines is a hot-button issue in europe , where governments are seeking to trim health care costs at the same time as encouraging the development of the pharmaceutical and biotechnology sectors .
three of europe 's biggest drug makers - astrazeneca , glaxosmithkline and sanofi-aventis - acknowledged they had been approached by eu regulators as part of the antitrust probe .
us-based pfizer , the world 's top drug maker , also confirmed it was being investigated .
looking for " something rotten " regulators said they suspect the firms involved may be protecting their own market shares at the expense of introducing better drugs .
" a sector inquiry is something we engage in if we have the feeling that the sector is not working optimally ... "

bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : eu commissioner kroes takes on a hot-button issue european citizens spend some 200 billion euros -lrb- $ 297 billion -rrb- a year on pharmaceutical products - the equivalent of 400 euros for every man , woman and child in the eu , kroes said .
unexplained drop in product launches but over the last decade , the number of new components launched on the market has fallen from an average of 40 per year between 1995 and 1999 , to just 28 per year between 2000 and 2004 .
" if innovative products are n't being produced , and cheaper generic alternatives are being delayed , we need to find out why , " kroes said .
the raids were carried out in a number of eu states with the help of local authorities , and targeted both firms based in europe and those based outside the continent who are active in its market .
kroes would not comment on which specific countries and companies were involved .
major concerns confirm probe however , astrazeneca said in a statement on wednesday : " we confirm that we are part of a sector inquiry instituted by the european commission on jan .
15 , 2008 into aspects of the pharmaceutical industry . "
the company added it was fully cooperating with the probe .
" the inquiry relates to the introduction of innovative and generic medicines for human consumption onto the market and covers commercial practices , including the use of patents , " the statement added .
" we understand that several companies have been similarly approached in connection with the inquiry . "
a spokesman for glaxosmithkline said the british group had also been visited by eu regulators as part of the investigation .
" we have been contacted by them , " the gsk spokesman said .
" i can not say the date or which site or where but we can confirm we have been visited by them . "
patent disputes at heart of issue the inquiry will pay particular attention to deals between drugs firms , such as settlements in patent disputes , and to the question of whether some companies could have abused their patent and legal rights to keep rivals out of the market .

the primary aim of the inquiry is to gather and analyze information on the operation of the pharmaceuticals market .
however , if it brings to light evidence of specific wrong-doing , such cases will be dealt with as they arise , she said .
the commission is tasked with ensuring that eu states and companies obey eu laws , including those on competition .
in the last year alone , it imposed fines of over 3 billion euros -lrb- $ 4.5 billion -rrb- on firms which had broken competition law .
unlike in those cartel cases , the raids on the drugs sector were not prompted by specific indications of illegal activity , but by a more general sense that the eu market is not working , kroes stressed .
" the inquiry is not investigating specific companies and is not based on specific evidence , " she said .
however , it would focus on " a couple of issues where we are not feeling safe that it is pro-competitive , " she added .
astrazeneca previously faced fines but during a news conference , kroes cited astrazeneca as a clear example of a company in which competition was not functioning optimally , referring to a 2005 decision in which the commission fined the company 60 million euros .

but some in say the move may endanger lives in germany . the deployment of 250 combat troops , who would join in the search for and fight against terrorists , would mark a departure from the bundeswehr 's current mission .
to date only stabilization forces have been deployed to the main german base at masar-i-sharif . the social democratic party 's defense spokesman , rainer arnold , told the passauer neue presse on wednesday , jan .
16 , that the german army had begun making preparations for the deployment . " this task falls to germany in the summer , " he said , adding that the mission , slated to start in july , signaled a " new quality " in the german engagement in afghanistan .

" if other countries are no longer available to do this task after september , then we will do it ourselves , " the head of the german federal armed forces association , bernhard gertz , told the mitteldeutsche zeitung .
" it 's in the interest of our own soldiers . " in a separate interview with the daily der tagesspiegel , gertz added : " it is clear that we will take over this task . " government spokesman ulrich wilhelm , however , said that the nato decision on which country takes over the quick response force is not expected to be made before the end of january . the defense ministry in berlin also confirmed that planning was underway and said that the deployment fell under the mandate for german forces in afghanistan renewed by parliament last year . mission covered by mandate ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany also has reconnaissance jets stationed in afghanistan but the ministry denied that the deployment would add a " new quality " to the bundeswehr 's mission in afghanistan . spokesman thomas raab said the army 's current mission already included " infantry-like components , " and that it was already possible for germans to escort convoys and help other nations ' troops or nationals . but some in germany have questioned whether the new deployment makes sense for the bundeswehr .

" you have to assume that these situations will arise , " he told the mitteldeutsche zeitung .
" and you can not expect from the outset that it will all occur without any victims . " pacifist organizations have said they intend to protest the bundeswehr 's plans . in october , the bundestag renewed the mandate for 3,500 german troops in afghanistan , combining two previous mandates .
up to 3,000 troops , part of nato 's forces in the country , are deployed in a training , reconstruction and security mission in afghanistan 's relatively peaceful north . dw staff -lrb- sms -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

leading social democrats are calling for sport to become a constitutional objective in germany .
some applaud the idea , but legal experts say it 's not the way to beef up federal funding for sports . after meeting with members of the german football association -lrb- dfb -rrb- and organizers for the women 's soccer world championship , manfred schaub , a member of the social democrats ' executive , said having sport as a constitutional objective would help resolve urban space issues , and make sure sport did n't always suffer when state coffers were empty . spd head kurt beck added that he recognized the contribution of the dfb in combating racism and integrating young immigrants . however , in an interview with the taz newspaper earlier in january , former constitutional court judge udo steiner advised against the move to make sport a national objective on the grounds that such objectives only required the government to act , but did n't specify in what way . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : clubs hope inclusion in the constitution will mean more financial support " as a general rule , there is always going to be controversy about what measures are appropriate , " steiner told the taz .
" if sport becomes a national objective , it probably would n't receive one single euro more .
political priorities determine how government money is distributed , and that is how it should be . " but the general director of the german olympic committee , michael vesper , said late last year that he welcomed the social democrats ' support for the initiative . " it is good news for sport , especially for the 7.5 million volunteers involved , " he said in a statement . a private matter ? nearly 30 percent of germany 's population is a member in a sports association . " there are more than 90,000 sports clubs and they help to keep our communities together , " vesper said .
" the inclusion of sport as national objective … can back community-spirited sports and give greater power to promote its aims . " however , speaking at a government hearing on the subject in 2007 , friedhelm hufen , a constitutional expert at the university of mainz , emphasized that the purpose of the constitution was not to recognize the efforts of volunteers and organizations . objectives currently in the german constitution include democracy , rule of law , environmental protection and animal protection , which , in 2002 , was the most recent addition .
a recent proposal also called for special protection of children in the constitution . most states support sport bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : sport is part of nearly all state constitutions fifteen of germany 's 16 states have already added sport to their list of objectives in their state constitutions .
under the federal constitution , the german government is responsible for supporting top-level sports . the social democrats have said before they wanted culture to be included as a new constitutional objective , along with sport .
the initiative also has the support of the left party and the free-market liberal free democrats , who originally called for the constitutional changes back in 2006 . as constitutional amendments require a two-thirds majority , they need the backing of chancellor angela merkel 's christian democrats .
however , the party made it clear in december 2007 that it would n't support any constitution changes within the current legislature period , which runs to may 2009 . dw staff -lrb- kh -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

16 , that the finnish company was a " locust which got money in germany and then said without warning ' we are going to romania ' to maybe get more public funds there . " he also said he would attempt to recover the 60 million euros -lrb- $ 89 million -rrb- in subsidies the state had paid the company .
nokia also received about 28 million euros from the federal government . " we are not simply going to accept this - this is not yet the end of the debate , " he added . german politicians have accused international companies of behaving like " locusts " to describe what they deem an excessive greed for profits . but getting any payments from nokia is likely to prove difficult .
north rhine-westphalia 's finance minister , christa thoben , said a deal holding the company to bochum , where it employed some 2,000 people , in exchange for subsidies ran out before nokia announced its plans to leave . subsidies lure hi-tech companies bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germans are calling on the eu to show nokia received no money from the bloc to relocate " you ca n't help but notice that the required period of retention ran out in september 2006 and half a year later nokia makes the decision to build a new plant romania , " she said . but german deputy economy minister hartmut schauerte told reporters berlin would request that the eu look into charges that nokia is profiting from european union subsidies in its decision to move production from germany to hungry and romania . " we are going to check with the european commission if the relocation of this site is being supported financially by european structural funds , " he said . " that must not be the case . " schauerte added germany was prepared for " intense talks " with nokia to try to strike a deal to keep the bochum plant open . hungarian support for move bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : sundbäck announced the bochum plant 's closure on tuesday nokia board member veli sundbäck said the company did not cash in on any eu subsidies in moving production to romania and hungry , both of which are eu members .
he added that the company , like any other , did register for financial support from the hungarian government .
hungary pays for up to 50 percent of costs for hi-tech companies that settle there . since 2005 , when the eu was accused of paying for aeg to move production within the eu from germany to poland , the bloc has issued guidelines that prohibit the subsidization of manufacturing shifts among member states . eu commission president jose manuel barroso said wednesday that there was little to criticize in nokia 's decision to move production to other eu member states . " if a shift from finland to germany is possible , then a shift from germany to romania also has to be possible , " he said . nokia the last to leave bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : nokia employees demonstrated to protest the plant 's closure the decision to close the bochum plant by the middle of the year makes nokia the last cell phone manufacturer to leave germany .
since 2006 , some 6,000 jobs at cell phone plants have been cut in germany as benq , once part of siemens , and motorola stopped german production . sundbäck said nokia could not convince supplier to setup shop near bochum and that the factory was not " internationally competitive . " " we are following nokia 's global strategy , which focuses on cost-effectiveness and logistics flexibility , " he said . german labor leaders , however , saying the factory was in the black . " the location is running really well , profits are being made here , " said ulrike kleinebrahm , the head of bochum 's ig-metall union , adding that the plant 's closure was a " catastrophe for bochum . " politicians and union leaders also said germany 's high labor costs , another reason cited by nokia for closing the plant , make up only 5 percent of production expenses , but salary costs in romania are a 10th of what companies pay in germany . nokia booked record results in the third quarter of 2007 .
its revenues climbed 28 percent to 12.9 billion euros compared to the same time the year before .
cell phone business is responsible for about 25 percent of the finnish company 's 1.56 billion euros in profits . dw staff -lrb- sms -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" we are not simply going to accept this - this is not yet the end of the debate , " he added . german politicians have accused international companies of behaving like " locusts " to describe what they deem an excessive greed for profits . but getting any payments from nokia is likely to prove difficult .
north rhine-westphalia 's finance minister , christa thoben , said a deal holding the company to bochum , where it employed some 2,000 people , in exchange for subsidies ran out before nokia announced its plans to leave . subsidies lure hi-tech companies bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germans are calling on the eu to show nokia received no money from the bloc to relocate " you ca n't help but notice that the required period of retention ran out in september 2006 and half a year later nokia makes the decision to build a new plant romania , " she said . but german deputy economy minister hartmut schauerte told reporters berlin would request that the eu look into charges that nokia is profiting from european union subsidies in its decision to move production from germany to hungry and romania . " we are going to check with the european commission if the relocation of this site is being supported financially by european structural funds , " he said . " that must not be the case . " schauerte added germany was prepared for " intense talks " with nokia to try to strike a deal to keep the bochum plant open . hungarian support for move bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : sundbäck announced the bochum plant 's closure on tuesday nokia board member veli sundbäck said the company did not cash in on any eu subsidies in moving production to romania and hungry , both of which are eu members .
he added that the company , like any other , did register for financial support from the hungarian government .
hungary pays for up to 50 percent of costs for hi-tech companies that settle there . since 2005 , when the eu was accused of paying for aeg to move production within the eu from germany to poland , the bloc has issued guidelines that prohibit the subsidization of manufacturing shifts among member states . eu commission president jose manuel barroso said wednesday that there was little to criticize in nokia 's decision to move production to other eu member states . " if a shift from finland to germany is possible , then a shift from germany to romania also has to be possible , " he said . nokia the last to leave bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : nokia employees demonstrated to protest the plant 's closure the decision to close the bochum plant by the middle of the year makes nokia the last cell phone manufacturer to leave germany .
since 2006 , some 6,000 jobs at cell phone plants have been cut in germany as benq , once part of siemens , and motorola stopped german production . sundbäck said nokia could not convince supplier to setup shop near bochum and that the factory was not " internationally competitive . " " we are following nokia 's global strategy , which focuses on cost-effectiveness and logistics flexibility , " he said . german labor leaders , however , saying the factory was in the black . " the location is running really well , profits are being made here , " said ulrike kleinebrahm , the head of bochum 's ig-metall union , adding that the plant 's closure was a " catastrophe for bochum . " politicians and union leaders also said germany 's high labor costs , another reason cited by nokia for closing the plant , make up only 5 percent of production expenses , but salary costs in romania are a 10th of what companies pay in germany . nokia booked record results in the third quarter of 2007 .
its revenues climbed 28 percent to 12.9 billion euros compared to the same time the year before .
cell phone business is responsible for about 25 percent of the finnish company 's 1.56 billion euros in profits . dw staff -lrb- sms -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

17 , came after street protests by anti-clerical students and professors on tuesday afternoon . it is the first cancellation of an appearance by the pontiff in the face of hostility since his election in april 2005 . " following the well-known events of these days ... it was considered appropriate to cancel the event , " the vatican said in a statement . benedict , who had been scheduled to deliver a speech at the start of la sapienza 's academic year , would still send his text to the university , the statement said . escalating dissent while tensions around the pontiff 's visit had escalated throughout the day with some 100 students staging a sit-in at la sapienza 's main hall , the vatican 's evening announcement came as a surprise . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : pope benedict xvi is no stranger to controversy earlier on tuesday afternoon , giovanni maria vian , the editor of the vatican 's mouthpiece newspaper l 'osservatore romano , lamented the controversy stirred by the pontiff 's planned visit , but predicted it would go ahead . and university rector renato guarini said that while opponents of the visit would be allowed to hold a demonstration on campus on thursday , the pontiff 's invitation was still valid . " the pope is a man of culture and great thinker " who should be allowed to have his say , guarini said in an interview with private news television news channel skytg24 . academics oppose pope 's stance the opposition to the planned visit began when a group of 67 academics signed a letter requesting that guarini withdraw the invitation to the pope . in the letter , the academics said they opposed the pontiff 's " incongruous " visit to a secular university , and called on the university to revoke the " disconcerting invitation " to benedict , whom they accuse of being a reactionary and an opponent of free thought and research . many scientists fault the intellectual , conservative and tradition-minded pope for a series of positions he has taken that they say subordinate science and reason to faith . the faculty protest against the visit was spearheaded by a well-known physicist , marcello cini , a professor emeritus at la sapienza . pope " is playing the victim " on learning of the cancellation , cini told afp news service , " i 'm satisfied , that 's what i was asking for .
i thought , and i continue to think , that this visit was ambiguous and an attack on the independence of culture and the university . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some protesters wore benedict masks he added : " by cancelling , he is playing the victim , which is very intelligent .
it will be a pretext for accusing us of refusing dialogue . " in their letter , the academics cited a 1990 speech made by benedict when he was still a cardinal , in which he allegedly justified the catholic church 's actions against galileo , the 17th-century physicist who ran afoul of church doctrine by insisting that the earth orbits the sun . during the 1990 speech delivered in parma , italy , the then-cardinal joseph ratzinger had quoted austrian-born philosopher paul feyerabend as saying that the church 's 1633 heresy trial against galileo had been " reasonable and fair .

16 , that the finnish company was a " locust which got money in germany and then said without warning ' we are going to romania ' to maybe get more public funds there . " he also said he would attempt to recover the 60 million euros -lrb- $ 89 million -rrb- in subsidies the state had paid the company .
nokia also received about 28 million euros from the federal government . " we are not simply going to accept this - this is not yet the end of the debate , " he added . german politicians have accused international companies of behaving like " locusts " to describe what they deem an excessive greed for profits . but getting any payments from nokia is likely to prove difficult .
north rhine-westphalia 's finance minister , christa thoben , said a deal holding the company to bochum , where it employed some 2,000 people , in exchange for subsidies ran out before nokia announced its plans to leave . subsidies lure hi-tech companies bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germans are calling on the eu to show nokia received no money from the bloc to relocate " you ca n't help but notice that the required period of retention ran out in september 2006 and half a year later nokia makes the decision to build a new plant romania , " she said . but german deputy economy minister hartmut schauerte told reporters berlin would request that the eu look into charges that nokia is profiting from european union subsidies in its decision to move production from germany to hungry and romania . " we are going to check with the european commission if the relocation of this site is being supported financially by european structural funds , " he said . " that must not be the case . " schauerte added germany was prepared for " intense talks " with nokia to try to strike a deal to keep the bochum plant open . hungarian support for move bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : sundbäck announced the bochum plant 's closure on tuesday nokia board member veli sundbäck said the company did not cash in on any eu subsidies in moving production to romania and hungry , both of which are eu members .
he added that the company , like any other , did register for financial support from the hungarian government .
hungary pays for up to 50 percent of costs for hi-tech companies that settle there . since 2005 , when the eu was accused of paying for aeg to move production within the eu from germany to poland , the bloc has issued guidelines that prohibit the subsidization of manufacturing shifts among member states . eu commission president jose manuel barroso said wednesday that there was little to criticize in nokia 's decision to move production to other eu member states . " if a shift from finland to germany is possible , then a shift from germany to romania also has to be possible , " he said . nokia the last to leave bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : nokia employees demonstrated to protest the plant 's closure the decision to close the bochum plant by the middle of the year makes nokia the last cell phone manufacturer to leave germany .
since 2006 , some 6,000 jobs at cell phone plants have been cut in germany as benq , once part of siemens , and motorola stopped german production . sundbäck said nokia could not convince supplier to setup shop near bochum and that the factory was not " internationally competitive . " " we are following nokia 's global strategy , which focuses on cost-effectiveness and logistics flexibility , " he said . german labor leaders , however , saying the factory was in the black . " the location is running really well , profits are being made here , " said ulrike kleinebrahm , the head of bochum 's ig-metall union , adding that the plant 's closure was a " catastrophe for bochum . " politicians and union leaders also said germany 's high labor costs , another reason cited by nokia for closing the plant , make up only 5 percent of production expenses , but salary costs in romania are a 10th of what companies pay in germany . nokia booked record results in the third quarter of 2007 .
its revenues climbed 28 percent to 12.9 billion euros compared to the same time the year before .
cell phone business is responsible for about 25 percent of the finnish company 's 1.56 billion euros in profits . dw staff -lrb- sms -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

regulators worry the big drug makers are acting to keep generics off the market , among other issues . the dawn raids and sector inquiry , which the eu commission said was not based on specific suspected violations , could lead to cartel charges against companies and potentially huge fines .
patents are the life blood of the pharmaceutical industry but critics allege some companies misuse patent rights to delay the introduction of generic medicines in unjustified ways .
the cost of medicines is a hot-button issue in europe , where governments are seeking to trim health care costs at the same time as encouraging the development of the pharmaceutical and biotechnology sectors .
three of europe 's biggest drug makers - astrazeneca , glaxosmithkline and sanofi-aventis - acknowledged they had been approached by eu regulators as part of the antitrust probe .
us-based pfizer , the world 's top drug maker , also confirmed it was being investigated .
looking for " something rotten " regulators said they suspect the firms involved may be protecting their own market shares at the expense of introducing better drugs .
" a sector inquiry is something we engage in if we have the feeling that the sector is not working optimally ... "
eu competition commissioner neelie kroes said .
" if there is a feeling that something is rotten in the state , or something could be rotten , let 's take the opportunity to find out , " she added .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : eu commissioner kroes takes on a hot-button issue european citizens spend some 200 billion euros -lrb- $ 297 billion -rrb- a year on pharmaceutical products - the equivalent of 400 euros for every man , woman and child in the eu , kroes said .
unexplained drop in product launches but over the last decade , the number of new components launched on the market has fallen from an average of 40 per year between 1995 and 1999 , to just 28 per year between 2000 and 2004 .
" if innovative products are n't being produced , and cheaper generic alternatives are being delayed , we need to find out why , " kroes said .
the raids were carried out in a number of eu states with the help of local authorities , and targeted both firms based in europe and those based outside the continent who are active in its market .
kroes would not comment on which specific countries and companies were involved .
major concerns confirm probe however , astrazeneca said in a statement on wednesday : " we confirm that we are part of a sector inquiry instituted by the european commission on jan .
15 , 2008 into aspects of the pharmaceutical industry . "
the company added it was fully cooperating with the probe .
" the inquiry relates to the introduction of innovative and generic medicines for human consumption onto the market and covers commercial practices , including the use of patents , " the statement added .
" we understand that several companies have been similarly approached in connection with the inquiry . "
a spokesman for glaxosmithkline said the british group had also been visited by eu regulators as part of the investigation .
" we have been contacted by them , " the gsk spokesman said .
" i can not say the date or which site or where but we can confirm we have been visited by them . "
patent disputes at heart of issue the inquiry will pay particular attention to deals between drugs firms , such as settlements in patent disputes , and to the question of whether some companies could have abused their patent and legal rights to keep rivals out of the market .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : pfizer also got a visit from eu regulators given that such questions deal with highly-sensitive information which " may be easily withheld , concealed or destroyed , " the use of unannounced inspections was " considered appropriate , " kroes said .
the primary aim of the inquiry is to gather and analyze information on the operation of the pharmaceuticals market .
however , if it brings to light evidence of specific wrong-doing , such cases will be dealt with as they arise , she said .
the commission is tasked with ensuring that eu states and companies obey eu laws , including those on competition .
in the last year alone , it imposed fines of over 3 billion euros -lrb- $ 4.5 billion -rrb- on firms which had broken competition law .
unlike in those cartel cases , the raids on the drugs sector were not prompted by specific indications of illegal activity , but by a more general sense that the eu market is not working , kroes stressed .
" the inquiry is not investigating specific companies and is not based on specific evidence , " she said .
however , it would focus on " a couple of issues where we are not feeling safe that it is pro-competitive , " she added .
astrazeneca previously faced fines but during a news conference , kroes cited astrazeneca as a clear example of a company in which competition was not functioning optimally , referring to a 2005 decision in which the commission fined the company 60 million euros .
the commission found that astrazeneca had misused the patent system to delay market entry of rivals to its ulcer drug losec .

regulators worry the big drug makers are acting to keep generics off the market , among other issues . the dawn raids and sector inquiry , which the eu commission said was not based on specific suspected violations , could lead to cartel charges against companies and potentially huge fines .
patents are the life blood of the pharmaceutical industry but critics allege some companies misuse patent rights to delay the introduction of generic medicines in unjustified ways .
the cost of medicines is a hot-button issue in europe , where governments are seeking to trim health care costs at the same time as encouraging the development of the pharmaceutical and biotechnology sectors .
three of europe 's biggest drug makers - astrazeneca , glaxosmithkline and sanofi-aventis - acknowledged they had been approached by eu regulators as part of the antitrust probe .
us-based pfizer , the world 's top drug maker , also confirmed it was being investigated .
looking for " something rotten " regulators said they suspect the firms involved may be protecting their own market shares at the expense of introducing better drugs .
" a sector inquiry is something we engage in if we have the feeling that the sector is not working optimally ... "
eu competition commissioner neelie kroes said .
" if there is a feeling that something is rotten in the state , or something could be rotten , let 's take the opportunity to find out , " she added .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : eu commissioner kroes takes on a hot-button issue european citizens spend some 200 billion euros -lrb- $ 297 billion -rrb- a year on pharmaceutical products - the equivalent of 400 euros for every man , woman and child in the eu , kroes said .
unexplained drop in product launches but over the last decade , the number of new components launched on the market has fallen from an average of 40 per year between 1995 and 1999 , to just 28 per year between 2000 and 2004 .
" if innovative products are n't being produced , and cheaper generic alternatives are being delayed , we need to find out why , " kroes said .
the raids were carried out in a number of eu states with the help of local authorities , and targeted both firms based in europe and those based outside the continent who are active in its market .
kroes would not comment on which specific countries and companies were involved .
major concerns confirm probe however , astrazeneca said in a statement on wednesday : " we confirm that we are part of a sector inquiry instituted by the european commission on jan .
15 , 2008 into aspects of the pharmaceutical industry . "
the company added it was fully cooperating with the probe .
" the inquiry relates to the introduction of innovative and generic medicines for human consumption onto the market and covers commercial practices , including the use of patents , " the statement added .
" we understand that several companies have been similarly approached in connection with the inquiry . "
a spokesman for glaxosmithkline said the british group had also been visited by eu regulators as part of the investigation .
" we have been contacted by them , " the gsk spokesman said .
" i can not say the date or which site or where but we can confirm we have been visited by them . "
patent disputes at heart of issue the inquiry will pay particular attention to deals between drugs firms , such as settlements in patent disputes , and to the question of whether some companies could have abused their patent and legal rights to keep rivals out of the market .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : pfizer also got a visit from eu regulators given that such questions deal with highly-sensitive information which " may be easily withheld , concealed or destroyed , " the use of unannounced inspections was " considered appropriate , " kroes said .
the primary aim of the inquiry is to gather and analyze information on the operation of the pharmaceuticals market .
however , if it brings to light evidence of specific wrong-doing , such cases will be dealt with as they arise , she said .
the commission is tasked with ensuring that eu states and companies obey eu laws , including those on competition .
in the last year alone , it imposed fines of over 3 billion euros -lrb- $ 4.5 billion -rrb- on firms which had broken competition law .
unlike in those cartel cases , the raids on the drugs sector were not prompted by specific indications of illegal activity , but by a more general sense that the eu market is not working , kroes stressed .
" the inquiry is not investigating specific companies and is not based on specific evidence , " she said .
however , it would focus on " a couple of issues where we are not feeling safe that it is pro-competitive , " she added .
astrazeneca previously faced fines but during a news conference , kroes cited astrazeneca as a clear example of a company in which competition was not functioning optimally , referring to a 2005 decision in which the commission fined the company 60 million euros .
the commission found that astrazeneca had misused the patent system to delay market entry of rivals to its ulcer drug losec .

but some in say the move may endanger lives in germany . the deployment of 250 combat troops , who would join in the search for and fight against terrorists , would mark a departure from the bundeswehr 's current mission .
to date only stabilization forces have been deployed to the main german base at masar-i-sharif . the social democratic party 's defense spokesman , rainer arnold , told the passauer neue presse on wednesday , jan .
16 , that the german army had begun making preparations for the deployment . " this task falls to germany in the summer , " he said , adding that the mission , slated to start in july , signaled a " new quality " in the german engagement in afghanistan .
part of the new mission could include pursuing terrorists , arnold told the paper . ready to replace norwegians bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany may be called on to replace other nato troops leaving this year with 350 norwegian troops leaving afghanistan by the middle of the year and germany heading nato 's international security and assistance force -lrb- isaf -rrb- in the country 's north , it is likely that the bundeswehr will have to replace the norwegians . " if other countries are no longer available to do this task after september , then we will do it ourselves , " the head of the german federal armed forces association , bernhard gertz , told the mitteldeutsche zeitung .
" it 's in the interest of our own soldiers . " in a separate interview with the daily der tagesspiegel , gertz added : " it is clear that we will take over this task . " government spokesman ulrich wilhelm , however , said that the nato decision on which country takes over the quick response force is not expected to be made before the end of january . the defense ministry in berlin also confirmed that planning was underway and said that the deployment fell under the mandate for german forces in afghanistan renewed by parliament last year . mission covered by mandate ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany also has reconnaissance jets stationed in afghanistan but the ministry denied that the deployment would add a " new quality " to the bundeswehr 's mission in afghanistan . spokesman thomas raab said the army 's current mission already included " infantry-like components , " and that it was already possible for germans to escort convoys and help other nations ' troops or nationals . but some in germany have questioned whether the new deployment makes sense for the bundeswehr . " with the planned deployment of bundeswehr combat units , the german government is , against all better judgment , bringing terror into the country , " opposition left party leader oskar lafontaine said . new dangers bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : polls show most german oppose the bundeswehr 's deployment to afghanistan greens party defense expert winfried nachtwei told tagesschau.de that " the risk of slipping into hard situations would be unavoidable " should germany join the quick reaction force . that 's a fact gertz said germany would have to get used to since the soldiers would be called on to fight if their comrades or the people they are protecting are in danger . " you have to assume that these situations will arise , " he told the mitteldeutsche zeitung .
" and you can not expect from the outset that it will all occur without any victims . " pacifist organizations have said they intend to protest the bundeswehr 's plans . in october , the bundestag renewed the mandate for 3,500 german troops in afghanistan , combining two previous mandates .
up to 3,000 troops , part of nato 's forces in the country , are deployed in a training , reconstruction and security mission in afghanistan 's relatively peaceful north . dw staff -lrb- sms -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

but some in say the move may endanger lives in germany . the deployment of 250 combat troops , who would join in the search for and fight against terrorists , would mark a departure from the bundeswehr 's current mission .
to date only stabilization forces have been deployed to the main german base at masar-i-sharif . the social democratic party 's defense spokesman , rainer arnold , told the passauer neue presse on wednesday , jan .
16 , that the german army had begun making preparations for the deployment . " this task falls to germany in the summer , " he said , adding that the mission , slated to start in july , signaled a " new quality " in the german engagement in afghanistan .
part of the new mission could include pursuing terrorists , arnold told the paper . ready to replace norwegians bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany may be called on to replace other nato troops leaving this year with 350 norwegian troops leaving afghanistan by the middle of the year and germany heading nato 's international security and assistance force -lrb- isaf -rrb- in the country 's north , it is likely that the bundeswehr will have to replace the norwegians . " if other countries are no longer available to do this task after september , then we will do it ourselves , " the head of the german federal armed forces association , bernhard gertz , told the mitteldeutsche zeitung .
" it 's in the interest of our own soldiers . " in a separate interview with the daily der tagesspiegel , gertz added : " it is clear that we will take over this task . " government spokesman ulrich wilhelm , however , said that the nato decision on which country takes over the quick response force is not expected to be made before the end of january . the defense ministry in berlin also confirmed that planning was underway and said that the deployment fell under the mandate for german forces in afghanistan renewed by parliament last year . mission covered by mandate ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany also has reconnaissance jets stationed in afghanistan but the ministry denied that the deployment would add a " new quality " to the bundeswehr 's mission in afghanistan . spokesman thomas raab said the army 's current mission already included " infantry-like components , " and that it was already possible for germans to escort convoys and help other nations ' troops or nationals . but some in germany have questioned whether the new deployment makes sense for the bundeswehr . " with the planned deployment of bundeswehr combat units , the german government is , against all better judgment , bringing terror into the country , " opposition left party leader oskar lafontaine said . new dangers bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : polls show most german oppose the bundeswehr 's deployment to afghanistan greens party defense expert winfried nachtwei told tagesschau.de that " the risk of slipping into hard situations would be unavoidable " should germany join the quick reaction force . that 's a fact gertz said germany would have to get used to since the soldiers would be called on to fight if their comrades or the people they are protecting are in danger . " you have to assume that these situations will arise , " he told the mitteldeutsche zeitung .
" and you can not expect from the outset that it will all occur without any victims . " pacifist organizations have said they intend to protest the bundeswehr 's plans . in october , the bundestag renewed the mandate for 3,500 german troops in afghanistan , combining two previous mandates .
up to 3,000 troops , part of nato 's forces in the country , are deployed in a training , reconstruction and security mission in afghanistan 's relatively peaceful north . dw staff -lrb- sms -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

leading social democrats are calling for sport to become a constitutional objective in germany .
some applaud the idea , but legal experts say it 's not the way to beef up federal funding for sports . after meeting with members of the german football association -lrb- dfb -rrb- and organizers for the women 's soccer world championship , manfred schaub , a member of the social democrats ' executive , said having sport as a constitutional objective would help resolve urban space issues , and make sure sport did n't always suffer when state coffers were empty . spd head kurt beck added that he recognized the contribution of the dfb in combating racism and integrating young immigrants . however , in an interview with the taz newspaper earlier in january , former constitutional court judge udo steiner advised against the move to make sport a national objective on the grounds that such objectives only required the government to act , but did n't specify in what way . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : clubs hope inclusion in the constitution will mean more financial support " as a general rule , there is always going to be controversy about what measures are appropriate , " steiner told the taz .
" if sport becomes a national objective , it probably would n't receive one single euro more .
political priorities determine how government money is distributed , and that is how it should be . " but the general director of the german olympic committee , michael vesper , said late last year that he welcomed the social democrats ' support for the initiative . " it is good news for sport , especially for the 7.5 million volunteers involved , " he said in a statement . a private matter ? nearly 30 percent of germany 's population is a member in a sports association . " there are more than 90,000 sports clubs and they help to keep our communities together , " vesper said .
" the inclusion of sport as national objective … can back community-spirited sports and give greater power to promote its aims . " however , speaking at a government hearing on the subject in 2007 , friedhelm hufen , a constitutional expert at the university of mainz , emphasized that the purpose of the constitution was not to recognize the efforts of volunteers and organizations . objectives currently in the german constitution include democracy , rule of law , environmental protection and animal protection , which , in 2002 , was the most recent addition .

the initiative also has the support of the left party and the free-market liberal free democrats , who originally called for the constitutional changes back in 2006 . as constitutional amendments require a two-thirds majority , they need the backing of chancellor angela merkel 's christian democrats .

leading social democrats are calling for sport to become a constitutional objective in germany .
some applaud the idea , but legal experts say it 's not the way to beef up federal funding for sports . after meeting with members of the german football association -lrb- dfb -rrb- and organizers for the women 's soccer world championship , manfred schaub , a member of the social democrats ' executive , said having sport as a constitutional objective would help resolve urban space issues , and make sure sport did n't always suffer when state coffers were empty . spd head kurt beck added that he recognized the contribution of the dfb in combating racism and integrating young immigrants . however , in an interview with the taz newspaper earlier in january , former constitutional court judge udo steiner advised against the move to make sport a national objective on the grounds that such objectives only required the government to act , but did n't specify in what way . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : clubs hope inclusion in the constitution will mean more financial support " as a general rule , there is always going to be controversy about what measures are appropriate , " steiner told the taz .
" if sport becomes a national objective , it probably would n't receive one single euro more .
political priorities determine how government money is distributed , and that is how it should be . " but the general director of the german olympic committee , michael vesper , said late last year that he welcomed the social democrats ' support for the initiative . " it is good news for sport , especially for the 7.5 million volunteers involved , " he said in a statement . a private matter ? nearly 30 percent of germany 's population is a member in a sports association . " there are more than 90,000 sports clubs and they help to keep our communities together , " vesper said .
" the inclusion of sport as national objective … can back community-spirited sports and give greater power to promote its aims . " however , speaking at a government hearing on the subject in 2007 , friedhelm hufen , a constitutional expert at the university of mainz , emphasized that the purpose of the constitution was not to recognize the efforts of volunteers and organizations . objectives currently in the german constitution include democracy , rule of law , environmental protection and animal protection , which , in 2002 , was the most recent addition .
a recent proposal also called for special protection of children in the constitution . most states support sport bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : sport is part of nearly all state constitutions fifteen of germany 's 16 states have already added sport to their list of objectives in their state constitutions .
under the federal constitution , the german government is responsible for supporting top-level sports . the social democrats have said before they wanted culture to be included as a new constitutional objective , along with sport .
the initiative also has the support of the left party and the free-market liberal free democrats , who originally called for the constitutional changes back in 2006 . as constitutional amendments require a two-thirds majority , they need the backing of chancellor angela merkel 's christian democrats .
however , the party made it clear in december 2007 that it would n't support any constitution changes within the current legislature period , which runs to may 2009 . dw staff -lrb- kh -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

little surprise , then , that a key investment-confidence indicator has plunged . peter bofinger and wolfgang franz , two of the five so-called " wise men " who act as economic advisers to the german government , said the peak of the financial market crisis has not yet been reached . " i expect the peak of the financial crisis to be reached at mid-year , " bofinger told the berliner zeitung newspaper .
bofinger said he was n't surprised by an overall sell-off on the dax on tuesday , jan .
15 , after german real-estate investment firm hypo real estate plunged a dizzying 35 percent - the steepest one-day price drop the dax has seen to date .
the fall came after the company announced it was writing off 390 million euros -lrb- $ 580 million -rrb- on us subprime debt losses .
shares had made back some gains in early wednesday trading .
effects of us real-estate pressure investors were taken by surprise by the write-off , because hypo real estate 's management had repeatedly said that the firm would be unscathed by the credit crunch , which has swept world markets .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hypo real estate took one of the biggest falls in dax history " the interest rate adjustments for buyers of us real estate are now coming into effect , and that is steadily increasing pressure on real estate markets , " bofinger told the berliner zeitung .
meanwhile , franz said the financial market crisis is not yet over , adding that interest-rate increases for mortgages , which are now coming into effect , will " create problems for some debtors , increasing the likelihood of defaults at banks and also here in germany . "
investors eye us for recession signals hypo real estate 's announcement on tuesday came in the wake of more grim news out of the us financial sector ; america 's biggest bank , citigroup , reported that it suffered a record $ 9.83 billion fourth-quarter loss .
meanwhile , concerns that a possible us recession will deepen the slowdown in europe 's largest economy pushed down a key german investor-confidence index .
a study by the zew center for european economic research published on tuesday showed investor confidence in germany fell to its lowest point in 15 years .
investor confidence was at minus 41.6 , from minus 37.2 a month earlier - the eighth straight decline .
it was a greater drop than analysts had expected . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hope for better days even as investor confidence slumped in germany in january goldman sachs and merrill lynch have forecast that the us will slip into recession this year for the first time since 2001 , as the housing slump , which has driven up credit costs globally , curbs consumer spending .
that may hurt european exporters already grappling with oil prices around $ 100 a barrel and an appreciating euro .
german growth is slowing " the bad news flow from the us banking sector has n't abated , " alexander koch , an economist at unicredit markets and investments in munich , told bloomberg news service .
" there are real concerns about a us recession dragging down german economic growth . "

little surprise , then , that a key investment-confidence indicator has plunged . peter bofinger and wolfgang franz , two of the five so-called " wise men " who act as economic advisers to the german government , said the peak of the financial market crisis has not yet been reached . " i expect the peak of the financial crisis to be reached at mid-year , " bofinger told the berliner zeitung newspaper .
bofinger said he was n't surprised by an overall sell-off on the dax on tuesday , jan .
15 , after german real-estate investment firm hypo real estate plunged a dizzying 35 percent - the steepest one-day price drop the dax has seen to date .
the fall came after the company announced it was writing off 390 million euros -lrb- $ 580 million -rrb- on us subprime debt losses .
shares had made back some gains in early wednesday trading .
effects of us real-estate pressure investors were taken by surprise by the write-off , because hypo real estate 's management had repeatedly said that the firm would be unscathed by the credit crunch , which has swept world markets .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hypo real estate took one of the biggest falls in dax history " the interest rate adjustments for buyers of us real estate are now coming into effect , and that is steadily increasing pressure on real estate markets , " bofinger told the berliner zeitung .
meanwhile , franz said the financial market crisis is not yet over , adding that interest-rate increases for mortgages , which are now coming into effect , will " create problems for some debtors , increasing the likelihood of defaults at banks and also here in germany . "
investors eye us for recession signals hypo real estate 's announcement on tuesday came in the wake of more grim news out of the us financial sector ; america 's biggest bank , citigroup , reported that it suffered a record $ 9.83 billion fourth-quarter loss .
meanwhile , concerns that a possible us recession will deepen the slowdown in europe 's largest economy pushed down a key german investor-confidence index .
a study by the zew center for european economic research published on tuesday showed investor confidence in germany fell to its lowest point in 15 years .
investor confidence was at minus 41.6 , from minus 37.2 a month earlier - the eighth straight decline .
it was a greater drop than analysts had expected . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hope for better days even as investor confidence slumped in germany in january goldman sachs and merrill lynch have forecast that the us will slip into recession this year for the first time since 2001 , as the housing slump , which has driven up credit costs globally , curbs consumer spending .
that may hurt european exporters already grappling with oil prices around $ 100 a barrel and an appreciating euro .
german growth is slowing " the bad news flow from the us banking sector has n't abated , " alexander koch , an economist at unicredit markets and investments in munich , told bloomberg news service .
" there are real concerns about a us recession dragging down german economic growth . "
german economic growth slowed to 2.5 percent last year from 2.9 percent in 2006 , which was the fastest expansion since the turn of the decade , the federal statistics office said on wednesday .

but some in say the move may endanger lives in germany . the deployment of 250 combat troops , who would join in the search for and fight against terrorists , would mark a departure from the bundeswehr 's current mission .
to date only stabilization forces have been deployed to the main german base at masar-i-sharif . the social democratic party 's defense spokesman , rainer arnold , told the passauer neue presse on wednesday , jan .
16 , that the german army had begun making preparations for the deployment . " this task falls to germany in the summer , " he said , adding that the mission , slated to start in july , signaled a " new quality " in the german engagement in afghanistan .
part of the new mission could include pursuing terrorists , arnold told the paper . ready to replace norwegians bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany may be called on to replace other nato troops leaving this year with 350 norwegian troops leaving afghanistan by the middle of the year and germany heading nato 's international security and assistance force -lrb- isaf -rrb- in the country 's north , it is likely that the bundeswehr will have to replace the norwegians . " if other countries are no longer available to do this task after september , then we will do it ourselves , " the head of the german federal armed forces association , bernhard gertz , told the mitteldeutsche zeitung .
" it 's in the interest of our own soldiers . " in a separate interview with the daily der tagesspiegel , gertz added : " it is clear that we will take over this task . " government spokesman ulrich wilhelm , however , said that the nato decision on which country takes over the quick response force is not expected to be made before the end of january . the defense ministry in berlin also confirmed that planning was underway and said that the deployment fell under the mandate for german forces in afghanistan renewed by parliament last year . mission covered by mandate ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany also has reconnaissance jets stationed in afghanistan but the ministry denied that the deployment would add a " new quality " to the bundeswehr 's mission in afghanistan . spokesman thomas raab said the army 's current mission already included " infantry-like components , " and that it was already possible for germans to escort convoys and help other nations ' troops or nationals . but some in germany have questioned whether the new deployment makes sense for the bundeswehr . " with the planned deployment of bundeswehr combat units , the german government is , against all better judgment , bringing terror into the country , " opposition left party leader oskar lafontaine said . new dangers bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : polls show most german oppose the bundeswehr 's deployment to afghanistan greens party defense expert winfried nachtwei told tagesschau.de that " the risk of slipping into hard situations would be unavoidable " should germany join the quick reaction force . that 's a fact gertz said germany would have to get used to since the soldiers would be called on to fight if their comrades or the people they are protecting are in danger . " you have to assume that these situations will arise , " he told the mitteldeutsche zeitung .
" and you can not expect from the outset that it will all occur without any victims . " pacifist organizations have said they intend to protest the bundeswehr 's plans . in october , the bundestag renewed the mandate for 3,500 german troops in afghanistan , combining two previous mandates .
up to 3,000 troops , part of nato 's forces in the country , are deployed in a training , reconstruction and security mission in afghanistan 's relatively peaceful north . dw staff -lrb- sms -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

17 , came after street protests by anti-clerical students and professors on tuesday afternoon . it is the first cancellation of an appearance by the pontiff in the face of hostility since his election in april 2005 . " following the well-known events of these days ... it was considered appropriate to cancel the event , " the vatican said in a statement . benedict , who had been scheduled to deliver a speech at the start of la sapienza 's academic year , would still send his text to the university , the statement said . escalating dissent while tensions around the pontiff 's visit had escalated throughout the day with some 100 students staging a sit-in at la sapienza 's main hall , the vatican 's evening announcement came as a surprise . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : pope benedict xvi is no stranger to controversy earlier on tuesday afternoon , giovanni maria vian , the editor of the vatican 's mouthpiece newspaper l 'osservatore romano , lamented the controversy stirred by the pontiff 's planned visit , but predicted it would go ahead . and university rector renato guarini said that while opponents of the visit would be allowed to hold a demonstration on campus on thursday , the pontiff 's invitation was still valid . " the pope is a man of culture and great thinker " who should be allowed to have his say , guarini said in an interview with private news television news channel skytg24 . academics oppose pope 's stance the opposition to the planned visit began when a group of 67 academics signed a letter requesting that guarini withdraw the invitation to the pope . in the letter , the academics said they opposed the pontiff 's " incongruous " visit to a secular university , and called on the university to revoke the " disconcerting invitation " to benedict , whom they accuse of being a reactionary and an opponent of free thought and research . many scientists fault the intellectual , conservative and tradition-minded pope for a series of positions he has taken that they say subordinate science and reason to faith . the faculty protest against the visit was spearheaded by a well-known physicist , marcello cini , a professor emeritus at la sapienza . pope " is playing the victim " on learning of the cancellation , cini told afp news service , " i 'm satisfied , that 's what i was asking for .
i thought , and i continue to think , that this visit was ambiguous and an attack on the independence of culture and the university .

it will be a pretext for accusing us of refusing dialogue . " in their letter , the academics cited a 1990 speech made by benedict when he was still a cardinal , in which he allegedly justified the catholic church 's actions against galileo , the 17th-century physicist who ran afoul of church doctrine by insisting that the earth orbits the sun . during the 1990 speech delivered in parma , italy , the then-cardinal joseph ratzinger had quoted austrian-born philosopher paul feyerabend as saying that the church 's 1633 heresy trial against galileo had been " reasonable and fair . " in court , galileo was forced to recant his theories . students focus on galileo comments benedict " condemns centuries of scientific and cultural growth by affirming anachronistic dogmas such as creationism , while attacking scientific free-thought and promoting mandatory heterosexuality , " students opposed to the visit , using the name physics collective , said on their web site . the students opposed to the visit kicked off an " anti-clergy week " on monday by showing a film on galileo . on monday , vatican radio said attempts to prevent benedict from speaking at the campus amounted to censorship . catholic and conservative politicians have condemned the university 's actions as a sign of intolerance , while opinions in the country 's governing center-left have been split , with some saying the pontiff 's opponents have the right to show their dissent . dw staff -lrb- jen -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de opinion -pipe- 16.01.2008 opinion : germany follows own non-nuclear energy path großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : if germany can prove that fighting climate change does n't necessarily require nuclear power , other nations will follow .
but if germany fails , a nuclear renaissance may result , says dw 's jens thurau . german environment minister sigmar gabriel had his chance to shine in december at the bali climate conference .
no country , the energetic social democratic politician says , is similarly engaged in protecting the climate as germany . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : by 2020 the country will reduce its emissions of greenhouse gasses by 40 percent by producing more energy from renewable sources , by saving energy , by investing billions in building renovations , by using energy from clean coal and gas power stations .
and without using nuclear power .
by 2021 all 17 of germany 's nuclear power plants - one after another - will be shut down . when compared to other industrialized nations , that decision makes germany more and more of an outsider .
a new nuclear power plant is being built in finland .
france , the united states and japan also have plans for new nuclear power stations .
great britain recently decided to put more of an emphasis on nuclear power .
these governments argue that the international community 's goals , which climate change researchers still call insufficient , to reduce greenhouse gas emissions can only be met with co2-free nuclear power . still , there are good reasons for german to turn its back on nuclear power .
some 440 nuclear power stations in 31 countries create about 16 percent of electricity worldwide .
more than 1,000 new nuclear power stations would have to be built to order to reduce the greenhouse effect with nuclear power - that 's not foreseeable . but even more importantly , investment in new nuclear power stations is expensive , though the necessary raw material - uranium - is cheap .
the expense means that nuclear power plants require long operating times to be profitable for investors , which sets the means of decades-worth of energy production in stone and hinders investment in non-fossil energy production . but if what climate researchers are saying is true , then there need to be recognizable reductions in greenhouse gasses by 2020 in order to save the climate .
this is exactly where many countries see a role for nuclear energy : as a transition to a solar age offering co2-free energy production in the next 20 to 50 years . germany has , at least for the moment , taken an uncompromising path : for lots of environmental technology and against nuclear power . the next few years will be decisive .
if germany proves that both an engaged climate policy and phasing out nuclear power are not mutually exclusive , then other countries will follow .
if germany fails , there will be an increasing nuclear energy , at least in industrialized nations , india , china and brazil .
in the world 's poorer countries , particularly in africa , nuclear power is still too expensive anyway . jens thurau is a dw-tv correspondent and environment expert -lrb- sms -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

16 , that the finnish company was a " locust which got money in germany and then said without warning ' we are going to romania ' to maybe get more public funds there . " he also said he would attempt to recover the 60 million euros -lrb- $ 89 million -rrb- in subsidies the state had paid the company .
nokia also received about 28 million euros from the federal government . " we are not simply going to accept this - this is not yet the end of the debate , " he added . german politicians have accused international companies of behaving like " locusts " to describe what they deem an excessive greed for profits . but getting any payments from nokia is likely to prove difficult .
north rhine-westphalia 's finance minister , christa thoben , said a deal holding the company to bochum , where it employed some 2,000 people , in exchange for subsidies ran out before nokia announced its plans to leave . subsidies lure hi-tech companies bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germans are calling on the eu to show nokia received no money from the bloc to relocate " you ca n't help but notice that the required period of retention ran out in september 2006 and half a year later nokia makes the decision to build a new plant romania , " she said . but german deputy economy minister hartmut schauerte told reporters berlin would request that the eu look into charges that nokia is profiting from european union subsidies in its decision to move production from germany to hungry and romania . " we are going to check with the european commission if the relocation of this site is being supported financially by european structural funds , " he said . " that must not be the case . " schauerte added germany was prepared for " intense talks " with nokia to try to strike a deal to keep the bochum plant open . hungarian support for move bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : sundbäck announced the bochum plant 's closure on tuesday nokia board member veli sundbäck said the company did not cash in on any eu subsidies in moving production to romania and hungry , both of which are eu members .
he added that the company , like any other , did register for financial support from the hungarian government .
hungary pays for up to 50 percent of costs for hi-tech companies that settle there . since 2005 , when the eu was accused of paying for aeg to move production within the eu from germany to poland , the bloc has issued guidelines that prohibit the subsidization of manufacturing shifts among member states . eu commission president jose manuel barroso said wednesday that there was little to criticize in nokia 's decision to move production to other eu member states . " if a shift from finland to germany is possible , then a shift from germany to romania also has to be possible , " he said . nokia the last to leave bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : nokia employees demonstrated to protest the plant 's closure the decision to close the bochum plant by the middle of the year makes nokia the last cell phone manufacturer to leave germany .
since 2006 , some 6,000 jobs at cell phone plants have been cut in germany as benq , once part of siemens , and motorola stopped german production . sundbäck said nokia could not convince supplier to setup shop near bochum and that the factory was not " internationally competitive . " " we are following nokia 's global strategy , which focuses on cost-effectiveness and logistics flexibility , " he said . german labor leaders , however , saying the factory was in the black . " the location is running really well , profits are being made here , " said ulrike kleinebrahm , the head of bochum 's ig-metall union , adding that the plant 's closure was a " catastrophe for bochum . " politicians and union leaders also said germany 's high labor costs , another reason cited by nokia for closing the plant , make up only 5 percent of production expenses , but salary costs in romania are a 10th of what companies pay in germany . nokia booked record results in the third quarter of 2007 .
its revenues climbed 28 percent to 12.9 billion euros compared to the same time the year before .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de television -pipe- 16.01.2008 broadcast gap protects german tv from us writers ' strike großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german tv viewers are n't faced with incessant re-runs - at least for the moment german tv stations are counting on the gap between the us broadcast and the airing of the dubbed versions of american shows to protect them from a scriptwriters ' strike that has plastered us screens with re-runs . to sandra kern , the idea of having being stuck with re-runs rather than new episodes the us-hit series " lost " is very upsetting . " right now , i keep monday nights free of other commitments , " the 32-year old said from her home in cologne .
" if there were only re-runs i 'd probably do something besides watch tv , because i would n't want to have to watch something else . " but kern and other german viewers are unlikely to be faced with re-runs of " lost " as the prosieben channel still has 15 of season three 's 22 episodes and can fall back on the eight episodes of season four that were already produced before the us writers ' strike began on nov .
5 . " the gap between the broadcast dates has kept us from feeling any real effects of the strike , " prosieben spokeswoman katja pichler said . germans hoping for an agreement - soon bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the writers ' strike turned the golden globes into little more than a press conference but the gap is n't as large for other series .
the fourth , and newest , season of " grey 's anatomy , " also shown on prosieben , is set to start in germany in february .
while the 11 shows produced before the strike began are waiting to be broadcast in germany , pichler said the channel has not decided what it will do if no new episodes arrive from the us . " we are hoping the strike will end , and that we do n't have to change our schedule , " she said , adding that prosieben needs six months to dub an episode of an american series into german . rtl , another major commercial german tv station , also said it has not yet determined how it will react if it runs out of " csi , " " house m.d. " or " law and order " episodes , according to spokesman claus richter . " we do n't have to be worried until autumn 2008 , " richter said .
" half the episodes for rtl 's series are ready and will be aired .
after that , we 'll have to decide if we show re-runs or something completely different . " sticking with us staples bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : complex dialog in fox 's house m.d. makes it difficult to dub , richter said but neither prosieben nor rtl , which regularly compete for the best ratings in the lucrative 14-49 age group , said they are planning to make any long-term changes to their programming based on the strike , and that they would continue buying and broadcasting us series . " we are happy with the strength of our us series and think viewers will come back when there are new episodes , " pichler said . prosieben and rtl are the two german broadcasters that rely most on us programming . according to a 2006 program analysis , 78 percent of prosieben 's and 47 percent of rtl 's fictional programming came from the united states . a matter of taste germany 's publicly funded stations rely less on us productions , with the top two , ard and zdf , buying 21 percent and 22 percent of their fiction programming from the us .
the two channels have also successfully invested in british , scandinavian and french mystery series , according to wolfgang seufert , a professor at the university of jena . " in all , there is a clear preference for german series , followed by us productions and then series from other countries , " he said , adding that a few us series beat out local productions to earn top ratings in germany . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : kern said german series do n't hold her interest as well as american ones but kern said german series just do n't hold her attention . " when i watch a german mystery i know who the murderer is in the first 10 minutes and change the channel , " kern said .
" but i get sucked into the us shows and have to see what 's going to happen next . " viewers will wait it out that 's good news for german broadcasters , since home-grown productions cost more than purchasing and dubbing foreign series , seufert said , he added that broadcasters can relax in knowing that viewers will be back whenever new episodes are ready to air . " overall tv use is relatively independent of what 's being shown , " he said , adding that the average german household has a choice of 30 channels .
" when people 's favorite show is n't on , they 'll watch something else and then switch back when their favorite show is back . " possible benefits for german writers bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german scriptwriters took to berlin 's streets to show solidarity with their us counterparts viewers who are willing to sit through repeats or watch another program lower the chances that the writers guild of america strike - especially if it ends soon - will help german writers sell more scripts , according to katharina uppenbrink , head of the german scriptwriters ' association . " if the strike ends soon , i do n't expect much of a change in stations ' policies , " she said . but if the us writers ' demands are met , it could help germans ' negotiating position when marketing their work , uppenbrink said . though differences in german and us labor structure make a direct comparisons difficult , the average pay for all the rights to an episode of a german series , which can take between weeks and months to complete depending on the author , is between 23,000 euros and 24,000 euros -lrb- $ 34,200 and $ 35,700 -rrb- , she said .
over a five-year period , us writers earn an average annual income of $ 62,000 , according to the writers guild of america . " we 're really watching what happens in the us because it would serve as a guide for germans and europeans , " she said .

" right now , i keep monday nights free of other commitments , " the 32-year old said from her home in cologne .
" if there were only re-runs i 'd probably do something besides watch tv , because i would n't want to have to watch something else . " but kern and other german viewers are unlikely to be faced with re-runs of " lost " as the prosieben channel still has 15 of season three 's 22 episodes and can fall back on the eight episodes of season four that were already produced before the us writers ' strike began on nov .
5 . " the gap between the broadcast dates has kept us from feeling any real effects of the strike , " prosieben spokeswoman katja pichler said . germans hoping for an agreement - soon bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the writers ' strike turned the golden globes into little more than a press conference but the gap is n't as large for other series .
the fourth , and newest , season of " grey 's anatomy , " also shown on prosieben , is set to start in germany in february .
while the 11 shows produced before the strike began are waiting to be broadcast in germany , pichler said the channel has not decided what it will do if no new episodes arrive from the us . " we are hoping the strike will end , and that we do n't have to change our schedule , " she said , adding that prosieben needs six months to dub an episode of an american series into german . rtl , another major commercial german tv station , also said it has not yet determined how it will react if it runs out of " csi , " " house m.d. " or " law and order " episodes , according to spokesman claus richter . " we do n't have to be worried until autumn 2008 , " richter said .
" half the episodes for rtl 's series are ready and will be aired .
after that , we 'll have to decide if we show re-runs or something completely different .

leading social democrats are calling for sport to become a constitutional objective in germany .
some applaud the idea , but legal experts say it 's not the way to beef up federal funding for sports . after meeting with members of the german football association -lrb- dfb -rrb- and organizers for the women 's soccer world championship , manfred schaub , a member of the social democrats ' executive , said having sport as a constitutional objective would help resolve urban space issues , and make sure sport did n't always suffer when state coffers were empty . spd head kurt beck added that he recognized the contribution of the dfb in combating racism and integrating young immigrants . however , in an interview with the taz newspaper earlier in january , former constitutional court judge udo steiner advised against the move to make sport a national objective on the grounds that such objectives only required the government to act , but did n't specify in what way . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : clubs hope inclusion in the constitution will mean more financial support " as a general rule , there is always going to be controversy about what measures are appropriate , " steiner told the taz .
" if sport becomes a national objective , it probably would n't receive one single euro more .
political priorities determine how government money is distributed , and that is how it should be . " but the general director of the german olympic committee , michael vesper , said late last year that he welcomed the social democrats ' support for the initiative . " it is good news for sport , especially for the 7.5 million volunteers involved , " he said in a statement . a private matter ? nearly 30 percent of germany 's population is a member in a sports association . " there are more than 90,000 sports clubs and they help to keep our communities together , " vesper said .
" the inclusion of sport as national objective … can back community-spirited sports and give greater power to promote its aims . " however , speaking at a government hearing on the subject in 2007 , friedhelm hufen , a constitutional expert at the university of mainz , emphasized that the purpose of the constitution was not to recognize the efforts of volunteers and organizations . objectives currently in the german constitution include democracy , rule of law , environmental protection and animal protection , which , in 2002 , was the most recent addition .
a recent proposal also called for special protection of children in the constitution . most states support sport bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : sport is part of nearly all state constitutions fifteen of germany 's 16 states have already added sport to their list of objectives in their state constitutions .
under the federal constitution , the german government is responsible for supporting top-level sports . the social democrats have said before they wanted culture to be included as a new constitutional objective , along with sport .
the initiative also has the support of the left party and the free-market liberal free democrats , who originally called for the constitutional changes back in 2006 . as constitutional amendments require a two-thirds majority , they need the backing of chancellor angela merkel 's christian democrats .
however , the party made it clear in december 2007 that it would n't support any constitution changes within the current legislature period , which runs to may 2009 . dw staff -lrb- kh -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

but the state was penalised for breaking party rules by holding its contests - or " primaries " - before 5 february .
this means neither the democratic nor republican primaries will count for as much as they normally do .
why did michigan hold its primary early ?
it is one of a number of states that have brought their votes forward , with a view to maximising their influence on the presidential nomination process .
key dates 15 jan : michigan primary 19 jan : nevada caucuses ; south carolina primary -lrb- rep -rrb- 26 jan : south carolina primary -lrb- dem -rrb- 29 jan : florida primary 5 feb : some 20 states including california , new york , new jersey q & a : us primary elections primary and caucus dates a caucus guide what is a primary ?
a spokesman for the michigan republican party said the state wanted to focus politicians ' attention on its big issues , such as the automobile industry and jobs .
in 2004 , the michigan democrats held their vote in early february and the republicans in may .
in 2000 , the republicans voted in late february and the democrats in march - by which time the democratic nomination had already been effectively decided -lrb- in favour of al gore -rrb- .
why was michigan penalised for this ?
in an attempt to stop the rush to the front of the queue , both the democratic and republican national committees decreed that - with certain exceptions - no primaries should take place before 5 february .
the democrats have allowed four states to hold contests before this date - iowa and new hampshire , because of their traditional first-in-the-nation status , plus nevada and south carolina , to increase the geographic and demographic diversity of the early contests .
the republicans allowed only iowa and nevada to hold votes before the cut-off date , because technically , those states ' contests are non-binding .
are any other states being penalised for holding contests before 5 february ?
yes .
both parties are penalising florida , which holds its primary on 29 january .
the republican party is also penalising new hampshire , south carolina and wyoming .
how are they being punished ?
the democratic party is barring all michigan and florida delegates from voting for the presidential nominee at the party 's national convention in the summer .
the republican party is halving the number of delegates from all the rule-breaking states .
the whole point of the primaries is to select the delegates that will vote at the national convention , so the democratic primaries in michigan and florida now have little more than symbolic value .
the republican primary in michigan being still of some importance was hotly contested .
did the michigan democratic primary go ahead nonetheless ?
yes , but to show their loyalty to the national party , all of the democratic presidential candidates agreed not to campaign in the state .
and of the mainstream democrats , all but hillary clinton opted to take their name off the ballot last october , so she was certain of victory .
however , supporters of her main rivals , barack obama and john edwards , had the option of voting " uncommitted " .
results showed mrs clinton with 55 % and " uncommitted " on 40 % .
are michigan 's convention delegates likely to be reinstated ?
local bosses from both parties believe that by the time the conventions come around , the national parties will be keen to avoid a row and will allow michigan 's delegates to take part after all .
this was another reason for supporters of mrs clinton 's rivals to vote " uncommitted " .
if reinstated , uncommitted delegates would be allowed to vote at the convention for candidates whose names are not on the ballot .
if the nomination is not sewn-up long before the convention - as is normally the case - this could prove important in deciding which candidate wins out .

but the state was penalised for breaking party rules by holding its contests - or " primaries " - before 5 february .
this means neither the democratic nor republican primaries will count for as much as they normally do .
why did michigan hold its primary early ?
it is one of a number of states that have brought their votes forward , with a view to maximising their influence on the presidential nomination process .
key dates 15 jan : michigan primary 19 jan : nevada caucuses ; south carolina primary -lrb- rep -rrb- 26 jan : south carolina primary -lrb- dem -rrb- 29 jan : florida primary 5 feb : some 20 states including california , new york , new jersey q & a : us primary elections primary and caucus dates a caucus guide what is a primary ?
a spokesman for the michigan republican party said the state wanted to focus politicians ' attention on its big issues , such as the automobile industry and jobs .
in 2004 , the michigan democrats held their vote in early february and the republicans in may .
in 2000 , the republicans voted in late february and the democrats in march - by which time the democratic nomination had already been effectively decided -lrb- in favour of al gore -rrb- .
why was michigan penalised for this ?
in an attempt to stop the rush to the front of the queue , both the democratic and republican national committees decreed that - with certain exceptions - no primaries should take place before 5 february .
the democrats have allowed four states to hold contests before this date - iowa and new hampshire , because of their traditional first-in-the-nation status , plus nevada and south carolina , to increase the geographic and demographic diversity of the early contests .
the republicans allowed only iowa and nevada to hold votes before the cut-off date , because technically , those states ' contests are non-binding .
are any other states being penalised for holding contests before 5 february ?
yes .
both parties are penalising florida , which holds its primary on 29 january .
the republican party is also penalising new hampshire , south carolina and wyoming .
how are they being punished ?
the democratic party is barring all michigan and florida delegates from voting for the presidential nominee at the party 's national convention in the summer .
the republican party is halving the number of delegates from all the rule-breaking states .
the whole point of the primaries is to select the delegates that will vote at the national convention , so the democratic primaries in michigan and florida now have little more than symbolic value .
the republican primary in michigan being still of some importance was hotly contested .
did the michigan democratic primary go ahead nonetheless ?
yes , but to show their loyalty to the national party , all of the democratic presidential candidates agreed not to campaign in the state .
and of the mainstream democrats , all but hillary clinton opted to take their name off the ballot last october , so she was certain of victory .
however , supporters of her main rivals , barack obama and john edwards , had the option of voting " uncommitted " .
results showed mrs clinton with 55 % and " uncommitted " on 40 % .
are michigan 's convention delegates likely to be reinstated ?
local bosses from both parties believe that by the time the conventions come around , the national parties will be keen to avoid a row and will allow michigan 's delegates to take part after all .
this was another reason for supporters of mrs clinton 's rivals to vote " uncommitted " .
if reinstated , uncommitted delegates would be allowed to vote at the convention for candidates whose names are not on the ballot .
if the nomination is not sewn-up long before the convention - as is normally the case - this could prove important in deciding which candidate wins out .

the pankisi gorge was once a no-go area for georgian troops enlarge image " before the war , we shot them with rifles .
after the war , we had machine guns , " he laughs .
" i found the kalashnikov-762 especially effective . "
seven years after he fled chechnya , ziauddin lives 60km -lrb- 37 miles -rrb- from its frontier with georgia , at the mouth of the pankisi gorge .
a university graduate who filmed the chechen rebels and fought alongside them , he says he misses his homeland but will only return if russian troops leave it .
today , between him and his former hunting ground lies a militarised border , minefields , and the high caucasus .
but chechnya was once much closer to pankisi .
rebels would cross the border freely to flee from the russians , regroup and re-arm .
unusually , their presence united washington and moscow in alarm .
in 2002 , the us warned that the remote valley had become a base for arab fighters allied to al-qaeda .
in august that year , president vladimir putin sent russian aircraft to bomb alleged rebel bases in the gorge , after accusing the georgian government of inaction .
foreign visitors were discouraged from entering the region by a series of high-profile kidnappings .
georgian troops too kept their distance , as rumours swirled that the area was a base for heavily-armed heroin smugglers .
for a brief period early in this decade , the pankisi gorge became a byword for international terrorism .
click here for a map of the region flight from war the caucasus mountains loom silent and beautiful over duisi - the main village in the gorge .
the pankisi gorge is largely peaceful now enlarge image the echoes of russia 's war in chechnya appear to have died down .
according to the georgian government , no rebels remain in pankisi - only refugees .
their memories deter them from return .
kometa timirbulatova shudders as she describes fighting in the chechen capital , grozny .
" i was stuck in a basement with no water and a one-month-old child .
there was running water two blocks away but fetching it meant certain death , because russian snipers on the rooftops were shooting anything that moved . "
" i prayed for a missile to fall on our basement and finish us all off , " she says , drawing an arm protectively across her young daughter .
the refugees in pankisi arrived after the start of the second war in chechnya , triggered in 1999 by russia 's drive to recapture grozny from the rebels .
some 200 chechens who fled the conflict are still estimated to live here .
the number used to be higher but most have now moved on - some to other russian republics , many to turkey and azerbaijan .
' not safe ' pankisi 's refugees are unique among displaced chechens - they live as close as possible to the conflict zone without actually being inside russia .
part of ziauddin 's office was recently damaged in a mysterious fire barely a day 's trek from the border , mobile phone calls keep them informed of the situation back home .
but they remain reluctant to speak about it , despite being residents of georgia , whose government routinely confronts moscow over a range of issues .
president putin 's air strikes on the gorge six years ago still resonate here - a reminder to the refugees that they are not beyond russia 's reach .
" we 've been told not to speak ill of russia , " says musa , a middle-aged man from grozny .
when asked by whom , he shrugged and looked away .
ziauddin is also on his guard .
last month , a fire destroyed the ground floor of the refugee centre he manages in the town of akhmeta .
he suspects arson but has no idea who did it .
" even here we 're not safe , " he mutters , studying the blackened walls of his building .
though grateful to georgia for accommodating them , the refugees say they would rather find work in the flourishing economies of western europe .
musa says he has no intention of returning to chechnya returning to chechnya while it remains under russian control is , for them , inconceivable .
" russian emergency ministry officials visit us and offer all sorts of incentives to go back - free transport , housing , jobs , " says musa .
" those who wished to have returned .
i 'm staying put . "
he fears he will be forever stigmatised for having lived in pankisi , a place long seen by russia as a hotbed of terrorism .
" as a chechen who comes back from georgia , you are treated as a criminal twice over , " he says .
russian resurgence the conflict in chechnya has eased in recent years and grozny is being rebuilt .
russia 's government says this proves the success of its strategy - namely , to strengthen its local ally , militia leader ramzan kadyrov , himself a former rebel .
people called us bandits and fanatics ...
we have shown our true colours by living here in peace ali khatushkaev chechen refugee human rights groups say mr kadyrov 's men , russian troops , and the rebels are all guilty of atrocities against civilians .
ziauddin is scathing about the russian government 's claim that chechnya is no longer at war .
" russia is trying to remove itself from the battlefield and portray the conflict as a fight between chechens , " he says .
" that way , it can say that any human rights violations are the work of chechens , not russians . "
but , he admits , russia is in a stronger position now than it was seven years ago , thanks to the us-led " war on terror " .
" moscow 's economy was a mess when they started the second war in chechnya .
but america 's wars in iraq and afghanistan have driven up the price of russian oil .
now , no-one dares criticise it . "
' co-existence ' since the refugees ' arrival , a popular uprising in georgia has installed a new government keen to draw the country away from moscow and closer to the us and nato .
chechen refugees live beside ' kist ' georgians of chechen descent this course was established , in part , by events in the pankisi gorge in 2002 .

" i prayed for a missile to fall on our basement and finish us all off , " she says , drawing an arm protectively across her young daughter .
the refugees in pankisi arrived after the start of the second war in chechnya , triggered in 1999 by russia 's drive to recapture grozny from the rebels .
some 200 chechens who fled the conflict are still estimated to live here .
the number used to be higher but most have now moved on - some to other russian republics , many to turkey and azerbaijan .

ziauddin is scathing about the russian government 's claim that chechnya is no longer at war .
" russia is trying to remove itself from the battlefield and portray the conflict as a fight between chechens , " he says .
" that way , it can say that any human rights violations are the work of chechens , not russians . "

the pankisi gorge was once a no-go area for georgian troops enlarge image " before the war , we shot them with rifles .
after the war , we had machine guns , " he laughs .
" i found the kalashnikov-762 especially effective . "
seven years after he fled chechnya , ziauddin lives 60km -lrb- 37 miles -rrb- from its frontier with georgia , at the mouth of the pankisi gorge .
a university graduate who filmed the chechen rebels and fought alongside them , he says he misses his homeland but will only return if russian troops leave it .
today , between him and his former hunting ground lies a militarised border , minefields , and the high caucasus .
but chechnya was once much closer to pankisi .
rebels would cross the border freely to flee from the russians , regroup and re-arm .
unusually , their presence united washington and moscow in alarm .
in 2002 , the us warned that the remote valley had become a base for arab fighters allied to al-qaeda .
in august that year , president vladimir putin sent russian aircraft to bomb alleged rebel bases in the gorge , after accusing the georgian government of inaction .
foreign visitors were discouraged from entering the region by a series of high-profile kidnappings .
georgian troops too kept their distance , as rumours swirled that the area was a base for heavily-armed heroin smugglers .
for a brief period early in this decade , the pankisi gorge became a byword for international terrorism .

the pankisi gorge is largely peaceful now enlarge image the echoes of russia 's war in chechnya appear to have died down .
according to the georgian government , no rebels remain in pankisi - only refugees .
their memories deter them from return .
kometa timirbulatova shudders as she describes fighting in the chechen capital , grozny .
" i was stuck in a basement with no water and a one-month-old child .
there was running water two blocks away but fetching it meant certain death , because russian snipers on the rooftops were shooting anything that moved . "
" i prayed for a missile to fall on our basement and finish us all off , " she says , drawing an arm protectively across her young daughter .
the refugees in pankisi arrived after the start of the second war in chechnya , triggered in 1999 by russia 's drive to recapture grozny from the rebels .
some 200 chechens who fled the conflict are still estimated to live here .
the number used to be higher but most have now moved on - some to other russian republics , many to turkey and azerbaijan .
' not safe ' pankisi 's refugees are unique among displaced chechens - they live as close as possible to the conflict zone without actually being inside russia .
part of ziauddin 's office was recently damaged in a mysterious fire barely a day 's trek from the border , mobile phone calls keep them informed of the situation back home .
but they remain reluctant to speak about it , despite being residents of georgia , whose government routinely confronts moscow over a range of issues .
president putin 's air strikes on the gorge six years ago still resonate here - a reminder to the refugees that they are not beyond russia 's reach .
" we 've been told not to speak ill of russia , " says musa , a middle-aged man from grozny .
when asked by whom , he shrugged and looked away .
ziauddin is also on his guard .
last month , a fire destroyed the ground floor of the refugee centre he manages in the town of akhmeta .
he suspects arson but has no idea who did it .
" even here we 're not safe , " he mutters , studying the blackened walls of his building .
though grateful to georgia for accommodating them , the refugees say they would rather find work in the flourishing economies of western europe .
musa says he has no intention of returning to chechnya returning to chechnya while it remains under russian control is , for them , inconceivable .
" russian emergency ministry officials visit us and offer all sorts of incentives to go back - free transport , housing , jobs , " says musa .
" those who wished to have returned .
i 'm staying put . "
he fears he will be forever stigmatised for having lived in pankisi , a place long seen by russia as a hotbed of terrorism .
" as a chechen who comes back from georgia , you are treated as a criminal twice over , " he says .
russian resurgence the conflict in chechnya has eased in recent years and grozny is being rebuilt .
russia 's government says this proves the success of its strategy - namely , to strengthen its local ally , militia leader ramzan kadyrov , himself a former rebel .
people called us bandits and fanatics ...
we have shown our true colours by living here in peace ali khatushkaev chechen refugee human rights groups say mr kadyrov 's men , russian troops , and the rebels are all guilty of atrocities against civilians .
ziauddin is scathing about the russian government 's claim that chechnya is no longer at war .
" russia is trying to remove itself from the battlefield and portray the conflict as a fight between chechens , " he says .
" that way , it can say that any human rights violations are the work of chechens , not russians . "
but , he admits , russia is in a stronger position now than it was seven years ago , thanks to the us-led " war on terror " .
" moscow 's economy was a mess when they started the second war in chechnya .
but america 's wars in iraq and afghanistan have driven up the price of russian oil .
now , no-one dares criticise it . "
' co-existence ' since the refugees ' arrival , a popular uprising in georgia has installed a new government keen to draw the country away from moscow and closer to the us and nato .
chechen refugees live beside ' kist ' georgians of chechen descent this course was established , in part , by events in the pankisi gorge in 2002 .
after russia 's air strikes , georgia sent troops trained by the us military to take on the chechen rebels .
the government in tbilisi says its military cleared out the militants and restored the rule of law .
but a refugee who fled to pankisi in 2002 says it is the will of the chechens themselves that has ensured peace .
" at first , people called us bandits and fanatics , " says ali khatushkaev , a young man with a neat beard and gold-capped teeth .
" but we have shown our true colours by living here in peace for all these years , " he says .
most of the refugees came to georgia at the height of the conflict amid the yearnings for independence , there is also evidence of the chechens ' history of co-existence with their neighbours in the caucasus .
muslim prayer beads hang on the wall of musa 's home in duisi .
next to them stands a christmas tree - popular with the children , musa 's wife says .
and as ziauddin reminisces about his hunting days in chechnya , he recalls shooting wild boar as well as bears .
eating boar , however , was forbidden by the chechens ' muslim faith .
the animals shot by ziauddin and his friends were sold as meat to the russians .

the welsh assembly 's audit committee said a new gp contract , which included a 25 % pay rise , had not brought enough improvements for patients .
in particular , the ams highlighted the problem many still have in getting an appointment with their local gp .
the welsh assembly government said it would consider the report 's findings .
the new gp contract , which was introduced in 2004 , cost the nhs in wales an extra £ 131m in 2005-06 or 44 % more than the old contract .
people get frustrated because they ca n't get an appointment vanessa bourne , of the patients ' association it gave doctors a pay rise - the average gp in wales is now understood to earn up to £ 100,000 - and reduced their working hours .
the goal was to improve the service patients received .
but david melding am , chairman of the audit committee , said : " the new contract has delivered some benefits for patients in wales , but more needs to be done to ensure that all the potential benefits are realised , or it will not represent value for money . "
' spiralling workload ' the report also said the " rigour and quality " of local health board -lrb- lhb -rrb- checks on gp practices to ensure they were meeting targets was " variable " across the country .
it recommended the assembly government issued guidelines to lhbs on checks to improve patient access .
despite the problems , the report said the new contract had delivered some improvements , including the fact investment in premises was starting to increase and more specialised services were being brought closer to patients ' homes .
dr david bailey , chairman of the bma 's welsh gp committee , said the new contract was brought in " because of a widespread recognition that gps had fallen behind other professions and that recruitment was down as a consequence of this and of spiralling workload " .

ms bourne , who lives in lampeter , said getting an appointment was a huge problem for many people who had contacted her .
" people get frustrated because they ca n't get an appointment , " she said .
" you have some people who have to take half a day off work to even make an appointment , let alone see the gp . "
a welsh assembly government spokesman said the health minister welcomed the report and would carefully consider its findings .
he said the contract has brought benefits to patients and gps and it was " important that this momentum is maintained " to maximise the significant investment made by the assembly government .

the welsh assembly 's audit committee said a new gp contract , which included a 25 % pay rise , had not brought enough improvements for patients .
in particular , the ams highlighted the problem many still have in getting an appointment with their local gp .
the welsh assembly government said it would consider the report 's findings .
the new gp contract , which was introduced in 2004 , cost the nhs in wales an extra £ 131m in 2005-06 or 44 % more than the old contract .
people get frustrated because they ca n't get an appointment vanessa bourne , of the patients ' association it gave doctors a pay rise - the average gp in wales is now understood to earn up to £ 100,000 - and reduced their working hours .
the goal was to improve the service patients received .
but david melding am , chairman of the audit committee , said : " the new contract has delivered some benefits for patients in wales , but more needs to be done to ensure that all the potential benefits are realised , or it will not represent value for money . "
' spiralling workload ' the report also said the " rigour and quality " of local health board -lrb- lhb -rrb- checks on gp practices to ensure they were meeting targets was " variable " across the country .
it recommended the assembly government issued guidelines to lhbs on checks to improve patient access .
despite the problems , the report said the new contract had delivered some improvements , including the fact investment in premises was starting to increase and more specialised services were being brought closer to patients ' homes .
dr david bailey , chairman of the bma 's welsh gp committee , said the new contract was brought in " because of a widespread recognition that gps had fallen behind other professions and that recruitment was down as a consequence of this and of spiralling workload " .
he added : " if you take the welsh assembly government 's own patient access survey findings , overall , 81 % of welsh patients say they are able to access their gps service within the welsh assembly government 's own 24-hour target . "
' benefits to patients ' vanessa bourne , of the patients ' association , a charity which supports patients , said she hoped the report would prompt health minister edwina hart into action .
" the gps are being paid more for doing less .
on the other hand you have to attract gps to do the job , " she said .
" but it does not seem patients are getting the benefit of this as much as the gps . "
ms bourne , who lives in lampeter , said getting an appointment was a huge problem for many people who had contacted her .
" people get frustrated because they ca n't get an appointment , " she said .
" you have some people who have to take half a day off work to even make an appointment , let alone see the gp . "
a welsh assembly government spokesman said the health minister welcomed the report and would carefully consider its findings .

but he said it was a " lie " to say such matters formed part of the talks .
the list , which included the giant 's causeway project , was disclosed in a letter from then direct rule minister david hanson to mr paisley .
it was made public by traditional unionist mep jim allister under the freedom of information act .
mr allister accused mr paisley of " wasting valuable leverage on securing concessions from the prime minister no less , not on matters of importance to unionists , but on issues of mere commercial or constituency import " .
' concerning ' sinn fein north antrim assembly member daithi mckay said people " would be shocked that ian paisley jr has brought his shopping list into the st andrews negotiations " .
" but more concerning is that of all the items on this shopping list , a third of them are in one way and another connected to a private developer who caused mr paisley so many problems last year , " he said .
the letter , dated 13 october 2006 , the last day of the st andrew 's negotiations aimed at reviving devolution , listed six requests by ian paisley jnr .
the giant 's causeway is northern ireland 's top tourist attraction mr hanson said the then prime minister tony blair had " considered the requests and has agreed the government should try to respond positively " .
topping the list was £ 1m in funding over seven years for the north west 200 , followed by planning approval for a spa including 200 homes .
also on the list was the giant 's causeway project and it was suggested private sector land should be included in its development .
the letter also suggested dropping a judicial review of lands in ballee .
the bbc reported in december that the case was settled after devolution in july .
the land is about to be sold by the department of social development , for about £ 50m in a deal that involves a range of business interests , including those of seymour sweeney .
seymour sweeney is seeking to build at the giant 's causeway mr sweeney , a member of the dup , is also the private developer seeking to build a new visitor 's centre at the giant 's causeway .
mr paisley later told the bbc that he was sorry if his actions had caused embarrassment to his party , but stressed that he had done nothing wrong .
in a statement , he also said : " it is now well known that on the margins of the st andrew 's talks , i took the opportunity with nio ministers to raise a number of outstanding constituency cases , including financial support for the nw 200 , planning in ballymena , the giant 's causeway and the ballee lands tribunal case .
" the dup at no time used any of these matters as leverage in the negotiations .
" they were not raised by , or with , the party , nor were they included on any shopping list considered and approved by the party . "
he added : " the fact that jim allister chooses to make an issue of this at the time of a by-election in dromore highlights the poverty of his activities . "
the northern ireland office said a number of issues were raised with the government in the margins of the st andrew 's talks " that were not connected to the negotiations and , as is the usual practice , were taken away for consideration " .

but he said it was a " lie " to say such matters formed part of the talks .
the list , which included the giant 's causeway project , was disclosed in a letter from then direct rule minister david hanson to mr paisley .
it was made public by traditional unionist mep jim allister under the freedom of information act .
mr allister accused mr paisley of " wasting valuable leverage on securing concessions from the prime minister no less , not on matters of importance to unionists , but on issues of mere commercial or constituency import " .
' concerning ' sinn fein north antrim assembly member daithi mckay said people " would be shocked that ian paisley jr has brought his shopping list into the st andrews negotiations " .
" but more concerning is that of all the items on this shopping list , a third of them are in one way and another connected to a private developer who caused mr paisley so many problems last year , " he said .
the letter , dated 13 october 2006 , the last day of the st andrew 's negotiations aimed at reviving devolution , listed six requests by ian paisley jnr .
the giant 's causeway is northern ireland 's top tourist attraction mr hanson said the then prime minister tony blair had " considered the requests and has agreed the government should try to respond positively " .
topping the list was £ 1m in funding over seven years for the north west 200 , followed by planning approval for a spa including 200 homes .
also on the list was the giant 's causeway project and it was suggested private sector land should be included in its development .
the letter also suggested dropping a judicial review of lands in ballee .
the bbc reported in december that the case was settled after devolution in july .
the land is about to be sold by the department of social development , for about £ 50m in a deal that involves a range of business interests , including those of seymour sweeney .
seymour sweeney is seeking to build at the giant 's causeway mr sweeney , a member of the dup , is also the private developer seeking to build a new visitor 's centre at the giant 's causeway .
mr paisley later told the bbc that he was sorry if his actions had caused embarrassment to his party , but stressed that he had done nothing wrong .
in a statement , he also said : " it is now well known that on the margins of the st andrew 's talks , i took the opportunity with nio ministers to raise a number of outstanding constituency cases , including financial support for the nw 200 , planning in ballymena , the giant 's causeway and the ballee lands tribunal case .
" the dup at no time used any of these matters as leverage in the negotiations .
" they were not raised by , or with , the party , nor were they included on any shopping list considered and approved by the party . "
he added : " the fact that jim allister chooses to make an issue of this at the time of a by-election in dromore highlights the poverty of his activities . "
