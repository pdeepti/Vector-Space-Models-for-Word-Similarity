but despite the dour overall outlook , a second study found germans remain fairly optimistic when it comes to their own lives . according to a study by the institute for market research commissioned by the daily leipziger volkszeitung , one out of three germans does not trust their country 's style of federalist democracy .
even fewer have faith in the system of social market economy . the study , published on tuesday , april 22 , comes on the heels of a speech by german chancellor angela merkel , calling for business leaders to shore up the economic system many say contributed to the country 's " economic miracle " after world war ii . based on responses of some 1,000 participants across the country , the study showed a regional difference in perceptions of german democracy .
in western germany , 64 percent believe democracy is operating as it should , while in the nation 's eastern states , that number is 44 percent . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany 's police got top marks in the poll faith in the german government and the political parties seems to have suffered most among the population : 38 percent believe in the german government , and only 22 percent in the parties represented in parliament . police are popular , so is love the strength of the market is a different story .
in western germany , 51 percent believe in the power of the german market economy and 43 percent think the social welfare system is up to par .
in eastern germany , those numbers are decidedly lower : 33 percent and 30 percent , respectively . the study showed that germans appear to have the most faith in their police force .
some 85 percent of those surveyed think the work police do is satisfactory .
some 62 percent are content with the justice system , and 64 percent said they find the reporting by german television acceptable . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : love still rules among many germans germans ' outlook on daily life was the subject of a survey published tuesday by the online version of der spiegel newsweekly . nearly 80 percent of all germans said they begin their day with confidence .
and over 80 percent of men and women believe in " true love , " according to the survey . the magazine 's poll looked at everything from when germans go to bed at night , to whether they sing in the car when alone or would sleep with their partner 's best friend , to how much time they take - on average - to eat breakfast in the morning . dw staff -lrb- als -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

dutschke died 11 years later as a result of complications from the injuries he sustained in the 1968 shooting by a house painter with alleged right-wing sympathies .
court rules against springer lawyers for springer argued that naming a street after dutschke would signal acceptance of crimes committed by some of the leftist student revolutionaries he came to represent .

meanwhile , france and the us are drafting a united nations resolution to put a stop to the piracy . somali pirates attempting to hijack a japanese oil tanker in the gulf of aden were thwarted in part due to the intervention of german navy frigate , the emden , which is patrolling the area as part of the international anti-terrorism operation , enduring freedom .
according to japanese shipping company nippon yusen kk , the takayam oil tanker was attacked early on monday , april 21 , by a small boat off the northern coast of somalia .
a rocket left a hole from which hundreds of gallons of fuel leaked , the ship 's operator said .
the tanker sent out a radio distress call , which was received by the emden , a german navy spokesperson said .
the frigate headed straight for the scene , sending ahead a helicopter to intercept the pirates .
by the time the helicopter arrived , the pirates had fled in their speedboat , the spokesman said , adding that the mere threat of the naval force had been enough to scare off the bandits .
somali troops storm dubai ship yemeni coastguard forces also claimed a role in helping to save the japanese tanker from somali pirates , yemen 's official news agency reported .

tourist travel to europe is also expanding among a growing chinese middle class . the soaring demand for air travel from europe to china in recent years has led to a rise in the number of new and unusual routes to the middle kingdom in the run-up to the olympic games in beijing . in march , lufthansa was the first european airline to start up non-stop flights from its main hub , in frankfurt , to the eastern chinese city nanjing , and in june , the german national flag carrier will service shenyang , a growing industrial center northeast of beijing and one of the key sites for the summer olympics . lufthansa rival air berlin will introduce regular , non-stop flights to beijing and shanghai from dusseldorf in may .
meanwhile , dutch carrier klm has been offering non-stop service from amsterdam to the interior chinese city chengdu , in the mountainous hinterlands east of the himalayas , since 2006 . but it is finnair , a medium-sized european airline , that has invested the most in the asian-pacific region relative to its size .
in 1999 , the finnish carrier made the strategic decision to drop all of its north atlantic routes , except for daily flights from helsinki to new york , and shift the rest of its long-haul capacity completely to asia . asia strategy " as a small country , we could not compete with the big european airlines on north american routes .
concentrating on asia makes geographical sense for us .
the shortest route to beijing or shanghai from europe is via helsinki , " said taneli hassinen , finnair 's vice president for investor relations . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : eu companies have sites near a new air route to nanjing hassinen explained that most european flights to asia need to fly over the north pole in finnish airspace anyway , so a stopover in helsinki makes sense for passengers coming from cities or countries without an asian network , such as spain , berlin or hamburg .
the majority of its passengers traveling to asia come from other european cities through its helsinki hub , with its 25 weekly flights to china accounting for nearly 40 percent of all finnair 's asian routes . of all european carriers , lufthansa , however , is in the lead , with 58 weekly flights to china , including its two new routes to nanjing and shenyang .
more than 3,000 german firms are active in china , with exports accounting for 54 billion euros -lrb- $ 86 billion -rrb- last year , generating plenty of business travel . big european demand as with finnair , the bulk of lufthansa 's passengers to china are coming through its frankfurt and munich hubs from other destinations in germany and europe .
german chemical giant basf opened an integrated production facility in nanjing in recent years , and it 's one of many multinational companies to benefit from the new route , according to airline spokesman boris ogursky . an estimated 1,000 eu companies , including electronics giant siemens and automakers such as fiat and ford , have production sites in and around nanjing , which is linked by a network of motorways to china 's biggest commercial center in shanghai . " nanjing and shanghai form a huge industrial cluster within 270 kilometers -lrb- 170 miles -rrb- and are close enough so that passengers could easily fly into one city and out of another back to germany , giving them more flexibility , " said ogursky . lufthansa also operates daily flights to the southern chinese city of guangzhou in the pearl delta region , which is undergoing a boom that could make it the next shanghai .
altogether chinese routes accounted for 20 percent of all asia revenues , and the planes are generally filled to capacity , with average passenger loads above the asian average of 83 percent , he added . middle class traveling to europe martina noss , a travel analyst with the german bank nordlb in hanover stressed that european airlines , which are well positioned in markets with tremendous growth potential such as china and india , stand to benefit in the long term .
asian routes are also far more lucrative than the saturated north atlantic market , where intense competition means a downward pressure on airfares that cut into profit margins , she added . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : touring european castles becomes a status symbol for middle class chinese " asia is a big profitable cake , and lufthansa has a huge advantage of having established itself early in the china market and getting a big piece of it , " said noss , who added that the bread and butter of air travel are premium-paying business travelers , but that the tourist segment of the market is also expanding rapidly . " there is a growing middle class in china and india , and taking a holiday in europe is a great status symbol for them , similar to the japanese tour groups who travel through the major european capitals in 10 days , " said noss . according to estimates by european aircraft manufacturer airbus , there will be 600 million middle class chinese consumers with disposable income for european holidays by 2020 . diana fong send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

but despite the dour overall outlook , a second study found germans remain fairly optimistic when it comes to their own lives . according to a study by the institute for market research commissioned by the daily leipziger volkszeitung , one out of three germans does not trust their country 's style of federalist democracy .
even fewer have faith in the system of social market economy . the study , published on tuesday , april 22 , comes on the heels of a speech by german chancellor angela merkel , calling for business leaders to shore up the economic system many say contributed to the country 's " economic miracle " after world war ii . based on responses of some 1,000 participants across the country , the study showed a regional difference in perceptions of german democracy .
in western germany , 64 percent believe democracy is operating as it should , while in the nation 's eastern states , that number is 44 percent . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany 's police got top marks in the poll faith in the german government and the political parties seems to have suffered most among the population : 38 percent believe in the german government , and only 22 percent in the parties represented in parliament . police are popular , so is love the strength of the market is a different story .
in western germany , 51 percent believe in the power of the german market economy and 43 percent think the social welfare system is up to par .

meanwhile , france and the us are drafting a united nations resolution to put a stop to the piracy . somali pirates attempting to hijack a japanese oil tanker in the gulf of aden were thwarted in part due to the intervention of german navy frigate , the emden , which is patrolling the area as part of the international anti-terrorism operation , enduring freedom .
according to japanese shipping company nippon yusen kk , the takayam oil tanker was attacked early on monday , april 21 , by a small boat off the northern coast of somalia .
a rocket left a hole from which hundreds of gallons of fuel leaked , the ship 's operator said .

the frigate headed straight for the scene , sending ahead a helicopter to intercept the pirates .
by the time the helicopter arrived , the pirates had fled in their speedboat , the spokesman said , adding that the mere threat of the naval force had been enough to scare off the bandits .

tourist travel to europe is also expanding among a growing chinese middle class . the soaring demand for air travel from europe to china in recent years has led to a rise in the number of new and unusual routes to the middle kingdom in the run-up to the olympic games in beijing . in march , lufthansa was the first european airline to start up non-stop flights from its main hub , in frankfurt , to the eastern chinese city nanjing , and in june , the german national flag carrier will service shenyang , a growing industrial center northeast of beijing and one of the key sites for the summer olympics . lufthansa rival air berlin will introduce regular , non-stop flights to beijing and shanghai from dusseldorf in may .
meanwhile , dutch carrier klm has been offering non-stop service from amsterdam to the interior chinese city chengdu , in the mountainous hinterlands east of the himalayas , since 2006 . but it is finnair , a medium-sized european airline , that has invested the most in the asian-pacific region relative to its size .
in 1999 , the finnish carrier made the strategic decision to drop all of its north atlantic routes , except for daily flights from helsinki to new york , and shift the rest of its long-haul capacity completely to asia . asia strategy " as a small country , we could not compete with the big european airlines on north american routes .
concentrating on asia makes geographical sense for us .
the shortest route to beijing or shanghai from europe is via helsinki , " said taneli hassinen , finnair 's vice president for investor relations . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : eu companies have sites near a new air route to nanjing hassinen explained that most european flights to asia need to fly over the north pole in finnish airspace anyway , so a stopover in helsinki makes sense for passengers coming from cities or countries without an asian network , such as spain , berlin or hamburg .
the majority of its passengers traveling to asia come from other european cities through its helsinki hub , with its 25 weekly flights to china accounting for nearly 40 percent of all finnair 's asian routes . of all european carriers , lufthansa , however , is in the lead , with 58 weekly flights to china , including its two new routes to nanjing and shenyang .
more than 3,000 german firms are active in china , with exports accounting for 54 billion euros -lrb- $ 86 billion -rrb- last year , generating plenty of business travel . big european demand as with finnair , the bulk of lufthansa 's passengers to china are coming through its frankfurt and munich hubs from other destinations in germany and europe .
german chemical giant basf opened an integrated production facility in nanjing in recent years , and it 's one of many multinational companies to benefit from the new route , according to airline spokesman boris ogursky . an estimated 1,000 eu companies , including electronics giant siemens and automakers such as fiat and ford , have production sites in and around nanjing , which is linked by a network of motorways to china 's biggest commercial center in shanghai . " nanjing and shanghai form a huge industrial cluster within 270 kilometers -lrb- 170 miles -rrb- and are close enough so that passengers could easily fly into one city and out of another back to germany , giving them more flexibility , " said ogursky . lufthansa also operates daily flights to the southern chinese city of guangzhou in the pearl delta region , which is undergoing a boom that could make it the next shanghai .
altogether chinese routes accounted for 20 percent of all asia revenues , and the planes are generally filled to capacity , with average passenger loads above the asian average of 83 percent , he added . middle class traveling to europe martina noss , a travel analyst with the german bank nordlb in hanover stressed that european airlines , which are well positioned in markets with tremendous growth potential such as china and india , stand to benefit in the long term .

but despite the dour overall outlook , a second study found germans remain fairly optimistic when it comes to their own lives . according to a study by the institute for market research commissioned by the daily leipziger volkszeitung , one out of three germans does not trust their country 's style of federalist democracy .
even fewer have faith in the system of social market economy . the study , published on tuesday , april 22 , comes on the heels of a speech by german chancellor angela merkel , calling for business leaders to shore up the economic system many say contributed to the country 's " economic miracle " after world war ii . based on responses of some 1,000 participants across the country , the study showed a regional difference in perceptions of german democracy .

in western germany , 51 percent believe in the power of the german market economy and 43 percent think the social welfare system is up to par .
in eastern germany , those numbers are decidedly lower : 33 percent and 30 percent , respectively . the study showed that germans appear to have the most faith in their police force .
some 85 percent of those surveyed think the work police do is satisfactory .
some 62 percent are content with the justice system , and 64 percent said they find the reporting by german television acceptable . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : love still rules among many germans germans ' outlook on daily life was the subject of a survey published tuesday by the online version of der spiegel newsweekly . nearly 80 percent of all germans said they begin their day with confidence .
and over 80 percent of men and women believe in " true love , " according to the survey . the magazine 's poll looked at everything from when germans go to bed at night , to whether they sing in the car when alone or would sleep with their partner 's best friend , to how much time they take - on average - to eat breakfast in the morning . dw staff -lrb- als -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

tourist travel to europe is also expanding among a growing chinese middle class . the soaring demand for air travel from europe to china in recent years has led to a rise in the number of new and unusual routes to the middle kingdom in the run-up to the olympic games in beijing . in march , lufthansa was the first european airline to start up non-stop flights from its main hub , in frankfurt , to the eastern chinese city nanjing , and in june , the german national flag carrier will service shenyang , a growing industrial center northeast of beijing and one of the key sites for the summer olympics . lufthansa rival air berlin will introduce regular , non-stop flights to beijing and shanghai from dusseldorf in may .
meanwhile , dutch carrier klm has been offering non-stop service from amsterdam to the interior chinese city chengdu , in the mountainous hinterlands east of the himalayas , since 2006 . but it is finnair , a medium-sized european airline , that has invested the most in the asian-pacific region relative to its size .
in 1999 , the finnish carrier made the strategic decision to drop all of its north atlantic routes , except for daily flights from helsinki to new york , and shift the rest of its long-haul capacity completely to asia . asia strategy " as a small country , we could not compete with the big european airlines on north american routes .

meanwhile , france and the us are drafting a united nations resolution to put a stop to the piracy . somali pirates attempting to hijack a japanese oil tanker in the gulf of aden were thwarted in part due to the intervention of german navy frigate , the emden , which is patrolling the area as part of the international anti-terrorism operation , enduring freedom .
according to japanese shipping company nippon yusen kk , the takayam oil tanker was attacked early on monday , april 21 , by a small boat off the northern coast of somalia .

the tanker sent out a radio distress call , which was received by the emden , a german navy spokesperson said .
the frigate headed straight for the scene , sending ahead a helicopter to intercept the pirates .
by the time the helicopter arrived , the pirates had fled in their speedboat , the spokesman said , adding that the mere threat of the naval force had been enough to scare off the bandits .

meanwhile , the tibetan spiritual leader called on the united states for help with tibet . the paris city council voted on monday , april 21 , to bestow honorary citizenship on the dalai lama without the blessing of president nicolas sarkozy 's federal government .
hu jia , a prominent human rights activist who was jailed in china earlier this month on charges of attempted subversion , was also awarded citizenship in the french capital . beijing said tuesday it was " strongly dissatisfied and resolutely opposed " to the paris city council 's decision , calling it interference in china 's internal affairs . a spokesman for sarkozy 's right-wing ump party said paris ' mayor bertrand delanoe may have been trying to boost his domestic popularity with the initiative . delanoe on monday called the dalai lama a " champion of peace " and said paris wanted " to show its support for the people of tibet who are defending their most basic right to dignity , freedom and simple life . " the honorary citizenship has turned up the heat on already simmering relations between france and china . calls to boycott french retailer carrefour 's 122 shops throughout china began on saturday and at least one location was forced to shut its doors on monday due to hefty demonstrations . china 's foreign ministry said tuesday it did not agree with " individual radical actions , " referring to unruly scenes that evolved during anti-western protests targeting the carrefour stores . " we do not agree with some individual radical actions , " foreign ministry spokeswoman jiang yu told reporters in beijing .
" we think the chinese people can express their feelings in a legal and rational way . " sarkozy writes to chinese torch-bearer bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : thousands demonstrated in front of carrefour supermarkets on saturday tension arose between the two countries two weeks ago when pro-tibet demonstrators disrupted the olympic torch relay in paris .
wheelchair-bound chinese fencer jin jing has since become a national icon after she resisted protestors who attempted to grab the torch . on a visit to shanghai on monday , french senate president christian poncelet presented her a letter from sarkozy expressing regret over the incident .
the athlete told chinese press that she was disappointed that the french president did n't explicitly apologize for the incident . sarkozy " expressed regret , shock and condemnation but no apology , " beijing reports quoted jin as saying . poncelet was also expected to hand over a letter from sarkozy to chinese president hu jintao , emphasizing the importance of bilateral relations between the two countries . sarkozy has said he will not attend the opening ceremonies in august if china does not enter into dialogue with the dalai lama in order to resolve the crisis with tibet .
france is set to take over the eu 's rotating presidency before the games begin . french , eu diplomats head to beijing bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : jin jing has become a national heroine two other high-ranking french diplomats - former french prime minister jean-pierre raffarin and sarkozy 's top diplomatic advisor jean-david levitte - are scheduled to make official visits to beijing this week . european commission president jose manuel barroso will also travel to china this week for talks on bilateral issues ranging from climate change to intellectual property .
during the talks , he 's expected to try to find balance between promoting the eu 's business interests in the quickly developing economy and appeasing calls from europe for at least a symbolic protest of china 's crackdown in tibet . barroso will raise " matters concerning human rights and freedom of expressions " while in beijing , " eu commission spokesman johannes laitenberger said on monday .

" appeal for american aid bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the eu does n't want to jeopardize economic ties to china the dalai lama on monday called on the us for help with tibet . " at this moment we need your help , " the tibetan spiritual leader told us special envoy on tibet paula dobriansky at a meeting in the us state of michigan . china criticized the meeting , the 12th of its kind between dobriansky and the dalai lama , accusing the us of interfering in its internal affairs . " the dalai lama is the only person with the influence and credibility to persuade tibetans to eschew violence and accept a genuine autonomy within china that would also preserve tibetan culture and identity , " dobriansky wrote in an editorial for monday 's washington post . the tibetan leader has consistently said he supports autonomy for tibet within china , not complete sovereignty .
on monday he also reiterated his support for the summer olympic games . protests against china 's rule over tibet began last month and beijing 's treatment of the demonstrators has led to calls for a boycott of the olympic games . dw staff -lrb- kjb -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the re-naming had been the subject of protracted legal debate , as publisher axel springer ag , which has its headquarters on kochstrasse , objected to the plan .
in 1968 , at the height of germany 's student movement , various springer publications called on readers to " eliminate the trouble-makers " and " stop the terror of the young reds . "
when dutschke was shot in the head and chest on april 11 , 1968 , his followers demonstrated outside the springer building , as they deemed the company partially responsible for the attack .
dutschke died 11 years later as a result of complications from the injuries he sustained in the 1968 shooting by a house painter with alleged right-wing sympathies .
court rules against springer lawyers for springer argued that naming a street after dutschke would signal acceptance of crimes committed by some of the leftist student revolutionaries he came to represent .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : rudi dutschke 's abandoned bicycle following his shooting on april 11 , 1968 , inspired a memorial 40 years later in the same spot the berlin-brandenburg higher administrative court , however , ruled on tuesday , april 22 , that springer 's rights were not being infringed upon by the decision to rename part of the street .
dutschke 's life and legacy were remembered earlier this month on the 40th anniversary of the shooting outside a pharmacy on kurfuerstendamm , where he had cycled to buy medicine for his baby son .
hundreds of germans honored the student leader by placing bicycles across the busy street in the western part of berlin . dw staff -lrb- dc -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the re-naming had been the subject of protracted legal debate , as publisher axel springer ag , which has its headquarters on kochstrasse , objected to the plan .
in 1968 , at the height of germany 's student movement , various springer publications called on readers to " eliminate the trouble-makers " and " stop the terror of the young reds . "
when dutschke was shot in the head and chest on april 11 , 1968 , his followers demonstrated outside the springer building , as they deemed the company partially responsible for the attack .
dutschke died 11 years later as a result of complications from the injuries he sustained in the 1968 shooting by a house painter with alleged right-wing sympathies .
court rules against springer lawyers for springer argued that naming a street after dutschke would signal acceptance of crimes committed by some of the leftist student revolutionaries he came to represent .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : rudi dutschke 's abandoned bicycle following his shooting on april 11 , 1968 , inspired a memorial 40 years later in the same spot the berlin-brandenburg higher administrative court , however , ruled on tuesday , april 22 , that springer 's rights were not being infringed upon by the decision to rename part of the street .
dutschke 's life and legacy were remembered earlier this month on the 40th anniversary of the shooting outside a pharmacy on kurfuerstendamm , where he had cycled to buy medicine for his baby son .
hundreds of germans honored the student leader by placing bicycles across the busy street in the western part of berlin . dw staff -lrb- dc -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?
dw-world.de ' 68 movement brought lasting changes to german society forty years after the assassination attempt on the leader of the 1968 student movement , rudi dutschke , germany is looking back on a time when young people demanded societal change - and went on the streets to get it .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de aviation -pipe- 22.04.2008 huge demand fuels europe-china air route expansion großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : european airlines are flying non-stop to new destinations in china european airlines are profiting from a big growing demand for air travel along china 's industrial belt .
tourist travel to europe is also expanding among a growing chinese middle class . the soaring demand for air travel from europe to china in recent years has led to a rise in the number of new and unusual routes to the middle kingdom in the run-up to the olympic games in beijing . in march , lufthansa was the first european airline to start up non-stop flights from its main hub , in frankfurt , to the eastern chinese city nanjing , and in june , the german national flag carrier will service shenyang , a growing industrial center northeast of beijing and one of the key sites for the summer olympics . lufthansa rival air berlin will introduce regular , non-stop flights to beijing and shanghai from dusseldorf in may .
meanwhile , dutch carrier klm has been offering non-stop service from amsterdam to the interior chinese city chengdu , in the mountainous hinterlands east of the himalayas , since 2006 . but it is finnair , a medium-sized european airline , that has invested the most in the asian-pacific region relative to its size .
in 1999 , the finnish carrier made the strategic decision to drop all of its north atlantic routes , except for daily flights from helsinki to new york , and shift the rest of its long-haul capacity completely to asia . asia strategy " as a small country , we could not compete with the big european airlines on north american routes .
concentrating on asia makes geographical sense for us .
the shortest route to beijing or shanghai from europe is via helsinki , " said taneli hassinen , finnair 's vice president for investor relations . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : eu companies have sites near a new air route to nanjing hassinen explained that most european flights to asia need to fly over the north pole in finnish airspace anyway , so a stopover in helsinki makes sense for passengers coming from cities or countries without an asian network , such as spain , berlin or hamburg .
the majority of its passengers traveling to asia come from other european cities through its helsinki hub , with its 25 weekly flights to china accounting for nearly 40 percent of all finnair 's asian routes . of all european carriers , lufthansa , however , is in the lead , with 58 weekly flights to china , including its two new routes to nanjing and shenyang .
more than 3,000 german firms are active in china , with exports accounting for 54 billion euros -lrb- $ 86 billion -rrb- last year , generating plenty of business travel . big european demand as with finnair , the bulk of lufthansa 's passengers to china are coming through its frankfurt and munich hubs from other destinations in germany and europe .
german chemical giant basf opened an integrated production facility in nanjing in recent years , and it 's one of many multinational companies to benefit from the new route , according to airline spokesman boris ogursky . an estimated 1,000 eu companies , including electronics giant siemens and automakers such as fiat and ford , have production sites in and around nanjing , which is linked by a network of motorways to china 's biggest commercial center in shanghai . " nanjing and shanghai form a huge industrial cluster within 270 kilometers -lrb- 170 miles -rrb- and are close enough so that passengers could easily fly into one city and out of another back to germany , giving them more flexibility , " said ogursky . lufthansa also operates daily flights to the southern chinese city of guangzhou in the pearl delta region , which is undergoing a boom that could make it the next shanghai .
altogether chinese routes accounted for 20 percent of all asia revenues , and the planes are generally filled to capacity , with average passenger loads above the asian average of 83 percent , he added . middle class traveling to europe martina noss , a travel analyst with the german bank nordlb in hanover stressed that european airlines , which are well positioned in markets with tremendous growth potential such as china and india , stand to benefit in the long term .
asian routes are also far more lucrative than the saturated north atlantic market , where intense competition means a downward pressure on airfares that cut into profit margins , she added . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : touring european castles becomes a status symbol for middle class chinese " asia is a big profitable cake , and lufthansa has a huge advantage of having established itself early in the china market and getting a big piece of it , " said noss , who added that the bread and butter of air travel are premium-paying business travelers , but that the tourist segment of the market is also expanding rapidly . " there is a growing middle class in china and india , and taking a holiday in europe is a great status symbol for them , similar to the japanese tour groups who travel through the major european capitals in 10 days , " said noss . according to estimates by european aircraft manufacturer airbus , there will be 600 million middle class chinese consumers with disposable income for european holidays by 2020 . diana fong send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

meanwhile , the tibetan spiritual leader called on the united states for help with tibet . the paris city council voted on monday , april 21 , to bestow honorary citizenship on the dalai lama without the blessing of president nicolas sarkozy 's federal government .
hu jia , a prominent human rights activist who was jailed in china earlier this month on charges of attempted subversion , was also awarded citizenship in the french capital . beijing said tuesday it was " strongly dissatisfied and resolutely opposed " to the paris city council 's decision , calling it interference in china 's internal affairs . a spokesman for sarkozy 's right-wing ump party said paris ' mayor bertrand delanoe may have been trying to boost his domestic popularity with the initiative . delanoe on monday called the dalai lama a " champion of peace " and said paris wanted " to show its support for the people of tibet who are defending their most basic right to dignity , freedom and simple life . " the honorary citizenship has turned up the heat on already simmering relations between france and china . calls to boycott french retailer carrefour 's 122 shops throughout china began on saturday and at least one location was forced to shut its doors on monday due to hefty demonstrations . china 's foreign ministry said tuesday it did not agree with " individual radical actions , " referring to unruly scenes that evolved during anti-western protests targeting the carrefour stores . " we do not agree with some individual radical actions , " foreign ministry spokeswoman jiang yu told reporters in beijing .
" we think the chinese people can express their feelings in a legal and rational way . " sarkozy writes to chinese torch-bearer bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : thousands demonstrated in front of carrefour supermarkets on saturday tension arose between the two countries two weeks ago when pro-tibet demonstrators disrupted the olympic torch relay in paris .
wheelchair-bound chinese fencer jin jing has since become a national icon after she resisted protestors who attempted to grab the torch . on a visit to shanghai on monday , french senate president christian poncelet presented her a letter from sarkozy expressing regret over the incident .
the athlete told chinese press that she was disappointed that the french president did n't explicitly apologize for the incident . sarkozy " expressed regret , shock and condemnation but no apology , " beijing reports quoted jin as saying . poncelet was also expected to hand over a letter from sarkozy to chinese president hu jintao , emphasizing the importance of bilateral relations between the two countries . sarkozy has said he will not attend the opening ceremonies in august if china does not enter into dialogue with the dalai lama in order to resolve the crisis with tibet .
france is set to take over the eu 's rotating presidency before the games begin . french , eu diplomats head to beijing bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : jin jing has become a national heroine two other high-ranking french diplomats - former french prime minister jean-pierre raffarin and sarkozy 's top diplomatic advisor jean-david levitte - are scheduled to make official visits to beijing this week . european commission president jose manuel barroso will also travel to china this week for talks on bilateral issues ranging from climate change to intellectual property .
during the talks , he 's expected to try to find balance between promoting the eu 's business interests in the quickly developing economy and appeasing calls from europe for at least a symbolic protest of china 's crackdown in tibet . barroso will raise " matters concerning human rights and freedom of expressions " while in beijing , " eu commission spokesman johannes laitenberger said on monday .
" obviously , recent events in tibet provide us with yet another reason to talk about these things . " appeal for american aid bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the eu does n't want to jeopardize economic ties to china the dalai lama on monday called on the us for help with tibet . " at this moment we need your help , " the tibetan spiritual leader told us special envoy on tibet paula dobriansky at a meeting in the us state of michigan . china criticized the meeting , the 12th of its kind between dobriansky and the dalai lama , accusing the us of interfering in its internal affairs . " the dalai lama is the only person with the influence and credibility to persuade tibetans to eschew violence and accept a genuine autonomy within china that would also preserve tibetan culture and identity , " dobriansky wrote in an editorial for monday 's washington post . the tibetan leader has consistently said he supports autonomy for tibet within china , not complete sovereignty .
on monday he also reiterated his support for the summer olympic games . protests against china 's rule over tibet began last month and beijing 's treatment of the demonstrators has led to calls for a boycott of the olympic games . dw staff -lrb- kjb -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

tourist travel to europe is also expanding among a growing chinese middle class . the soaring demand for air travel from europe to china in recent years has led to a rise in the number of new and unusual routes to the middle kingdom in the run-up to the olympic games in beijing . in march , lufthansa was the first european airline to start up non-stop flights from its main hub , in frankfurt , to the eastern chinese city nanjing , and in june , the german national flag carrier will service shenyang , a growing industrial center northeast of beijing and one of the key sites for the summer olympics . lufthansa rival air berlin will introduce regular , non-stop flights to beijing and shanghai from dusseldorf in may .
meanwhile , dutch carrier klm has been offering non-stop service from amsterdam to the interior chinese city chengdu , in the mountainous hinterlands east of the himalayas , since 2006 . but it is finnair , a medium-sized european airline , that has invested the most in the asian-pacific region relative to its size .
in 1999 , the finnish carrier made the strategic decision to drop all of its north atlantic routes , except for daily flights from helsinki to new york , and shift the rest of its long-haul capacity completely to asia . asia strategy " as a small country , we could not compete with the big european airlines on north american routes .
concentrating on asia makes geographical sense for us .
the shortest route to beijing or shanghai from europe is via helsinki , " said taneli hassinen , finnair 's vice president for investor relations . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : eu companies have sites near a new air route to nanjing hassinen explained that most european flights to asia need to fly over the north pole in finnish airspace anyway , so a stopover in helsinki makes sense for passengers coming from cities or countries without an asian network , such as spain , berlin or hamburg .
the majority of its passengers traveling to asia come from other european cities through its helsinki hub , with its 25 weekly flights to china accounting for nearly 40 percent of all finnair 's asian routes . of all european carriers , lufthansa , however , is in the lead , with 58 weekly flights to china , including its two new routes to nanjing and shenyang .
more than 3,000 german firms are active in china , with exports accounting for 54 billion euros -lrb- $ 86 billion -rrb- last year , generating plenty of business travel . big european demand as with finnair , the bulk of lufthansa 's passengers to china are coming through its frankfurt and munich hubs from other destinations in germany and europe .
german chemical giant basf opened an integrated production facility in nanjing in recent years , and it 's one of many multinational companies to benefit from the new route , according to airline spokesman boris ogursky . an estimated 1,000 eu companies , including electronics giant siemens and automakers such as fiat and ford , have production sites in and around nanjing , which is linked by a network of motorways to china 's biggest commercial center in shanghai . " nanjing and shanghai form a huge industrial cluster within 270 kilometers -lrb- 170 miles -rrb- and are close enough so that passengers could easily fly into one city and out of another back to germany , giving them more flexibility , " said ogursky . lufthansa also operates daily flights to the southern chinese city of guangzhou in the pearl delta region , which is undergoing a boom that could make it the next shanghai .
altogether chinese routes accounted for 20 percent of all asia revenues , and the planes are generally filled to capacity , with average passenger loads above the asian average of 83 percent , he added . middle class traveling to europe martina noss , a travel analyst with the german bank nordlb in hanover stressed that european airlines , which are well positioned in markets with tremendous growth potential such as china and india , stand to benefit in the long term .
asian routes are also far more lucrative than the saturated north atlantic market , where intense competition means a downward pressure on airfares that cut into profit margins , she added . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : touring european castles becomes a status symbol for middle class chinese " asia is a big profitable cake , and lufthansa has a huge advantage of having established itself early in the china market and getting a big piece of it , " said noss , who added that the bread and butter of air travel are premium-paying business travelers , but that the tourist segment of the market is also expanding rapidly . " there is a growing middle class in china and india , and taking a holiday in europe is a great status symbol for them , similar to the japanese tour groups who travel through the major european capitals in 10 days , " said noss . according to estimates by european aircraft manufacturer airbus , there will be 600 million middle class chinese consumers with disposable income for european holidays by 2020 . diana fong send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the re-naming had been the subject of protracted legal debate , as publisher axel springer ag , which has its headquarters on kochstrasse , objected to the plan .
in 1968 , at the height of germany 's student movement , various springer publications called on readers to " eliminate the trouble-makers " and " stop the terror of the young reds . "
when dutschke was shot in the head and chest on april 11 , 1968 , his followers demonstrated outside the springer building , as they deemed the company partially responsible for the attack .
dutschke died 11 years later as a result of complications from the injuries he sustained in the 1968 shooting by a house painter with alleged right-wing sympathies .
court rules against springer lawyers for springer argued that naming a street after dutschke would signal acceptance of crimes committed by some of the leftist student revolutionaries he came to represent .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : rudi dutschke 's abandoned bicycle following his shooting on april 11 , 1968 , inspired a memorial 40 years later in the same spot the berlin-brandenburg higher administrative court , however , ruled on tuesday , april 22 , that springer 's rights were not being infringed upon by the decision to rename part of the street .
dutschke 's life and legacy were remembered earlier this month on the 40th anniversary of the shooting outside a pharmacy on kurfuerstendamm , where he had cycled to buy medicine for his baby son .
hundreds of germans honored the student leader by placing bicycles across the busy street in the western part of berlin . dw staff -lrb- dc -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de aviation -pipe- 22.04.2008 huge demand fuels europe-china air route expansion großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : european airlines are flying non-stop to new destinations in china european airlines are profiting from a big growing demand for air travel along china 's industrial belt .
tourist travel to europe is also expanding among a growing chinese middle class . the soaring demand for air travel from europe to china in recent years has led to a rise in the number of new and unusual routes to the middle kingdom in the run-up to the olympic games in beijing . in march , lufthansa was the first european airline to start up non-stop flights from its main hub , in frankfurt , to the eastern chinese city nanjing , and in june , the german national flag carrier will service shenyang , a growing industrial center northeast of beijing and one of the key sites for the summer olympics . lufthansa rival air berlin will introduce regular , non-stop flights to beijing and shanghai from dusseldorf in may .
meanwhile , dutch carrier klm has been offering non-stop service from amsterdam to the interior chinese city chengdu , in the mountainous hinterlands east of the himalayas , since 2006 . but it is finnair , a medium-sized european airline , that has invested the most in the asian-pacific region relative to its size .
in 1999 , the finnish carrier made the strategic decision to drop all of its north atlantic routes , except for daily flights from helsinki to new york , and shift the rest of its long-haul capacity completely to asia . asia strategy " as a small country , we could not compete with the big european airlines on north american routes .
concentrating on asia makes geographical sense for us .
the shortest route to beijing or shanghai from europe is via helsinki , " said taneli hassinen , finnair 's vice president for investor relations . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : eu companies have sites near a new air route to nanjing hassinen explained that most european flights to asia need to fly over the north pole in finnish airspace anyway , so a stopover in helsinki makes sense for passengers coming from cities or countries without an asian network , such as spain , berlin or hamburg .
the majority of its passengers traveling to asia come from other european cities through its helsinki hub , with its 25 weekly flights to china accounting for nearly 40 percent of all finnair 's asian routes . of all european carriers , lufthansa , however , is in the lead , with 58 weekly flights to china , including its two new routes to nanjing and shenyang .
more than 3,000 german firms are active in china , with exports accounting for 54 billion euros -lrb- $ 86 billion -rrb- last year , generating plenty of business travel . big european demand as with finnair , the bulk of lufthansa 's passengers to china are coming through its frankfurt and munich hubs from other destinations in germany and europe .
german chemical giant basf opened an integrated production facility in nanjing in recent years , and it 's one of many multinational companies to benefit from the new route , according to airline spokesman boris ogursky . an estimated 1,000 eu companies , including electronics giant siemens and automakers such as fiat and ford , have production sites in and around nanjing , which is linked by a network of motorways to china 's biggest commercial center in shanghai . " nanjing and shanghai form a huge industrial cluster within 270 kilometers -lrb- 170 miles -rrb- and are close enough so that passengers could easily fly into one city and out of another back to germany , giving them more flexibility , " said ogursky . lufthansa also operates daily flights to the southern chinese city of guangzhou in the pearl delta region , which is undergoing a boom that could make it the next shanghai .
altogether chinese routes accounted for 20 percent of all asia revenues , and the planes are generally filled to capacity , with average passenger loads above the asian average of 83 percent , he added . middle class traveling to europe martina noss , a travel analyst with the german bank nordlb in hanover stressed that european airlines , which are well positioned in markets with tremendous growth potential such as china and india , stand to benefit in the long term .
asian routes are also far more lucrative than the saturated north atlantic market , where intense competition means a downward pressure on airfares that cut into profit margins , she added . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : touring european castles becomes a status symbol for middle class chinese " asia is a big profitable cake , and lufthansa has a huge advantage of having established itself early in the china market and getting a big piece of it , " said noss , who added that the bread and butter of air travel are premium-paying business travelers , but that the tourist segment of the market is also expanding rapidly . " there is a growing middle class in china and india , and taking a holiday in europe is a great status symbol for them , similar to the japanese tour groups who travel through the major european capitals in 10 days , " said noss . according to estimates by european aircraft manufacturer airbus , there will be 600 million middle class chinese consumers with disposable income for european holidays by 2020 . diana fong send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

meanwhile , france and the us are drafting a united nations resolution to put a stop to the piracy . somali pirates attempting to hijack a japanese oil tanker in the gulf of aden were thwarted in part due to the intervention of german navy frigate , the emden , which is patrolling the area as part of the international anti-terrorism operation , enduring freedom .
according to japanese shipping company nippon yusen kk , the takayam oil tanker was attacked early on monday , april 21 , by a small boat off the northern coast of somalia .
a rocket left a hole from which hundreds of gallons of fuel leaked , the ship 's operator said .
the tanker sent out a radio distress call , which was received by the emden , a german navy spokesperson said .
the frigate headed straight for the scene , sending ahead a helicopter to intercept the pirates .
by the time the helicopter arrived , the pirates had fled in their speedboat , the spokesman said , adding that the mere threat of the naval force had been enough to scare off the bandits .

meanwhile , france and the us are drafting a united nations resolution to put a stop to the piracy . somali pirates attempting to hijack a japanese oil tanker in the gulf of aden were thwarted in part due to the intervention of german navy frigate , the emden , which is patrolling the area as part of the international anti-terrorism operation , enduring freedom .
according to japanese shipping company nippon yusen kk , the takayam oil tanker was attacked early on monday , april 21 , by a small boat off the northern coast of somalia .
a rocket left a hole from which hundreds of gallons of fuel leaked , the ship 's operator said .

tourist travel to europe is also expanding among a growing chinese middle class . the soaring demand for air travel from europe to china in recent years has led to a rise in the number of new and unusual routes to the middle kingdom in the run-up to the olympic games in beijing . in march , lufthansa was the first european airline to start up non-stop flights from its main hub , in frankfurt , to the eastern chinese city nanjing , and in june , the german national flag carrier will service shenyang , a growing industrial center northeast of beijing and one of the key sites for the summer olympics . lufthansa rival air berlin will introduce regular , non-stop flights to beijing and shanghai from dusseldorf in may .
meanwhile , dutch carrier klm has been offering non-stop service from amsterdam to the interior chinese city chengdu , in the mountainous hinterlands east of the himalayas , since 2006 . but it is finnair , a medium-sized european airline , that has invested the most in the asian-pacific region relative to its size .
in 1999 , the finnish carrier made the strategic decision to drop all of its north atlantic routes , except for daily flights from helsinki to new york , and shift the rest of its long-haul capacity completely to asia . asia strategy " as a small country , we could not compete with the big european airlines on north american routes .

" nanjing and shanghai form a huge industrial cluster within 270 kilometers -lrb- 170 miles -rrb- and are close enough so that passengers could easily fly into one city and out of another back to germany , giving them more flexibility , " said ogursky . lufthansa also operates daily flights to the southern chinese city of guangzhou in the pearl delta region , which is undergoing a boom that could make it the next shanghai .
altogether chinese routes accounted for 20 percent of all asia revenues , and the planes are generally filled to capacity , with average passenger loads above the asian average of 83 percent , he added . middle class traveling to europe martina noss , a travel analyst with the german bank nordlb in hanover stressed that european airlines , which are well positioned in markets with tremendous growth potential such as china and india , stand to benefit in the long term .

but despite the dour overall outlook , a second study found germans remain fairly optimistic when it comes to their own lives . according to a study by the institute for market research commissioned by the daily leipziger volkszeitung , one out of three germans does not trust their country 's style of federalist democracy .
even fewer have faith in the system of social market economy . the study , published on tuesday , april 22 , comes on the heels of a speech by german chancellor angela merkel , calling for business leaders to shore up the economic system many say contributed to the country 's " economic miracle " after world war ii . based on responses of some 1,000 participants across the country , the study showed a regional difference in perceptions of german democracy .
in western germany , 64 percent believe democracy is operating as it should , while in the nation 's eastern states , that number is 44 percent . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany 's police got top marks in the poll faith in the german government and the political parties seems to have suffered most among the population : 38 percent believe in the german government , and only 22 percent in the parties represented in parliament . police are popular , so is love the strength of the market is a different story .
in western germany , 51 percent believe in the power of the german market economy and 43 percent think the social welfare system is up to par .
in eastern germany , those numbers are decidedly lower : 33 percent and 30 percent , respectively . the study showed that germans appear to have the most faith in their police force .
some 85 percent of those surveyed think the work police do is satisfactory .
some 62 percent are content with the justice system , and 64 percent said they find the reporting by german television acceptable . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : love still rules among many germans germans ' outlook on daily life was the subject of a survey published tuesday by the online version of der spiegel newsweekly . nearly 80 percent of all germans said they begin their day with confidence .
and over 80 percent of men and women believe in " true love , " according to the survey . the magazine 's poll looked at everything from when germans go to bed at night , to whether they sing in the car when alone or would sleep with their partner 's best friend , to how much time they take - on average - to eat breakfast in the morning . dw staff -lrb- als -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

tourist travel to europe is also expanding among a growing chinese middle class . the soaring demand for air travel from europe to china in recent years has led to a rise in the number of new and unusual routes to the middle kingdom in the run-up to the olympic games in beijing . in march , lufthansa was the first european airline to start up non-stop flights from its main hub , in frankfurt , to the eastern chinese city nanjing , and in june , the german national flag carrier will service shenyang , a growing industrial center northeast of beijing and one of the key sites for the summer olympics . lufthansa rival air berlin will introduce regular , non-stop flights to beijing and shanghai from dusseldorf in may .
meanwhile , dutch carrier klm has been offering non-stop service from amsterdam to the interior chinese city chengdu , in the mountainous hinterlands east of the himalayas , since 2006 . but it is finnair , a medium-sized european airline , that has invested the most in the asian-pacific region relative to its size .
in 1999 , the finnish carrier made the strategic decision to drop all of its north atlantic routes , except for daily flights from helsinki to new york , and shift the rest of its long-haul capacity completely to asia . asia strategy " as a small country , we could not compete with the big european airlines on north american routes .
concentrating on asia makes geographical sense for us .
the shortest route to beijing or shanghai from europe is via helsinki , " said taneli hassinen , finnair 's vice president for investor relations . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : eu companies have sites near a new air route to nanjing hassinen explained that most european flights to asia need to fly over the north pole in finnish airspace anyway , so a stopover in helsinki makes sense for passengers coming from cities or countries without an asian network , such as spain , berlin or hamburg .
the majority of its passengers traveling to asia come from other european cities through its helsinki hub , with its 25 weekly flights to china accounting for nearly 40 percent of all finnair 's asian routes . of all european carriers , lufthansa , however , is in the lead , with 58 weekly flights to china , including its two new routes to nanjing and shenyang .

german chemical giant basf opened an integrated production facility in nanjing in recent years , and it 's one of many multinational companies to benefit from the new route , according to airline spokesman boris ogursky . an estimated 1,000 eu companies , including electronics giant siemens and automakers such as fiat and ford , have production sites in and around nanjing , which is linked by a network of motorways to china 's biggest commercial center in shanghai . " nanjing and shanghai form a huge industrial cluster within 270 kilometers -lrb- 170 miles -rrb- and are close enough so that passengers could easily fly into one city and out of another back to germany , giving them more flexibility , " said ogursky . lufthansa also operates daily flights to the southern chinese city of guangzhou in the pearl delta region , which is undergoing a boom that could make it the next shanghai .
altogether chinese routes accounted for 20 percent of all asia revenues , and the planes are generally filled to capacity , with average passenger loads above the asian average of 83 percent , he added . middle class traveling to europe martina noss , a travel analyst with the german bank nordlb in hanover stressed that european airlines , which are well positioned in markets with tremendous growth potential such as china and india , stand to benefit in the long term .
asian routes are also far more lucrative than the saturated north atlantic market , where intense competition means a downward pressure on airfares that cut into profit margins , she added . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : touring european castles becomes a status symbol for middle class chinese " asia is a big profitable cake , and lufthansa has a huge advantage of having established itself early in the china market and getting a big piece of it , " said noss , who added that the bread and butter of air travel are premium-paying business travelers , but that the tourist segment of the market is also expanding rapidly . " there is a growing middle class in china and india , and taking a holiday in europe is a great status symbol for them , similar to the japanese tour groups who travel through the major european capitals in 10 days , " said noss . according to estimates by european aircraft manufacturer airbus , there will be 600 million middle class chinese consumers with disposable income for european holidays by 2020 . diana fong send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the shortest route to beijing or shanghai from europe is via helsinki , " said taneli hassinen , finnair 's vice president for investor relations . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : eu companies have sites near a new air route to nanjing hassinen explained that most european flights to asia need to fly over the north pole in finnish airspace anyway , so a stopover in helsinki makes sense for passengers coming from cities or countries without an asian network , such as spain , berlin or hamburg .
the majority of its passengers traveling to asia come from other european cities through its helsinki hub , with its 25 weekly flights to china accounting for nearly 40 percent of all finnair 's asian routes . of all european carriers , lufthansa , however , is in the lead , with 58 weekly flights to china , including its two new routes to nanjing and shenyang .
more than 3,000 german firms are active in china , with exports accounting for 54 billion euros -lrb- $ 86 billion -rrb- last year , generating plenty of business travel . big european demand as with finnair , the bulk of lufthansa 's passengers to china are coming through its frankfurt and munich hubs from other destinations in germany and europe .
german chemical giant basf opened an integrated production facility in nanjing in recent years , and it 's one of many multinational companies to benefit from the new route , according to airline spokesman boris ogursky . an estimated 1,000 eu companies , including electronics giant siemens and automakers such as fiat and ford , have production sites in and around nanjing , which is linked by a network of motorways to china 's biggest commercial center in shanghai . " nanjing and shanghai form a huge industrial cluster within 270 kilometers -lrb- 170 miles -rrb- and are close enough so that passengers could easily fly into one city and out of another back to germany , giving them more flexibility , " said ogursky . lufthansa also operates daily flights to the southern chinese city of guangzhou in the pearl delta region , which is undergoing a boom that could make it the next shanghai .
altogether chinese routes accounted for 20 percent of all asia revenues , and the planes are generally filled to capacity , with average passenger loads above the asian average of 83 percent , he added . middle class traveling to europe martina noss , a travel analyst with the german bank nordlb in hanover stressed that european airlines , which are well positioned in markets with tremendous growth potential such as china and india , stand to benefit in the long term .
asian routes are also far more lucrative than the saturated north atlantic market , where intense competition means a downward pressure on airfares that cut into profit margins , she added . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : touring european castles becomes a status symbol for middle class chinese " asia is a big profitable cake , and lufthansa has a huge advantage of having established itself early in the china market and getting a big piece of it , " said noss , who added that the bread and butter of air travel are premium-paying business travelers , but that the tourist segment of the market is also expanding rapidly . " there is a growing middle class in china and india , and taking a holiday in europe is a great status symbol for them , similar to the japanese tour groups who travel through the major european capitals in 10 days , " said noss . according to estimates by european aircraft manufacturer airbus , there will be 600 million middle class chinese consumers with disposable income for european holidays by 2020 . diana fong send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

meanwhile , france and the us are drafting a united nations resolution to put a stop to the piracy . somali pirates attempting to hijack a japanese oil tanker in the gulf of aden were thwarted in part due to the intervention of german navy frigate , the emden , which is patrolling the area as part of the international anti-terrorism operation , enduring freedom .
according to japanese shipping company nippon yusen kk , the takayam oil tanker was attacked early on monday , april 21 , by a small boat off the northern coast of somalia .
a rocket left a hole from which hundreds of gallons of fuel leaked , the ship 's operator said .
the tanker sent out a radio distress call , which was received by the emden , a german navy spokesperson said .
the frigate headed straight for the scene , sending ahead a helicopter to intercept the pirates .
by the time the helicopter arrived , the pirates had fled in their speedboat , the spokesman said , adding that the mere threat of the naval force had been enough to scare off the bandits .
somali troops storm dubai ship yemeni coastguard forces also claimed a role in helping to save the japanese tanker from somali pirates , yemen 's official news agency reported .

meanwhile , france and the us are drafting a united nations resolution to put a stop to the piracy . somali pirates attempting to hijack a japanese oil tanker in the gulf of aden were thwarted in part due to the intervention of german navy frigate , the emden , which is patrolling the area as part of the international anti-terrorism operation , enduring freedom .

the frigate headed straight for the scene , sending ahead a helicopter to intercept the pirates .

meanwhile , the tibetan spiritual leader called on the united states for help with tibet . the paris city council voted on monday , april 21 , to bestow honorary citizenship on the dalai lama without the blessing of president nicolas sarkozy 's federal government .
hu jia , a prominent human rights activist who was jailed in china earlier this month on charges of attempted subversion , was also awarded citizenship in the french capital . beijing said tuesday it was " strongly dissatisfied and resolutely opposed " to the paris city council 's decision , calling it interference in china 's internal affairs . a spokesman for sarkozy 's right-wing ump party said paris ' mayor bertrand delanoe may have been trying to boost his domestic popularity with the initiative . delanoe on monday called the dalai lama a " champion of peace " and said paris wanted " to show its support for the people of tibet who are defending their most basic right to dignity , freedom and simple life . " the honorary citizenship has turned up the heat on already simmering relations between france and china . calls to boycott french retailer carrefour 's 122 shops throughout china began on saturday and at least one location was forced to shut its doors on monday due to hefty demonstrations . china 's foreign ministry said tuesday it did not agree with " individual radical actions , " referring to unruly scenes that evolved during anti-western protests targeting the carrefour stores . " we do not agree with some individual radical actions , " foreign ministry spokeswoman jiang yu told reporters in beijing .
" we think the chinese people can express their feelings in a legal and rational way . " sarkozy writes to chinese torch-bearer bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : thousands demonstrated in front of carrefour supermarkets on saturday tension arose between the two countries two weeks ago when pro-tibet demonstrators disrupted the olympic torch relay in paris .
wheelchair-bound chinese fencer jin jing has since become a national icon after she resisted protestors who attempted to grab the torch . on a visit to shanghai on monday , french senate president christian poncelet presented her a letter from sarkozy expressing regret over the incident .
the athlete told chinese press that she was disappointed that the french president did n't explicitly apologize for the incident . sarkozy " expressed regret , shock and condemnation but no apology , " beijing reports quoted jin as saying . poncelet was also expected to hand over a letter from sarkozy to chinese president hu jintao , emphasizing the importance of bilateral relations between the two countries . sarkozy has said he will not attend the opening ceremonies in august if china does not enter into dialogue with the dalai lama in order to resolve the crisis with tibet .

during the talks , he 's expected to try to find balance between promoting the eu 's business interests in the quickly developing economy and appeasing calls from europe for at least a symbolic protest of china 's crackdown in tibet . barroso will raise " matters concerning human rights and freedom of expressions " while in beijing , " eu commission spokesman johannes laitenberger said on monday .

" the dalai lama is the only person with the influence and credibility to persuade tibetans to eschew violence and accept a genuine autonomy within china that would also preserve tibetan culture and identity , " dobriansky wrote in an editorial for monday 's washington post . the tibetan leader has consistently said he supports autonomy for tibet within china , not complete sovereignty .
on monday he also reiterated his support for the summer olympic games . protests against china 's rule over tibet began last month and beijing 's treatment of the demonstrators has led to calls for a boycott of the olympic games . dw staff -lrb- kjb -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

france is set to take over the eu 's rotating presidency before the games begin . french , eu diplomats head to beijing bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : jin jing has become a national heroine two other high-ranking french diplomats - former french prime minister jean-pierre raffarin and sarkozy 's top diplomatic advisor jean-david levitte - are scheduled to make official visits to beijing this week . european commission president jose manuel barroso will also travel to china this week for talks on bilateral issues ranging from climate change to intellectual property .
during the talks , he 's expected to try to find balance between promoting the eu 's business interests in the quickly developing economy and appeasing calls from europe for at least a symbolic protest of china 's crackdown in tibet . barroso will raise " matters concerning human rights and freedom of expressions " while in beijing , " eu commission spokesman johannes laitenberger said on monday .
" obviously , recent events in tibet provide us with yet another reason to talk about these things . " appeal for american aid bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the eu does n't want to jeopardize economic ties to china the dalai lama on monday called on the us for help with tibet . " at this moment we need your help , " the tibetan spiritual leader told us special envoy on tibet paula dobriansky at a meeting in the us state of michigan . china criticized the meeting , the 12th of its kind between dobriansky and the dalai lama , accusing the us of interfering in its internal affairs . " the dalai lama is the only person with the influence and credibility to persuade tibetans to eschew violence and accept a genuine autonomy within china that would also preserve tibetan culture and identity , " dobriansky wrote in an editorial for monday 's washington post . the tibetan leader has consistently said he supports autonomy for tibet within china , not complete sovereignty .
on monday he also reiterated his support for the summer olympic games . protests against china 's rule over tibet began last month and beijing 's treatment of the demonstrators has led to calls for a boycott of the olympic games . dw staff -lrb- kjb -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

meanwhile , the tibetan spiritual leader called on the united states for help with tibet . the paris city council voted on monday , april 21 , to bestow honorary citizenship on the dalai lama without the blessing of president nicolas sarkozy 's federal government .
hu jia , a prominent human rights activist who was jailed in china earlier this month on charges of attempted subversion , was also awarded citizenship in the french capital . beijing said tuesday it was " strongly dissatisfied and resolutely opposed " to the paris city council 's decision , calling it interference in china 's internal affairs . a spokesman for sarkozy 's right-wing ump party said paris ' mayor bertrand delanoe may have been trying to boost his domestic popularity with the initiative . delanoe on monday called the dalai lama a " champion of peace " and said paris wanted " to show its support for the people of tibet who are defending their most basic right to dignity , freedom and simple life . " the honorary citizenship has turned up the heat on already simmering relations between france and china . calls to boycott french retailer carrefour 's 122 shops throughout china began on saturday and at least one location was forced to shut its doors on monday due to hefty demonstrations . china 's foreign ministry said tuesday it did not agree with " individual radical actions , " referring to unruly scenes that evolved during anti-western protests targeting the carrefour stores . " we do not agree with some individual radical actions , " foreign ministry spokeswoman jiang yu told reporters in beijing .
" we think the chinese people can express their feelings in a legal and rational way . " sarkozy writes to chinese torch-bearer bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : thousands demonstrated in front of carrefour supermarkets on saturday tension arose between the two countries two weeks ago when pro-tibet demonstrators disrupted the olympic torch relay in paris .
wheelchair-bound chinese fencer jin jing has since become a national icon after she resisted protestors who attempted to grab the torch . on a visit to shanghai on monday , french senate president christian poncelet presented her a letter from sarkozy expressing regret over the incident .
the athlete told chinese press that she was disappointed that the french president did n't explicitly apologize for the incident . sarkozy " expressed regret , shock and condemnation but no apology , " beijing reports quoted jin as saying . poncelet was also expected to hand over a letter from sarkozy to chinese president hu jintao , emphasizing the importance of bilateral relations between the two countries . sarkozy has said he will not attend the opening ceremonies in august if china does not enter into dialogue with the dalai lama in order to resolve the crisis with tibet .
france is set to take over the eu 's rotating presidency before the games begin . french , eu diplomats head to beijing bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : jin jing has become a national heroine two other high-ranking french diplomats - former french prime minister jean-pierre raffarin and sarkozy 's top diplomatic advisor jean-david levitte - are scheduled to make official visits to beijing this week . european commission president jose manuel barroso will also travel to china this week for talks on bilateral issues ranging from climate change to intellectual property .
during the talks , he 's expected to try to find balance between promoting the eu 's business interests in the quickly developing economy and appeasing calls from europe for at least a symbolic protest of china 's crackdown in tibet . barroso will raise " matters concerning human rights and freedom of expressions " while in beijing , " eu commission spokesman johannes laitenberger said on monday .
" obviously , recent events in tibet provide us with yet another reason to talk about these things . " appeal for american aid bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the eu does n't want to jeopardize economic ties to china the dalai lama on monday called on the us for help with tibet . " at this moment we need your help , " the tibetan spiritual leader told us special envoy on tibet paula dobriansky at a meeting in the us state of michigan . china criticized the meeting , the 12th of its kind between dobriansky and the dalai lama , accusing the us of interfering in its internal affairs . " the dalai lama is the only person with the influence and credibility to persuade tibetans to eschew violence and accept a genuine autonomy within china that would also preserve tibetan culture and identity , " dobriansky wrote in an editorial for monday 's washington post . the tibetan leader has consistently said he supports autonomy for tibet within china , not complete sovereignty .
on monday he also reiterated his support for the summer olympic games . protests against china 's rule over tibet began last month and beijing 's treatment of the demonstrators has led to calls for a boycott of the olympic games . dw staff -lrb- kjb -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the re-naming had been the subject of protracted legal debate , as publisher axel springer ag , which has its headquarters on kochstrasse , objected to the plan .
in 1968 , at the height of germany 's student movement , various springer publications called on readers to " eliminate the trouble-makers " and " stop the terror of the young reds . "
when dutschke was shot in the head and chest on april 11 , 1968 , his followers demonstrated outside the springer building , as they deemed the company partially responsible for the attack .
dutschke died 11 years later as a result of complications from the injuries he sustained in the 1968 shooting by a house painter with alleged right-wing sympathies .
court rules against springer lawyers for springer argued that naming a street after dutschke would signal acceptance of crimes committed by some of the leftist student revolutionaries he came to represent .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : rudi dutschke 's abandoned bicycle following his shooting on april 11 , 1968 , inspired a memorial 40 years later in the same spot the berlin-brandenburg higher administrative court , however , ruled on tuesday , april 22 , that springer 's rights were not being infringed upon by the decision to rename part of the street .
dutschke 's life and legacy were remembered earlier this month on the 40th anniversary of the shooting outside a pharmacy on kurfuerstendamm , where he had cycled to buy medicine for his baby son .
hundreds of germans honored the student leader by placing bicycles across the busy street in the western part of berlin . dw staff -lrb- dc -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?
dw-world.de ' 68 movement brought lasting changes to german society forty years after the assassination attempt on the leader of the 1968 student movement , rudi dutschke , germany is looking back on a time when young people demanded societal change - and went on the streets to get it .

meanwhile , the tibetan spiritual leader called on the united states for help with tibet . the paris city council voted on monday , april 21 , to bestow honorary citizenship on the dalai lama without the blessing of president nicolas sarkozy 's federal government .
hu jia , a prominent human rights activist who was jailed in china earlier this month on charges of attempted subversion , was also awarded citizenship in the french capital . beijing said tuesday it was " strongly dissatisfied and resolutely opposed " to the paris city council 's decision , calling it interference in china 's internal affairs . a spokesman for sarkozy 's right-wing ump party said paris ' mayor bertrand delanoe may have been trying to boost his domestic popularity with the initiative . delanoe on monday called the dalai lama a " champion of peace " and said paris wanted " to show its support for the people of tibet who are defending their most basic right to dignity , freedom and simple life . " the honorary citizenship has turned up the heat on already simmering relations between france and china . calls to boycott french retailer carrefour 's 122 shops throughout china began on saturday and at least one location was forced to shut its doors on monday due to hefty demonstrations . china 's foreign ministry said tuesday it did not agree with " individual radical actions , " referring to unruly scenes that evolved during anti-western protests targeting the carrefour stores . " we do not agree with some individual radical actions , " foreign ministry spokeswoman jiang yu told reporters in beijing .
" we think the chinese people can express their feelings in a legal and rational way . " sarkozy writes to chinese torch-bearer bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : thousands demonstrated in front of carrefour supermarkets on saturday tension arose between the two countries two weeks ago when pro-tibet demonstrators disrupted the olympic torch relay in paris .
wheelchair-bound chinese fencer jin jing has since become a national icon after she resisted protestors who attempted to grab the torch . on a visit to shanghai on monday , french senate president christian poncelet presented her a letter from sarkozy expressing regret over the incident .
the athlete told chinese press that she was disappointed that the french president did n't explicitly apologize for the incident . sarkozy " expressed regret , shock and condemnation but no apology , " beijing reports quoted jin as saying . poncelet was also expected to hand over a letter from sarkozy to chinese president hu jintao , emphasizing the importance of bilateral relations between the two countries . sarkozy has said he will not attend the opening ceremonies in august if china does not enter into dialogue with the dalai lama in order to resolve the crisis with tibet .
france is set to take over the eu 's rotating presidency before the games begin . french , eu diplomats head to beijing bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : jin jing has become a national heroine two other high-ranking french diplomats - former french prime minister jean-pierre raffarin and sarkozy 's top diplomatic advisor jean-david levitte - are scheduled to make official visits to beijing this week . european commission president jose manuel barroso will also travel to china this week for talks on bilateral issues ranging from climate change to intellectual property .
during the talks , he 's expected to try to find balance between promoting the eu 's business interests in the quickly developing economy and appeasing calls from europe for at least a symbolic protest of china 's crackdown in tibet . barroso will raise " matters concerning human rights and freedom of expressions " while in beijing , " eu commission spokesman johannes laitenberger said on monday .
" obviously , recent events in tibet provide us with yet another reason to talk about these things . " appeal for american aid bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the eu does n't want to jeopardize economic ties to china the dalai lama on monday called on the us for help with tibet . " at this moment we need your help , " the tibetan spiritual leader told us special envoy on tibet paula dobriansky at a meeting in the us state of michigan . china criticized the meeting , the 12th of its kind between dobriansky and the dalai lama , accusing the us of interfering in its internal affairs . " the dalai lama is the only person with the influence and credibility to persuade tibetans to eschew violence and accept a genuine autonomy within china that would also preserve tibetan culture and identity , " dobriansky wrote in an editorial for monday 's washington post . the tibetan leader has consistently said he supports autonomy for tibet within china , not complete sovereignty .
on monday he also reiterated his support for the summer olympic games . protests against china 's rule over tibet began last month and beijing 's treatment of the demonstrators has led to calls for a boycott of the olympic games . dw staff -lrb- kjb -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

meanwhile , the tibetan spiritual leader called on the united states for help with tibet . the paris city council voted on monday , april 21 , to bestow honorary citizenship on the dalai lama without the blessing of president nicolas sarkozy 's federal government .
hu jia , a prominent human rights activist who was jailed in china earlier this month on charges of attempted subversion , was also awarded citizenship in the french capital . beijing said tuesday it was " strongly dissatisfied and resolutely opposed " to the paris city council 's decision , calling it interference in china 's internal affairs . a spokesman for sarkozy 's right-wing ump party said paris ' mayor bertrand delanoe may have been trying to boost his domestic popularity with the initiative . delanoe on monday called the dalai lama a " champion of peace " and said paris wanted " to show its support for the people of tibet who are defending their most basic right to dignity , freedom and simple life . " the honorary citizenship has turned up the heat on already simmering relations between france and china . calls to boycott french retailer carrefour 's 122 shops throughout china began on saturday and at least one location was forced to shut its doors on monday due to hefty demonstrations . china 's foreign ministry said tuesday it did not agree with " individual radical actions , " referring to unruly scenes that evolved during anti-western protests targeting the carrefour stores . " we do not agree with some individual radical actions , " foreign ministry spokeswoman jiang yu told reporters in beijing .
" we think the chinese people can express their feelings in a legal and rational way . " sarkozy writes to chinese torch-bearer bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : thousands demonstrated in front of carrefour supermarkets on saturday tension arose between the two countries two weeks ago when pro-tibet demonstrators disrupted the olympic torch relay in paris .
wheelchair-bound chinese fencer jin jing has since become a national icon after she resisted protestors who attempted to grab the torch . on a visit to shanghai on monday , french senate president christian poncelet presented her a letter from sarkozy expressing regret over the incident .
the athlete told chinese press that she was disappointed that the french president did n't explicitly apologize for the incident . sarkozy " expressed regret , shock and condemnation but no apology , " beijing reports quoted jin as saying . poncelet was also expected to hand over a letter from sarkozy to chinese president hu jintao , emphasizing the importance of bilateral relations between the two countries . sarkozy has said he will not attend the opening ceremonies in august if china does not enter into dialogue with the dalai lama in order to resolve the crisis with tibet .
france is set to take over the eu 's rotating presidency before the games begin . french , eu diplomats head to beijing bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : jin jing has become a national heroine two other high-ranking french diplomats - former french prime minister jean-pierre raffarin and sarkozy 's top diplomatic advisor jean-david levitte - are scheduled to make official visits to beijing this week . european commission president jose manuel barroso will also travel to china this week for talks on bilateral issues ranging from climate change to intellectual property .
during the talks , he 's expected to try to find balance between promoting the eu 's business interests in the quickly developing economy and appeasing calls from europe for at least a symbolic protest of china 's crackdown in tibet . barroso will raise " matters concerning human rights and freedom of expressions " while in beijing , " eu commission spokesman johannes laitenberger said on monday .
" obviously , recent events in tibet provide us with yet another reason to talk about these things . " appeal for american aid bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the eu does n't want to jeopardize economic ties to china the dalai lama on monday called on the us for help with tibet . " at this moment we need your help , " the tibetan spiritual leader told us special envoy on tibet paula dobriansky at a meeting in the us state of michigan . china criticized the meeting , the 12th of its kind between dobriansky and the dalai lama , accusing the us of interfering in its internal affairs . " the dalai lama is the only person with the influence and credibility to persuade tibetans to eschew violence and accept a genuine autonomy within china that would also preserve tibetan culture and identity , " dobriansky wrote in an editorial for monday 's washington post . the tibetan leader has consistently said he supports autonomy for tibet within china , not complete sovereignty .
on monday he also reiterated his support for the summer olympic games . protests against china 's rule over tibet began last month and beijing 's treatment of the demonstrators has led to calls for a boycott of the olympic games . dw staff -lrb- kjb -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the re-naming had been the subject of protracted legal debate , as publisher axel springer ag , which has its headquarters on kochstrasse , objected to the plan .
in 1968 , at the height of germany 's student movement , various springer publications called on readers to " eliminate the trouble-makers " and " stop the terror of the young reds . "
when dutschke was shot in the head and chest on april 11 , 1968 , his followers demonstrated outside the springer building , as they deemed the company partially responsible for the attack .
dutschke died 11 years later as a result of complications from the injuries he sustained in the 1968 shooting by a house painter with alleged right-wing sympathies .
court rules against springer lawyers for springer argued that naming a street after dutschke would signal acceptance of crimes committed by some of the leftist student revolutionaries he came to represent .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : rudi dutschke 's abandoned bicycle following his shooting on april 11 , 1968 , inspired a memorial 40 years later in the same spot the berlin-brandenburg higher administrative court , however , ruled on tuesday , april 22 , that springer 's rights were not being infringed upon by the decision to rename part of the street .
dutschke 's life and legacy were remembered earlier this month on the 40th anniversary of the shooting outside a pharmacy on kurfuerstendamm , where he had cycled to buy medicine for his baby son .
hundreds of germans honored the student leader by placing bicycles across the busy street in the western part of berlin . dw staff -lrb- dc -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the re-naming had been the subject of protracted legal debate , as publisher axel springer ag , which has its headquarters on kochstrasse , objected to the plan .
in 1968 , at the height of germany 's student movement , various springer publications called on readers to " eliminate the trouble-makers " and " stop the terror of the young reds . "
when dutschke was shot in the head and chest on april 11 , 1968 , his followers demonstrated outside the springer building , as they deemed the company partially responsible for the attack .
dutschke died 11 years later as a result of complications from the injuries he sustained in the 1968 shooting by a house painter with alleged right-wing sympathies .
court rules against springer lawyers for springer argued that naming a street after dutschke would signal acceptance of crimes committed by some of the leftist student revolutionaries he came to represent .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : rudi dutschke 's abandoned bicycle following his shooting on april 11 , 1968 , inspired a memorial 40 years later in the same spot the berlin-brandenburg higher administrative court , however , ruled on tuesday , april 22 , that springer 's rights were not being infringed upon by the decision to rename part of the street .
dutschke 's life and legacy were remembered earlier this month on the 40th anniversary of the shooting outside a pharmacy on kurfuerstendamm , where he had cycled to buy medicine for his baby son .
hundreds of germans honored the student leader by placing bicycles across the busy street in the western part of berlin . dw staff -lrb- dc -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" the kfw , however , had not " accepted weapons as security for its demands on the zimbabwean government " because " at the time , we were told the nature of the cargo was not precisely known , " said helbig . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : kfw helps in various development projects the legal order came too late anyway .
the chinese ship had left south africa already on friday , before a bailiff could go on board to confiscate more than 70 tons of weapons and ammunition ordered by zimbabwean president robert mugabe . the kfw did not intend to secure the cache of weapons per se , but instead wanted to exercise its legal rights to enforce repayment of a loan to zimbabwe 's state-owned iron & steel company , which had been guaranteed by the zimbabwean government , " spiegel " reported . the kfw development bank had given the iron & steel company one loan in 1998 and another in 2000 , worth more than " a two-digit million sum , " said helbig , to aid the firm in building a steelworks .
south african media reported that the sum totaled some 40 million euros -lrb- $ 64 million -rrb- . the kfw said that since iron & steel had not paid its debts , the zimbabwean government was liable for repaying the loan .
the bank had sought legal permission as early as 2006 to allow it to seize zimbabwean government assets outside zimbabwe . whereabouts of ship unknown the " an yue jiang " is thought to be carrying assault rifle ammunition , mortar rounds and rocket-propelled grenades , according to south african media . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : opposition supporter in zimbabwe it was believed to be on its way to luanda , angola , as human rights and labor groups had campaigned to stop the cargo being moved through south africa to zimbabwe . separately , zimbabwe 's opposition leader , morgan tsvangirai , on monday requested that the united nations and the african union help resolve his country 's political crisis . un secretary general ban ki-moon also called zimbabwe 's electoral commission to release the results of the march 29 presidential election without further delay .
countries around the world have responded similarly , saying that the delayed announcement of official results was impinging on democracy . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : elections were over nearly a month ago , but results are open while the opposition movement for democratic change claims that tsvangirai won last month 's election outright , president robert mugabe 's ruling zanu-pf party says neither tsvangirai nor mugabe got more than 50 percent of the vote , meaning that a run-off would be required . mugabe has been in power for nearly three decades .

the re-naming had been the subject of protracted legal debate , as publisher axel springer ag , which has its headquarters on kochstrasse , objected to the plan .
in 1968 , at the height of germany 's student movement , various springer publications called on readers to " eliminate the trouble-makers " and " stop the terror of the young reds . "
when dutschke was shot in the head and chest on april 11 , 1968 , his followers demonstrated outside the springer building , as they deemed the company partially responsible for the attack .
dutschke died 11 years later as a result of complications from the injuries he sustained in the 1968 shooting by a house painter with alleged right-wing sympathies .
court rules against springer lawyers for springer argued that naming a street after dutschke would signal acceptance of crimes committed by some of the leftist student revolutionaries he came to represent .

tourist travel to europe is also expanding among a growing chinese middle class . the soaring demand for air travel from europe to china in recent years has led to a rise in the number of new and unusual routes to the middle kingdom in the run-up to the olympic games in beijing . in march , lufthansa was the first european airline to start up non-stop flights from its main hub , in frankfurt , to the eastern chinese city nanjing , and in june , the german national flag carrier will service shenyang , a growing industrial center northeast of beijing and one of the key sites for the summer olympics . lufthansa rival air berlin will introduce regular , non-stop flights to beijing and shanghai from dusseldorf in may .
meanwhile , dutch carrier klm has been offering non-stop service from amsterdam to the interior chinese city chengdu , in the mountainous hinterlands east of the himalayas , since 2006 . but it is finnair , a medium-sized european airline , that has invested the most in the asian-pacific region relative to its size .
in 1999 , the finnish carrier made the strategic decision to drop all of its north atlantic routes , except for daily flights from helsinki to new york , and shift the rest of its long-haul capacity completely to asia . asia strategy " as a small country , we could not compete with the big european airlines on north american routes .

" nanjing and shanghai form a huge industrial cluster within 270 kilometers -lrb- 170 miles -rrb- and are close enough so that passengers could easily fly into one city and out of another back to germany , giving them more flexibility , " said ogursky . lufthansa also operates daily flights to the southern chinese city of guangzhou in the pearl delta region , which is undergoing a boom that could make it the next shanghai .

the re-naming had been the subject of protracted legal debate , as publisher axel springer ag , which has its headquarters on kochstrasse , objected to the plan .
in 1968 , at the height of germany 's student movement , various springer publications called on readers to " eliminate the trouble-makers " and " stop the terror of the young reds . "
when dutschke was shot in the head and chest on april 11 , 1968 , his followers demonstrated outside the springer building , as they deemed the company partially responsible for the attack .
dutschke died 11 years later as a result of complications from the injuries he sustained in the 1968 shooting by a house painter with alleged right-wing sympathies .
court rules against springer lawyers for springer argued that naming a street after dutschke would signal acceptance of crimes committed by some of the leftist student revolutionaries he came to represent .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : rudi dutschke 's abandoned bicycle following his shooting on april 11 , 1968 , inspired a memorial 40 years later in the same spot the berlin-brandenburg higher administrative court , however , ruled on tuesday , april 22 , that springer 's rights were not being infringed upon by the decision to rename part of the street .
dutschke 's life and legacy were remembered earlier this month on the 40th anniversary of the shooting outside a pharmacy on kurfuerstendamm , where he had cycled to buy medicine for his baby son .
hundreds of germans honored the student leader by placing bicycles across the busy street in the western part of berlin . dw staff -lrb- dc -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the athlete told chinese press that she was disappointed that the french president did n't explicitly apologize for the incident . sarkozy " expressed regret , shock and condemnation but no apology , " beijing reports quoted jin as saying . poncelet was also expected to hand over a letter from sarkozy to chinese president hu jintao , emphasizing the importance of bilateral relations between the two countries . sarkozy has said he will not attend the opening ceremonies in august if china does not enter into dialogue with the dalai lama in order to resolve the crisis with tibet .
france is set to take over the eu 's rotating presidency before the games begin . french , eu diplomats head to beijing bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : jin jing has become a national heroine two other high-ranking french diplomats - former french prime minister jean-pierre raffarin and sarkozy 's top diplomatic advisor jean-david levitte - are scheduled to make official visits to beijing this week . european commission president jose manuel barroso will also travel to china this week for talks on bilateral issues ranging from climate change to intellectual property .
during the talks , he 's expected to try to find balance between promoting the eu 's business interests in the quickly developing economy and appeasing calls from europe for at least a symbolic protest of china 's crackdown in tibet . barroso will raise " matters concerning human rights and freedom of expressions " while in beijing , " eu commission spokesman johannes laitenberger said on monday .
" obviously , recent events in tibet provide us with yet another reason to talk about these things . " appeal for american aid bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the eu does n't want to jeopardize economic ties to china the dalai lama on monday called on the us for help with tibet . " at this moment we need your help , " the tibetan spiritual leader told us special envoy on tibet paula dobriansky at a meeting in the us state of michigan . china criticized the meeting , the 12th of its kind between dobriansky and the dalai lama , accusing the us of interfering in its internal affairs . " the dalai lama is the only person with the influence and credibility to persuade tibetans to eschew violence and accept a genuine autonomy within china that would also preserve tibetan culture and identity , " dobriansky wrote in an editorial for monday 's washington post . the tibetan leader has consistently said he supports autonomy for tibet within china , not complete sovereignty .
on monday he also reiterated his support for the summer olympic games . protests against china 's rule over tibet began last month and beijing 's treatment of the demonstrators has led to calls for a boycott of the olympic games . dw staff -lrb- kjb -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

david miliband speaks to the bbc about pakistan foreign secretary david miliband has told the people of pakistan that the country 's new coalition government deserves credit for coming through the trauma of an assassination , and then being elected by genuine democracy .
it was very deliberate praise of the new and still fragile coalition .
that government is setting out on a long , hard road to demonstrate that democratic civilian rule can succeed and survive in pakistan in the face of both extremism and major economic challenges .
mr miliband , completing a two-day visit to the country , had dinner with the rivals who have come together in coalition - nawaz sharif and asif zardari .
they had been bitter enemies over many years .
mr miliband said he was humbled to sit with one on either side of him and hear them talk to each other about democracy .
terrorist presence but britain ’ s foreign secretary did not deny the immense challenges facing the new coalition .
he said there was clear evidence of a continuing al-qaeda presence on both sides of pakistan ’ s border with afghanistan .
britain supports the country 's commitment to dialogue leading to the possibility of reconciliation with those extremists who are prepared to play by the rules within pakistan 's constitution .
britain supports reconciliation with extremists who renounce violence miliband backs pakistan dialogue however , mr miliband gave a very clear warning to those in the country who argue that their army should not be used to fight against militants , including fellow pakistanis in the tribal areas bordering afghanistan .
" reconciliation , " he said , " does not mean creating a safe space for terrorists to operate . "
that reflects a fear that , to some , reconciliation could simply mean the government reaching an accommodation with extremists in return for some sort of undertaking that they will attack targets outside , not inside , the country .
the danger to britain is something mr miliband has also stressed .
there is no question that britain has a life and death interest in the long-term triumph of democracy over extremism in pakistan .
mr miliband told me that 70 % of the terrorist plots now being investigated in britain could be traced back to pakistan .
the country does have a historic opportunity to end the cycle of corrupt civilian rule punctuated by military take-overs , but the new coalition has to rise above a history of past corruption and abuses of power if it is to break that cycle .

it was very deliberate praise of the new and still fragile coalition .
that government is setting out on a long , hard road to demonstrate that democratic civilian rule can succeed and survive in pakistan in the face of both extremism and major economic challenges .
mr miliband , completing a two-day visit to the country , had dinner with the rivals who have come together in coalition - nawaz sharif and asif zardari .
they had been bitter enemies over many years .
mr miliband said he was humbled to sit with one on either side of him and hear them talk to each other about democracy .
terrorist presence but britain ’ s foreign secretary did not deny the immense challenges facing the new coalition .
he said there was clear evidence of a continuing al-qaeda presence on both sides of pakistan ’ s border with afghanistan .
britain supports the country 's commitment to dialogue leading to the possibility of reconciliation with those extremists who are prepared to play by the rules within pakistan 's constitution .
britain supports reconciliation with extremists who renounce violence miliband backs pakistan dialogue however , mr miliband gave a very clear warning to those in the country who argue that their army should not be used to fight against militants , including fellow pakistanis in the tribal areas bordering afghanistan .
" reconciliation , " he said , " does not mean creating a safe space for terrorists to operate . "
that reflects a fear that , to some , reconciliation could simply mean the government reaching an accommodation with extremists in return for some sort of undertaking that they will attack targets outside , not inside , the country .
the danger to britain is something mr miliband has also stressed .
there is no question that britain has a life and death interest in the long-term triumph of democracy over extremism in pakistan .
mr miliband told me that 70 % of the terrorist plots now being investigated in britain could be traced back to pakistan .
the country does have a historic opportunity to end the cycle of corrupt civilian rule punctuated by military take-overs , but the new coalition has to rise above a history of past corruption and abuses of power if it is to break that cycle .

generic drugs sell at a fraction of what the original cost the truth is that lawyers and the pilots of aircraft have also got big roles to play .
the pilots because when the patent on a drug made by a big pharmaceutical company expires , great cargo planes full of copies are already in the air , ready to land and in markets the following morning .
take the case of ramipril , a heart drug made by actavis as a copy of a drug developed by a big pharmaceutical company .
literally the moment the patent expired , actavis flew plane-loads of its copies into big potential markets such as germany .
" we had seven of the biggest cargo planes , antonovs , fully loaded and they went into german airspace just after midnight , " according to robert wessman , chief executive of actavis .
we usually take 90 % off the brand price robert wessman , actavis the lawyers , too , are involved in a continuing battle between the generic drug companies and the originators .
" sometimes we see that big pharma tries to extend their own patent lifetimes with patents that are not novel , " mr wessman told the bbc .
" we just sue them to get the patents invalidated when the patents are only there to delay us getting to market .
and those court cases are running all over the world . "
' tweaks ' denied patents last for 20 years , so typically a completely new drug might take 10 years of development and then 10 years of actually making money through sales .
it might cost $ 1.5bn to develop each one , compared with $ 1.5m for the copier to get the regulatory approval once the patent has expired .
glaxosmithkline defends its policy on extending patents mr wessman defends his company 's copying : " we usually take 90 % off the brand price .
so it 's only fair to the consumer that the brands are n't in there for ever . "
the big pharmaceutical companies deny just tweaking drugs to get new patents - and thus , new patent protection .
glaxosmithkline told the bbc that " product line extensions " were for the benefit of patients .
the company continually reviewed its products to improve them and the successor took time to be developed .
it has a string of drugs that are successors to products that had just gone out of patent protection : anti-depression drug paxil cr was launched in the us in 2002 -lrb- paxil went generic in 2003 -rrb- anti-depression drug wellbutrin xl was launched in 2003 -lrb- wellbutrin went generic in 2004 -rrb- heart drug coreg cr was launched in the us in 2007 , the same year that coreg went generic .
the company said the main factor determining the timing of the launching of successor drugs was the time needed to evaluate how patients reacted to the original drug and what the effects of the changes would be .
combination therapy with such a high cost of development of drugs from scratch , it is in the interest of pharmaceutical companies to keep products going .
they argue that combining existing products differently is an effective new use .
the treatment of hiv , for example , has been improved through modifying existing drugs .
glaxo says it has 96 completely new " chemical entities " in the pipeline , compared with 37 " product line extensions " so it says it 's not true that it relies on variants of existing products rather than completely original research and development .
the pressure on big pharma , though , is likely to get much greater .
advances in genetics mean that more and more drugs can be targeted at smaller and smaller groups of people , so spreading the costs over a smaller market .
and whatever they develop , the generic drug manufacturers are watching and copying and stockpiling , ready to sell at a fraction of the cost .
it might seem good for the consumer , but if the current way of making money is n't sustainable for the big companies , what replaces it ?
in truth , they do n't really know .
neither does anybody else .

the controversial system is based around small files called cookies that some computer security firms say they may label as " adware " and block .
other firms are waiting until the system is rolled out until they decide what to do with phorm cookies .
phorm said the firm was talking to security companies to explain how its system worked .
many security firms contacted by bbc news said the tools included in security programs would let computer owners stop the cookie being used .
privacy fear phorm works by watching a user 's web browsing habits and then slipping adverts related to that history onto websites that have signed up .
to target ads phorm , like many other web businesses , uses a small text file called a cookie .
so far three net firms , bt , virgin and carphone warehouse , have signed up for phorm .
carphone warehouse has said its customers will have to opt in to the system the other two will automatically enrol anyone that does not explicitly ask to be excluded .
some computer security companies contacted by the bbc say they may block the cookie that phorm uses to keep an eye on a web user 's habits .
stefan lundstrom , an anti-spyware researcher at f-secure , said it had been in discussion with phorm about how its system works .
he added that it would take a firm decision when the system goes live .
" phorm have hinted that most isp 's will choose an opt-out solution based on a cookie , " he said .
" we have expressed our concern that 's not informed consent and most likely will meet our detection criteria . "
the result would be blocking of the cookie and labelling it as adware .
simon heron , managing director of uk security firm network box , which provides security services to small businesses , said it would block the cookie initially .
mr heron acknowledged phorm 's efforts to abide by the anti-spyware coalition 's code of practice and its links with net firms but said security and privacy concerns had driven its blocking decision .
he added : " we will continue to monitor this situation but browsing information is the user 's property not the isp 's or anybody else 's . "
symantec , trend micro and mcafee said they would monitor phorm as it gets rolled out to see how the cookie is used in practice and whether users need warning about it .
in a statement symantec said : " at this point we are assessing the full implications of this technology and how it fits into the established criteria we use for categorising and classifying new technologies such as phorm 's . "
graham cluley , senior technology consultant at sophos , said because it only provided services to businesses it was unlikely to be called on to block phorm cookies .
he added that the website phorm uses to serve up targeted ads would be entered into its security database to give customers the option of blocking that .
" our aim is to give companies the power to police their users ' safe use of the web , rather than disrupt what some may consider legitimate internet traffic , " he added .
greg day , security analyst at mcafee , said it was still talking to phorm about how the ad-serving system worked .
" at this point we have not rushed to give it a classification , " he said .
its eventual classification would come down to how the system was used , added mr day .
" is the customer aware of it and do they have the choice of whether to opt in or out ? "
mr day said that the cookie could end up being blocked by many users if security programs warn them about the tiny file .
" most people do not differentiate between viruses , worms , mass mailers or trojans , " he said .
" when they see a pop up from a security vendor they will see it as a bad thing and worry about it . "
a spokesman for phorm said : " the reality of it is that the phorm cookie is a cookie like any other .
it is an inactive piece of text that 's dropped on your computer just like any other third party tracking software . "
he added that any company that blocked the phorm cookie could consider blocking cookies from other ad-serving companies , such as google , which gave users no choice to avoid being shown targeted ads .
he said phorm was talking to security companies to explain how its system worked so they could understand what it did and respect the methods it used to help people opt out .

the controversial system is based around small files called cookies that some computer security firms say they may label as " adware " and block .
other firms are waiting until the system is rolled out until they decide what to do with phorm cookies .
phorm said the firm was talking to security companies to explain how its system worked .
many security firms contacted by bbc news said the tools included in security programs would let computer owners stop the cookie being used .
privacy fear phorm works by watching a user 's web browsing habits and then slipping adverts related to that history onto websites that have signed up .
to target ads phorm , like many other web businesses , uses a small text file called a cookie .
so far three net firms , bt , virgin and carphone warehouse , have signed up for phorm .
carphone warehouse has said its customers will have to opt in to the system the other two will automatically enrol anyone that does not explicitly ask to be excluded .
some computer security companies contacted by the bbc say they may block the cookie that phorm uses to keep an eye on a web user 's habits .
stefan lundstrom , an anti-spyware researcher at f-secure , said it had been in discussion with phorm about how its system works .
he added that it would take a firm decision when the system goes live .
" phorm have hinted that most isp 's will choose an opt-out solution based on a cookie , " he said .
" we have expressed our concern that 's not informed consent and most likely will meet our detection criteria . "
security software may start warning users about the phorm cookie the result would be blocking of the cookie and labelling it as adware .
simon heron , managing director of uk security firm network box , which provides security services to small businesses , said it would block the cookie initially .
mr heron acknowledged phorm 's efforts to abide by the anti-spyware coalition 's code of practice and its links with net firms but said security and privacy concerns had driven its blocking decision .
he added : " we will continue to monitor this situation but browsing information is the user 's property not the isp 's or anybody else 's . "
symantec , trend micro and mcafee said they would monitor phorm as it gets rolled out to see how the cookie is used in practice and whether users need warning about it .
in a statement symantec said : " at this point we are assessing the full implications of this technology and how it fits into the established criteria we use for categorising and classifying new technologies such as phorm 's . "
graham cluley , senior technology consultant at sophos , said because it only provided services to businesses it was unlikely to be called on to block phorm cookies .
he added that the website phorm uses to serve up targeted ads would be entered into its security database to give customers the option of blocking that .
" our aim is to give companies the power to police their users ' safe use of the web , rather than disrupt what some may consider legitimate internet traffic , " he added .
greg day , security analyst at mcafee , said it was still talking to phorm about how the ad-serving system worked .
" at this point we have not rushed to give it a classification , " he said .
its eventual classification would come down to how the system was used , added mr day .
" is the customer aware of it and do they have the choice of whether to opt in or out ? "
mr day said that the cookie could end up being blocked by many users if security programs warn them about the tiny file .
" most people do not differentiate between viruses , worms , mass mailers or trojans , " he said .
" when they see a pop up from a security vendor they will see it as a bad thing and worry about it . "
a spokesman for phorm said : " the reality of it is that the phorm cookie is a cookie like any other .
it is an inactive piece of text that 's dropped on your computer just like any other third party tracking software . "
he added that any company that blocked the phorm cookie could consider blocking cookies from other ad-serving companies , such as google , which gave users no choice to avoid being shown targeted ads .

the controversial system is based around small files called cookies that some computer security firms say they may label as " adware " and block .
other firms are waiting until the system is rolled out until they decide what to do with phorm cookies .
phorm said the firm was talking to security companies to explain how its system worked .
many security firms contacted by bbc news said the tools included in security programs would let computer owners stop the cookie being used .
privacy fear phorm works by watching a user 's web browsing habits and then slipping adverts related to that history onto websites that have signed up .
to target ads phorm , like many other web businesses , uses a small text file called a cookie .
so far three net firms , bt , virgin and carphone warehouse , have signed up for phorm .
carphone warehouse has said its customers will have to opt in to the system the other two will automatically enrol anyone that does not explicitly ask to be excluded .
some computer security companies contacted by the bbc say they may block the cookie that phorm uses to keep an eye on a web user 's habits .
stefan lundstrom , an anti-spyware researcher at f-secure , said it had been in discussion with phorm about how its system works .
he added that it would take a firm decision when the system goes live .
" phorm have hinted that most isp 's will choose an opt-out solution based on a cookie , " he said .
" we have expressed our concern that 's not informed consent and most likely will meet our detection criteria . "
security software may start warning users about the phorm cookie the result would be blocking of the cookie and labelling it as adware .
simon heron , managing director of uk security firm network box , which provides security services to small businesses , said it would block the cookie initially .
mr heron acknowledged phorm 's efforts to abide by the anti-spyware coalition 's code of practice and its links with net firms but said security and privacy concerns had driven its blocking decision .
he added : " we will continue to monitor this situation but browsing information is the user 's property not the isp 's or anybody else 's . "
symantec , trend micro and mcafee said they would monitor phorm as it gets rolled out to see how the cookie is used in practice and whether users need warning about it .
in a statement symantec said : " at this point we are assessing the full implications of this technology and how it fits into the established criteria we use for categorising and classifying new technologies such as phorm 's . "
graham cluley , senior technology consultant at sophos , said because it only provided services to businesses it was unlikely to be called on to block phorm cookies .
he added that the website phorm uses to serve up targeted ads would be entered into its security database to give customers the option of blocking that .
" our aim is to give companies the power to police their users ' safe use of the web , rather than disrupt what some may consider legitimate internet traffic , " he added .
greg day , security analyst at mcafee , said it was still talking to phorm about how the ad-serving system worked .
" at this point we have not rushed to give it a classification , " he said .
its eventual classification would come down to how the system was used , added mr day .
" is the customer aware of it and do they have the choice of whether to opt in or out ? "
mr day said that the cookie could end up being blocked by many users if security programs warn them about the tiny file .
" most people do not differentiate between viruses , worms , mass mailers or trojans , " he said .
" when they see a pop up from a security vendor they will see it as a bad thing and worry about it . "
a spokesman for phorm said : " the reality of it is that the phorm cookie is a cookie like any other .
it is an inactive piece of text that 's dropped on your computer just like any other third party tracking software . "
he added that any company that blocked the phorm cookie could consider blocking cookies from other ad-serving companies , such as google , which gave users no choice to avoid being shown targeted ads .
he said phorm was talking to security companies to explain how its system worked so they could understand what it did and respect the methods it used to help people opt out .

engineers at isis , a technology transfer spin-out company of the university of oxford , have found a way of creating antennas which can work in three " planes " but that are small enough to fit in hand-held devices .
existing antennas for consumer electronics only track a signal as it moves from side to side between its origin and the receiving unit , but the isis antennas will allow for up and down signal motion to be detected as well .
" there is a requirement - and demand - to make these antennas compact enough to allow you to basically emit and transmit in three dimensions , " rakesh roshan , one of the isis engineers , told bbc world service 's digital planet programme .
" basically you to slap it on the back of a mobile phone , or laptop , and you can gain the critical advantage of saving space and making it more efficient , " he added .
proper signal the antennas have three different " elements " included to track all three polarisations of electromagnetic waves .
fundamentally this gives the device much greater capacity .
what our technology can offer is a 33 percent gain in efficiency rakesh roshan " imagine three different elements printed on the antenna - depending on how you want to use it , you can use all three independently , or use them to carry combined information , " mr roshan said .
" so you can use them to have either a more robust link or a more reliable one . "
this means that the user can choose whether to put the extra capacity into boosting the signal range , having lower battery use , or acquiring more data .
" if you see people in a cluttered environment , when they use their phones they have to rush out to get a proper signal , " mr roshan " sometimes they have to nearly jump out the window to get a signal .
" so i think what our technology can offer is a 33 % gain in efficiency - meaning you do n't need to rush out .
in a cluttered environment you can receive those signals , so no more jumping out of the window . "
he also explained that what has made the isis " compact dielectric antenna systems " - as the technology is known - attractive to industry is that it uses existing materials and can be quickly brought to market .
" it uses the current materials and plugs into the current infrastructure , so you do n't have to do anything different , " he said .
" this is what makes this particular invention very attractive to the commercial partners . "

what our technology can offer is a 33 percent gain in efficiency rakesh roshan " imagine three different elements printed on the antenna - depending on how you want to use it , you can use all three independently , or use them to carry combined information , " mr roshan said .
" so you can use them to have either a more robust link or a more reliable one . "
this means that the user can choose whether to put the extra capacity into boosting the signal range , having lower battery use , or acquiring more data .

engineers at isis , a technology transfer spin-out company of the university of oxford , have found a way of creating antennas which can work in three " planes " but that are small enough to fit in hand-held devices .
existing antennas for consumer electronics only track a signal as it moves from side to side between its origin and the receiving unit , but the isis antennas will allow for up and down signal motion to be detected as well .
" there is a requirement - and demand - to make these antennas compact enough to allow you to basically emit and transmit in three dimensions , " rakesh roshan , one of the isis engineers , told bbc world service 's digital planet programme .
" basically you to slap it on the back of a mobile phone , or laptop , and you can gain the critical advantage of saving space and making it more efficient , " he added .
proper signal the antennas have three different " elements " included to track all three polarisations of electromagnetic waves .
fundamentally this gives the device much greater capacity .
what our technology can offer is a 33 percent gain in efficiency rakesh roshan " imagine three different elements printed on the antenna - depending on how you want to use it , you can use all three independently , or use them to carry combined information , " mr roshan said .
" so you can use them to have either a more robust link or a more reliable one . "
this means that the user can choose whether to put the extra capacity into boosting the signal range , having lower battery use , or acquiring more data .
" if you see people in a cluttered environment , when they use their phones they have to rush out to get a proper signal , " mr roshan " sometimes they have to nearly jump out the window to get a signal .
" so i think what our technology can offer is a 33 % gain in efficiency - meaning you do n't need to rush out .
in a cluttered environment you can receive those signals , so no more jumping out of the window . "
he also explained that what has made the isis " compact dielectric antenna systems " - as the technology is known - attractive to industry is that it uses existing materials and can be quickly brought to market .
" it uses the current materials and plugs into the current infrastructure , so you do n't have to do anything different , " he said .

the 49-year-old singer sought permission from malawi 's high court to put the hearing back as she had to travel to the us to promote her album .
a court official told reuters the final hearing would now be 15 may " unless her lawyers ask for another date " .

milo ventimiglia opens up about kissing fergie , winning a bafta and the new series of heroes as care nurse peter petrelli in futuristic tv drama heroes , he was persuaded he needed to " save the cheerleader " to protect the future of the planet .
the show has gained critical acclaim - and a bafta television award in london on sunday - for its portrayal of a group of people with special powers , giving them the chance to fly , time-travel or vanish , for instance .
ventimiglia 's character is a little different from the rest , however , as initially he has no powers of his own .
his talent is to absorb others ' abilities by standing beside them , and the first series saw peter petrelli coming to terms with the havoc this could cause .
the end of series one brought the conclusion of his mission involving cheerleader claire bennet , played by hayden panettiere .
ventimiglia has also appeared in tv shows law and order and csi and when series two begins on bbc two on thursday , uk viewers will see the resolution of a cliffhanger dictating his character 's own future .
ventimiglia , who has appeared in tv hits such as the gilmore girls and films including rocky balboa , admits heroes has been very different to his other work to date .
" i definitely see the fun that we get to play with in blurring the line of reality , " he says .
" the mix of the human struggle with the world of the fantastic , coupled and combined and meshed together , lends itself to a greater ride than some very standard , straightforward types of shows - not to take away from any of them . "
he says he still remembers the moment when he was first approached to appear in the drama , which has also been a big hit for us network nbc .
heroes focuses on characters who are coming to terms with special abilities " i was in philadelphia working on rocky balboa and i got a phone call from a director friend of mine named david semel , who i 'd worked on american dreams with .
" he said : ' listen , i 'm doing this show .
i 'm doing this pilot , it 's called heroes - it 's great .
i 've seen everybody for this one role .
we do n't like anybody .
you are it . '
" i read it and was just blown away .
i got out of my contract with warner bros , jumped on to heroes , and was very fortunate that they were as excited about me as i was of them . "
ventimiglia believes sunday 's victory at the baftas , in the only category dedicated to non uk-material , " carries a lot of weight and is of great significance to our show , to me , to anybody " .
" you look at the community of awards shows and associations that garner respect and you think about the baftas ; the golden globes ; the hollywood foreign press ; the academy of motion pictures , arts and sciences .
" all of them are right on the same tier , so to win a bafta is just as prestigious , if not more , as winning any of the others . "
who would n't want to sit around wearing tattoos making out with fergie milo ventimiglia on his video with the black eyed peas singer -lrb- pictured -rrb- he stresses that egos have remained in check behind the scenes of heroes , despite the large cast .
asked which actor has the biggest backstage trailer , he replies : " we all have the same .
" there 's a lot of talk at times about who carries the weight of the show , and i think the responsibility falls on all of us .
" i think as long as we remind each other that we 're all in it together , and it is a group effort , and not one of us is more important than the other , then hopefully the working situation will be as successful as the show . "
ventimiglia broke away from the ensemble briefly last year to appear in the video for big girls do n't cry , a single by black eyed peas star fergie .
" who would n't want to sit around wearing tattoos making out with fergie , " he wonders when asked why he took on the role of a drug-dealing boyfriend with extensive body art .
" it was great fun .
it was an opportunity as an actor to try and do something a little different .
ventimiglia appeared with co-star adrian pasdar -lrb- right -rrb- at the tv baftas " people would look at me and wonder , ' wow , do you really have all of those tattoos , and is that a real ponytail , and are you a drug dealer ? '
" it was fun to strap on a different character . "
and while ventimiglia is in his most high-profile project to date , he seems to realise that the future could seem him branching out into any number of roles in film , on tv , or even in the music industry .
the state of his career is something he is " very happy with " , he says , adding that on turning 30 last july , " i did n't quite feel like i 'd reached a peak " .
" i think at 63 is when i 'm really going to hit a stride , " he adds with a smile .

the show has gained critical acclaim - and a bafta television award in london on sunday - for its portrayal of a group of people with special powers , giving them the chance to fly , time-travel or vanish , for instance .

as care nurse peter petrelli in futuristic tv drama heroes , he was persuaded he needed to " save the cheerleader " to protect the future of the planet .
the show has gained critical acclaim - and a bafta television award in london on sunday - for its portrayal of a group of people with special powers , giving them the chance to fly , time-travel or vanish , for instance .
ventimiglia 's character is a little different from the rest , however , as initially he has no powers of his own .
his talent is to absorb others ' abilities by standing beside them , and the first series saw peter petrelli coming to terms with the havoc this could cause .
the end of series one brought the conclusion of his mission involving cheerleader claire bennet , played by hayden panettiere .
and when series two begins on bbc two on thursday , uk viewers will see the resolution of a cliffhanger dictating his character 's own future .
ventimiglia , who has appeared in tv hits such as the gilmore girls and films including rocky balboa , admits heroes has been very different to his other work to date .
" i definitely see the fun that we get to play with in blurring the line of reality , " he says .
" the mix of the human struggle with the world of the fantastic , coupled and combined and meshed together , lends itself to a greater ride than some very standard , straightforward types of shows - not to take away from any of them . "
he says he still remembers the moment when he was first approached to appear in the drama , which has also been a big hit for us network nbc .
" i was in philadelphia working on rocky balboa and i got a phone call from a director friend of mine named david semel , who i 'd worked on american dreams with .
" he said : ' listen , i 'm doing this show .
i 'm doing this pilot , it 's called heroes - it 's great .
i 've seen everybody for this one role .
we do n't like anybody .
you are it . '
" i read it and was just blown away .
i got out of my contract with warner bros , jumped on to heroes , and was very fortunate that they were as excited about me as i was of them . "

these mahalla residents blame poverty and heavy-handed policing for the riots .
amani mohammed , 35 , banana seller it was not a demonstration .
people are poor , very poor , they were just expressing their anger over the rising price of food .
one kilo of rice now costs four egyptian pounds -lrb- $ 0.74 -rrb- and pasta costs five pounds -lrb- $ 0.92 -rrb- .
we ca n't live like that .
it all started when the police suddenly appeared on the streets and in the market , pointing their guns at us .
a woman got jumpy and started screaming : " why are you here ?
are you going to start a war ?
are n't we poor and helpless enough ?
do you want to kill us too ? "
the police started shooting rubber bullets at everyone , mainly at women and children .
people were running everywhere , it was like a war .
god help us .
what can we do ?
i buy the bananas for 2.5 egyptian pounds -lrb- $ 0.46 -rrb- i sell them for 3.3 egyptian pounds -lrb- $ 0.61 -rrb- .
i know it is expensive , but what can i do ?
life is expensive , i can barely afford to keep myself and my daughter .
we live on fried potatoes , but even this is becoming difficult because oil is so expensive .
hashma saleh , 40 , nurse they fired bullets at us , i got one in my leg and one in my chest .
89 i could n't breathe from the tear gas canisters they threw at us as well .
i was shot as i was coming back from work at night .

we are experienced in holding peaceful , well-organised strikes .
for example , when the prime minister came afterwards and gave us a bonus of one month 's salary , that was n't what we asked for , or what we wanted .
we want whole scale pay reform .
salaries are miserable compared to living expenses - and this has to change .
the cost of food and housing has risen so much .
all living costs have gone up .
lack of transport is also a big problem ; workers can queue for hours waiting for a bus to take them to work .

the action plan aims to improve services in health , social services and education - and expand into areas of housing , leisure and general society .
the assembly government has pledged £ 1.8m for the programme 's first year .
an estimated 30,000 in wales are affected - directly or indirectly - by the learning disability .
details of the autistic spectrum disorder -lrb- asd -rrb- strategic action plan is to be launched later at the third wales international autism conference organised by autism cymru in cardiff .
hugh morgan , chief executive of autism cymru , will lead the development of needs and services over the next year , which have to be undertaken by every council in wales .
what is autism ?
autism is a developmental disability that affects the way a person communicates and interacts with other people people with autism can not relate to others in a meaningful way .
they also have trouble making sense of the world at large as a result , their ability to develop friendships is impaired they also have a limited capacity to understand other people 's feelings autism is often also associated with learning disabilities nobody knows what causes autism , although genetic factors are likely to play a crucial role source : bbc health online the assembly government says it has identified funding for the next three years .
announcing the action plan , deputy minister for social services , gwenda thomas , said : " an increasing number of people are being diagnosed with autism in wales and there is a need to improve the provision that is available for children , young people and adults with asd . "
education minister jane hutt added : " we need to ensure that practitioners are able to recognise where young people are having difficulties and are able to support them so that they fulfil their potential .
simon and nicola davies , from llanelli , whose eight-year-old son robbie is autistic , said they hoped the scheme would provide better help for families and carers .
" it 's difficult for any parent , " said mrs davies , who is a teacher and also has a five year old daughter .
' unpredictable ' " for us , robbie is severely autistic .
he 's non-verbal , he 's not yet toilet trained , he 's got poor co-ordination , he 's got sensory processing difficulties and he 's got a touch of adhd -lsb- attention deficit hyperactivity disorder -rsb- , which means that you have to be alert 24 hours a day seven days a week .
" he needs one-to-one attention all the time he 's awake because his behaviour 's so unpredictable . "
she added : " it makes family life very difficult indeed because he takes up so much of our time . "
ms thomas said she believed the new plan would help robbie and his family .
" hopefully it will deliver better services and it will follow robbie 's life pattern and this is exceedingly important through childhood through young adulthood to adulthood , " she said .
mr morgan added : " i think that certainly over the first year what we have to do is for the circumstances of robbie and his family and the many thousands affected by autism wherever they should live within wales .
" we have to first identify far more effectively than we 're doing now what their needs are .
" we need to identify the range of support that they 're going to require from now and on a long-lasting basis . "

what is autism ?
autism is a developmental disability that affects the way a person communicates and interacts with other people people with autism can not relate to others in a meaningful way .
they also have trouble making sense of the world at large as a result , their ability to develop friendships is impaired they also have a limited capacity to understand other people 's feelings autism is often also associated with learning disabilities nobody knows what causes autism , although genetic factors are likely to play a crucial role source : bbc health online the assembly government says it has identified funding for the next three years .
announcing the action plan , deputy minister for social services , gwenda thomas , said : " an increasing number of people are being diagnosed with autism in wales and there is a need to improve the provision that is available for children , young people and adults with asd . "
education minister jane hutt added : " we need to ensure that practitioners are able to recognise where young people are having difficulties and are able to support them so that they fulfil their potential .
simon and nicola davies , from llanelli , whose eight-year-old son robbie is autistic , said they hoped the scheme would provide better help for families and carers .
" it 's difficult for any parent , " said mrs davies , who is a teacher and also has a five year old daughter .
' unpredictable ' " for us , robbie is severely autistic .
he 's non-verbal , he 's not yet toilet trained , he 's got poor co-ordination , he 's got sensory processing difficulties and he 's got a touch of adhd -lsb- attention deficit hyperactivity disorder -rsb- , which means that you have to be alert 24 hours a day seven days a week .
" he needs one-to-one attention all the time he 's awake because his behaviour 's so unpredictable . "
she added : " it makes family life very difficult indeed because he takes up so much of our time . "
ms thomas said she believed the new plan would help robbie and his family .
" hopefully it will deliver better services and it will follow robbie 's life pattern and this is exceedingly important through childhood through young adulthood to adulthood , " she said .
mr morgan added : " i think that certainly over the first year what we have to do is for the circumstances of robbie and his family and the many thousands affected by autism wherever they should live within wales .
" we have to first identify far more effectively than we 're doing now what their needs are .
" we need to identify the range of support that they 're going to require from now and on a long-lasting basis . "

the royal society for the protection of birds -lrb- rspb -rrb- said birds were being killed in the north york moors and the yorkshire dales .
the charity said it blamed gamekeepers and people who shoot for sport for " wiping out iconic species " .
a campaign has been started to try to protect birds of prey .
the peak district and country estates were also reported as areas where high numbers of birds are being killed .
' callous few ' according to the charity , those species most are risk are eagles , peregrine falcons and hen harriers , which nest in upland areas which are prime sites for grouse shooting .
rspb conservation director dr mark avery said : " visitors to the peak district , the yorkshire dales and the north york moors national parks would rightly expect to see a diversity of birds of prey , but our initial evidence shows these birds are being targeted before the birds can establish themselves .
" the skies are owned by no one , but a callous few want to deprive the nation of some of our most charismatic wildlife .
" this year we are calling on upland shooting estates to allow birds of prey to nest successfully . "
dorothy fairburn , from the country landowners ' association , said she shared the rspb 's concerns but questioned the accuracy of the numbers .
she said : " areas of grouse moors are particularly good for upland waders and lots of other birds and so they get much more interest taken in them by rspb members . "

the royal society for the protection of birds -lrb- rspb -rrb- said birds were being killed in the north york moors and the yorkshire dales .
the charity said it blamed gamekeepers and people who shoot for sport for " wiping out iconic species " .
a campaign has been started to try to protect birds of prey .
the peak district and country estates were also reported as areas where high numbers of birds are being killed .
' callous few ' according to the charity , those species most are risk are eagles , peregrine falcons and hen harriers , which nest in upland areas which are prime sites for grouse shooting .
rspb conservation director dr mark avery said : " visitors to the peak district , the yorkshire dales and the north york moors national parks would rightly expect to see a diversity of birds of prey , but our initial evidence shows these birds are being targeted before the birds can establish themselves .
" the skies are owned by no one , but a callous few want to deprive the nation of some of our most charismatic wildlife .
" this year we are calling on upland shooting estates to allow birds of prey to nest successfully . "
dorothy fairburn , from the country landowners ' association , said she shared the rspb 's concerns but questioned the accuracy of the numbers .
she said : " areas of grouse moors are particularly good for upland waders and lots of other birds and so they get much more interest taken in them by rspb members . "

speaking at the un in new york , bolivian president evo morales said the development of biofuels harmed the world 's most impoverished people .
and president alan garcia of peru said using land for biofuels was putting food out of reach for the poor .
meanwhile uk prime minister gordon brown is hosting a meeting to discuss european policy encouraging biofuels .
ahead of the meeting , mr brown said that the uk should be " more selective in our support " for biofuels , which convert cereals into fuel .
campaigners say providing a renewable alternative for conventional fuels could help stop global warming .
tackling hunger is a moral challenge to each of us and it is also a threat to the political and economic stability of nations gordon brown pm urges food price action send us your comments but as food prices climb worldwide , there is a fear that development of biofuels could reduce the production of badly-needed basic foodstuffs .
ethanol production is on course to account for some 30 % of the us maize crop by 2010 , dramatically curtailing the amount of land available for food crops .
the eu has meanwhile come under criticism for its target of getting 10 % of road transport fuel from crops by 2020 .
the head of the un world food programme and the chief of the african development bank chief are among those attending the london meeting .
bio-ethanol project opening a un forum on the global impact of climate change on indigenous peoples , mr morales said that capitalism should be scrapped if the planet is to be saved from the effects of climate change .

south americans warn over biofuels bolivia 's left-wing president said unbridled industrial development was responsible for the pillaging of natural resources .
but , he said , " some south american presidents who were talking about biofuels but did not understand what they were talking about " .
the bbc 's daniel schweimler says this is a clear reference to brazilian president luiz inacio lula da silva , who says his country has enough land to grow food crops as well as plants to produce biofuels .
last week , he rejected allegations that biofuels were responsible for the recent rise in global food prices .
and on monday , brazil announced a major joint venture in ghana to grow sugar cane for bio-ethanol .
" in ghana we are developing a project that will result in growing 27,000 hectares -lrb- of sugar cane -rrb- for the production of 150 million litres of ethanol per year that are destined for the swedish market , " said president lula , who was in accra for the occasion .
industrialised countries want to use a higher percentage of biofuels for his part , peru 's president garcia said the demand for biofuels was putting world food production under threat .
just over 40 % of peruvians - some 12 million people - live below the poverty line and have been hit hard by the soaring cost of basic foodstuffs .
the global prices of wheat , rice and maize have nearly doubled in the past year , while milk and meat have more than doubled in price in some countries .
such rises , combined with high oil prices , are causing increasing political instability in less developed countries across the world .
food riots earlier this month in haiti , which is highly reliant on imports of food and fuel , led to the deaths of at least six people , including a un peacekeeper .
there has also been unrest in burkina faso , cameroon , egypt , indonesia , ivory coast , mauritania , mozambique and senegal .

mr mwanawasa said the tension in zimbabwe , following last month 's disputed elections , should not be allowed to escalate further .
zimbabwe 's justice minister said it was their right to defend themselves and buy weapons from any legitimate source .
the ship has already been turned away from south africa and mozambique .
the chinese vessel was said to be bound for angola but the us is reported to be pressuring port authorities there and in namibia not to allow them to dock .
even people who have died of natural causes are adopted by the mdc-t patrick chinamasa zimbabwe justice minister " i hope this will be the case with all the countries because we do n't want a situation which will escalate the -lsb- tension -rsb- in zimbabwe more than what it is , " said mr mwanawasa .
the international transport workers federation says it has asked its members across africa not to help unload the an yue jiang , which is reportedly carrying three million rounds of ammunition , 1,500 rocket-propelled grenades and 2,500 mortar rounds .
the opposition says the weapons could be used to " wage war " on its supporters ahead of a possible run-off in the presidential vote .
this is strongly denied by the government , which has accused the opposition of exaggerating claims of recent political violence .
monitored the ship , which had been anchored off the port of durban for four days , was forced to move on friday after a south african court refused to allow the weapons on board to be transported across the country to landlocked zimbabwe .
despite reports the ship was heading for angola , an ally of zimbabwe 's government , director of the institute of angolan ports filomeno mendonca said the vessel had not asked for permission to dock in angola .
" this ship has not sought request to enter angolan territorial waters and it 's not authorised to enter angolan ports , " he told local radio .
a south african military spokesman has said the ship was no longer in south african waters .
south african defence ministry spokesperson themba gadebe was speaking in response to a claim that the ship remained in the country 's jurisdiction despite last week 's court order .
the southern africa litigation centre -lrb- salc -rrb- , which took the matter to court , had asked the south african navy to intervene .
mr gadebe said the ship was being monitored but declined to say where it was , except that it was off south africa 's west coast .
zimbabwe 's justice minister patrick chinamasa said it was their right to defend themselves and buy weapons from any legitimate source .
" i do n't understand all this hullabaloo about a lone ship , " he told reporters .
the country has yet to publish the results of its presidential election , which the opposition movement for democratic change -lrb- mdc -rrb- says was won outright by its candidate morgan tsvangirai .
' torture camps ' meanwhile , the southern african regional body , sadc , has rejected mr tsvangirai 's calls for south africa 's thabo mbeki to be replaced as the chief mediator for zimbabwe .
" we have complete faith in president mbeki , " the afp news agency quotes mauritius prime minister navin ramgoolam as saying .
mr tsvangirai has wanted president mwanawasa to take over , with some opposition supporters saying mr mbeki was close to mr mugabe .
a recount in 23 out of 210 parliamentary seats , which had been due to end on monday , was delayed for an unknown period .
the mdc has rejected the recount as illegal and insists it beat president robert mugabe 's zanu-pf party outright in the 29 march presidential and parliamentary polls .
