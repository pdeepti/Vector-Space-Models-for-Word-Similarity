some mediterranean regions already receive 20 percent less rain than a century ago , the report said , increasing the risk of forest fires and the desertification of the region .
the report labelled glacier retreat in europe a double-edged sword , projecting an overall increase in river floods across europe , but also an increase in river droughts in the south .
" uncertainty in the rate of melting of greenland 's outlet glaciers makes projections of future sea level rise uncertain , " the report said , adding that according to satellite observations the global sea level had risen by as much as 3.1 mm a year in the past 15 years .
europe a global warming hot spot bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : europe is set to struggle under increasing temperatures caused by global warming the report highlighted the widespread vulnerability of europe to global warming-induced climate change , with mountainous regions , coastal zones , the mediterranean and the arctic set to shoulder the lion 's share of the environmental burden .
" global average temperature has increased almost 0.8 of a degree above pre-industrial levels , with even higher temperature increases in europe and northern latitudes , " the report said .
europe has warmed by 1 degree .
the report 's authors said mitigation and adaptation measures against climate change needed to be more widespread in europe and that today 's efforts focus only on flood management and defense .
they also recommended the creation of a european clearing house on climate change impacts , vulnerability and adaptation to make climate change data widely available . dw staff -lrb- dm -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

some mediterranean regions already receive 20 percent less rain than a century ago , the report said , increasing the risk of forest fires and the desertification of the region .
the report labelled glacier retreat in europe a double-edged sword , projecting an overall increase in river floods across europe , but also an increase in river droughts in the south .
" uncertainty in the rate of melting of greenland 's outlet glaciers makes projections of future sea level rise uncertain , " the report said , adding that according to satellite observations the global sea level had risen by as much as 3.1 mm a year in the past 15 years .
europe a global warming hot spot bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : europe is set to struggle under increasing temperatures caused by global warming the report highlighted the widespread vulnerability of europe to global warming-induced climate change , with mountainous regions , coastal zones , the mediterranean and the arctic set to shoulder the lion 's share of the environmental burden .
" global average temperature has increased almost 0.8 of a degree above pre-industrial levels , with even higher temperature increases in europe and northern latitudes , " the report said .
europe has warmed by 1 degree .
the report 's authors said mitigation and adaptation measures against climate change needed to be more widespread in europe and that today 's efforts focus only on flood management and defense .
they also recommended the creation of a european clearing house on climate change impacts , vulnerability and adaptation to make climate change data widely available . dw staff -lrb- dm -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de elections -pipe- 29.09.2008 bavarian conservatives lose state majority in damaging defeat großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : beckstein suffered defeat on what was described as a " black day " for conservatives bavaria 's christian social union -lrb- csu -rrb- lost its decades-old absolute majority as voters defected to smaller parties in a state election seen as a test of support ahead of national polls next year . computer projections showed a swing of more than 17 percentage points away from the sister party of chancellor angela merkel 's christian democrats -lrb- cdu -rrb- , forcing it to look for a coalition partner .
the csu polled 43.4 percent of the vote on sunday , sept .
28 , in its worst showing in half a century .
the center-left social democrats -lrb- spd -rrb- , which govern in a grand coalition with merkel 's party in berlin , polled 18.6 percent , a decline of 1 percentage point from the last state election in 2003 . csu secretary general christine haderthauer said the disastrous result was a black day for the party , which had ruled unchallenged for more than 40 years .
in the last state elections in 2003 , the csu polled 60.7 percent of the vote in the strongly catholic state , where some of germany 's leading companies have their headquarters , including siemens and bmw .
the party 's stated intent had been to retain its absolute majority in the 180-seat parliament in munich .
" we have clearly failed to achieve our goal , " haderthauer said .
beckstein refuses to shoulder the blame bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : beckstein and huber will face an inquest into the defeat state prime minister guenther beckstein , who was elected last year after longtime leader edmund stoiber was toppled in a party revolt , ruled out stepping down to take responsibility for the poor showing .
" the people have shown that they want a csu-led government , but that they do not want the csu to govern bavaria alone , " he said , adding that the party would immediately start to look for a coalition partner .
the most likely contenders are the liberal free democrats -lrb- fdp -rrb- , who polled 8 percent of the vote to enter parliament after an absence of 14 years .
the liberals are eyeing a coalition with the cdu at the national level next year , but shifting alliances in the party landscape could make a wider alliance possible .
another possibility is the free voters , a conservative party that will make its parliamentary debut after winning 10.2 percent on a platform seeking greater local power .
the environmentalist greens won 9.4 percent , but the pro-labor left party at 4.3 percent failed to clear the 5 percent hurdle needed to get into parliament . the csu 's good showing in bavaria in the 2004 general election helped elevate merkel to power , but its popularity has been steadily eroding under beckstein and party chairman erwin huber . losses by the state-owned bank bayernlb , the scrapping of a prestigious super-fast train link to the munich airport and a controversial smoking ban combined to fuel voter discontent .
analysts said the party 's poor performance could increase pressure on the csu leadership , which had been criticized for running a tepid campaign and failing to galvanize voters . the party ran a campaign highlighting the csu 's past successes while pushing for greater tax breaks for commuters and better conditions for working mothers .
state losses could have national ramifications the dramatic losses suffered by the csu in bavaria have ramifications well beyond the borders of germany 's largest state .
the shockwaves reached as far as berlin , where merkel rules in an uneasy grand coalition with the left-of-center social democrats -lrb- spd -rrb- . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel will want answers from the csu leadership analysts said that the outcome could increase tension between the coalition partners and hurt merkel 's chances of retaining power in federal elections scheduled for september 2009 .
foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier , who has been picked by the spd to challenge merkel for the chancellorship , said the vote had far-reaching implications .
" we are not talking about an election result , " he said , " but about an earthquake that has been unleashed by this election in bavaria . "
but he did n't mention that his party 's own performance of just over 18 percent was also its worst-ever showing in the prosperous state of laptops and lederhosen .
analysts said that voters punished the csu for clinging to traditional social values and catholic church doctrine in a europe that has become increasingly secular .
it did not help that beckstein and party chairman erwin huber lacked the charisma of stoiber and failed to galvanize voters to support a fresh vision .

the csu polled 43.4 percent of the vote on sunday , sept .
28 , in its worst showing in half a century .
the center-left social democrats -lrb- spd -rrb- , which govern in a grand coalition with merkel 's party in berlin , polled 18.6 percent , a decline of 1 percentage point from the last state election in 2003 . csu secretary general christine haderthauer said the disastrous result was a black day for the party , which had ruled unchallenged for more than 40 years .
in the last state elections in 2003 , the csu polled 60.7 percent of the vote in the strongly catholic state , where some of germany 's leading companies have their headquarters , including siemens and bmw .
the party 's stated intent had been to retain its absolute majority in the 180-seat parliament in munich .

the liberals are eyeing a coalition with the cdu at the national level next year , but shifting alliances in the party landscape could make a wider alliance possible .
another possibility is the free voters , a conservative party that will make its parliamentary debut after winning 10.2 percent on a platform seeking greater local power .
the environmentalist greens won 9.4 percent , but the pro-labor left party at 4.3 percent failed to clear the 5 percent hurdle needed to get into parliament . the csu 's good showing in bavaria in the 2004 general election helped elevate merkel to power , but its popularity has been steadily eroding under beckstein and party chairman erwin huber . losses by the state-owned bank bayernlb , the scrapping of a prestigious super-fast train link to the munich airport and a controversial smoking ban combined to fuel voter discontent .
analysts said the party 's poor performance could increase pressure on the csu leadership , which had been criticized for running a tepid campaign and failing to galvanize voters . the party ran a campaign highlighting the csu 's past successes while pushing for greater tax breaks for commuters and better conditions for working mothers .

foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier , who has been picked by the spd to challenge merkel for the chancellorship , said the vote had far-reaching implications .

the environmentalist greens won 9.4 percent , but the pro-labor left party at 4.3 percent failed to clear the 5 percent hurdle needed to get into parliament . the csu 's good showing in bavaria in the 2004 general election helped elevate merkel to power , but its popularity has been steadily eroding under beckstein and party chairman erwin huber . losses by the state-owned bank bayernlb , the scrapping of a prestigious super-fast train link to the munich airport and a controversial smoking ban combined to fuel voter discontent .
analysts said the party 's poor performance could increase pressure on the csu leadership , which had been criticized for running a tepid campaign and failing to galvanize voters . the party ran a campaign highlighting the csu 's past successes while pushing for greater tax breaks for commuters and better conditions for working mothers .
state losses could have national ramifications the dramatic losses suffered by the csu in bavaria have ramifications well beyond the borders of germany 's largest state .

foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier , who has been picked by the spd to challenge merkel for the chancellorship , said the vote had far-reaching implications .
" we are not talking about an election result , " he said , " but about an earthquake that has been unleashed by this election in bavaria . "
but he did n't mention that his party 's own performance of just over 18 percent was also its worst-ever showing in the prosperous state of laptops and lederhosen .

the csu polled 43.4 percent of the vote on sunday , sept .
28 , in its worst showing in half a century .
the center-left social democrats -lrb- spd -rrb- , which govern in a grand coalition with merkel 's party in berlin , polled 18.6 percent , a decline of 1 percentage point from the last state election in 2003 . csu secretary general christine haderthauer said the disastrous result was a black day for the party , which had ruled unchallenged for more than 40 years .
in the last state elections in 2003 , the csu polled 60.7 percent of the vote in the strongly catholic state , where some of germany 's leading companies have their headquarters , including siemens and bmw .
the party 's stated intent had been to retain its absolute majority in the 180-seat parliament in munich .
" we have clearly failed to achieve our goal , " haderthauer said .
beckstein refuses to shoulder the blame bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : beckstein and huber will face an inquest into the defeat state prime minister guenther beckstein , who was elected last year after longtime leader edmund stoiber was toppled in a party revolt , ruled out stepping down to take responsibility for the poor showing .
" the people have shown that they want a csu-led government , but that they do not want the csu to govern bavaria alone , " he said , adding that the party would immediately start to look for a coalition partner .
the most likely contenders are the liberal free democrats -lrb- fdp -rrb- , who polled 8 percent of the vote to enter parliament after an absence of 14 years .
the liberals are eyeing a coalition with the cdu at the national level next year , but shifting alliances in the party landscape could make a wider alliance possible .
another possibility is the free voters , a conservative party that will make its parliamentary debut after winning 10.2 percent on a platform seeking greater local power .

28 , the belgian , dutch and luxembourg governments agreed to inject 11.2 billion euros -lrb- $ 16.4 billion -rrb- into the banking and insurance company fortis after a weekend of high drama .
the presence of trichet , who as ecb head is responsible for safeguarding financial stability in the euro zone , was unprecedented in a commercial bank rescue and underlined the seriousness of concern for the integrity of the euro zone 's financial system .
in the first major bank crisis to hit the euro zone in 13 months of global financial turmoil that began in the united states , fortis looked to be in severe danger with some experts concerned that the tri-nation group could go under by monday if nothing was done to save it .
fortis saw its shares drop by a third last week on investor concerns about its liquidity and funding which stem from last year 's 70 billion euro purchase of dutch bank abn amro with partners royal bank of scotland and spain 's santander .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : fortis ' troubles can be traced to the purchase of abn shares dived more than 20 percent to 15-year lows on friday despite a statement that the group 's position was solid and a pledge to expand asset sales to as much as 10 billion euros .

the group 's nationalization dwarfs britain 's state takeover of fallen mortgage lender northern rock last year .
france 's bnp paribas allegedly pulled out of a deal last week after offering just 1.60 euros per share for fortis , compared to friday 's closing price of 5.20 , and demanding state guarantees against possible future losses , a source said .
the dutch ing group was alleged to have bid just 1.5 euros per share .

fortis group too large not to be saved fortis , with 85,000 staff worldwide , is the biggest private sector employer in belgium and more than 1.5 million households , roughly half the country , bank with the group .
" we could have not intervened , but the question was whether fortis would have survived on monday , " dutch finance minister wouter bos told reporters .
the benelux governments chose a partial state buyout after two private bidders made paltry offers for the group last week .

belgium will put in 4.7 billion euros , the netherlands 4 billion and luxembourg 2.5 billion , the latter in the form of a convertible loan .
the group 's nationalization dwarfs britain 's state takeover of fallen mortgage lender northern rock last year .
france 's bnp paribas allegedly pulled out of a deal last week after offering just 1.60 euros per share for fortis , compared to friday 's closing price of 5.20 , and demanding state guarantees against possible future losses , a source said .
the dutch ing group was alleged to have bid just 1.5 euros per share .
" there was no serious bidder for the intrinsic value of the whole group , " the source told reuters news agency .

fortis chairman maurice lippens , accused by shareholders of concealing the bank 's troubles for too long , resigned after the news of the nationalization broke .
fortis also named filip dierckx as chief executive on friday evening , hastily replacing caretaker herman verwilst .

28 . the social democrats -lrb- spoe -rrb- took 29.7 percent while the conservatives -lrb- oevp -rrb- secured 25.6 percent , according to official ministry results , which did not include absentee ballots .
the far-right , meanwhile , established itself as the third political force in austria , with 18.0 percent for the freedom party -lrb- fpoe -rrb- and a surprising 11.0 percent for joerg haider 's smaller alliance for austria 's future -lrb- bzoe -rrb- .
the greens had to settle for fifth place with 9.8 percent .
a total 15 parties were listed on the ballot in sunday 's election , the highest number in austrian electoral history , but most of them did not pass the 4.0-percent threshold to get into parliament .
participation stood at 71.4 percent , out of 6.3 million eligible voters , but some 586,700 absentees still had to be taken into account .
these were to be tallied in the next week with full final results expected on oct .
6 .
bildunterschrift : heinz strache , wilhelm molterer , joerg haider , alex van der bellen , werner faymann in the last general elections in october 2006 , voter participation was 78.49 percent , including absentee ballots .
far-right gains due to disillusionment the far-right gains were the most worrying results of the election but experts said the parties got a massive boost because voters were frustrated with the centrist coalition parties and not because of the rightists ' anti-immigration rhetoric .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : strache has aligned himself with people like le pen the results for heinz christian strache 's fpoe were up seven percent from the last elections in 2006 , while haider 's bzoe more than doubled its votes to 11 percent , from 4 percent in 2006 .
" the main reason was that the government 's dismal performance , " political scientist peter gerlich of the vienna university said , explaining voters ' shift to the far right .
the coalition between social democrats and their junior partner , the conservative people 's party -lrb- oevp -rrb- , split in july after 18 months of bickering and political stalemate .
experts also said the two parties were successful at portraying themselves as caring for lower-income voters worried about rising prices .
although the social democrats pushed a package of social spending bills through parliament mere days before the elections , the freedom party had more credibility with social issues , fritz plasser of innsbruck university said .
" supporting the weak helped them , " plasser said .
strache 's anti-european union rhetoric also resonated in a country where 47 percent of the population thinks austria has not benefited from being an eu member .
but despite these factors , there is no denying that strache 's freedom party , and , to a lesser extent , haider 's alliance , banked on voters ' anti-immigrant and anti-islamic sentiments .
controversial electioneering at strache 's final election rally in one of vienna 's working class districts last friday , the crowd cheered loudest not when he spoke about social issues , but when he complained that foreigners were now allowed to live in social housing projects .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : haider made yet another comeback in sunday 's election haider suggested during the election race that all asylum seekers should be made to wear electronic tags to monitor their movements .
although it is clear that both right-wing parties will play a bigger role in austrian politics , both social democrats and conservatives have so far ruled out forming coalitions with strache or haider .
" the spoe will be somewhat tempted , " to cooperate with the freedom party , gerlich said .
but his colleague plasser said that such a coalition would create a deep split among social democrats .
there is also a rumor about a -lrb- social democratic -rrb- minority government with parliamentary support from the freedom party , gerlich said . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?
dw-world.de austrian elections : social democrats on top as far-right gains austria 's social democrats are likely to emerge as the biggest party after early elections despite significant gains by parties on the far-right , according to early official results .

28 . the social democrats -lrb- spoe -rrb- took 29.7 percent while the conservatives -lrb- oevp -rrb- secured 25.6 percent , according to official ministry results , which did not include absentee ballots .
the far-right , meanwhile , established itself as the third political force in austria , with 18.0 percent for the freedom party -lrb- fpoe -rrb- and a surprising 11.0 percent for joerg haider 's smaller alliance for austria 's future -lrb- bzoe -rrb- .
the greens had to settle for fifth place with 9.8 percent .
a total 15 parties were listed on the ballot in sunday 's election , the highest number in austrian electoral history , but most of them did not pass the 4.0-percent threshold to get into parliament .
participation stood at 71.4 percent , out of 6.3 million eligible voters , but some 586,700 absentees still had to be taken into account .
these were to be tallied in the next week with full final results expected on oct .

bildunterschrift : heinz strache , wilhelm molterer , joerg haider , alex van der bellen , werner faymann in the last general elections in october 2006 , voter participation was 78.49 percent , including absentee ballots .
far-right gains due to disillusionment the far-right gains were the most worrying results of the election but experts said the parties got a massive boost because voters were frustrated with the centrist coalition parties and not because of the rightists ' anti-immigration rhetoric .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : strache has aligned himself with people like le pen the results for heinz christian strache 's fpoe were up seven percent from the last elections in 2006 , while haider 's bzoe more than doubled its votes to 11 percent , from 4 percent in 2006 .
" the main reason was that the government 's dismal performance , " political scientist peter gerlich of the vienna university said , explaining voters ' shift to the far right .
the coalition between social democrats and their junior partner , the conservative people 's party -lrb- oevp -rrb- , split in july after 18 months of bickering and political stalemate .
experts also said the two parties were successful at portraying themselves as caring for lower-income voters worried about rising prices .
although the social democrats pushed a package of social spending bills through parliament mere days before the elections , the freedom party had more credibility with social issues , fritz plasser of innsbruck university said .
" supporting the weak helped them , " plasser said .
strache 's anti-european union rhetoric also resonated in a country where 47 percent of the population thinks austria has not benefited from being an eu member .
but despite these factors , there is no denying that strache 's freedom party , and , to a lesser extent , haider 's alliance , banked on voters ' anti-immigrant and anti-islamic sentiments .
controversial electioneering at strache 's final election rally in one of vienna 's working class districts last friday , the crowd cheered loudest not when he spoke about social issues , but when he complained that foreigners were now allowed to live in social housing projects .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : haider made yet another comeback in sunday 's election haider suggested during the election race that all asylum seekers should be made to wear electronic tags to monitor their movements .
although it is clear that both right-wing parties will play a bigger role in austrian politics , both social democrats and conservatives have so far ruled out forming coalitions with strache or haider .
" the spoe will be somewhat tempted , " to cooperate with the freedom party , gerlich said .
but his colleague plasser said that such a coalition would create a deep split among social democrats .

28 . the social democrats -lrb- spoe -rrb- took 29.7 percent while the conservatives -lrb- oevp -rrb- secured 25.6 percent , according to official ministry results , which did not include absentee ballots .
the far-right , meanwhile , established itself as the third political force in austria , with 18.0 percent for the freedom party -lrb- fpoe -rrb- and a surprising 11.0 percent for joerg haider 's smaller alliance for austria 's future -lrb- bzoe -rrb- .
the greens had to settle for fifth place with 9.8 percent .
a total 15 parties were listed on the ballot in sunday 's election , the highest number in austrian electoral history , but most of them did not pass the 4.0-percent threshold to get into parliament .
participation stood at 71.4 percent , out of 6.3 million eligible voters , but some 586,700 absentees still had to be taken into account .
these were to be tallied in the next week with full final results expected on oct .
6 .
bildunterschrift : heinz strache , wilhelm molterer , joerg haider , alex van der bellen , werner faymann in the last general elections in october 2006 , voter participation was 78.49 percent , including absentee ballots .
far-right gains due to disillusionment the far-right gains were the most worrying results of the election but experts said the parties got a massive boost because voters were frustrated with the centrist coalition parties and not because of the rightists ' anti-immigration rhetoric .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : strache has aligned himself with people like le pen the results for heinz christian strache 's fpoe were up seven percent from the last elections in 2006 , while haider 's bzoe more than doubled its votes to 11 percent , from 4 percent in 2006 .
" the main reason was that the government 's dismal performance , " political scientist peter gerlich of the vienna university said , explaining voters ' shift to the far right .
the coalition between social democrats and their junior partner , the conservative people 's party -lrb- oevp -rrb- , split in july after 18 months of bickering and political stalemate .
experts also said the two parties were successful at portraying themselves as caring for lower-income voters worried about rising prices .
although the social democrats pushed a package of social spending bills through parliament mere days before the elections , the freedom party had more credibility with social issues , fritz plasser of innsbruck university said .
" supporting the weak helped them , " plasser said .
strache 's anti-european union rhetoric also resonated in a country where 47 percent of the population thinks austria has not benefited from being an eu member .
but despite these factors , there is no denying that strache 's freedom party , and , to a lesser extent , haider 's alliance , banked on voters ' anti-immigrant and anti-islamic sentiments .
controversial electioneering at strache 's final election rally in one of vienna 's working class districts last friday , the crowd cheered loudest not when he spoke about social issues , but when he complained that foreigners were now allowed to live in social housing projects .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : haider made yet another comeback in sunday 's election haider suggested during the election race that all asylum seekers should be made to wear electronic tags to monitor their movements .
although it is clear that both right-wing parties will play a bigger role in austrian politics , both social democrats and conservatives have so far ruled out forming coalitions with strache or haider .
" the spoe will be somewhat tempted , " to cooperate with the freedom party , gerlich said .
but his colleague plasser said that such a coalition would create a deep split among social democrats .
there is also a rumor about a -lrb- social democratic -rrb- minority government with parliamentary support from the freedom party , gerlich said . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the german finance ministry in berlin said it has provided hre guarantees for an emergency credit line totalling 35 billion euros -lrb- $ 50 billion -rrb- .
the ministry added that it had no intention of nationalizing the lender . a spokesman said the commitment was needed so that banks could bail out hre , but the actual losses were not that high . sources said the commitment could potentially strain chancellor angela merkel 's federal budget .
germany 's parliament would have to vote on the bailout package .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de bundesliga -pipe- 29.09.2008 hertha consider moving out of berlin 's olympic stadium großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hugely impressive and steeped in history , the olympic stadium is also hard to fill for decades berlin 's multi-functional olympic stadium , built for the 1936 " nazi " games , has served as the " home " of bundesliga club hertha berlin .
but rarely do enough fans show up to fill the enormous stadium . as a result hertha 's management is currently pondering saying " auf wiedersehen " to the stadium - where legendary black us sprinter jesse owens made athletics history 72 years ago by bagging four olympic gold medals - and building a new " soccer-only " stadium elsewhere in the city .
for hertha , the drawback with the olympic stadium is its size .
the athletics track bordering the pitch also means fans are some distance from the soccer action , unlike crowds at frankfurt , hamburg , borussia dortmund and bayern munich , which itself moved from the munich olympic stadium to the allianz arena for similar reasons , where stands rise just a few meters from the touch-line .
berlin 's olympic stadium has a 76,000 maximum crowd capacity , but about the only time hertha draws a crowd that size is when it plays bayern at home in the league .
at most other games , the stadium remains only about 50 percent occupied .
this has led to discussions at the club , with officials - club manager dieter hoeness among them - openly favoring a " soccer only " club ground .
hertha pay around 4.5 million euros in annual rent for the olympic stadium , and are currently contracted to stay at the olympic stadium until the year 2017 but hoeness says the club is not seeking to change that arrangement .
but he notes that if hertha pursues the idea of building a new club ground a minimum period of seven or eight years planning would be needed before it was realized .
huge home ground swallows smalls crowds bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : no every day can be world cup final day in berlin hertha 's problems were highlighted a fortnight ago when the club entertained dublin side st patrick 's athletic in an uefa cup match at home , and only 13,000 spectators showed up .
similarly at the club 's first two home league matches this season the home ground was barely 50 per cent occupied while last season average attendances of 44,483 were achieved .
berlin city government officials have been surprised by the talk of hertha possibly wanting to exit the olympic stadium .
for erhart koerting , berlin 's social democrat interior and sport minister , the olympic stadium is a world-famous sports facility , as evidenced by its hosting of the 2009 world athletics championships .
it underwent a major 282-million-euro revamp in the run-up to the 2006 world cup , when it was endowed with a spectacular oval-shaped roof , towering 68 meters above its enlarged seating area and bevy of vip loges .
for that reason alone , hertha could not expect financial support from the public purse if it was to build a new stadium , said koerting .
opinion divided over relocation bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : few sides can boast such a spectacular home stadium even hertha league players are divided by talk of a new stadium .
steve von bergen , a club defender , says : " it would be a shame if hertha no longer played at the olympic stadium .
the stadium is a monument .
every day people come to look at it , even when there is n't football activity there . "
club goalkeeper jaroslav drobny takes another view .
" naturally the olympic stadium has a long tradition , but times have changed .
when hertha played st patrick 's recently the stadium was empty , one could hear the fans , but not see them , " he claimed .
" the club deserves to play in a stadium which is 100 per-cent tailored for football , " he reckons .
midfield player fabian lustenberger , on the other hand , says the " football atmosphere " at the stadium is not as bad as it 's often painted .
" in dortmund or hamburg the soccer feeling is great but at bayern munich the atmosphere 's hardly sensational at times , " he points out . dpa news agency -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

but rarely do enough fans show up to fill the enormous stadium . as a result hertha 's management is currently pondering saying " auf wiedersehen " to the stadium - where legendary black us sprinter jesse owens made athletics history 72 years ago by bagging four olympic gold medals - and building a new " soccer-only " stadium elsewhere in the city .
for hertha , the drawback with the olympic stadium is its size .
the athletics track bordering the pitch also means fans are some distance from the soccer action , unlike crowds at frankfurt , hamburg , borussia dortmund and bayern munich , which itself moved from the munich olympic stadium to the allianz arena for similar reasons , where stands rise just a few meters from the touch-line .
berlin 's olympic stadium has a 76,000 maximum crowd capacity , but about the only time hertha draws a crowd that size is when it plays bayern at home in the league .
at most other games , the stadium remains only about 50 percent occupied .
this has led to discussions at the club , with officials - club manager dieter hoeness among them - openly favoring a " soccer only " club ground .
hertha pay around 4.5 million euros in annual rent for the olympic stadium , and are currently contracted to stay at the olympic stadium until the year 2017 but hoeness says the club is not seeking to change that arrangement .
but he notes that if hertha pursues the idea of building a new club ground a minimum period of seven or eight years planning would be needed before it was realized .
huge home ground swallows smalls crowds bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : no every day can be world cup final day in berlin hertha 's problems were highlighted a fortnight ago when the club entertained dublin side st patrick 's athletic in an uefa cup match at home , and only 13,000 spectators showed up .
similarly at the club 's first two home league matches this season the home ground was barely 50 per cent occupied while last season average attendances of 44,483 were achieved .
berlin city government officials have been surprised by the talk of hertha possibly wanting to exit the olympic stadium .
for erhart koerting , berlin 's social democrat interior and sport minister , the olympic stadium is a world-famous sports facility , as evidenced by its hosting of the 2009 world athletics championships .
it underwent a major 282-million-euro revamp in the run-up to the 2006 world cup , when it was endowed with a spectacular oval-shaped roof , towering 68 meters above its enlarged seating area and bevy of vip loges .
for that reason alone , hertha could not expect financial support from the public purse if it was to build a new stadium , said koerting .
opinion divided over relocation bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : few sides can boast such a spectacular home stadium even hertha league players are divided by talk of a new stadium .
steve von bergen , a club defender , says : " it would be a shame if hertha no longer played at the olympic stadium .
the stadium is a monument .
every day people come to look at it , even when there is n't football activity there . "
club goalkeeper jaroslav drobny takes another view .
" naturally the olympic stadium has a long tradition , but times have changed .
when hertha played st patrick 's recently the stadium was empty , one could hear the fans , but not see them , " he claimed .
" the club deserves to play in a stadium which is 100 per-cent tailored for football , " he reckons .
midfield player fabian lustenberger , on the other hand , says the " football atmosphere " at the stadium is not as bad as it 's often painted .
" in dortmund or hamburg the soccer feeling is great but at bayern munich the atmosphere 's hardly sensational at times , " he points out . dpa news agency -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the results could have an effect on national elections . the result of the state elections in bavaria is like an earthquake shaking german politics .
the csu 's absolute majority in the state was considered to be a law of nature but now that law has been smashed and the csu must find itself a coalition partner - it 's something only old bavarians know from the 1950s .
the shockwaves from this earthquake reach all the way to berlin .
angela merkel wants to continue as chancellor after next year 's parliamentary election but not as the head of the deeply unpopular grand coalition with the social democrats .
she would much prefer the fdp free market liberals . for that to happen , it 's not just the fdp that needs to ratchet up votes .
the conservatives from merkel 's christian democratic union -lrb- cdu -rrb- and its sister party , the christian social -lrb- csu -rrb- need to hugely boost their support .
right now , however the csu has done just the opposite , by suffering massive losses in bavaria .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : peter stützle admittedly , the earthquake has n't exactly put the brand new chancellor candidate of germany 's social democrats , frank-walter steinmeier , in a better position .
despite the weakness of the ruling csu , the social democrats in bavaria could n't capitalize on the conservatives ' disarray and recorded their worst result in five years .
steinmeier 's dream partners , the greens and the fdp may both have increased their gains but a three-way coalition of the spd , greens and the fdp can only work if the spd becomes stronger - if anything , the party has just gotten a little weaker .
one of the most striking results of the bavarian election has been the continuing erosion of germany 's two biggest traditional parties , the spd and the cdu .
it 's a development that has become apparent in all state elections in recent years and in the general elections in 2005 .
what 's equally striking is that the ensuing political camps remain largely unchanged . disillusioned spd supporters usually turn toward the left party and partly toward the greens while fed-up conservative voters flock to the fdp and , in the case of bavaria , to the free voters .
the free voters , a grassroots organization which largely includes former csu members , attaches great importance to the principle that they are n't beholden to any party line .
the group however will not contest the general elections next year which means that a lot of their voters could return to the csu .
the grand coalition in berlin now needs to roll up their sleeves to finish off what they started . a few important decisions loom in the next weeks such as tax reforms .
it 's not clear how the csu will react in the grand coalition in berlin , whether it will be stubborn or more open to compromise . if the tensions between the ruling parties continue and increase , then this could exacerbate the frustration in the populace which in turn could accelerate the erosion of the two main parties .

the results could have an effect on national elections . the result of the state elections in bavaria is like an earthquake shaking german politics .
the csu 's absolute majority in the state was considered to be a law of nature but now that law has been smashed and the csu must find itself a coalition partner - it 's something only old bavarians know from the 1950s .
the shockwaves from this earthquake reach all the way to berlin .
angela merkel wants to continue as chancellor after next year 's parliamentary election but not as the head of the deeply unpopular grand coalition with the social democrats .
she would much prefer the fdp free market liberals . for that to happen , it 's not just the fdp that needs to ratchet up votes .
the conservatives from merkel 's christian democratic union -lrb- cdu -rrb- and its sister party , the christian social -lrb- csu -rrb- need to hugely boost their support .
right now , however the csu has done just the opposite , by suffering massive losses in bavaria .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : peter stützle admittedly , the earthquake has n't exactly put the brand new chancellor candidate of germany 's social democrats , frank-walter steinmeier , in a better position .
despite the weakness of the ruling csu , the social democrats in bavaria could n't capitalize on the conservatives ' disarray and recorded their worst result in five years .
steinmeier 's dream partners , the greens and the fdp may both have increased their gains but a three-way coalition of the spd , greens and the fdp can only work if the spd becomes stronger - if anything , the party has just gotten a little weaker .
one of the most striking results of the bavarian election has been the continuing erosion of germany 's two biggest traditional parties , the spd and the cdu .
it 's a development that has become apparent in all state elections in recent years and in the general elections in 2005 .
what 's equally striking is that the ensuing political camps remain largely unchanged . disillusioned spd supporters usually turn toward the left party and partly toward the greens while fed-up conservative voters flock to the fdp and , in the case of bavaria , to the free voters .
the free voters , a grassroots organization which largely includes former csu members , attaches great importance to the principle that they are n't beholden to any party line .
the group however will not contest the general elections next year which means that a lot of their voters could return to the csu .
the grand coalition in berlin now needs to roll up their sleeves to finish off what they started . a few important decisions loom in the next weeks such as tax reforms .
it 's not clear how the csu will react in the grand coalition in berlin , whether it will be stubborn or more open to compromise . if the tensions between the ruling parties continue and increase , then this could exacerbate the frustration in the populace which in turn could accelerate the erosion of the two main parties .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de bundesliga -pipe- 29.09.2008 hertha consider moving out of berlin 's olympic stadium großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hugely impressive and steeped in history , the olympic stadium is also hard to fill for decades berlin 's multi-functional olympic stadium , built for the 1936 " nazi " games , has served as the " home " of bundesliga club hertha berlin .
but rarely do enough fans show up to fill the enormous stadium . as a result hertha 's management is currently pondering saying " auf wiedersehen " to the stadium - where legendary black us sprinter jesse owens made athletics history 72 years ago by bagging four olympic gold medals - and building a new " soccer-only " stadium elsewhere in the city .
for hertha , the drawback with the olympic stadium is its size .
the athletics track bordering the pitch also means fans are some distance from the soccer action , unlike crowds at frankfurt , hamburg , borussia dortmund and bayern munich , which itself moved from the munich olympic stadium to the allianz arena for similar reasons , where stands rise just a few meters from the touch-line .
berlin 's olympic stadium has a 76,000 maximum crowd capacity , but about the only time hertha draws a crowd that size is when it plays bayern at home in the league .
at most other games , the stadium remains only about 50 percent occupied .
this has led to discussions at the club , with officials - club manager dieter hoeness among them - openly favoring a " soccer only " club ground .
hertha pay around 4.5 million euros in annual rent for the olympic stadium , and are currently contracted to stay at the olympic stadium until the year 2017 but hoeness says the club is not seeking to change that arrangement .
but he notes that if hertha pursues the idea of building a new club ground a minimum period of seven or eight years planning would be needed before it was realized .
huge home ground swallows smalls crowds bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : no every day can be world cup final day in berlin hertha 's problems were highlighted a fortnight ago when the club entertained dublin side st patrick 's athletic in an uefa cup match at home , and only 13,000 spectators showed up .
similarly at the club 's first two home league matches this season the home ground was barely 50 per cent occupied while last season average attendances of 44,483 were achieved .
berlin city government officials have been surprised by the talk of hertha possibly wanting to exit the olympic stadium .
for erhart koerting , berlin 's social democrat interior and sport minister , the olympic stadium is a world-famous sports facility , as evidenced by its hosting of the 2009 world athletics championships .
it underwent a major 282-million-euro revamp in the run-up to the 2006 world cup , when it was endowed with a spectacular oval-shaped roof , towering 68 meters above its enlarged seating area and bevy of vip loges .
for that reason alone , hertha could not expect financial support from the public purse if it was to build a new stadium , said koerting .
opinion divided over relocation bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : few sides can boast such a spectacular home stadium even hertha league players are divided by talk of a new stadium .
steve von bergen , a club defender , says : " it would be a shame if hertha no longer played at the olympic stadium .
the stadium is a monument .
every day people come to look at it , even when there is n't football activity there . "
club goalkeeper jaroslav drobny takes another view .
" naturally the olympic stadium has a long tradition , but times have changed .
when hertha played st patrick 's recently the stadium was empty , one could hear the fans , but not see them , " he claimed .
" the club deserves to play in a stadium which is 100 per-cent tailored for football , " he reckons .
midfield player fabian lustenberger , on the other hand , says the " football atmosphere " at the stadium is not as bad as it 's often painted .
" in dortmund or hamburg the soccer feeling is great but at bayern munich the atmosphere 's hardly sensational at times , " he points out . dpa news agency -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

but rarely do enough fans show up to fill the enormous stadium . as a result hertha 's management is currently pondering saying " auf wiedersehen " to the stadium - where legendary black us sprinter jesse owens made athletics history 72 years ago by bagging four olympic gold medals - and building a new " soccer-only " stadium elsewhere in the city .
for hertha , the drawback with the olympic stadium is its size .
the athletics track bordering the pitch also means fans are some distance from the soccer action , unlike crowds at frankfurt , hamburg , borussia dortmund and bayern munich , which itself moved from the munich olympic stadium to the allianz arena for similar reasons , where stands rise just a few meters from the touch-line .
berlin 's olympic stadium has a 76,000 maximum crowd capacity , but about the only time hertha draws a crowd that size is when it plays bayern at home in the league .
at most other games , the stadium remains only about 50 percent occupied .
this has led to discussions at the club , with officials - club manager dieter hoeness among them - openly favoring a " soccer only " club ground .
hertha pay around 4.5 million euros in annual rent for the olympic stadium , and are currently contracted to stay at the olympic stadium until the year 2017 but hoeness says the club is not seeking to change that arrangement .
but he notes that if hertha pursues the idea of building a new club ground a minimum period of seven or eight years planning would be needed before it was realized .
huge home ground swallows smalls crowds bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : no every day can be world cup final day in berlin hertha 's problems were highlighted a fortnight ago when the club entertained dublin side st patrick 's athletic in an uefa cup match at home , and only 13,000 spectators showed up .
similarly at the club 's first two home league matches this season the home ground was barely 50 per cent occupied while last season average attendances of 44,483 were achieved .
berlin city government officials have been surprised by the talk of hertha possibly wanting to exit the olympic stadium .
for erhart koerting , berlin 's social democrat interior and sport minister , the olympic stadium is a world-famous sports facility , as evidenced by its hosting of the 2009 world athletics championships .
it underwent a major 282-million-euro revamp in the run-up to the 2006 world cup , when it was endowed with a spectacular oval-shaped roof , towering 68 meters above its enlarged seating area and bevy of vip loges .
for that reason alone , hertha could not expect financial support from the public purse if it was to build a new stadium , said koerting .
opinion divided over relocation bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : few sides can boast such a spectacular home stadium even hertha league players are divided by talk of a new stadium .
steve von bergen , a club defender , says : " it would be a shame if hertha no longer played at the olympic stadium .
the stadium is a monument .
every day people come to look at it , even when there is n't football activity there . "
club goalkeeper jaroslav drobny takes another view .
" naturally the olympic stadium has a long tradition , but times have changed .
when hertha played st patrick 's recently the stadium was empty , one could hear the fans , but not see them , " he claimed .
" the club deserves to play in a stadium which is 100 per-cent tailored for football , " he reckons .
midfield player fabian lustenberger , on the other hand , says the " football atmosphere " at the stadium is not as bad as it 's often painted .
" in dortmund or hamburg the soccer feeling is great but at bayern munich the atmosphere 's hardly sensational at times , " he points out . dpa news agency -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

some mediterranean regions already receive 20 percent less rain than a century ago , the report said , increasing the risk of forest fires and the desertification of the region .
the report labelled glacier retreat in europe a double-edged sword , projecting an overall increase in river floods across europe , but also an increase in river droughts in the south .
" uncertainty in the rate of melting of greenland 's outlet glaciers makes projections of future sea level rise uncertain , " the report said , adding that according to satellite observations the global sea level had risen by as much as 3.1 mm a year in the past 15 years .
europe a global warming hot spot bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : europe is set to struggle under increasing temperatures caused by global warming the report highlighted the widespread vulnerability of europe to global warming-induced climate change , with mountainous regions , coastal zones , the mediterranean and the arctic set to shoulder the lion 's share of the environmental burden .
" global average temperature has increased almost 0.8 of a degree above pre-industrial levels , with even higher temperature increases in europe and northern latitudes , " the report said .
europe has warmed by 1 degree .
the report 's authors said mitigation and adaptation measures against climate change needed to be more widespread in europe and that today 's efforts focus only on flood management and defense .
they also recommended the creation of a european clearing house on climate change impacts , vulnerability and adaptation to make climate change data widely available . dw staff -lrb- dm -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de elections -pipe- 29.09.2008 bavarian conservatives lose state majority in damaging defeat großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : beckstein suffered defeat on what was described as a " black day " for conservatives bavaria 's christian social union -lrb- csu -rrb- lost its decades-old absolute majority as voters defected to smaller parties in a state election seen as a test of support ahead of national polls next year . computer projections showed a swing of more than 17 percentage points away from the sister party of chancellor angela merkel 's christian democrats -lrb- cdu -rrb- , forcing it to look for a coalition partner .
the csu polled 43.4 percent of the vote on sunday , sept .
28 , in its worst showing in half a century .
the center-left social democrats -lrb- spd -rrb- , which govern in a grand coalition with merkel 's party in berlin , polled 18.6 percent , a decline of 1 percentage point from the last state election in 2003 . csu secretary general christine haderthauer said the disastrous result was a black day for the party , which had ruled unchallenged for more than 40 years .
in the last state elections in 2003 , the csu polled 60.7 percent of the vote in the strongly catholic state , where some of germany 's leading companies have their headquarters , including siemens and bmw .
the party 's stated intent had been to retain its absolute majority in the 180-seat parliament in munich .
" we have clearly failed to achieve our goal , " haderthauer said .
beckstein refuses to shoulder the blame bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : beckstein and huber will face an inquest into the defeat state prime minister guenther beckstein , who was elected last year after longtime leader edmund stoiber was toppled in a party revolt , ruled out stepping down to take responsibility for the poor showing .
" the people have shown that they want a csu-led government , but that they do not want the csu to govern bavaria alone , " he said , adding that the party would immediately start to look for a coalition partner .
the most likely contenders are the liberal free democrats -lrb- fdp -rrb- , who polled 8 percent of the vote to enter parliament after an absence of 14 years .
the liberals are eyeing a coalition with the cdu at the national level next year , but shifting alliances in the party landscape could make a wider alliance possible .
another possibility is the free voters , a conservative party that will make its parliamentary debut after winning 10.2 percent on a platform seeking greater local power .
the environmentalist greens won 9.4 percent , but the pro-labor left party at 4.3 percent failed to clear the 5 percent hurdle needed to get into parliament . the csu 's good showing in bavaria in the 2004 general election helped elevate merkel to power , but its popularity has been steadily eroding under beckstein and party chairman erwin huber . losses by the state-owned bank bayernlb , the scrapping of a prestigious super-fast train link to the munich airport and a controversial smoking ban combined to fuel voter discontent .
analysts said the party 's poor performance could increase pressure on the csu leadership , which had been criticized for running a tepid campaign and failing to galvanize voters . the party ran a campaign highlighting the csu 's past successes while pushing for greater tax breaks for commuters and better conditions for working mothers .
state losses could have national ramifications the dramatic losses suffered by the csu in bavaria have ramifications well beyond the borders of germany 's largest state .
the shockwaves reached as far as berlin , where merkel rules in an uneasy grand coalition with the left-of-center social democrats -lrb- spd -rrb- . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel will want answers from the csu leadership analysts said that the outcome could increase tension between the coalition partners and hurt merkel 's chances of retaining power in federal elections scheduled for september 2009 .
foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier , who has been picked by the spd to challenge merkel for the chancellorship , said the vote had far-reaching implications .
" we are not talking about an election result , " he said , " but about an earthquake that has been unleashed by this election in bavaria . "
but he did n't mention that his party 's own performance of just over 18 percent was also its worst-ever showing in the prosperous state of laptops and lederhosen .
analysts said that voters punished the csu for clinging to traditional social values and catholic church doctrine in a europe that has become increasingly secular .
it did not help that beckstein and party chairman erwin huber lacked the charisma of stoiber and failed to galvanize voters to support a fresh vision .
recent state elections have seen coalitions between the cdu and greens in hamburg , and the spd eyeing an alliance with the greens and the left in hesse , where there is a minority cdu caretaker government .
the defeated spd candidate in bavaria , franz maget , even suggested a four-party coalition to unseat the csu , arguing that the ruling party had morally lost the right to govern .
while the greens said they would support such a move , the fdp said it was not interested in " a gaudy coalition of anarchists . " dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

some mediterranean regions already receive 20 percent less rain than a century ago , the report said , increasing the risk of forest fires and the desertification of the region .
the report labelled glacier retreat in europe a double-edged sword , projecting an overall increase in river floods across europe , but also an increase in river droughts in the south .
" uncertainty in the rate of melting of greenland 's outlet glaciers makes projections of future sea level rise uncertain , " the report said , adding that according to satellite observations the global sea level had risen by as much as 3.1 mm a year in the past 15 years .
europe a global warming hot spot bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : europe is set to struggle under increasing temperatures caused by global warming the report highlighted the widespread vulnerability of europe to global warming-induced climate change , with mountainous regions , coastal zones , the mediterranean and the arctic set to shoulder the lion 's share of the environmental burden .
" global average temperature has increased almost 0.8 of a degree above pre-industrial levels , with even higher temperature increases in europe and northern latitudes , " the report said .
europe has warmed by 1 degree .
the report 's authors said mitigation and adaptation measures against climate change needed to be more widespread in europe and that today 's efforts focus only on flood management and defense .
they also recommended the creation of a european clearing house on climate change impacts , vulnerability and adaptation to make climate change data widely available . dw staff -lrb- dm -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de elections -pipe- 29.09.2008 bavarian conservatives lose state majority in damaging defeat großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : beckstein suffered defeat on what was described as a " black day " for conservatives bavaria 's christian social union -lrb- csu -rrb- lost its decades-old absolute majority as voters defected to smaller parties in a state election seen as a test of support ahead of national polls next year . computer projections showed a swing of more than 17 percentage points away from the sister party of chancellor angela merkel 's christian democrats -lrb- cdu -rrb- , forcing it to look for a coalition partner .
the csu polled 43.4 percent of the vote on sunday , sept .
28 , in its worst showing in half a century .
the center-left social democrats -lrb- spd -rrb- , which govern in a grand coalition with merkel 's party in berlin , polled 18.6 percent , a decline of 1 percentage point from the last state election in 2003 . csu secretary general christine haderthauer said the disastrous result was a black day for the party , which had ruled unchallenged for more than 40 years .
in the last state elections in 2003 , the csu polled 60.7 percent of the vote in the strongly catholic state , where some of germany 's leading companies have their headquarters , including siemens and bmw .
the party 's stated intent had been to retain its absolute majority in the 180-seat parliament in munich .
" we have clearly failed to achieve our goal , " haderthauer said .
beckstein refuses to shoulder the blame bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : beckstein and huber will face an inquest into the defeat state prime minister guenther beckstein , who was elected last year after longtime leader edmund stoiber was toppled in a party revolt , ruled out stepping down to take responsibility for the poor showing .
" the people have shown that they want a csu-led government , but that they do not want the csu to govern bavaria alone , " he said , adding that the party would immediately start to look for a coalition partner .
the most likely contenders are the liberal free democrats -lrb- fdp -rrb- , who polled 8 percent of the vote to enter parliament after an absence of 14 years .
the liberals are eyeing a coalition with the cdu at the national level next year , but shifting alliances in the party landscape could make a wider alliance possible .
another possibility is the free voters , a conservative party that will make its parliamentary debut after winning 10.2 percent on a platform seeking greater local power .
the environmentalist greens won 9.4 percent , but the pro-labor left party at 4.3 percent failed to clear the 5 percent hurdle needed to get into parliament . the csu 's good showing in bavaria in the 2004 general election helped elevate merkel to power , but its popularity has been steadily eroding under beckstein and party chairman erwin huber . losses by the state-owned bank bayernlb , the scrapping of a prestigious super-fast train link to the munich airport and a controversial smoking ban combined to fuel voter discontent .
analysts said the party 's poor performance could increase pressure on the csu leadership , which had been criticized for running a tepid campaign and failing to galvanize voters . the party ran a campaign highlighting the csu 's past successes while pushing for greater tax breaks for commuters and better conditions for working mothers .
state losses could have national ramifications the dramatic losses suffered by the csu in bavaria have ramifications well beyond the borders of germany 's largest state .
the shockwaves reached as far as berlin , where merkel rules in an uneasy grand coalition with the left-of-center social democrats -lrb- spd -rrb- . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel will want answers from the csu leadership analysts said that the outcome could increase tension between the coalition partners and hurt merkel 's chances of retaining power in federal elections scheduled for september 2009 .
foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier , who has been picked by the spd to challenge merkel for the chancellorship , said the vote had far-reaching implications .
" we are not talking about an election result , " he said , " but about an earthquake that has been unleashed by this election in bavaria . "
but he did n't mention that his party 's own performance of just over 18 percent was also its worst-ever showing in the prosperous state of laptops and lederhosen .
analysts said that voters punished the csu for clinging to traditional social values and catholic church doctrine in a europe that has become increasingly secular .
it did not help that beckstein and party chairman erwin huber lacked the charisma of stoiber and failed to galvanize voters to support a fresh vision .
recent state elections have seen coalitions between the cdu and greens in hamburg , and the spd eyeing an alliance with the greens and the left in hesse , where there is a minority cdu caretaker government .
the defeated spd candidate in bavaria , franz maget , even suggested a four-party coalition to unseat the csu , arguing that the ruling party had morally lost the right to govern .
while the greens said they would support such a move , the fdp said it was not interested in " a gaudy coalition of anarchists . " dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the results could have an effect on national elections . the result of the state elections in bavaria is like an earthquake shaking german politics .
the csu 's absolute majority in the state was considered to be a law of nature but now that law has been smashed and the csu must find itself a coalition partner - it 's something only old bavarians know from the 1950s .
the shockwaves from this earthquake reach all the way to berlin .
angela merkel wants to continue as chancellor after next year 's parliamentary election but not as the head of the deeply unpopular grand coalition with the social democrats .
she would much prefer the fdp free market liberals . for that to happen , it 's not just the fdp that needs to ratchet up votes .
the conservatives from merkel 's christian democratic union -lrb- cdu -rrb- and its sister party , the christian social -lrb- csu -rrb- need to hugely boost their support .
right now , however the csu has done just the opposite , by suffering massive losses in bavaria .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : peter stützle admittedly , the earthquake has n't exactly put the brand new chancellor candidate of germany 's social democrats , frank-walter steinmeier , in a better position .
despite the weakness of the ruling csu , the social democrats in bavaria could n't capitalize on the conservatives ' disarray and recorded their worst result in five years .
steinmeier 's dream partners , the greens and the fdp may both have increased their gains but a three-way coalition of the spd , greens and the fdp can only work if the spd becomes stronger - if anything , the party has just gotten a little weaker .
one of the most striking results of the bavarian election has been the continuing erosion of germany 's two biggest traditional parties , the spd and the cdu .
it 's a development that has become apparent in all state elections in recent years and in the general elections in 2005 .
what 's equally striking is that the ensuing political camps remain largely unchanged . disillusioned spd supporters usually turn toward the left party and partly toward the greens while fed-up conservative voters flock to the fdp and , in the case of bavaria , to the free voters .
the free voters , a grassroots organization which largely includes former csu members , attaches great importance to the principle that they are n't beholden to any party line .
the group however will not contest the general elections next year which means that a lot of their voters could return to the csu .
the grand coalition in berlin now needs to roll up their sleeves to finish off what they started . a few important decisions loom in the next weeks such as tax reforms .
it 's not clear how the csu will react in the grand coalition in berlin , whether it will be stubborn or more open to compromise . if the tensions between the ruling parties continue and increase , then this could exacerbate the frustration in the populace which in turn could accelerate the erosion of the two main parties .

some mediterranean regions already receive 20 percent less rain than a century ago , the report said , increasing the risk of forest fires and the desertification of the region .
the report labelled glacier retreat in europe a double-edged sword , projecting an overall increase in river floods across europe , but also an increase in river droughts in the south .
" uncertainty in the rate of melting of greenland 's outlet glaciers makes projections of future sea level rise uncertain , " the report said , adding that according to satellite observations the global sea level had risen by as much as 3.1 mm a year in the past 15 years .

" global average temperature has increased almost 0.8 of a degree above pre-industrial levels , with even higher temperature increases in europe and northern latitudes , " the report said .
europe has warmed by 1 degree .
the report 's authors said mitigation and adaptation measures against climate change needed to be more widespread in europe and that today 's efforts focus only on flood management and defense .
they also recommended the creation of a european clearing house on climate change impacts , vulnerability and adaptation to make climate change data widely available . dw staff -lrb- dm -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de finance -pipe- 29.09.2008 benelux countries to bail out sinking fortis group großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : experts predicted fortis faced collapse unless a radical rescue package was found as washington prepares to vote on its massive bailout plan , the european central bank gave the green light to a rapid nationalization of the benelux financial group fortis in a bid to save one of europe 's top 20 banks . after emergency discussions with ecb president jean-claude trichet on sunday , sept .
28 , the belgian , dutch and luxembourg governments agreed to inject 11.2 billion euros -lrb- $ 16.4 billion -rrb- into the banking and insurance company fortis after a weekend of high drama .
the presence of trichet , who as ecb head is responsible for safeguarding financial stability in the euro zone , was unprecedented in a commercial bank rescue and underlined the seriousness of concern for the integrity of the euro zone 's financial system .
in the first major bank crisis to hit the euro zone in 13 months of global financial turmoil that began in the united states , fortis looked to be in severe danger with some experts concerned that the tri-nation group could go under by monday if nothing was done to save it .
fortis saw its shares drop by a third last week on investor concerns about its liquidity and funding which stem from last year 's 70 billion euro purchase of dutch bank abn amro with partners royal bank of scotland and spain 's santander .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : fortis ' troubles can be traced to the purchase of abn shares dived more than 20 percent to 15-year lows on friday despite a statement that the group 's position was solid and a pledge to expand asset sales to as much as 10 billion euros .
the group 's market capitalization also slumped from 50 billion euros after the abn purchase to just 12 billion euros on friday .
fortis group too large not to be saved fortis , with 85,000 staff worldwide , is the biggest private sector employer in belgium and more than 1.5 million households , roughly half the country , bank with the group .
" we could have not intervened , but the question was whether fortis would have survived on monday , " dutch finance minister wouter bos told reporters .
the benelux governments chose a partial state buyout after two private bidders made paltry offers for the group last week .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the fortis nationalization dwarfs that on northen rock each government will take a 49 percent stake in fortis banks in their respective countries .
belgium will put in 4.7 billion euros , the netherlands 4 billion and luxembourg 2.5 billion , the latter in the form of a convertible loan .
the group 's nationalization dwarfs britain 's state takeover of fallen mortgage lender northern rock last year .
france 's bnp paribas allegedly pulled out of a deal last week after offering just 1.60 euros per share for fortis , compared to friday 's closing price of 5.20 , and demanding state guarantees against possible future losses , a source said .
the dutch ing group was alleged to have bid just 1.5 euros per share .
" there was no serious bidder for the intrinsic value of the whole group , " the source told reuters news agency .
bnp paribas and ing declined comment on reports that they had bid for all or part of fortis .
nationalization comes as all eyes turn to us bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the us federal reserve 's ben bernanke feels the pressure fortis said in a statement it expected total negative value adjustments of about 5 billion euros after tax in the third quarter .
it added its core equity would be around 30 billion euros , resulting in a 9.5 billion euro excess core equity .
the group also said that it will sell the parts of abn that it bought last year .
fortis chairman maurice lippens , accused by shareholders of concealing the bank 's troubles for too long , resigned after the news of the nationalization broke .
fortis also named filip dierckx as chief executive on friday evening , hastily replacing caretaker herman verwilst .
the fortis nationalization came as financial groups around the world watch for any movement from us lawmakers who are still debating whether to sign off on a deal to create a $ 700 billion government fund to buy bad debt from ailing us banks in a bid to stem a credit crisis threatening the global economy . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

28 , the belgian , dutch and luxembourg governments agreed to inject 11.2 billion euros -lrb- $ 16.4 billion -rrb- into the banking and insurance company fortis after a weekend of high drama .
the presence of trichet , who as ecb head is responsible for safeguarding financial stability in the euro zone , was unprecedented in a commercial bank rescue and underlined the seriousness of concern for the integrity of the euro zone 's financial system .
in the first major bank crisis to hit the euro zone in 13 months of global financial turmoil that began in the united states , fortis looked to be in severe danger with some experts concerned that the tri-nation group could go under by monday if nothing was done to save it .
fortis saw its shares drop by a third last week on investor concerns about its liquidity and funding which stem from last year 's 70 billion euro purchase of dutch bank abn amro with partners royal bank of scotland and spain 's santander .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : fortis ' troubles can be traced to the purchase of abn shares dived more than 20 percent to 15-year lows on friday despite a statement that the group 's position was solid and a pledge to expand asset sales to as much as 10 billion euros .

some mediterranean regions already receive 20 percent less rain than a century ago , the report said , increasing the risk of forest fires and the desertification of the region .
the report labelled glacier retreat in europe a double-edged sword , projecting an overall increase in river floods across europe , but also an increase in river droughts in the south .
" uncertainty in the rate of melting of greenland 's outlet glaciers makes projections of future sea level rise uncertain , " the report said , adding that according to satellite observations the global sea level had risen by as much as 3.1 mm a year in the past 15 years .
europe a global warming hot spot bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : europe is set to struggle under increasing temperatures caused by global warming the report highlighted the widespread vulnerability of europe to global warming-induced climate change , with mountainous regions , coastal zones , the mediterranean and the arctic set to shoulder the lion 's share of the environmental burden .
" global average temperature has increased almost 0.8 of a degree above pre-industrial levels , with even higher temperature increases in europe and northern latitudes , " the report said .
europe has warmed by 1 degree .
the report 's authors said mitigation and adaptation measures against climate change needed to be more widespread in europe and that today 's efforts focus only on flood management and defense .
they also recommended the creation of a european clearing house on climate change impacts , vulnerability and adaptation to make climate change data widely available . dw staff -lrb- dm -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de bundesliga -pipe- 29.09.2008 hertha consider moving out of berlin 's olympic stadium großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hugely impressive and steeped in history , the olympic stadium is also hard to fill for decades berlin 's multi-functional olympic stadium , built for the 1936 " nazi " games , has served as the " home " of bundesliga club hertha berlin .
but rarely do enough fans show up to fill the enormous stadium . as a result hertha 's management is currently pondering saying " auf wiedersehen " to the stadium - where legendary black us sprinter jesse owens made athletics history 72 years ago by bagging four olympic gold medals - and building a new " soccer-only " stadium elsewhere in the city .
for hertha , the drawback with the olympic stadium is its size .
the athletics track bordering the pitch also means fans are some distance from the soccer action , unlike crowds at frankfurt , hamburg , borussia dortmund and bayern munich , which itself moved from the munich olympic stadium to the allianz arena for similar reasons , where stands rise just a few meters from the touch-line .
berlin 's olympic stadium has a 76,000 maximum crowd capacity , but about the only time hertha draws a crowd that size is when it plays bayern at home in the league .
at most other games , the stadium remains only about 50 percent occupied .
this has led to discussions at the club , with officials - club manager dieter hoeness among them - openly favoring a " soccer only " club ground .
hertha pay around 4.5 million euros in annual rent for the olympic stadium , and are currently contracted to stay at the olympic stadium until the year 2017 but hoeness says the club is not seeking to change that arrangement .
but he notes that if hertha pursues the idea of building a new club ground a minimum period of seven or eight years planning would be needed before it was realized .
huge home ground swallows smalls crowds bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : no every day can be world cup final day in berlin hertha 's problems were highlighted a fortnight ago when the club entertained dublin side st patrick 's athletic in an uefa cup match at home , and only 13,000 spectators showed up .
similarly at the club 's first two home league matches this season the home ground was barely 50 per cent occupied while last season average attendances of 44,483 were achieved .
berlin city government officials have been surprised by the talk of hertha possibly wanting to exit the olympic stadium .
for erhart koerting , berlin 's social democrat interior and sport minister , the olympic stadium is a world-famous sports facility , as evidenced by its hosting of the 2009 world athletics championships .
it underwent a major 282-million-euro revamp in the run-up to the 2006 world cup , when it was endowed with a spectacular oval-shaped roof , towering 68 meters above its enlarged seating area and bevy of vip loges .
for that reason alone , hertha could not expect financial support from the public purse if it was to build a new stadium , said koerting .
opinion divided over relocation bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : few sides can boast such a spectacular home stadium even hertha league players are divided by talk of a new stadium .
steve von bergen , a club defender , says : " it would be a shame if hertha no longer played at the olympic stadium .
the stadium is a monument .
every day people come to look at it , even when there is n't football activity there . "
club goalkeeper jaroslav drobny takes another view .
" naturally the olympic stadium has a long tradition , but times have changed .
when hertha played st patrick 's recently the stadium was empty , one could hear the fans , but not see them , " he claimed .
" the club deserves to play in a stadium which is 100 per-cent tailored for football , " he reckons .
midfield player fabian lustenberger , on the other hand , says the " football atmosphere " at the stadium is not as bad as it 's often painted .
" in dortmund or hamburg the soccer feeling is great but at bayern munich the atmosphere 's hardly sensational at times , " he points out . dpa news agency -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

but rarely do enough fans show up to fill the enormous stadium . as a result hertha 's management is currently pondering saying " auf wiedersehen " to the stadium - where legendary black us sprinter jesse owens made athletics history 72 years ago by bagging four olympic gold medals - and building a new " soccer-only " stadium elsewhere in the city .
for hertha , the drawback with the olympic stadium is its size .
the athletics track bordering the pitch also means fans are some distance from the soccer action , unlike crowds at frankfurt , hamburg , borussia dortmund and bayern munich , which itself moved from the munich olympic stadium to the allianz arena for similar reasons , where stands rise just a few meters from the touch-line .
berlin 's olympic stadium has a 76,000 maximum crowd capacity , but about the only time hertha draws a crowd that size is when it plays bayern at home in the league .
at most other games , the stadium remains only about 50 percent occupied .
this has led to discussions at the club , with officials - club manager dieter hoeness among them - openly favoring a " soccer only " club ground .
hertha pay around 4.5 million euros in annual rent for the olympic stadium , and are currently contracted to stay at the olympic stadium until the year 2017 but hoeness says the club is not seeking to change that arrangement .
but he notes that if hertha pursues the idea of building a new club ground a minimum period of seven or eight years planning would be needed before it was realized .
huge home ground swallows smalls crowds bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : no every day can be world cup final day in berlin hertha 's problems were highlighted a fortnight ago when the club entertained dublin side st patrick 's athletic in an uefa cup match at home , and only 13,000 spectators showed up .
similarly at the club 's first two home league matches this season the home ground was barely 50 per cent occupied while last season average attendances of 44,483 were achieved .
berlin city government officials have been surprised by the talk of hertha possibly wanting to exit the olympic stadium .
for erhart koerting , berlin 's social democrat interior and sport minister , the olympic stadium is a world-famous sports facility , as evidenced by its hosting of the 2009 world athletics championships .
it underwent a major 282-million-euro revamp in the run-up to the 2006 world cup , when it was endowed with a spectacular oval-shaped roof , towering 68 meters above its enlarged seating area and bevy of vip loges .
for that reason alone , hertha could not expect financial support from the public purse if it was to build a new stadium , said koerting .
opinion divided over relocation bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : few sides can boast such a spectacular home stadium even hertha league players are divided by talk of a new stadium .
steve von bergen , a club defender , says : " it would be a shame if hertha no longer played at the olympic stadium .
the stadium is a monument .
every day people come to look at it , even when there is n't football activity there . "
club goalkeeper jaroslav drobny takes another view .
" naturally the olympic stadium has a long tradition , but times have changed .
when hertha played st patrick 's recently the stadium was empty , one could hear the fans , but not see them , " he claimed .
" the club deserves to play in a stadium which is 100 per-cent tailored for football , " he reckons .
midfield player fabian lustenberger , on the other hand , says the " football atmosphere " at the stadium is not as bad as it 's often painted .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de opinion -pipe- 29.09.2008 opinion : the bavarian earthquake sends tremors through berlin großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the shockwaves of the christian social union 's -lrb- csu -rrb- worst showing in half a century of bavarian state elections are being felt in berlin , dw 's peter stützle says .
the results could have an effect on national elections . the result of the state elections in bavaria is like an earthquake shaking german politics .
the csu 's absolute majority in the state was considered to be a law of nature but now that law has been smashed and the csu must find itself a coalition partner - it 's something only old bavarians know from the 1950s .
the shockwaves from this earthquake reach all the way to berlin .
angela merkel wants to continue as chancellor after next year 's parliamentary election but not as the head of the deeply unpopular grand coalition with the social democrats .
she would much prefer the fdp free market liberals . for that to happen , it 's not just the fdp that needs to ratchet up votes .
the conservatives from merkel 's christian democratic union -lrb- cdu -rrb- and its sister party , the christian social -lrb- csu -rrb- need to hugely boost their support .
right now , however the csu has done just the opposite , by suffering massive losses in bavaria .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : peter stützle admittedly , the earthquake has n't exactly put the brand new chancellor candidate of germany 's social democrats , frank-walter steinmeier , in a better position .
despite the weakness of the ruling csu , the social democrats in bavaria could n't capitalize on the conservatives ' disarray and recorded their worst result in five years .
steinmeier 's dream partners , the greens and the fdp may both have increased their gains but a three-way coalition of the spd , greens and the fdp can only work if the spd becomes stronger - if anything , the party has just gotten a little weaker .
one of the most striking results of the bavarian election has been the continuing erosion of germany 's two biggest traditional parties , the spd and the cdu .
it 's a development that has become apparent in all state elections in recent years and in the general elections in 2005 .
what 's equally striking is that the ensuing political camps remain largely unchanged . disillusioned spd supporters usually turn toward the left party and partly toward the greens while fed-up conservative voters flock to the fdp and , in the case of bavaria , to the free voters .
the free voters , a grassroots organization which largely includes former csu members , attaches great importance to the principle that they are n't beholden to any party line .
the group however will not contest the general elections next year which means that a lot of their voters could return to the csu .
the grand coalition in berlin now needs to roll up their sleeves to finish off what they started . a few important decisions loom in the next weeks such as tax reforms .
it 's not clear how the csu will react in the grand coalition in berlin , whether it will be stubborn or more open to compromise . if the tensions between the ruling parties continue and increase , then this could exacerbate the frustration in the populace which in turn could accelerate the erosion of the two main parties .
in the end , both the conservative bloc as well as the spd may have no other option other than to forge a new large coalition . peter stützle -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?
dw-world.de bavarian conservatives lose state majority in damaging defeat bavaria 's christian social union -lrb- csu -rrb- lost its decades-old absolute majority as voters defected to smaller parties in a state election seen as a test of support ahead of national polls next year .
-lrb- 29.09.2008 -rrb- heavy election losses likely to end csu 's lone rule in bavaria bavaria 's conservative christian social union -lrb- csu -rrb- suffered heavy losses in sunday 's state elections that will likely end the party 's decades-long rule without a coalition partner .

but rarely do enough fans show up to fill the enormous stadium . as a result hertha 's management is currently pondering saying " auf wiedersehen " to the stadium - where legendary black us sprinter jesse owens made athletics history 72 years ago by bagging four olympic gold medals - and building a new " soccer-only " stadium elsewhere in the city .
for hertha , the drawback with the olympic stadium is its size .
the athletics track bordering the pitch also means fans are some distance from the soccer action , unlike crowds at frankfurt , hamburg , borussia dortmund and bayern munich , which itself moved from the munich olympic stadium to the allianz arena for similar reasons , where stands rise just a few meters from the touch-line .
berlin 's olympic stadium has a 76,000 maximum crowd capacity , but about the only time hertha draws a crowd that size is when it plays bayern at home in the league .
at most other games , the stadium remains only about 50 percent occupied .
this has led to discussions at the club , with officials - club manager dieter hoeness among them - openly favoring a " soccer only " club ground .
hertha pay around 4.5 million euros in annual rent for the olympic stadium , and are currently contracted to stay at the olympic stadium until the year 2017 but hoeness says the club is not seeking to change that arrangement .
but he notes that if hertha pursues the idea of building a new club ground a minimum period of seven or eight years planning would be needed before it was realized .
huge home ground swallows smalls crowds bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : no every day can be world cup final day in berlin hertha 's problems were highlighted a fortnight ago when the club entertained dublin side st patrick 's athletic in an uefa cup match at home , and only 13,000 spectators showed up .
similarly at the club 's first two home league matches this season the home ground was barely 50 per cent occupied while last season average attendances of 44,483 were achieved .
berlin city government officials have been surprised by the talk of hertha possibly wanting to exit the olympic stadium .
for erhart koerting , berlin 's social democrat interior and sport minister , the olympic stadium is a world-famous sports facility , as evidenced by its hosting of the 2009 world athletics championships .
it underwent a major 282-million-euro revamp in the run-up to the 2006 world cup , when it was endowed with a spectacular oval-shaped roof , towering 68 meters above its enlarged seating area and bevy of vip loges .
for that reason alone , hertha could not expect financial support from the public purse if it was to build a new stadium , said koerting .
opinion divided over relocation bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : few sides can boast such a spectacular home stadium even hertha league players are divided by talk of a new stadium .
steve von bergen , a club defender , says : " it would be a shame if hertha no longer played at the olympic stadium .
the stadium is a monument .
every day people come to look at it , even when there is n't football activity there . "
club goalkeeper jaroslav drobny takes another view .
" naturally the olympic stadium has a long tradition , but times have changed .
when hertha played st patrick 's recently the stadium was empty , one could hear the fans , but not see them , " he claimed .
" the club deserves to play in a stadium which is 100 per-cent tailored for football , " he reckons .
midfield player fabian lustenberger , on the other hand , says the " football atmosphere " at the stadium is not as bad as it 's often painted .
" in dortmund or hamburg the soccer feeling is great but at bayern munich the atmosphere 's hardly sensational at times , " he points out . dpa news agency -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

but in terms of structure , the free voters are miles apart .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de finance -pipe- 29.09.2008 benelux countries to bail out sinking fortis group großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : experts predicted fortis faced collapse unless a radical rescue package was found as washington prepares to vote on its massive bailout plan , the european central bank gave the green light to a rapid nationalization of the benelux financial group fortis in a bid to save one of europe 's top 20 banks . after emergency discussions with ecb president jean-claude trichet on sunday , sept .
28 , the belgian , dutch and luxembourg governments agreed to inject 11.2 billion euros -lrb- $ 16.4 billion -rrb- into the banking and insurance company fortis after a weekend of high drama .
the presence of trichet , who as ecb head is responsible for safeguarding financial stability in the euro zone , was unprecedented in a commercial bank rescue and underlined the seriousness of concern for the integrity of the euro zone 's financial system .
in the first major bank crisis to hit the euro zone in 13 months of global financial turmoil that began in the united states , fortis looked to be in severe danger with some experts concerned that the tri-nation group could go under by monday if nothing was done to save it .
fortis saw its shares drop by a third last week on investor concerns about its liquidity and funding which stem from last year 's 70 billion euro purchase of dutch bank abn amro with partners royal bank of scotland and spain 's santander .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : fortis ' troubles can be traced to the purchase of abn shares dived more than 20 percent to 15-year lows on friday despite a statement that the group 's position was solid and a pledge to expand asset sales to as much as 10 billion euros .
the group 's market capitalization also slumped from 50 billion euros after the abn purchase to just 12 billion euros on friday .
fortis group too large not to be saved fortis , with 85,000 staff worldwide , is the biggest private sector employer in belgium and more than 1.5 million households , roughly half the country , bank with the group .
" we could have not intervened , but the question was whether fortis would have survived on monday , " dutch finance minister wouter bos told reporters .
the benelux governments chose a partial state buyout after two private bidders made paltry offers for the group last week .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the fortis nationalization dwarfs that on northen rock each government will take a 49 percent stake in fortis banks in their respective countries .
belgium will put in 4.7 billion euros , the netherlands 4 billion and luxembourg 2.5 billion , the latter in the form of a convertible loan .
the group 's nationalization dwarfs britain 's state takeover of fallen mortgage lender northern rock last year .
france 's bnp paribas allegedly pulled out of a deal last week after offering just 1.60 euros per share for fortis , compared to friday 's closing price of 5.20 , and demanding state guarantees against possible future losses , a source said .
the dutch ing group was alleged to have bid just 1.5 euros per share .
" there was no serious bidder for the intrinsic value of the whole group , " the source told reuters news agency .
bnp paribas and ing declined comment on reports that they had bid for all or part of fortis .
nationalization comes as all eyes turn to us bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the us federal reserve 's ben bernanke feels the pressure fortis said in a statement it expected total negative value adjustments of about 5 billion euros after tax in the third quarter .
it added its core equity would be around 30 billion euros , resulting in a 9.5 billion euro excess core equity .
the group also said that it will sell the parts of abn that it bought last year .
fortis chairman maurice lippens , accused by shareholders of concealing the bank 's troubles for too long , resigned after the news of the nationalization broke .
fortis also named filip dierckx as chief executive on friday evening , hastily replacing caretaker herman verwilst .
the fortis nationalization came as financial groups around the world watch for any movement from us lawmakers who are still debating whether to sign off on a deal to create a $ 700 billion government fund to buy bad debt from ailing us banks in a bid to stem a credit crisis threatening the global economy . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

many of the votes went to another conservative party , the free voters . the freie waehler , or free voters , won 10.2 percent of the vote , surprising everyone , including themselves .
the election result now makes them the third strongest party in bavaria , behind the once mighty csu and the social democrats .
the free voters have contested two previous bavarian state elections but failed on both occasions to win the five percent required to enter parliament .
“ we 've been wall flowers for long enough , ” said the party 's state chairman , hubert aiwanger , after the results from sunday 's election came through .
“ we 're a force that bavaria has long waited for , ” he added .

the election result now makes them the third strongest party in bavaria , behind the once mighty csu and the social democrats . the free voters have contested two previous bavarian state elections but failed on both occasions to win the five percent required to enter parliament . " we 've been wall flowers for long enough , " said the party 's state chairman , hubert aiwanger , after the results from sunday 's election came through . " we 're a force that bavaria has long waited for , " he added . the main csu party now has to find a coalition partner to form a government .
the liberal free democrats party -lrb- fdp -rrb- is considered the most likely contender .
with eight percent polled , the fdp will enter parliament for the first time in 14 years .
the free voters are considered the second best option , and hubert aiwanger has not ruled out working with the csu . surprise success the party 's success this time around could be linked to one of its newest members : gabriele pauli .
she joined the party earlier this year , after leaving the csu in controversial circumstances last year . it was partly due to her that former csu leader edmund stoiber left the party .
she 'd openly criticised stoiber , and commentators are now asking whether this was the start of the csu 's downward spiral . with pauli on board , the free voters received much more coverage in the media , at a time when voters were looking away from the csu . in terms of policy , the free voters do n't differ greatly from the main csu party .
but in terms of structure , the free voters are miles apart .
they consider themselves a grassroots organization , and do n't have the same hierarchical structures as other political parties .
their only ideology , they say , is that they are not a party . dw staff -lrb- cla -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

egyptian authorities said the hostages were freed after a mission near the sudan-chad border and that half the kidnappers were killed .
the kidnappers had demanded a six-million-euro ransom for the hostages - to be paid by germany - but authorities insisted no ransom changed hands .
the identity of the kidnappers has still not been confirmed , but reports speculate the bandits may have been connected with a darfur rebel group , a faction of the sudanese liberation army .
however , none of the region 's rebel groups have claimed responsibility for the kidnapping .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de finance -pipe- 29.09.2008 benelux countries to bail out sinking fortis group großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : experts predicted fortis faced collapse unless a radical rescue package was found as washington prepares to vote on its massive bailout plan , the european central bank gave the green light to a rapid nationalization of the benelux financial group fortis in a bid to save one of europe 's top 20 banks . after emergency discussions with ecb president jean-claude trichet on sunday , sept .
28 , the belgian , dutch and luxembourg governments agreed to inject 11.2 billion euros -lrb- $ 16.4 billion -rrb- into the banking and insurance company fortis after a weekend of high drama .
the presence of trichet , who as ecb head is responsible for safeguarding financial stability in the euro zone , was unprecedented in a commercial bank rescue and underlined the seriousness of concern for the integrity of the euro zone 's financial system .
in the first major bank crisis to hit the euro zone in 13 months of global financial turmoil that began in the united states , fortis looked to be in severe danger with some experts concerned that the tri-nation group could go under by monday if nothing was done to save it .
fortis saw its shares drop by a third last week on investor concerns about its liquidity and funding which stem from last year 's 70 billion euro purchase of dutch bank abn amro with partners royal bank of scotland and spain 's santander .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : fortis ' troubles can be traced to the purchase of abn shares dived more than 20 percent to 15-year lows on friday despite a statement that the group 's position was solid and a pledge to expand asset sales to as much as 10 billion euros .
the group 's market capitalization also slumped from 50 billion euros after the abn purchase to just 12 billion euros on friday .
fortis group too large not to be saved fortis , with 85,000 staff worldwide , is the biggest private sector employer in belgium and more than 1.5 million households , roughly half the country , bank with the group .
" we could have not intervened , but the question was whether fortis would have survived on monday , " dutch finance minister wouter bos told reporters .
the benelux governments chose a partial state buyout after two private bidders made paltry offers for the group last week .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the fortis nationalization dwarfs that on northen rock each government will take a 49 percent stake in fortis banks in their respective countries .
belgium will put in 4.7 billion euros , the netherlands 4 billion and luxembourg 2.5 billion , the latter in the form of a convertible loan .
the group 's nationalization dwarfs britain 's state takeover of fallen mortgage lender northern rock last year .
france 's bnp paribas allegedly pulled out of a deal last week after offering just 1.60 euros per share for fortis , compared to friday 's closing price of 5.20 , and demanding state guarantees against possible future losses , a source said .
the dutch ing group was alleged to have bid just 1.5 euros per share .
" there was no serious bidder for the intrinsic value of the whole group , " the source told reuters news agency .
bnp paribas and ing declined comment on reports that they had bid for all or part of fortis .
nationalization comes as all eyes turn to us bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the us federal reserve 's ben bernanke feels the pressure fortis said in a statement it expected total negative value adjustments of about 5 billion euros after tax in the third quarter .
it added its core equity would be around 30 billion euros , resulting in a 9.5 billion euro excess core equity .
the group also said that it will sell the parts of abn that it bought last year .
fortis chairman maurice lippens , accused by shareholders of concealing the bank 's troubles for too long , resigned after the news of the nationalization broke .
fortis also named filip dierckx as chief executive on friday evening , hastily replacing caretaker herman verwilst .
the fortis nationalization came as financial groups around the world watch for any movement from us lawmakers who are still debating whether to sign off on a deal to create a $ 700 billion government fund to buy bad debt from ailing us banks in a bid to stem a credit crisis threatening the global economy . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

egyptian authorities said the hostages were freed after a mission near the sudan-chad border and that half the kidnappers were killed .
the kidnappers had demanded a six-million-euro ransom for the hostages - to be paid by germany - but authorities insisted no ransom changed hands .
the identity of the kidnappers has still not been confirmed , but reports speculate the bandits may have been connected with a darfur rebel group , a faction of the sudanese liberation army .
however , none of the region 's rebel groups have claimed responsibility for the kidnapping .
steinmeier uncertain over release details german foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier thanked the authorities that contributed toward securing a " happy ending to the hijacking . "

the german finance ministry in berlin said it has provided hre guarantees for an emergency credit line totalling 35 billion euros -lrb- $ 50 billion -rrb- .
the ministry added that it had no intention of nationalizing the lender . a spokesman said the commitment was needed so that banks could bail out hre , but the actual losses were not that high . sources said the commitment could potentially strain chancellor angela merkel 's federal budget .
germany 's parliament would have to vote on the bailout package .
hre is the first major german casualty of the current worldwide financial crisis . hre said in munich that a consortium of banks came to its rescue overnight as it faced a refinancing squeeze , extending credit to tide over the problems .
hre did not name the banks or disclose the size of the bailout . stock price plummets amid news of bailout as trading began on the frankfurt stock exchange , hre shares plunged 63 percent to 4.95 euros , dragging down other banks . hre had earlier been in urgent talks with german banking regulator bafin and the finance ministry seeking a solution . germany 's second-biggest commercial-property lender , a blue chip among the 30 top companies in the dax stock index , had fallen victim to speculation by its dublin-based unit depfa , which specializes in loans to local governments in germany . depfa had pursued long-term projects with heavy loans and generally ensured refinancing only at the last minute .
it was caught short when it could not raise sufficient short-term money . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the us senate banking committee will decide on the plan hre , which also lends money for commercial and industrial property , said it had entered into talks with the banks " in response to the extremely challenging conditions on the international money markets following the lehman collapse and other market disruptions . " commerzbank , germany 's number-two bank , said it had already secured all the refinancing it needed this year and had no desire to take over hre .
commerzbank stock dipped up to 25 percent monday before clawing back some ground . markets plunge as world waits for us plan approval meanwhile , global stock markets tumbled as the us congress was to vote on a multi-billion dollar bailout deal . us lawmakers agreed over the weekend to a $ 700-billion -lrb- 479-billion-euro -rrb- bailout for debt-stricken wall street banks and sent the legislation aiming to stem the us financial crisis for congress to start voting on monday . meanwhile , there were still doubts about the proposed us financial rescue package , which needs to be approved by congress and offers no guarantee of an end to the credit crunch that has ravaged global markets , dealers said . " in our view , while the ' bailout plan ' reduces the risk of a systemic collapse , many downside risks remain - not least those related to a protracted slowdown in the global economy , " barclays capital analyst david woo told reporters .
" in addition ... the financial market turbulence is seriously affecting the european financial system . " woo added : " the weakness in equities ... suggests the market is pessimistic about the likely effectiveness of the -lrb- us -rrb- treasury 's plan . " the us deal , announced just hours before asian markets opened , is designed to mop up toxic debts from struggling banks and prevent further financial chaos that could tip the world 's largest economy into recession . the unprecedented us bailout would be the largest government economic intervention since the great depression of the 1930s , and aims to shore up an economy in the face of a severe housing slump . us treasury secretary henry paulson said the package " gives us the flexibility to unclog our financial markets -lrb- and -rrb- increase the ability of our financial institutions to deliver the credit that will help create jobs . " ecb offers special loan as france call emergency meeting the european central bank monday announced a special 38-day euro loan to provide euro zone banks with more cash in a bid to balance conditions on extremely tense interbank money markets . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : sarkozy wants to insure the safety of france 's banks also on monday , french president nicolas sarkozy said he will meet with the chief executives of leading french banks and insurance companies to discuss the global financial crisis on tuesday . the meeting at the elysee presidential palace is to " review the situation of financial institutions and the credit level of households and businesses , " said a statement from the presidency on monday . sarkozy warned in a major address last week that france would not be spared from the turmoil unleashed by the us banking crisis . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

experts also said the two parties were successful at portraying themselves as caring for lower-income voters worried about rising prices .
although the social democrats pushed a package of social spending bills through parliament mere days before the elections , the freedom party had more credibility with social issues , fritz plasser of innsbruck university said .
" supporting the weak helped them , " plasser said .
strache 's anti-european union rhetoric also resonated in a country where 47 percent of the population thinks austria has not benefited from being an eu member .
but despite these factors , there is no denying that strache 's freedom party , and , to a lesser extent , haider 's alliance , banked on voters ' anti-immigrant and anti-islamic sentiments .
controversial electioneering at strache 's final election rally in one of vienna 's working class districts last friday , the crowd cheered loudest not when he spoke about social issues , but when he complained that foreigners were now allowed to live in social housing projects .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : haider made yet another comeback in sunday 's election haider suggested during the election race that all asylum seekers should be made to wear electronic tags to monitor their movements .
although it is clear that both right-wing parties will play a bigger role in austrian politics , both social democrats and conservatives have so far ruled out forming coalitions with strache or haider .
" the spoe will be somewhat tempted , " to cooperate with the freedom party , gerlich said .
but his colleague plasser said that such a coalition would create a deep split among social democrats .
there is also a rumor about a -lrb- social democratic -rrb- minority government with parliamentary support from the freedom party , gerlich said . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

many of the votes went to another conservative party , the free voters . the freie waehler , or free voters , won 10.2 percent of the vote , surprising everyone , including themselves .
the election result now makes them the third strongest party in bavaria , behind the once mighty csu and the social democrats .
the free voters have contested two previous bavarian state elections but failed on both occasions to win the five percent required to enter parliament .
“ we 've been wall flowers for long enough , ” said the party 's state chairman , hubert aiwanger , after the results from sunday 's election came through .
“ we 're a force that bavaria has long waited for , ” he added .

" we 've been wall flowers for long enough , " said the party 's state chairman , hubert aiwanger , after the results from sunday 's election came through . " we 're a force that bavaria has long waited for , " he added . the main csu party now has to find a coalition partner to form a government .
the liberal free democrats party -lrb- fdp -rrb- is considered the most likely contender .
with eight percent polled , the fdp will enter parliament for the first time in 14 years .
the free voters are considered the second best option , and hubert aiwanger has not ruled out working with the csu . surprise success the party 's success this time around could be linked to one of its newest members : gabriele pauli .
she joined the party earlier this year , after leaving the csu in controversial circumstances last year . it was partly due to her that former csu leader edmund stoiber left the party .
she 'd openly criticised stoiber , and commentators are now asking whether this was the start of the csu 's downward spiral . with pauli on board , the free voters received much more coverage in the media , at a time when voters were looking away from the csu . in terms of policy , the free voters do n't differ greatly from the main csu party .
but in terms of structure , the free voters are miles apart .
they consider themselves a grassroots organization , and do n't have the same hierarchical structures as other political parties .
their only ideology , they say , is that they are not a party . dw staff -lrb- cla -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the german finance ministry in berlin said it has provided hre guarantees for an emergency credit line totalling 35 billion euros -lrb- $ 50 billion -rrb- .
the ministry added that it had no intention of nationalizing the lender . a spokesman said the commitment was needed so that banks could bail out hre , but the actual losses were not that high . sources said the commitment could potentially strain chancellor angela merkel 's federal budget .
germany 's parliament would have to vote on the bailout package .
hre is the first major german casualty of the current worldwide financial crisis . hre said in munich that a consortium of banks came to its rescue overnight as it faced a refinancing squeeze , extending credit to tide over the problems .
hre did not name the banks or disclose the size of the bailout . stock price plummets amid news of bailout as trading began on the frankfurt stock exchange , hre shares plunged 63 percent to 4.95 euros , dragging down other banks . hre had earlier been in urgent talks with german banking regulator bafin and the finance ministry seeking a solution . germany 's second-biggest commercial-property lender , a blue chip among the 30 top companies in the dax stock index , had fallen victim to speculation by its dublin-based unit depfa , which specializes in loans to local governments in germany . depfa had pursued long-term projects with heavy loans and generally ensured refinancing only at the last minute .
it was caught short when it could not raise sufficient short-term money . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the us senate banking committee will decide on the plan hre , which also lends money for commercial and industrial property , said it had entered into talks with the banks " in response to the extremely challenging conditions on the international money markets following the lehman collapse and other market disruptions . " commerzbank , germany 's number-two bank , said it had already secured all the refinancing it needed this year and had no desire to take over hre .
commerzbank stock dipped up to 25 percent monday before clawing back some ground . markets plunge as world waits for us plan approval meanwhile , global stock markets tumbled as the us congress was to vote on a multi-billion dollar bailout deal . us lawmakers agreed over the weekend to a $ 700-billion -lrb- 479-billion-euro -rrb- bailout for debt-stricken wall street banks and sent the legislation aiming to stem the us financial crisis for congress to start voting on monday . meanwhile , there were still doubts about the proposed us financial rescue package , which needs to be approved by congress and offers no guarantee of an end to the credit crunch that has ravaged global markets , dealers said . " in our view , while the ' bailout plan ' reduces the risk of a systemic collapse , many downside risks remain - not least those related to a protracted slowdown in the global economy , " barclays capital analyst david woo told reporters .
" in addition ... the financial market turbulence is seriously affecting the european financial system . " woo added : " the weakness in equities ... suggests the market is pessimistic about the likely effectiveness of the -lrb- us -rrb- treasury 's plan . " the us deal , announced just hours before asian markets opened , is designed to mop up toxic debts from struggling banks and prevent further financial chaos that could tip the world 's largest economy into recession . the unprecedented us bailout would be the largest government economic intervention since the great depression of the 1930s , and aims to shore up an economy in the face of a severe housing slump . us treasury secretary henry paulson said the package " gives us the flexibility to unclog our financial markets -lrb- and -rrb- increase the ability of our financial institutions to deliver the credit that will help create jobs . " ecb offers special loan as france call emergency meeting the european central bank monday announced a special 38-day euro loan to provide euro zone banks with more cash in a bid to balance conditions on extremely tense interbank money markets . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : sarkozy wants to insure the safety of france 's banks also on monday , french president nicolas sarkozy said he will meet with the chief executives of leading french banks and insurance companies to discuss the global financial crisis on tuesday . the meeting at the elysee presidential palace is to " review the situation of financial institutions and the credit level of households and businesses , " said a statement from the presidency on monday . sarkozy warned in a major address last week that france would not be spared from the turmoil unleashed by the us banking crisis . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de bundesliga -pipe- 29.09.2008 hertha consider moving out of berlin 's olympic stadium großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hugely impressive and steeped in history , the olympic stadium is also hard to fill for decades berlin 's multi-functional olympic stadium , built for the 1936 " nazi " games , has served as the " home " of bundesliga club hertha berlin .
but rarely do enough fans show up to fill the enormous stadium . as a result hertha 's management is currently pondering saying " auf wiedersehen " to the stadium - where legendary black us sprinter jesse owens made athletics history 72 years ago by bagging four olympic gold medals - and building a new " soccer-only " stadium elsewhere in the city .
for hertha , the drawback with the olympic stadium is its size .
the athletics track bordering the pitch also means fans are some distance from the soccer action , unlike crowds at frankfurt , hamburg , borussia dortmund and bayern munich , which itself moved from the munich olympic stadium to the allianz arena for similar reasons , where stands rise just a few meters from the touch-line .
berlin 's olympic stadium has a 76,000 maximum crowd capacity , but about the only time hertha draws a crowd that size is when it plays bayern at home in the league .
at most other games , the stadium remains only about 50 percent occupied .
this has led to discussions at the club , with officials - club manager dieter hoeness among them - openly favoring a " soccer only " club ground .
hertha pay around 4.5 million euros in annual rent for the olympic stadium , and are currently contracted to stay at the olympic stadium until the year 2017 but hoeness says the club is not seeking to change that arrangement .
but he notes that if hertha pursues the idea of building a new club ground a minimum period of seven or eight years planning would be needed before it was realized .
huge home ground swallows smalls crowds bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : no every day can be world cup final day in berlin hertha 's problems were highlighted a fortnight ago when the club entertained dublin side st patrick 's athletic in an uefa cup match at home , and only 13,000 spectators showed up .
similarly at the club 's first two home league matches this season the home ground was barely 50 per cent occupied while last season average attendances of 44,483 were achieved .
berlin city government officials have been surprised by the talk of hertha possibly wanting to exit the olympic stadium .
for erhart koerting , berlin 's social democrat interior and sport minister , the olympic stadium is a world-famous sports facility , as evidenced by its hosting of the 2009 world athletics championships .
it underwent a major 282-million-euro revamp in the run-up to the 2006 world cup , when it was endowed with a spectacular oval-shaped roof , towering 68 meters above its enlarged seating area and bevy of vip loges .
for that reason alone , hertha could not expect financial support from the public purse if it was to build a new stadium , said koerting .
opinion divided over relocation bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : few sides can boast such a spectacular home stadium even hertha league players are divided by talk of a new stadium .
steve von bergen , a club defender , says : " it would be a shame if hertha no longer played at the olympic stadium .
the stadium is a monument .
every day people come to look at it , even when there is n't football activity there . "
club goalkeeper jaroslav drobny takes another view .
" naturally the olympic stadium has a long tradition , but times have changed .
when hertha played st patrick 's recently the stadium was empty , one could hear the fans , but not see them , " he claimed .
" the club deserves to play in a stadium which is 100 per-cent tailored for football , " he reckons .
midfield player fabian lustenberger , on the other hand , says the " football atmosphere " at the stadium is not as bad as it 's often painted .
" in dortmund or hamburg the soccer feeling is great but at bayern munich the atmosphere 's hardly sensational at times , " he points out . dpa news agency -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the csu polled 43.4 percent of the vote on sunday , sept .
28 , in its worst showing in half a century .
the center-left social democrats -lrb- spd -rrb- , which govern in a grand coalition with merkel 's party in berlin , polled 18.6 percent , a decline of 1 percentage point from the last state election in 2003 . csu secretary general christine haderthauer said the disastrous result was a black day for the party , which had ruled unchallenged for more than 40 years .
in the last state elections in 2003 , the csu polled 60.7 percent of the vote in the strongly catholic state , where some of germany 's leading companies have their headquarters , including siemens and bmw .
the party 's stated intent had been to retain its absolute majority in the 180-seat parliament in munich .
" we have clearly failed to achieve our goal , " haderthauer said .
beckstein refuses to shoulder the blame bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : beckstein and huber will face an inquest into the defeat state prime minister guenther beckstein , who was elected last year after longtime leader edmund stoiber was toppled in a party revolt , ruled out stepping down to take responsibility for the poor showing .
" the people have shown that they want a csu-led government , but that they do not want the csu to govern bavaria alone , " he said , adding that the party would immediately start to look for a coalition partner .
the most likely contenders are the liberal free democrats -lrb- fdp -rrb- , who polled 8 percent of the vote to enter parliament after an absence of 14 years .
the liberals are eyeing a coalition with the cdu at the national level next year , but shifting alliances in the party landscape could make a wider alliance possible .
another possibility is the free voters , a conservative party that will make its parliamentary debut after winning 10.2 percent on a platform seeking greater local power .
the environmentalist greens won 9.4 percent , but the pro-labor left party at 4.3 percent failed to clear the 5 percent hurdle needed to get into parliament . the csu 's good showing in bavaria in the 2004 general election helped elevate merkel to power , but its popularity has been steadily eroding under beckstein and party chairman erwin huber . losses by the state-owned bank bayernlb , the scrapping of a prestigious super-fast train link to the munich airport and a controversial smoking ban combined to fuel voter discontent .
analysts said the party 's poor performance could increase pressure on the csu leadership , which had been criticized for running a tepid campaign and failing to galvanize voters . the party ran a campaign highlighting the csu 's past successes while pushing for greater tax breaks for commuters and better conditions for working mothers .
state losses could have national ramifications the dramatic losses suffered by the csu in bavaria have ramifications well beyond the borders of germany 's largest state .
the shockwaves reached as far as berlin , where merkel rules in an uneasy grand coalition with the left-of-center social democrats -lrb- spd -rrb- . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel will want answers from the csu leadership analysts said that the outcome could increase tension between the coalition partners and hurt merkel 's chances of retaining power in federal elections scheduled for september 2009 .
foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier , who has been picked by the spd to challenge merkel for the chancellorship , said the vote had far-reaching implications .
" we are not talking about an election result , " he said , " but about an earthquake that has been unleashed by this election in bavaria . "
but he did n't mention that his party 's own performance of just over 18 percent was also its worst-ever showing in the prosperous state of laptops and lederhosen .
analysts said that voters punished the csu for clinging to traditional social values and catholic church doctrine in a europe that has become increasingly secular .
it did not help that beckstein and party chairman erwin huber lacked the charisma of stoiber and failed to galvanize voters to support a fresh vision .
recent state elections have seen coalitions between the cdu and greens in hamburg , and the spd eyeing an alliance with the greens and the left in hesse , where there is a minority cdu caretaker government .
the defeated spd candidate in bavaria , franz maget , even suggested a four-party coalition to unseat the csu , arguing that the ruling party had morally lost the right to govern .

28 , the belgian , dutch and luxembourg governments agreed to inject 11.2 billion euros -lrb- $ 16.4 billion -rrb- into the banking and insurance company fortis after a weekend of high drama .
the presence of trichet , who as ecb head is responsible for safeguarding financial stability in the euro zone , was unprecedented in a commercial bank rescue and underlined the seriousness of concern for the integrity of the euro zone 's financial system .
in the first major bank crisis to hit the euro zone in 13 months of global financial turmoil that began in the united states , fortis looked to be in severe danger with some experts concerned that the tri-nation group could go under by monday if nothing was done to save it .
fortis saw its shares drop by a third last week on investor concerns about its liquidity and funding which stem from last year 's 70 billion euro purchase of dutch bank abn amro with partners royal bank of scotland and spain 's santander .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : fortis ' troubles can be traced to the purchase of abn shares dived more than 20 percent to 15-year lows on friday despite a statement that the group 's position was solid and a pledge to expand asset sales to as much as 10 billion euros .
the group 's market capitalization also slumped from 50 billion euros after the abn purchase to just 12 billion euros on friday .
fortis group too large not to be saved fortis , with 85,000 staff worldwide , is the biggest private sector employer in belgium and more than 1.5 million households , roughly half the country , bank with the group .
" we could have not intervened , but the question was whether fortis would have survived on monday , " dutch finance minister wouter bos told reporters .
the benelux governments chose a partial state buyout after two private bidders made paltry offers for the group last week .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the fortis nationalization dwarfs that on northen rock each government will take a 49 percent stake in fortis banks in their respective countries .
belgium will put in 4.7 billion euros , the netherlands 4 billion and luxembourg 2.5 billion , the latter in the form of a convertible loan .
the group 's nationalization dwarfs britain 's state takeover of fallen mortgage lender northern rock last year .
france 's bnp paribas allegedly pulled out of a deal last week after offering just 1.60 euros per share for fortis , compared to friday 's closing price of 5.20 , and demanding state guarantees against possible future losses , a source said .
the dutch ing group was alleged to have bid just 1.5 euros per share .
" there was no serious bidder for the intrinsic value of the whole group , " the source told reuters news agency .
bnp paribas and ing declined comment on reports that they had bid for all or part of fortis .
nationalization comes as all eyes turn to us bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the us federal reserve 's ben bernanke feels the pressure fortis said in a statement it expected total negative value adjustments of about 5 billion euros after tax in the third quarter .
it added its core equity would be around 30 billion euros , resulting in a 9.5 billion euro excess core equity .

fortis chairman maurice lippens , accused by shareholders of concealing the bank 's troubles for too long , resigned after the news of the nationalization broke .
fortis also named filip dierckx as chief executive on friday evening , hastily replacing caretaker herman verwilst .
the fortis nationalization came as financial groups around the world watch for any movement from us lawmakers who are still debating whether to sign off on a deal to create a $ 700 billion government fund to buy bad debt from ailing us banks in a bid to stem a credit crisis threatening the global economy . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

28 . the social democrats -lrb- spoe -rrb- took 29.7 percent while the conservatives -lrb- oevp -rrb- secured 25.6 percent , according to official ministry results , which did not include absentee ballots .
the far-right , meanwhile , established itself as the third political force in austria , with 18.0 percent for the freedom party -lrb- fpoe -rrb- and a surprising 11.0 percent for joerg haider 's smaller alliance for austria 's future -lrb- bzoe -rrb- .
the greens had to settle for fifth place with 9.8 percent .
a total 15 parties were listed on the ballot in sunday 's election , the highest number in austrian electoral history , but most of them did not pass the 4.0-percent threshold to get into parliament .
participation stood at 71.4 percent , out of 6.3 million eligible voters , but some 586,700 absentees still had to be taken into account .
these were to be tallied in the next week with full final results expected on oct .
6 .
bildunterschrift : heinz strache , wilhelm molterer , joerg haider , alex van der bellen , werner faymann in the last general elections in october 2006 , voter participation was 78.49 percent , including absentee ballots .
far-right gains due to disillusionment the far-right gains were the most worrying results of the election but experts said the parties got a massive boost because voters were frustrated with the centrist coalition parties and not because of the rightists ' anti-immigration rhetoric .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : strache has aligned himself with people like le pen the results for heinz christian strache 's fpoe were up seven percent from the last elections in 2006 , while haider 's bzoe more than doubled its votes to 11 percent , from 4 percent in 2006 .
" the main reason was that the government 's dismal performance , " political scientist peter gerlich of the vienna university said , explaining voters ' shift to the far right .
the coalition between social democrats and their junior partner , the conservative people 's party -lrb- oevp -rrb- , split in july after 18 months of bickering and political stalemate .
experts also said the two parties were successful at portraying themselves as caring for lower-income voters worried about rising prices .
although the social democrats pushed a package of social spending bills through parliament mere days before the elections , the freedom party had more credibility with social issues , fritz plasser of innsbruck university said .
" supporting the weak helped them , " plasser said .
strache 's anti-european union rhetoric also resonated in a country where 47 percent of the population thinks austria has not benefited from being an eu member .
but despite these factors , there is no denying that strache 's freedom party , and , to a lesser extent , haider 's alliance , banked on voters ' anti-immigrant and anti-islamic sentiments .
controversial electioneering at strache 's final election rally in one of vienna 's working class districts last friday , the crowd cheered loudest not when he spoke about social issues , but when he complained that foreigners were now allowed to live in social housing projects .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : haider made yet another comeback in sunday 's election haider suggested during the election race that all asylum seekers should be made to wear electronic tags to monitor their movements .
although it is clear that both right-wing parties will play a bigger role in austrian politics , both social democrats and conservatives have so far ruled out forming coalitions with strache or haider .
" the spoe will be somewhat tempted , " to cooperate with the freedom party , gerlich said .
but his colleague plasser said that such a coalition would create a deep split among social democrats .
there is also a rumor about a -lrb- social democratic -rrb- minority government with parliamentary support from the freedom party , gerlich said . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

egyptian authorities said the hostages were freed after a mission near the sudan-chad border and that half the kidnappers were killed .
the kidnappers had demanded a six-million-euro ransom for the hostages - to be paid by germany - but authorities insisted no ransom changed hands .
the identity of the kidnappers has still not been confirmed , but reports speculate the bandits may have been connected with a darfur rebel group , a faction of the sudanese liberation army .
however , none of the region 's rebel groups have claimed responsibility for the kidnapping .
steinmeier uncertain over release details german foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier thanked the authorities that contributed toward securing a " happy ending to the hijacking . "
" i hope -lrb- the freed hostages -rrb- will return to germany as soon as possible , " he said , refusing to elaborate on the circumstances surrounding their release .
" i do not want to reveal details at the moment .
we should wait for the safe return of the hostages first , " he said .
italy thanks involved authorities bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the five germans , five italians and one romanian will undergo medical tests before returning home italian foreign affairs minister franco frattini said the release was the result of " international cooperation for which we should be truly grateful to the authorities of the other countries that worked with us . "
the minister said the release was achieved thanks to " activities that can not be revealed in collaboration with the egyptian authorities , " whom he thanked , " in addition to the germans , who collaborated with -lrb- italy -rrb- and the egyptian , sudanese and libyan authorities for permitting the hostages ’ transit through their respective territories . "
he said italian special forces took part in securing the hostages ' release .
the group - consisting of five germans , five italians and a romanian - was kidnapped sept .
19 while on a desert safari in an isolated south-western region of egypt .
the group was believed to have been first moved across the border to sudan to the remote mountain region of jebel uweinat , a plateau that straddles the borders of egypt , libya and sudan , before the bandits took them into chad , according to sudanese officials .
sudden shootout in an unexpected turn of events sunday , gunfire reportedly broke out between sudanese troops and the hostage-takers after the latter were spotted near the sudan-egypt-libya border area .
the clash ended with the death of six of the bandits and the capture of two .
" the problem was solved .
they had agreed to the ransom .
it was merely a matter of receiving the hostages , but then this surprise happened , " an egyptian security official said . dw staff -lrb- dm -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" ostalgia , " a pun combing " nostalgia and " ost " -lrb- east -rrb- , is on the rise and numerous businesses and individuals are cashing in on the trend .
today , you can have your picture taken with a soviet soldier look-alike at the former checkpoint charlie crossing in berlin or rent a room in a sparsely furnished apartment that is a replica of a 1980s east german accommodation .
you can also take a tour of east berlin in a plastic-body trabi car that east germans had to wait years to buy .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the ' ostel ' hostel in berlin gives visitors a look into the communist gdr " ask the people who run those businesses if they would still want to live in an old , small , box-like flat in a concrete high-rise , " said dagmar schipanski , president of the parliament in the eastern german state of thuringia .
" most of them now own expensive apartments and drive nice cars . "
missing the historical context schipanski makes no attempt to hide her anger when talking about what she regards as " a deliberate exclusion of the real historical context . "
the 65-year-old former scientist , who grew up in the german democratic republic , the eastern part of divided germany , heads a commission that drafted a position paper on eastern germany 's future .
the panel , which also reviewed successes and failures in the eastern region since the wall came down in 1989 , was set up by chancellor angela merkel 's christian democratic party -lrb- cdu -rrb- .
the document , which has been criticized by opposition parties for failing to examine the cdu 's own role in east germany , also suggests strategies for future development .
call for better education a central demand is directed at the education system .
" we need to come to terms with the history of divided germany in our schools , by reforming curricula and teaching practices alike , " said schipanski .
her call is echoed by another recent study assessing the level of knowledge about east and west german history . " pupils know next to nothing , " said klaus schroeder , the berlin professor who headed the survey .
" fewer than one in two knows who built the berlin wall . "
bildunterschrift : not everyone who lived in east germany knows that the berlin wall was built in 1961 on orders from state council chairman walter ulbrich the little they did know they learned from their families or from television shows , which painted a distorted picture , schroeder added .
establishments like die firma -lrb- the firm -rrb- , a pub themed after east germany 's dreaded stasi secret service , which a former stasi informer opened in berlin a few months ago , was " utterly tasteless , " schroeder said .
many students confirmed the findings of the study based on their own experience , jan redmann , a member of the cdu 's youth organization , the ju , told dpa news agency .
" pupils tell us that east germany is often omitted in lessons , " he says .
" that 's also because dealing with the german past for many teachers also means dealing with their own biographies . "
the other side of the story together with other ju members , redmann started an anti-ostalgie campaign three years ago when east german-themed shows first hit german tv screens .
" on these program , celebrities go on about how much fun it was to drive a trabi and to mix their own fuel , " complains campaigner peter tauber .
" but they never mentioned that you had to wait years to get a car in the first place . "
some 700 people have so far signed up to the online campaign , whose web site is decorated with a banana , a symbol of the shortage of imported goods in the soviet-guided east germany .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the new stasi bar in berlin has been frowned upon " citizens were never fully informed about the actual state of the economy , " cdu politician schipanski told dpa .
the upheavals they faced in 1989 were very serious and often meant unemployment or starting a new career from scratch , she said .
" we have to honor their achievements in adapting to a completely different environment . "
she agreed with social scientist schroeder that unemployment and economic deprivation should not be an excuse to paint a glossy picture of life in east germany .
separating state and citizens " we have to make clear that criticizing the system does not mean criticizing the people , " schroeder said .
" but we must improve education about the second german dictatorship , because that 's what it was . "
daniel helbig , who runs the east german-style ostel guesthouse in berlin , did not want to be drawn into the political aspect of the debate .
he pointed out another ostalgie attraction which opened last week in cooperation with his hostel - a 2,200-square-meter -lrb- 23,700-square-foot -rrb- exhibition of artworks commissioned by east germany . dpa news agency -lrb- kjb -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

but rarely do enough fans show up to fill the enormous stadium . as a result hertha 's management is currently pondering saying " auf wiedersehen " to the stadium - where legendary black us sprinter jesse owens made athletics history 72 years ago by bagging four olympic gold medals - and building a new " soccer-only " stadium elsewhere in the city .
for hertha , the drawback with the olympic stadium is its size .
the athletics track bordering the pitch also means fans are some distance from the soccer action , unlike crowds at frankfurt , hamburg , borussia dortmund and bayern munich , which itself moved from the munich olympic stadium to the allianz arena for similar reasons , where stands rise just a few meters from the touch-line .
berlin 's olympic stadium has a 76,000 maximum crowd capacity , but about the only time hertha draws a crowd that size is when it plays bayern at home in the league .
at most other games , the stadium remains only about 50 percent occupied .
this has led to discussions at the club , with officials - club manager dieter hoeness among them - openly favoring a " soccer only " club ground .
hertha pay around 4.5 million euros in annual rent for the olympic stadium , and are currently contracted to stay at the olympic stadium until the year 2017 but hoeness says the club is not seeking to change that arrangement .
but he notes that if hertha pursues the idea of building a new club ground a minimum period of seven or eight years planning would be needed before it was realized .
huge home ground swallows smalls crowds bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : no every day can be world cup final day in berlin hertha 's problems were highlighted a fortnight ago when the club entertained dublin side st patrick 's athletic in an uefa cup match at home , and only 13,000 spectators showed up .
similarly at the club 's first two home league matches this season the home ground was barely 50 per cent occupied while last season average attendances of 44,483 were achieved .
berlin city government officials have been surprised by the talk of hertha possibly wanting to exit the olympic stadium .
for erhart koerting , berlin 's social democrat interior and sport minister , the olympic stadium is a world-famous sports facility , as evidenced by its hosting of the 2009 world athletics championships .
it underwent a major 282-million-euro revamp in the run-up to the 2006 world cup , when it was endowed with a spectacular oval-shaped roof , towering 68 meters above its enlarged seating area and bevy of vip loges .
for that reason alone , hertha could not expect financial support from the public purse if it was to build a new stadium , said koerting .
opinion divided over relocation bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : few sides can boast such a spectacular home stadium even hertha league players are divided by talk of a new stadium .
steve von bergen , a club defender , says : " it would be a shame if hertha no longer played at the olympic stadium .
the stadium is a monument .
every day people come to look at it , even when there is n't football activity there . "
club goalkeeper jaroslav drobny takes another view .

when hertha played st patrick 's recently the stadium was empty , one could hear the fans , but not see them , " he claimed .

the german finance ministry in berlin said it has provided hre guarantees for an emergency credit line totalling 35 billion euros -lrb- $ 50 billion -rrb- .
the ministry added that it had no intention of nationalizing the lender . a spokesman said the commitment was needed so that banks could bail out hre , but the actual losses were not that high . sources said the commitment could potentially strain chancellor angela merkel 's federal budget .
germany 's parliament would have to vote on the bailout package .
hre is the first major german casualty of the current worldwide financial crisis . hre said in munich that a consortium of banks came to its rescue overnight as it faced a refinancing squeeze , extending credit to tide over the problems .
hre did not name the banks or disclose the size of the bailout . stock price plummets amid news of bailout as trading began on the frankfurt stock exchange , hre shares plunged 63 percent to 4.95 euros , dragging down other banks . hre had earlier been in urgent talks with german banking regulator bafin and the finance ministry seeking a solution . germany 's second-biggest commercial-property lender , a blue chip among the 30 top companies in the dax stock index , had fallen victim to speculation by its dublin-based unit depfa , which specializes in loans to local governments in germany . depfa had pursued long-term projects with heavy loans and generally ensured refinancing only at the last minute .
it was caught short when it could not raise sufficient short-term money . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the us senate banking committee will decide on the plan hre , which also lends money for commercial and industrial property , said it had entered into talks with the banks " in response to the extremely challenging conditions on the international money markets following the lehman collapse and other market disruptions . " commerzbank , germany 's number-two bank , said it had already secured all the refinancing it needed this year and had no desire to take over hre .
commerzbank stock dipped up to 25 percent monday before clawing back some ground . markets plunge as world waits for us plan approval meanwhile , global stock markets tumbled as the us congress was to vote on a multi-billion dollar bailout deal . us lawmakers agreed over the weekend to a $ 700-billion -lrb- 479-billion-euro -rrb- bailout for debt-stricken wall street banks and sent the legislation aiming to stem the us financial crisis for congress to start voting on monday . meanwhile , there were still doubts about the proposed us financial rescue package , which needs to be approved by congress and offers no guarantee of an end to the credit crunch that has ravaged global markets , dealers said . " in our view , while the ' bailout plan ' reduces the risk of a systemic collapse , many downside risks remain - not least those related to a protracted slowdown in the global economy , " barclays capital analyst david woo told reporters .
" in addition ... the financial market turbulence is seriously affecting the european financial system . " woo added : " the weakness in equities ... suggests the market is pessimistic about the likely effectiveness of the -lrb- us -rrb- treasury 's plan . " the us deal , announced just hours before asian markets opened , is designed to mop up toxic debts from struggling banks and prevent further financial chaos that could tip the world 's largest economy into recession . the unprecedented us bailout would be the largest government economic intervention since the great depression of the 1930s , and aims to shore up an economy in the face of a severe housing slump . us treasury secretary henry paulson said the package " gives us the flexibility to unclog our financial markets -lrb- and -rrb- increase the ability of our financial institutions to deliver the credit that will help create jobs . " ecb offers special loan as france call emergency meeting the european central bank monday announced a special 38-day euro loan to provide euro zone banks with more cash in a bid to balance conditions on extremely tense interbank money markets . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : sarkozy wants to insure the safety of france 's banks also on monday , french president nicolas sarkozy said he will meet with the chief executives of leading french banks and insurance companies to discuss the global financial crisis on tuesday . the meeting at the elysee presidential palace is to " review the situation of financial institutions and the credit level of households and businesses , " said a statement from the presidency on monday . sarkozy warned in a major address last week that france would not be spared from the turmoil unleashed by the us banking crisis . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de elections -pipe- 29.09.2008 far right enjoys gains as social democrats win austrian election großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : joerg haider -lrb- left -rrb- and his bzoe far-right party were among those who made electoral gains austria 's social democrats won sunday 's elections ahead of the conservative people 's party , but the far-right freedom party made big gains , interior minister maria fekter said sunday , sept .
28 . the social democrats -lrb- spoe -rrb- took 29.7 percent while the conservatives -lrb- oevp -rrb- secured 25.6 percent , according to official ministry results , which did not include absentee ballots .
the far-right , meanwhile , established itself as the third political force in austria , with 18.0 percent for the freedom party -lrb- fpoe -rrb- and a surprising 11.0 percent for joerg haider 's smaller alliance for austria 's future -lrb- bzoe -rrb- .
the greens had to settle for fifth place with 9.8 percent .
a total 15 parties were listed on the ballot in sunday 's election , the highest number in austrian electoral history , but most of them did not pass the 4.0-percent threshold to get into parliament .
participation stood at 71.4 percent , out of 6.3 million eligible voters , but some 586,700 absentees still had to be taken into account .
these were to be tallied in the next week with full final results expected on oct .
6 .
bildunterschrift : heinz strache , wilhelm molterer , joerg haider , alex van der bellen , werner faymann in the last general elections in october 2006 , voter participation was 78.49 percent , including absentee ballots .
far-right gains due to disillusionment the far-right gains were the most worrying results of the election but experts said the parties got a massive boost because voters were frustrated with the centrist coalition parties and not because of the rightists ' anti-immigration rhetoric .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : strache has aligned himself with people like le pen the results for heinz christian strache 's fpoe were up seven percent from the last elections in 2006 , while haider 's bzoe more than doubled its votes to 11 percent , from 4 percent in 2006 .
" the main reason was that the government 's dismal performance , " political scientist peter gerlich of the vienna university said , explaining voters ' shift to the far right .
the coalition between social democrats and their junior partner , the conservative people 's party -lrb- oevp -rrb- , split in july after 18 months of bickering and political stalemate .
experts also said the two parties were successful at portraying themselves as caring for lower-income voters worried about rising prices .
although the social democrats pushed a package of social spending bills through parliament mere days before the elections , the freedom party had more credibility with social issues , fritz plasser of innsbruck university said .
" supporting the weak helped them , " plasser said .
strache 's anti-european union rhetoric also resonated in a country where 47 percent of the population thinks austria has not benefited from being an eu member .
but despite these factors , there is no denying that strache 's freedom party , and , to a lesser extent , haider 's alliance , banked on voters ' anti-immigrant and anti-islamic sentiments .
controversial electioneering at strache 's final election rally in one of vienna 's working class districts last friday , the crowd cheered loudest not when he spoke about social issues , but when he complained that foreigners were now allowed to live in social housing projects .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : haider made yet another comeback in sunday 's election haider suggested during the election race that all asylum seekers should be made to wear electronic tags to monitor their movements .
although it is clear that both right-wing parties will play a bigger role in austrian politics , both social democrats and conservatives have so far ruled out forming coalitions with strache or haider .
" the spoe will be somewhat tempted , " to cooperate with the freedom party , gerlich said .
but his colleague plasser said that such a coalition would create a deep split among social democrats .
there is also a rumor about a -lrb- social democratic -rrb- minority government with parliamentary support from the freedom party , gerlich said . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

some mediterranean regions already receive 20 percent less rain than a century ago , the report said , increasing the risk of forest fires and the desertification of the region .
the report labelled glacier retreat in europe a double-edged sword , projecting an overall increase in river floods across europe , but also an increase in river droughts in the south .
" uncertainty in the rate of melting of greenland 's outlet glaciers makes projections of future sea level rise uncertain , " the report said , adding that according to satellite observations the global sea level had risen by as much as 3.1 mm a year in the past 15 years .
europe a global warming hot spot bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : europe is set to struggle under increasing temperatures caused by global warming the report highlighted the widespread vulnerability of europe to global warming-induced climate change , with mountainous regions , coastal zones , the mediterranean and the arctic set to shoulder the lion 's share of the environmental burden .
" global average temperature has increased almost 0.8 of a degree above pre-industrial levels , with even higher temperature increases in europe and northern latitudes , " the report said .
europe has warmed by 1 degree .
the report 's authors said mitigation and adaptation measures against climate change needed to be more widespread in europe and that today 's efforts focus only on flood management and defense .
they also recommended the creation of a european clearing house on climate change impacts , vulnerability and adaptation to make climate change data widely available . dw staff -lrb- dm -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de finance -pipe- 29.09.2008 germany bails out ailing mortgage lender hypo real estate großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hypo real estate is germany 's second-largest commercial property lender germany 's government and top banks were injecting billions of euros monday into troubled commercial property lender hypo real estate , the first german blue-chip company to seek a bailout in the global financial crisis . the bail out came the same day as britain nationalized lender bradford & bingley -lrb- b & b -rrb- and a day after three european governments took stakes in belgian-dutch insurance and banking group fortis , underlining that the financial crisis has spread well beyond the united states .
the german finance ministry in berlin said it has provided hre guarantees for an emergency credit line totalling 35 billion euros -lrb- $ 50 billion -rrb- .
the ministry added that it had no intention of nationalizing the lender . a spokesman said the commitment was needed so that banks could bail out hre , but the actual losses were not that high . sources said the commitment could potentially strain chancellor angela merkel 's federal budget .
germany 's parliament would have to vote on the bailout package .
hre is the first major german casualty of the current worldwide financial crisis . hre said in munich that a consortium of banks came to its rescue overnight as it faced a refinancing squeeze , extending credit to tide over the problems .
hre did not name the banks or disclose the size of the bailout . stock price plummets amid news of bailout as trading began on the frankfurt stock exchange , hre shares plunged 63 percent to 4.95 euros , dragging down other banks . hre had earlier been in urgent talks with german banking regulator bafin and the finance ministry seeking a solution . germany 's second-biggest commercial-property lender , a blue chip among the 30 top companies in the dax stock index , had fallen victim to speculation by its dublin-based unit depfa , which specializes in loans to local governments in germany . depfa had pursued long-term projects with heavy loans and generally ensured refinancing only at the last minute .
it was caught short when it could not raise sufficient short-term money . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the us senate banking committee will decide on the plan hre , which also lends money for commercial and industrial property , said it had entered into talks with the banks " in response to the extremely challenging conditions on the international money markets following the lehman collapse and other market disruptions . " commerzbank , germany 's number-two bank , said it had already secured all the refinancing it needed this year and had no desire to take over hre .
commerzbank stock dipped up to 25 percent monday before clawing back some ground . markets plunge as world waits for us plan approval meanwhile , global stock markets tumbled as the us congress was to vote on a multi-billion dollar bailout deal . us lawmakers agreed over the weekend to a $ 700-billion -lrb- 479-billion-euro -rrb- bailout for debt-stricken wall street banks and sent the legislation aiming to stem the us financial crisis for congress to start voting on monday . meanwhile , there were still doubts about the proposed us financial rescue package , which needs to be approved by congress and offers no guarantee of an end to the credit crunch that has ravaged global markets , dealers said . " in our view , while the ' bailout plan ' reduces the risk of a systemic collapse , many downside risks remain - not least those related to a protracted slowdown in the global economy , " barclays capital analyst david woo told reporters .
" in addition ... the financial market turbulence is seriously affecting the european financial system . " woo added : " the weakness in equities ... suggests the market is pessimistic about the likely effectiveness of the -lrb- us -rrb- treasury 's plan . " the us deal , announced just hours before asian markets opened , is designed to mop up toxic debts from struggling banks and prevent further financial chaos that could tip the world 's largest economy into recession . the unprecedented us bailout would be the largest government economic intervention since the great depression of the 1930s , and aims to shore up an economy in the face of a severe housing slump . us treasury secretary henry paulson said the package " gives us the flexibility to unclog our financial markets -lrb- and -rrb- increase the ability of our financial institutions to deliver the credit that will help create jobs . " ecb offers special loan as france call emergency meeting the european central bank monday announced a special 38-day euro loan to provide euro zone banks with more cash in a bid to balance conditions on extremely tense interbank money markets . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : sarkozy wants to insure the safety of france 's banks also on monday , french president nicolas sarkozy said he will meet with the chief executives of leading french banks and insurance companies to discuss the global financial crisis on tuesday . the meeting at the elysee presidential palace is to " review the situation of financial institutions and the credit level of households and businesses , " said a statement from the presidency on monday . sarkozy warned in a major address last week that france would not be spared from the turmoil unleashed by the us banking crisis . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

some mediterranean regions already receive 20 percent less rain than a century ago , the report said , increasing the risk of forest fires and the desertification of the region .
the report labelled glacier retreat in europe a double-edged sword , projecting an overall increase in river floods across europe , but also an increase in river droughts in the south .
" uncertainty in the rate of melting of greenland 's outlet glaciers makes projections of future sea level rise uncertain , " the report said , adding that according to satellite observations the global sea level had risen by as much as 3.1 mm a year in the past 15 years .
europe a global warming hot spot bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : europe is set to struggle under increasing temperatures caused by global warming the report highlighted the widespread vulnerability of europe to global warming-induced climate change , with mountainous regions , coastal zones , the mediterranean and the arctic set to shoulder the lion 's share of the environmental burden .
" global average temperature has increased almost 0.8 of a degree above pre-industrial levels , with even higher temperature increases in europe and northern latitudes , " the report said .
europe has warmed by 1 degree .
the report 's authors said mitigation and adaptation measures against climate change needed to be more widespread in europe and that today 's efforts focus only on flood management and defense .
they also recommended the creation of a european clearing house on climate change impacts , vulnerability and adaptation to make climate change data widely available . dw staff -lrb- dm -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de science -pipe- 29.09.2008 german researchers claim alzheimer 's breakthrough großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : scientists involved with the project say the results on mice have been stunning german scientists have developed a new enzyme-blocking method which nearly halts the formation of protein deposits associated with alzheimer 's .
still , it could be years before the treatment becomes reality . for more than a decade , hans-ulrich demuth and his team at a small biotech firm in eastern germany had been researching protein deposits in the brain , deposits that have long been associated with alzheimer 's disease .
“ our question was what are the harmful components of the protein deposits , and is there a way to reduce or eliminate them by blocking the enzyme we know is part of its characteristics ? "
demuth said .
as it turns out , there was .
demuth 's team at probiodrug found the enzyme that was responsible for an extremely small , but extremely harmful part of the deposits .
it 's known as glutaminyl cyclase -lrb- qc -rrb- and the researchers devised a method they believed would block its function in lab mice .
stunning results stefan rossner of the paul flechsig institute at the university of leipzig was contracted to study the brains of the mice .
he discovered stunning results .
" the protein deposits typical of alzheimer 's disease were reduced in the brains of the mice by up to 80 percent , " he said .
dirk montag of the leibniz institute for neurobiology in magdeburg sought to find out the practical results of the reduced instance of protein deposits , performing behavioral and cognitive tests on the mice .
" in general performance , reflexes and the like , the treated mice were the same as the untreated control mice , " he said , adding , " with the exception of mental functioning , that is , which was improved . "
montag also said that he had found no behavioral side effects .
if success on that scale were to be repeated in human trials , the discovery could prove to be a very big one .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : alzheimer 's is a debilitating and terminal disease alzheimer 's is the most common form of dementia and is triggered when nerve cells in the brain die .
up to a million people in germany are estimated to be afflicted by the disease which remains incurable and causes loss of memory , orientation and recognition .
scientists plan a new study to monitor potential side effects more closely .
but the results of this study are nothing sort of a sensation .
the treatment given to the mice to inhibit the qc enzyme reduced not just the particularly harmful matter within protein deposits in brain cells , rather the size and instance of protein deposits altogether .
holding back from ' breakthrough ' the finding has many in the research community excited , and has earned the study 's results a place in the respected journal nature medicine .
but some say the treatment still has much to prove .
lutz froehlich of mannheim 's central institute of mental health told the associated press that he believed a causal relationship between protein deposits and the death of neural cells had yet to be established .
any treatment that focuses on the deposits may end up missing the target of keeping brain cells alive , he said .
of the positive results in cognitive tests of the learning capabilities of the mice , froehlich said , " animal models can never provide us the whole picture of a disease 's effects , just isolated aspects . " he added that he 'd seen too many studies with great results from animal testing produce underwhelming results from humans .
human testing on its way the researchers ' next challenge will be to take what they know and develop a treatment suitable for humans - that is , one that is both non-toxic and still effective at blocking the enzyme .
demuth said , however , that getting toward such a compound should n't take more than a year .
while there 's no telling as to whether the enzyme blocker will work nearly as well on humans as on mice , demuth was hopeful , saying he thought that " the generations that are now 30 , 40 , or 50 years old should definitely benefit from this discovery . "
if tests do succeed , researches say a legitimate anti-alzheimer 's drug could be available to the public within five to eight years . matt hermann send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

egyptian authorities said the hostages were freed after a mission near the sudan-chad border and that half the kidnappers were killed .
the kidnappers had demanded a six-million-euro ransom for the hostages - to be paid by germany - but authorities insisted no ransom changed hands .
the identity of the kidnappers has still not been confirmed , but reports speculate the bandits may have been connected with a darfur rebel group , a faction of the sudanese liberation army .
however , none of the region 's rebel groups have claimed responsibility for the kidnapping .
steinmeier uncertain over release details german foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier thanked the authorities that contributed toward securing a " happy ending to the hijacking . "
" i hope -lrb- the freed hostages -rrb- will return to germany as soon as possible , " he said , refusing to elaborate on the circumstances surrounding their release .
" i do not want to reveal details at the moment .
we should wait for the safe return of the hostages first , " he said .
italy thanks involved authorities bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the five germans , five italians and one romanian will undergo medical tests before returning home italian foreign affairs minister franco frattini said the release was the result of " international cooperation for which we should be truly grateful to the authorities of the other countries that worked with us . "
the minister said the release was achieved thanks to " activities that can not be revealed in collaboration with the egyptian authorities , " whom he thanked , " in addition to the germans , who collaborated with -lrb- italy -rrb- and the egyptian , sudanese and libyan authorities for permitting the hostages ’ transit through their respective territories . "
he said italian special forces took part in securing the hostages ' release .
the group - consisting of five germans , five italians and a romanian - was kidnapped sept .
19 while on a desert safari in an isolated south-western region of egypt .
the group was believed to have been first moved across the border to sudan to the remote mountain region of jebel uweinat , a plateau that straddles the borders of egypt , libya and sudan , before the bandits took them into chad , according to sudanese officials .
sudden shootout in an unexpected turn of events sunday , gunfire reportedly broke out between sudanese troops and the hostage-takers after the latter were spotted near the sudan-egypt-libya border area .
the clash ended with the death of six of the bandits and the capture of two .
" the problem was solved .
they had agreed to the ransom .

the csu polled 43.4 percent of the vote on sunday , sept .
28 , in its worst showing in half a century .
the center-left social democrats -lrb- spd -rrb- , which govern in a grand coalition with merkel 's party in berlin , polled 18.6 percent , a decline of 1 percentage point from the last state election in 2003 . csu secretary general christine haderthauer said the disastrous result was a black day for the party , which had ruled unchallenged for more than 40 years .
in the last state elections in 2003 , the csu polled 60.7 percent of the vote in the strongly catholic state , where some of germany 's leading companies have their headquarters , including siemens and bmw .
the party 's stated intent had been to retain its absolute majority in the 180-seat parliament in munich .
" we have clearly failed to achieve our goal , " haderthauer said .
beckstein refuses to shoulder the blame bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : beckstein and huber will face an inquest into the defeat state prime minister guenther beckstein , who was elected last year after longtime leader edmund stoiber was toppled in a party revolt , ruled out stepping down to take responsibility for the poor showing .
" the people have shown that they want a csu-led government , but that they do not want the csu to govern bavaria alone , " he said , adding that the party would immediately start to look for a coalition partner .
the most likely contenders are the liberal free democrats -lrb- fdp -rrb- , who polled 8 percent of the vote to enter parliament after an absence of 14 years .
the liberals are eyeing a coalition with the cdu at the national level next year , but shifting alliances in the party landscape could make a wider alliance possible .
another possibility is the free voters , a conservative party that will make its parliamentary debut after winning 10.2 percent on a platform seeking greater local power .
the environmentalist greens won 9.4 percent , but the pro-labor left party at 4.3 percent failed to clear the 5 percent hurdle needed to get into parliament . the csu 's good showing in bavaria in the 2004 general election helped elevate merkel to power , but its popularity has been steadily eroding under beckstein and party chairman erwin huber . losses by the state-owned bank bayernlb , the scrapping of a prestigious super-fast train link to the munich airport and a controversial smoking ban combined to fuel voter discontent .
analysts said the party 's poor performance could increase pressure on the csu leadership , which had been criticized for running a tepid campaign and failing to galvanize voters . the party ran a campaign highlighting the csu 's past successes while pushing for greater tax breaks for commuters and better conditions for working mothers .
state losses could have national ramifications the dramatic losses suffered by the csu in bavaria have ramifications well beyond the borders of germany 's largest state .
the shockwaves reached as far as berlin , where merkel rules in an uneasy grand coalition with the left-of-center social democrats -lrb- spd -rrb- . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel will want answers from the csu leadership analysts said that the outcome could increase tension between the coalition partners and hurt merkel 's chances of retaining power in federal elections scheduled for september 2009 .
foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier , who has been picked by the spd to challenge merkel for the chancellorship , said the vote had far-reaching implications .
" we are not talking about an election result , " he said , " but about an earthquake that has been unleashed by this election in bavaria . "
but he did n't mention that his party 's own performance of just over 18 percent was also its worst-ever showing in the prosperous state of laptops and lederhosen .
analysts said that voters punished the csu for clinging to traditional social values and catholic church doctrine in a europe that has become increasingly secular .
it did not help that beckstein and party chairman erwin huber lacked the charisma of stoiber and failed to galvanize voters to support a fresh vision .
recent state elections have seen coalitions between the cdu and greens in hamburg , and the spd eyeing an alliance with the greens and the left in hesse , where there is a minority cdu caretaker government .
the defeated spd candidate in bavaria , franz maget , even suggested a four-party coalition to unseat the csu , arguing that the ruling party had morally lost the right to govern .
while the greens said they would support such a move , the fdp said it was not interested in " a gaudy coalition of anarchists . " dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

many of the votes went to another conservative party , the free voters . the freie waehler , or free voters , won 10.2 percent of the vote , surprising everyone , including themselves .
the election result now makes them the third strongest party in bavaria , behind the once mighty csu and the social democrats .
the free voters have contested two previous bavarian state elections but failed on both occasions to win the five percent required to enter parliament .
“ we 've been wall flowers for long enough , ” said the party 's state chairman , hubert aiwanger , after the results from sunday 's election came through .
“ we 're a force that bavaria has long waited for , ” he added .

the election result now makes them the third strongest party in bavaria , behind the once mighty csu and the social democrats . the free voters have contested two previous bavarian state elections but failed on both occasions to win the five percent required to enter parliament . " we 've been wall flowers for long enough , " said the party 's state chairman , hubert aiwanger , after the results from sunday 's election came through . " we 're a force that bavaria has long waited for , " he added . the main csu party now has to find a coalition partner to form a government .
the liberal free democrats party -lrb- fdp -rrb- is considered the most likely contender .
with eight percent polled , the fdp will enter parliament for the first time in 14 years .
the free voters are considered the second best option , and hubert aiwanger has not ruled out working with the csu . surprise success the party 's success this time around could be linked to one of its newest members : gabriele pauli .
she joined the party earlier this year , after leaving the csu in controversial circumstances last year . it was partly due to her that former csu leader edmund stoiber left the party .
she 'd openly criticised stoiber , and commentators are now asking whether this was the start of the csu 's downward spiral . with pauli on board , the free voters received much more coverage in the media , at a time when voters were looking away from the csu . in terms of policy , the free voters do n't differ greatly from the main csu party .
but in terms of structure , the free voters are miles apart .
they consider themselves a grassroots organization , and do n't have the same hierarchical structures as other political parties .
their only ideology , they say , is that they are not a party . dw staff -lrb- cla -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de politics -pipe- 29.09.2008 merkel disappointed by bavarian ally 's drubbing at polls großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel 's expression spoke volumes about the mood in germany 's conservative camp chancellor merkel says her governing conservatives must focus on the economy , jobs and education in the wake of a massive loss for her allies in bavaria that could hurt her bid for re-election in polls next year . a day after her bavarian ally , the christian social union -lrb- csu -rrb- lost their absolute majority it had held in bavaria 's state assembly for nearly half a century , chancellor merkel said she would try harder to win back voters , stressing the economy , creating jobs , education and integrating minorities in her campaign . " we 'll offer germans a vision of the future and steadiness amid globalization , " the chancellor said in berlin on monday , sept 29 . csu loss could hurt merkel 's re-election voters in bavaria on sunday turned their backs on the csu in large numbers , handing big gains to smaller parties . the csu polled just 43.4 per cent of the vote in its worst showing in half a century .
after more than 40 years of solo rule , it will have to embrace one of the minor parties as a coalition partner to retain power .
the munich-based respected daily sueddeutsche zeitung called the conservatives ' drubbing " an unparalleled humiliation . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : in mourning - merkel , center , with bavaria 's premier beckstein , right , and csu leader huber analysts said the drubbing had to do with the conservative party 's lack of vision in bavaria and the compromises it has made on a national level as part of merkel 's uneasy " grand coalition " with the social democrats in berlin .
the social democrats , however , were unable to capitalize on the conservatives ' misery and slipped one point to 18.6 percent . the bavarian election result has alarmed merkel 's conservative christian democratic union -lrb- cdu -rrb- as the chancellor struggles to win re-election next year . merkel 's cdu does not operate in bavaria .
the csu 's federal legislators form a single bloc with the cdu in berlin and are crucial to her hold on power . tensions among cdu and csu amid calls from csu stalwarts for heads to roll , the bavarian party announced a party congress would be held on october 25 . party chairman erwin huber said it would enable " self criticism " of where the party went wrong .
he termed the poll outcome a rebuke , but was tight-lipped about whether or not he would stand down . as analysts predicted that the cdu and csu would have to adopt a harder political edge to attract centre-right voters at germany 's general election next year , merkel said the csu had failed to win confidence in bavaria that it was entitled to rule alone . merkel 's critics have suggested that her steady-as-we-go approach has failed to inspire voters , especially when the cdu has had to soft-pedal its usual centre-right policies to avoid upsetting the social democrats -lrb- spd -rrb- , the other coalition party . huber attacked merkel over her refusal to endorse csu proposals for tax rebates , saying , " we wish the cdu had supported us more . " despite pressure by some senior cdu figures to end the federal grand coalition now , merkel said her government would stay in place until the election , which is scheduled for september 27 , 2009 . the spd polled 18.6 per cent in bavaria , a decline of 1 percentage point from the last state election in 2003 , as voters forsook both big parties for smaller rivals . huber said the csu would invite the small free democrat party , which gained 8 per cent of the vote , or the free voters , a conservative party with 10.2 per cent , into a coalition . guenther beckstein , the csu premier of mainly catholic bavaria , said monday he would insist that the future state coalition put a focus on traditional values including patriotism and social conservatism . dw staff -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

28 , the belgian , dutch and luxembourg governments agreed to inject 11.2 billion euros -lrb- $ 16.4 billion -rrb- into the banking and insurance company fortis after a weekend of high drama .
the presence of trichet , who as ecb head is responsible for safeguarding financial stability in the euro zone , was unprecedented in a commercial bank rescue and underlined the seriousness of concern for the integrity of the euro zone 's financial system .
in the first major bank crisis to hit the euro zone in 13 months of global financial turmoil that began in the united states , fortis looked to be in severe danger with some experts concerned that the tri-nation group could go under by monday if nothing was done to save it .
fortis saw its shares drop by a third last week on investor concerns about its liquidity and funding which stem from last year 's 70 billion euro purchase of dutch bank abn amro with partners royal bank of scotland and spain 's santander .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : fortis ' troubles can be traced to the purchase of abn shares dived more than 20 percent to 15-year lows on friday despite a statement that the group 's position was solid and a pledge to expand asset sales to as much as 10 billion euros .
the group 's market capitalization also slumped from 50 billion euros after the abn purchase to just 12 billion euros on friday .
fortis group too large not to be saved fortis , with 85,000 staff worldwide , is the biggest private sector employer in belgium and more than 1.5 million households , roughly half the country , bank with the group .
" we could have not intervened , but the question was whether fortis would have survived on monday , " dutch finance minister wouter bos told reporters .
the benelux governments chose a partial state buyout after two private bidders made paltry offers for the group last week .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the fortis nationalization dwarfs that on northen rock each government will take a 49 percent stake in fortis banks in their respective countries .
belgium will put in 4.7 billion euros , the netherlands 4 billion and luxembourg 2.5 billion , the latter in the form of a convertible loan .
the group 's nationalization dwarfs britain 's state takeover of fallen mortgage lender northern rock last year .
france 's bnp paribas allegedly pulled out of a deal last week after offering just 1.60 euros per share for fortis , compared to friday 's closing price of 5.20 , and demanding state guarantees against possible future losses , a source said .
the dutch ing group was alleged to have bid just 1.5 euros per share .
" there was no serious bidder for the intrinsic value of the whole group , " the source told reuters news agency .
bnp paribas and ing declined comment on reports that they had bid for all or part of fortis .
nationalization comes as all eyes turn to us bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the us federal reserve 's ben bernanke feels the pressure fortis said in a statement it expected total negative value adjustments of about 5 billion euros after tax in the third quarter .
it added its core equity would be around 30 billion euros , resulting in a 9.5 billion euro excess core equity .
the group also said that it will sell the parts of abn that it bought last year .
fortis chairman maurice lippens , accused by shareholders of concealing the bank 's troubles for too long , resigned after the news of the nationalization broke .
fortis also named filip dierckx as chief executive on friday evening , hastily replacing caretaker herman verwilst .
the fortis nationalization came as financial groups around the world watch for any movement from us lawmakers who are still debating whether to sign off on a deal to create a $ 700 billion government fund to buy bad debt from ailing us banks in a bid to stem a credit crisis threatening the global economy . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the csu polled 43.4 percent of the vote on sunday , sept .
28 , in its worst showing in half a century .
the center-left social democrats -lrb- spd -rrb- , which govern in a grand coalition with merkel 's party in berlin , polled 18.6 percent , a decline of 1 percentage point from the last state election in 2003 . csu secretary general christine haderthauer said the disastrous result was a black day for the party , which had ruled unchallenged for more than 40 years .
in the last state elections in 2003 , the csu polled 60.7 percent of the vote in the strongly catholic state , where some of germany 's leading companies have their headquarters , including siemens and bmw .
the party 's stated intent had been to retain its absolute majority in the 180-seat parliament in munich .
" we have clearly failed to achieve our goal , " haderthauer said .

" we 'll offer germans a vision of the future and steadiness amid globalization , " the chancellor said in berlin on monday , sept 29 . csu loss could hurt merkel 's re-election voters in bavaria on sunday turned their backs on the csu in large numbers , handing big gains to smaller parties . the csu polled just 43.4 per cent of the vote in its worst showing in half a century .
after more than 40 years of solo rule , it will have to embrace one of the minor parties as a coalition partner to retain power .
the munich-based respected daily sueddeutsche zeitung called the conservatives ' drubbing " an unparalleled humiliation . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : in mourning - merkel , center , with bavaria 's premier beckstein , right , and csu leader huber analysts said the drubbing had to do with the conservative party 's lack of vision in bavaria and the compromises it has made on a national level as part of merkel 's uneasy " grand coalition " with the social democrats in berlin .
the social democrats , however , were unable to capitalize on the conservatives ' misery and slipped one point to 18.6 percent . the bavarian election result has alarmed merkel 's conservative christian democratic union -lrb- cdu -rrb- as the chancellor struggles to win re-election next year . merkel 's cdu does not operate in bavaria .
the csu 's federal legislators form a single bloc with the cdu in berlin and are crucial to her hold on power . tensions among cdu and csu amid calls from csu stalwarts for heads to roll , the bavarian party announced a party congress would be held on october 25 . party chairman erwin huber said it would enable " self criticism " of where the party went wrong .
he termed the poll outcome a rebuke , but was tight-lipped about whether or not he would stand down . as analysts predicted that the cdu and csu would have to adopt a harder political edge to attract centre-right voters at germany 's general election next year , merkel said the csu had failed to win confidence in bavaria that it was entitled to rule alone . merkel 's critics have suggested that her steady-as-we-go approach has failed to inspire voters , especially when the cdu has had to soft-pedal its usual centre-right policies to avoid upsetting the social democrats -lrb- spd -rrb- , the other coalition party . huber attacked merkel over her refusal to endorse csu proposals for tax rebates , saying , " we wish the cdu had supported us more . " despite pressure by some senior cdu figures to end the federal grand coalition now , merkel said her government would stay in place until the election , which is scheduled for september 27 , 2009 . the spd polled 18.6 per cent in bavaria , a decline of 1 percentage point from the last state election in 2003 , as voters forsook both big parties for smaller rivals . huber said the csu would invite the small free democrat party , which gained 8 per cent of the vote , or the free voters , a conservative party with 10.2 per cent , into a coalition . guenther beckstein , the csu premier of mainly catholic bavaria , said monday he would insist that the future state coalition put a focus on traditional values including patriotism and social conservatism . dw staff -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ? 9799 radio news listen to world headlines from the top of the hour .

" ostalgia , " a pun combing " nostalgia and " ost " -lrb- east -rrb- , is on the rise and numerous businesses and individuals are cashing in on the trend .
today , you can have your picture taken with a soviet soldier look-alike at the former checkpoint charlie crossing in berlin or rent a room in a sparsely furnished apartment that is a replica of a 1980s east german accommodation .
you can also take a tour of east berlin in a plastic-body trabi car that east germans had to wait years to buy .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the ' ostel ' hostel in berlin gives visitors a look into the communist gdr " ask the people who run those businesses if they would still want to live in an old , small , box-like flat in a concrete high-rise , " said dagmar schipanski , president of the parliament in the eastern german state of thuringia .
" most of them now own expensive apartments and drive nice cars . "
missing the historical context schipanski makes no attempt to hide her anger when talking about what she regards as " a deliberate exclusion of the real historical context . "
the 65-year-old former scientist , who grew up in the german democratic republic , the eastern part of divided germany , heads a commission that drafted a position paper on eastern germany 's future .
the panel , which also reviewed successes and failures in the eastern region since the wall came down in 1989 , was set up by chancellor angela merkel 's christian democratic party -lrb- cdu -rrb- .
the document , which has been criticized by opposition parties for failing to examine the cdu 's own role in east germany , also suggests strategies for future development .
call for better education a central demand is directed at the education system .
" we need to come to terms with the history of divided germany in our schools , by reforming curricula and teaching practices alike , " said schipanski .
her call is echoed by another recent study assessing the level of knowledge about east and west german history . " pupils know next to nothing , " said klaus schroeder , the berlin professor who headed the survey .
" fewer than one in two knows who built the berlin wall . "
bildunterschrift : not everyone who lived in east germany knows that the berlin wall was built in 1961 on orders from state council chairman walter ulbrich the little they did know they learned from their families or from television shows , which painted a distorted picture , schroeder added .
establishments like die firma -lrb- the firm -rrb- , a pub themed after east germany 's dreaded stasi secret service , which a former stasi informer opened in berlin a few months ago , was " utterly tasteless , " schroeder said .
many students confirmed the findings of the study based on their own experience , jan redmann , a member of the cdu 's youth organization , the ju , told dpa news agency .
" pupils tell us that east germany is often omitted in lessons , " he says .
" that 's also because dealing with the german past for many teachers also means dealing with their own biographies . "
the other side of the story together with other ju members , redmann started an anti-ostalgie campaign three years ago when east german-themed shows first hit german tv screens .
" on these program , celebrities go on about how much fun it was to drive a trabi and to mix their own fuel , " complains campaigner peter tauber .
" but they never mentioned that you had to wait years to get a car in the first place . "
some 700 people have so far signed up to the online campaign , whose web site is decorated with a banana , a symbol of the shortage of imported goods in the soviet-guided east germany .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the new stasi bar in berlin has been frowned upon " citizens were never fully informed about the actual state of the economy , " cdu politician schipanski told dpa .
the upheavals they faced in 1989 were very serious and often meant unemployment or starting a new career from scratch , she said .
" we have to honor their achievements in adapting to a completely different environment . "
she agreed with social scientist schroeder that unemployment and economic deprivation should not be an excuse to paint a glossy picture of life in east germany .

28 , the belgian , dutch and luxembourg governments agreed to inject 11.2 billion euros -lrb- $ 16.4 billion -rrb- into the banking and insurance company fortis after a weekend of high drama .
the presence of trichet , who as ecb head is responsible for safeguarding financial stability in the euro zone , was unprecedented in a commercial bank rescue and underlined the seriousness of concern for the integrity of the euro zone 's financial system .
in the first major bank crisis to hit the euro zone in 13 months of global financial turmoil that began in the united states , fortis looked to be in severe danger with some experts concerned that the tri-nation group could go under by monday if nothing was done to save it .
fortis saw its shares drop by a third last week on investor concerns about its liquidity and funding which stem from last year 's 70 billion euro purchase of dutch bank abn amro with partners royal bank of scotland and spain 's santander .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : fortis ' troubles can be traced to the purchase of abn shares dived more than 20 percent to 15-year lows on friday despite a statement that the group 's position was solid and a pledge to expand asset sales to as much as 10 billion euros .
the group 's market capitalization also slumped from 50 billion euros after the abn purchase to just 12 billion euros on friday .
fortis group too large not to be saved fortis , with 85,000 staff worldwide , is the biggest private sector employer in belgium and more than 1.5 million households , roughly half the country , bank with the group .
" we could have not intervened , but the question was whether fortis would have survived on monday , " dutch finance minister wouter bos told reporters .
the benelux governments chose a partial state buyout after two private bidders made paltry offers for the group last week .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the fortis nationalization dwarfs that on northen rock each government will take a 49 percent stake in fortis banks in their respective countries .
belgium will put in 4.7 billion euros , the netherlands 4 billion and luxembourg 2.5 billion , the latter in the form of a convertible loan .
the group 's nationalization dwarfs britain 's state takeover of fallen mortgage lender northern rock last year .
france 's bnp paribas allegedly pulled out of a deal last week after offering just 1.60 euros per share for fortis , compared to friday 's closing price of 5.20 , and demanding state guarantees against possible future losses , a source said .
the dutch ing group was alleged to have bid just 1.5 euros per share .
" there was no serious bidder for the intrinsic value of the whole group , " the source told reuters news agency .
bnp paribas and ing declined comment on reports that they had bid for all or part of fortis .
nationalization comes as all eyes turn to us bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the us federal reserve 's ben bernanke feels the pressure fortis said in a statement it expected total negative value adjustments of about 5 billion euros after tax in the third quarter .
it added its core equity would be around 30 billion euros , resulting in a 9.5 billion euro excess core equity .
the group also said that it will sell the parts of abn that it bought last year .
fortis chairman maurice lippens , accused by shareholders of concealing the bank 's troubles for too long , resigned after the news of the nationalization broke .
fortis also named filip dierckx as chief executive on friday evening , hastily replacing caretaker herman verwilst .
the fortis nationalization came as financial groups around the world watch for any movement from us lawmakers who are still debating whether to sign off on a deal to create a $ 700 billion government fund to buy bad debt from ailing us banks in a bid to stem a credit crisis threatening the global economy . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de opinion -pipe- 29.09.2008 opinion : the bavarian earthquake sends tremors through berlin großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the shockwaves of the christian social union 's -lrb- csu -rrb- worst showing in half a century of bavarian state elections are being felt in berlin , dw 's peter stützle says .
the results could have an effect on national elections . the result of the state elections in bavaria is like an earthquake shaking german politics .
the csu 's absolute majority in the state was considered to be a law of nature but now that law has been smashed and the csu must find itself a coalition partner - it 's something only old bavarians know from the 1950s .
the shockwaves from this earthquake reach all the way to berlin .
angela merkel wants to continue as chancellor after next year 's parliamentary election but not as the head of the deeply unpopular grand coalition with the social democrats .
she would much prefer the fdp free market liberals . for that to happen , it 's not just the fdp that needs to ratchet up votes .
the conservatives from merkel 's christian democratic union -lrb- cdu -rrb- and its sister party , the christian social -lrb- csu -rrb- need to hugely boost their support .
right now , however the csu has done just the opposite , by suffering massive losses in bavaria .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : peter stützle admittedly , the earthquake has n't exactly put the brand new chancellor candidate of germany 's social democrats , frank-walter steinmeier , in a better position .
despite the weakness of the ruling csu , the social democrats in bavaria could n't capitalize on the conservatives ' disarray and recorded their worst result in five years .
steinmeier 's dream partners , the greens and the fdp may both have increased their gains but a three-way coalition of the spd , greens and the fdp can only work if the spd becomes stronger - if anything , the party has just gotten a little weaker .
one of the most striking results of the bavarian election has been the continuing erosion of germany 's two biggest traditional parties , the spd and the cdu .
it 's a development that has become apparent in all state elections in recent years and in the general elections in 2005 .
what 's equally striking is that the ensuing political camps remain largely unchanged . disillusioned spd supporters usually turn toward the left party and partly toward the greens while fed-up conservative voters flock to the fdp and , in the case of bavaria , to the free voters .
the free voters , a grassroots organization which largely includes former csu members , attaches great importance to the principle that they are n't beholden to any party line .
the group however will not contest the general elections next year which means that a lot of their voters could return to the csu .
the grand coalition in berlin now needs to roll up their sleeves to finish off what they started . a few important decisions loom in the next weeks such as tax reforms .
it 's not clear how the csu will react in the grand coalition in berlin , whether it will be stubborn or more open to compromise . if the tensions between the ruling parties continue and increase , then this could exacerbate the frustration in the populace which in turn could accelerate the erosion of the two main parties .
in the end , both the conservative bloc as well as the spd may have no other option other than to forge a new large coalition . peter stützle -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?
dw-world.de bavarian conservatives lose state majority in damaging defeat bavaria 's christian social union -lrb- csu -rrb- lost its decades-old absolute majority as voters defected to smaller parties in a state election seen as a test of support ahead of national polls next year .
-lrb- 29.09.2008 -rrb- heavy election losses likely to end csu 's lone rule in bavaria bavaria 's conservative christian social union -lrb- csu -rrb- suffered heavy losses in sunday 's state elections that will likely end the party 's decades-long rule without a coalition partner .

you can also take a tour of east berlin in a plastic-body trabi car that east germans had to wait years to buy .

" most of them now own expensive apartments and drive nice cars . "
missing the historical context schipanski makes no attempt to hide her anger when talking about what she regards as " a deliberate exclusion of the real historical context . "
the 65-year-old former scientist , who grew up in the german democratic republic , the eastern part of divided germany , heads a commission that drafted a position paper on eastern germany 's future .
the panel , which also reviewed successes and failures in the eastern region since the wall came down in 1989 , was set up by chancellor angela merkel 's christian democratic party -lrb- cdu -rrb- .
the document , which has been criticized by opposition parties for failing to examine the cdu 's own role in east germany , also suggests strategies for future development .
call for better education a central demand is directed at the education system .

france 's bnp paribas allegedly pulled out of a deal last week after offering just 1.60 euros per share for fortis , compared to friday 's closing price of 5.20 , and demanding state guarantees against possible future losses , a source said .
the dutch ing group was alleged to have bid just 1.5 euros per share .
" there was no serious bidder for the intrinsic value of the whole group , " the source told reuters news agency .
bnp paribas and ing declined comment on reports that they had bid for all or part of fortis .
nationalization comes as all eyes turn to us bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the us federal reserve 's ben bernanke feels the pressure fortis said in a statement it expected total negative value adjustments of about 5 billion euros after tax in the third quarter .
it added its core equity would be around 30 billion euros , resulting in a 9.5 billion euro excess core equity .
the group also said that it will sell the parts of abn that it bought last year .
fortis chairman maurice lippens , accused by shareholders of concealing the bank 's troubles for too long , resigned after the news of the nationalization broke .
fortis also named filip dierckx as chief executive on friday evening , hastily replacing caretaker herman verwilst .
the fortis nationalization came as financial groups around the world watch for any movement from us lawmakers who are still debating whether to sign off on a deal to create a $ 700 billion government fund to buy bad debt from ailing us banks in a bid to stem a credit crisis threatening the global economy . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the results could have an effect on national elections . the result of the state elections in bavaria is like an earthquake shaking german politics .
the csu 's absolute majority in the state was considered to be a law of nature but now that law has been smashed and the csu must find itself a coalition partner - it 's something only old bavarians know from the 1950s .
the shockwaves from this earthquake reach all the way to berlin .
angela merkel wants to continue as chancellor after next year 's parliamentary election but not as the head of the deeply unpopular grand coalition with the social democrats .
she would much prefer the fdp free market liberals . for that to happen , it 's not just the fdp that needs to ratchet up votes .
the conservatives from merkel 's christian democratic union -lrb- cdu -rrb- and its sister party , the christian social -lrb- csu -rrb- need to hugely boost their support .
right now , however the csu has done just the opposite , by suffering massive losses in bavaria .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : peter stützle admittedly , the earthquake has n't exactly put the brand new chancellor candidate of germany 's social democrats , frank-walter steinmeier , in a better position .
despite the weakness of the ruling csu , the social democrats in bavaria could n't capitalize on the conservatives ' disarray and recorded their worst result in five years .
steinmeier 's dream partners , the greens and the fdp may both have increased their gains but a three-way coalition of the spd , greens and the fdp can only work if the spd becomes stronger - if anything , the party has just gotten a little weaker .
one of the most striking results of the bavarian election has been the continuing erosion of germany 's two biggest traditional parties , the spd and the cdu .
it 's a development that has become apparent in all state elections in recent years and in the general elections in 2005 .
what 's equally striking is that the ensuing political camps remain largely unchanged . disillusioned spd supporters usually turn toward the left party and partly toward the greens while fed-up conservative voters flock to the fdp and , in the case of bavaria , to the free voters .
the free voters , a grassroots organization which largely includes former csu members , attaches great importance to the principle that they are n't beholden to any party line .
the group however will not contest the general elections next year which means that a lot of their voters could return to the csu .
the grand coalition in berlin now needs to roll up their sleeves to finish off what they started . a few important decisions loom in the next weeks such as tax reforms .
it 's not clear how the csu will react in the grand coalition in berlin , whether it will be stubborn or more open to compromise . if the tensions between the ruling parties continue and increase , then this could exacerbate the frustration in the populace which in turn could accelerate the erosion of the two main parties .
in the end , both the conservative bloc as well as the spd may have no other option other than to forge a new large coalition . peter stützle -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

28 , the belgian , dutch and luxembourg governments agreed to inject 11.2 billion euros -lrb- $ 16.4 billion -rrb- into the banking and insurance company fortis after a weekend of high drama .
the presence of trichet , who as ecb head is responsible for safeguarding financial stability in the euro zone , was unprecedented in a commercial bank rescue and underlined the seriousness of concern for the integrity of the euro zone 's financial system .
in the first major bank crisis to hit the euro zone in 13 months of global financial turmoil that began in the united states , fortis looked to be in severe danger with some experts concerned that the tri-nation group could go under by monday if nothing was done to save it .
fortis saw its shares drop by a third last week on investor concerns about its liquidity and funding which stem from last year 's 70 billion euro purchase of dutch bank abn amro with partners royal bank of scotland and spain 's santander .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : fortis ' troubles can be traced to the purchase of abn shares dived more than 20 percent to 15-year lows on friday despite a statement that the group 's position was solid and a pledge to expand asset sales to as much as 10 billion euros .

the results could have an effect on national elections . the result of the state elections in bavaria is like an earthquake shaking german politics .
the csu 's absolute majority in the state was considered to be a law of nature but now that law has been smashed and the csu must find itself a coalition partner - it 's something only old bavarians know from the 1950s .
the shockwaves from this earthquake reach all the way to berlin .
angela merkel wants to continue as chancellor after next year 's parliamentary election but not as the head of the deeply unpopular grand coalition with the social democrats .
she would much prefer the fdp free market liberals . for that to happen , it 's not just the fdp that needs to ratchet up votes .
the conservatives from merkel 's christian democratic union -lrb- cdu -rrb- and its sister party , the christian social -lrb- csu -rrb- need to hugely boost their support .
right now , however the csu has done just the opposite , by suffering massive losses in bavaria .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : peter stützle admittedly , the earthquake has n't exactly put the brand new chancellor candidate of germany 's social democrats , frank-walter steinmeier , in a better position .
despite the weakness of the ruling csu , the social democrats in bavaria could n't capitalize on the conservatives ' disarray and recorded their worst result in five years .
steinmeier 's dream partners , the greens and the fdp may both have increased their gains but a three-way coalition of the spd , greens and the fdp can only work if the spd becomes stronger - if anything , the party has just gotten a little weaker .
one of the most striking results of the bavarian election has been the continuing erosion of germany 's two biggest traditional parties , the spd and the cdu .
it 's a development that has become apparent in all state elections in recent years and in the general elections in 2005 .
what 's equally striking is that the ensuing political camps remain largely unchanged . disillusioned spd supporters usually turn toward the left party and partly toward the greens while fed-up conservative voters flock to the fdp and , in the case of bavaria , to the free voters .
the free voters , a grassroots organization which largely includes former csu members , attaches great importance to the principle that they are n't beholden to any party line .
the group however will not contest the general elections next year which means that a lot of their voters could return to the csu .
the grand coalition in berlin now needs to roll up their sleeves to finish off what they started . a few important decisions loom in the next weeks such as tax reforms .
it 's not clear how the csu will react in the grand coalition in berlin , whether it will be stubborn or more open to compromise . if the tensions between the ruling parties continue and increase , then this could exacerbate the frustration in the populace which in turn could accelerate the erosion of the two main parties .
in the end , both the conservative bloc as well as the spd may have no other option other than to forge a new large coalition . peter stützle -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

28 . the social democrats -lrb- spoe -rrb- took 29.7 percent while the conservatives -lrb- oevp -rrb- secured 25.6 percent , according to official ministry results , which did not include absentee ballots .
the far-right , meanwhile , established itself as the third political force in austria , with 18.0 percent for the freedom party -lrb- fpoe -rrb- and a surprising 11.0 percent for joerg haider 's smaller alliance for austria 's future -lrb- bzoe -rrb- .
the greens had to settle for fifth place with 9.8 percent .
a total 15 parties were listed on the ballot in sunday 's election , the highest number in austrian electoral history , but most of them did not pass the 4.0-percent threshold to get into parliament .
participation stood at 71.4 percent , out of 6.3 million eligible voters , but some 586,700 absentees still had to be taken into account .
these were to be tallied in the next week with full final results expected on oct .

bildunterschrift : heinz strache , wilhelm molterer , joerg haider , alex van der bellen , werner faymann in the last general elections in october 2006 , voter participation was 78.49 percent , including absentee ballots .
far-right gains due to disillusionment the far-right gains were the most worrying results of the election but experts said the parties got a massive boost because voters were frustrated with the centrist coalition parties and not because of the rightists ' anti-immigration rhetoric .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : strache has aligned himself with people like le pen the results for heinz christian strache 's fpoe were up seven percent from the last elections in 2006 , while haider 's bzoe more than doubled its votes to 11 percent , from 4 percent in 2006 .
" the main reason was that the government 's dismal performance , " political scientist peter gerlich of the vienna university said , explaining voters ' shift to the far right .
the coalition between social democrats and their junior partner , the conservative people 's party -lrb- oevp -rrb- , split in july after 18 months of bickering and political stalemate .
experts also said the two parties were successful at portraying themselves as caring for lower-income voters worried about rising prices .
although the social democrats pushed a package of social spending bills through parliament mere days before the elections , the freedom party had more credibility with social issues , fritz plasser of innsbruck university said .
" supporting the weak helped them , " plasser said .
strache 's anti-european union rhetoric also resonated in a country where 47 percent of the population thinks austria has not benefited from being an eu member .
but despite these factors , there is no denying that strache 's freedom party , and , to a lesser extent , haider 's alliance , banked on voters ' anti-immigrant and anti-islamic sentiments .
controversial electioneering at strache 's final election rally in one of vienna 's working class districts last friday , the crowd cheered loudest not when he spoke about social issues , but when he complained that foreigners were now allowed to live in social housing projects .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : haider made yet another comeback in sunday 's election haider suggested during the election race that all asylum seekers should be made to wear electronic tags to monitor their movements .
although it is clear that both right-wing parties will play a bigger role in austrian politics , both social democrats and conservatives have so far ruled out forming coalitions with strache or haider .
" the spoe will be somewhat tempted , " to cooperate with the freedom party , gerlich said .
but his colleague plasser said that such a coalition would create a deep split among social democrats .

but rarely do enough fans show up to fill the enormous stadium . as a result hertha 's management is currently pondering saying " auf wiedersehen " to the stadium - where legendary black us sprinter jesse owens made athletics history 72 years ago by bagging four olympic gold medals - and building a new " soccer-only " stadium elsewhere in the city .
for hertha , the drawback with the olympic stadium is its size .
the athletics track bordering the pitch also means fans are some distance from the soccer action , unlike crowds at frankfurt , hamburg , borussia dortmund and bayern munich , which itself moved from the munich olympic stadium to the allianz arena for similar reasons , where stands rise just a few meters from the touch-line .
berlin 's olympic stadium has a 76,000 maximum crowd capacity , but about the only time hertha draws a crowd that size is when it plays bayern at home in the league .
at most other games , the stadium remains only about 50 percent occupied .
this has led to discussions at the club , with officials - club manager dieter hoeness among them - openly favoring a " soccer only " club ground .
hertha pay around 4.5 million euros in annual rent for the olympic stadium , and are currently contracted to stay at the olympic stadium until the year 2017 but hoeness says the club is not seeking to change that arrangement .
but he notes that if hertha pursues the idea of building a new club ground a minimum period of seven or eight years planning would be needed before it was realized .
huge home ground swallows smalls crowds bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : no every day can be world cup final day in berlin hertha 's problems were highlighted a fortnight ago when the club entertained dublin side st patrick 's athletic in an uefa cup match at home , and only 13,000 spectators showed up .
similarly at the club 's first two home league matches this season the home ground was barely 50 per cent occupied while last season average attendances of 44,483 were achieved .
berlin city government officials have been surprised by the talk of hertha possibly wanting to exit the olympic stadium .
for erhart koerting , berlin 's social democrat interior and sport minister , the olympic stadium is a world-famous sports facility , as evidenced by its hosting of the 2009 world athletics championships .
it underwent a major 282-million-euro revamp in the run-up to the 2006 world cup , when it was endowed with a spectacular oval-shaped roof , towering 68 meters above its enlarged seating area and bevy of vip loges .
for that reason alone , hertha could not expect financial support from the public purse if it was to build a new stadium , said koerting .
opinion divided over relocation bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : few sides can boast such a spectacular home stadium even hertha league players are divided by talk of a new stadium .
steve von bergen , a club defender , says : " it would be a shame if hertha no longer played at the olympic stadium .
the stadium is a monument .
every day people come to look at it , even when there is n't football activity there . "
club goalkeeper jaroslav drobny takes another view .
" naturally the olympic stadium has a long tradition , but times have changed .
when hertha played st patrick 's recently the stadium was empty , one could hear the fans , but not see them , " he claimed .
" the club deserves to play in a stadium which is 100 per-cent tailored for football , " he reckons .
midfield player fabian lustenberger , on the other hand , says the " football atmosphere " at the stadium is not as bad as it 's often painted .

the csu polled 43.4 percent of the vote on sunday , sept .
28 , in its worst showing in half a century .
the center-left social democrats -lrb- spd -rrb- , which govern in a grand coalition with merkel 's party in berlin , polled 18.6 percent , a decline of 1 percentage point from the last state election in 2003 . csu secretary general christine haderthauer said the disastrous result was a black day for the party , which had ruled unchallenged for more than 40 years .
in the last state elections in 2003 , the csu polled 60.7 percent of the vote in the strongly catholic state , where some of germany 's leading companies have their headquarters , including siemens and bmw .
the party 's stated intent had been to retain its absolute majority in the 180-seat parliament in munich .
" we have clearly failed to achieve our goal , " haderthauer said .
beckstein refuses to shoulder the blame bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : beckstein and huber will face an inquest into the defeat state prime minister guenther beckstein , who was elected last year after longtime leader edmund stoiber was toppled in a party revolt , ruled out stepping down to take responsibility for the poor showing .
" the people have shown that they want a csu-led government , but that they do not want the csu to govern bavaria alone , " he said , adding that the party would immediately start to look for a coalition partner .
the most likely contenders are the liberal free democrats -lrb- fdp -rrb- , who polled 8 percent of the vote to enter parliament after an absence of 14 years .
the liberals are eyeing a coalition with the cdu at the national level next year , but shifting alliances in the party landscape could make a wider alliance possible .
another possibility is the free voters , a conservative party that will make its parliamentary debut after winning 10.2 percent on a platform seeking greater local power .
the environmentalist greens won 9.4 percent , but the pro-labor left party at 4.3 percent failed to clear the 5 percent hurdle needed to get into parliament . the csu 's good showing in bavaria in the 2004 general election helped elevate merkel to power , but its popularity has been steadily eroding under beckstein and party chairman erwin huber . losses by the state-owned bank bayernlb , the scrapping of a prestigious super-fast train link to the munich airport and a controversial smoking ban combined to fuel voter discontent .
analysts said the party 's poor performance could increase pressure on the csu leadership , which had been criticized for running a tepid campaign and failing to galvanize voters . the party ran a campaign highlighting the csu 's past successes while pushing for greater tax breaks for commuters and better conditions for working mothers .
state losses could have national ramifications the dramatic losses suffered by the csu in bavaria have ramifications well beyond the borders of germany 's largest state .

foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier , who has been picked by the spd to challenge merkel for the chancellorship , said the vote had far-reaching implications .
" we are not talking about an election result , " he said , " but about an earthquake that has been unleashed by this election in bavaria . "
but he did n't mention that his party 's own performance of just over 18 percent was also its worst-ever showing in the prosperous state of laptops and lederhosen .
analysts said that voters punished the csu for clinging to traditional social values and catholic church doctrine in a europe that has become increasingly secular .
it did not help that beckstein and party chairman erwin huber lacked the charisma of stoiber and failed to galvanize voters to support a fresh vision .
recent state elections have seen coalitions between the cdu and greens in hamburg , and the spd eyeing an alliance with the greens and the left in hesse , where there is a minority cdu caretaker government .
the defeated spd candidate in bavaria , franz maget , even suggested a four-party coalition to unseat the csu , arguing that the ruling party had morally lost the right to govern .

the german finance ministry in berlin said it has provided hre guarantees for an emergency credit line totalling 35 billion euros -lrb- $ 50 billion -rrb- .
the ministry added that it had no intention of nationalizing the lender . a spokesman said the commitment was needed so that banks could bail out hre , but the actual losses were not that high . sources said the commitment could potentially strain chancellor angela merkel 's federal budget .
germany 's parliament would have to vote on the bailout package .
hre is the first major german casualty of the current worldwide financial crisis . hre said in munich that a consortium of banks came to its rescue overnight as it faced a refinancing squeeze , extending credit to tide over the problems .
hre did not name the banks or disclose the size of the bailout . stock price plummets amid news of bailout as trading began on the frankfurt stock exchange , hre shares plunged 63 percent to 4.95 euros , dragging down other banks . hre had earlier been in urgent talks with german banking regulator bafin and the finance ministry seeking a solution . germany 's second-biggest commercial-property lender , a blue chip among the 30 top companies in the dax stock index , had fallen victim to speculation by its dublin-based unit depfa , which specializes in loans to local governments in germany . depfa had pursued long-term projects with heavy loans and generally ensured refinancing only at the last minute .
it was caught short when it could not raise sufficient short-term money . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the us senate banking committee will decide on the plan hre , which also lends money for commercial and industrial property , said it had entered into talks with the banks " in response to the extremely challenging conditions on the international money markets following the lehman collapse and other market disruptions . " commerzbank , germany 's number-two bank , said it had already secured all the refinancing it needed this year and had no desire to take over hre .
commerzbank stock dipped up to 25 percent monday before clawing back some ground . markets plunge as world waits for us plan approval meanwhile , global stock markets tumbled as the us congress was to vote on a multi-billion dollar bailout deal . us lawmakers agreed over the weekend to a $ 700-billion -lrb- 479-billion-euro -rrb- bailout for debt-stricken wall street banks and sent the legislation aiming to stem the us financial crisis for congress to start voting on monday . meanwhile , there were still doubts about the proposed us financial rescue package , which needs to be approved by congress and offers no guarantee of an end to the credit crunch that has ravaged global markets , dealers said . " in our view , while the ' bailout plan ' reduces the risk of a systemic collapse , many downside risks remain - not least those related to a protracted slowdown in the global economy , " barclays capital analyst david woo told reporters .
" in addition ... the financial market turbulence is seriously affecting the european financial system . " woo added : " the weakness in equities ... suggests the market is pessimistic about the likely effectiveness of the -lrb- us -rrb- treasury 's plan . " the us deal , announced just hours before asian markets opened , is designed to mop up toxic debts from struggling banks and prevent further financial chaos that could tip the world 's largest economy into recession . the unprecedented us bailout would be the largest government economic intervention since the great depression of the 1930s , and aims to shore up an economy in the face of a severe housing slump . us treasury secretary henry paulson said the package " gives us the flexibility to unclog our financial markets -lrb- and -rrb- increase the ability of our financial institutions to deliver the credit that will help create jobs . " ecb offers special loan as france call emergency meeting the european central bank monday announced a special 38-day euro loan to provide euro zone banks with more cash in a bid to balance conditions on extremely tense interbank money markets . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : sarkozy wants to insure the safety of france 's banks also on monday , french president nicolas sarkozy said he will meet with the chief executives of leading french banks and insurance companies to discuss the global financial crisis on tuesday . the meeting at the elysee presidential palace is to " review the situation of financial institutions and the credit level of households and businesses , " said a statement from the presidency on monday . sarkozy warned in a major address last week that france would not be spared from the turmoil unleashed by the us banking crisis . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

28 . the social democrats -lrb- spoe -rrb- took 29.7 percent while the conservatives -lrb- oevp -rrb- secured 25.6 percent , according to official ministry results , which did not include absentee ballots .
the far-right , meanwhile , established itself as the third political force in austria , with 18.0 percent for the freedom party -lrb- fpoe -rrb- and a surprising 11.0 percent for joerg haider 's smaller alliance for austria 's future -lrb- bzoe -rrb- .
the greens had to settle for fifth place with 9.8 percent .
a total 15 parties were listed on the ballot in sunday 's election , the highest number in austrian electoral history , but most of them did not pass the 4.0-percent threshold to get into parliament .
participation stood at 71.4 percent , out of 6.3 million eligible voters , but some 586,700 absentees still had to be taken into account .
these were to be tallied in the next week with full final results expected on oct .
6 .
bildunterschrift : heinz strache , wilhelm molterer , joerg haider , alex van der bellen , werner faymann in the last general elections in october 2006 , voter participation was 78.49 percent , including absentee ballots .
far-right gains due to disillusionment the far-right gains were the most worrying results of the election but experts said the parties got a massive boost because voters were frustrated with the centrist coalition parties and not because of the rightists ' anti-immigration rhetoric .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : strache has aligned himself with people like le pen the results for heinz christian strache 's fpoe were up seven percent from the last elections in 2006 , while haider 's bzoe more than doubled its votes to 11 percent , from 4 percent in 2006 .
" the main reason was that the government 's dismal performance , " political scientist peter gerlich of the vienna university said , explaining voters ' shift to the far right .
the coalition between social democrats and their junior partner , the conservative people 's party -lrb- oevp -rrb- , split in july after 18 months of bickering and political stalemate .
experts also said the two parties were successful at portraying themselves as caring for lower-income voters worried about rising prices .
although the social democrats pushed a package of social spending bills through parliament mere days before the elections , the freedom party had more credibility with social issues , fritz plasser of innsbruck university said .
" supporting the weak helped them , " plasser said .
strache 's anti-european union rhetoric also resonated in a country where 47 percent of the population thinks austria has not benefited from being an eu member .
but despite these factors , there is no denying that strache 's freedom party , and , to a lesser extent , haider 's alliance , banked on voters ' anti-immigrant and anti-islamic sentiments .
controversial electioneering at strache 's final election rally in one of vienna 's working class districts last friday , the crowd cheered loudest not when he spoke about social issues , but when he complained that foreigners were now allowed to live in social housing projects .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : haider made yet another comeback in sunday 's election haider suggested during the election race that all asylum seekers should be made to wear electronic tags to monitor their movements .
although it is clear that both right-wing parties will play a bigger role in austrian politics , both social democrats and conservatives have so far ruled out forming coalitions with strache or haider .
" the spoe will be somewhat tempted , " to cooperate with the freedom party , gerlich said .
but his colleague plasser said that such a coalition would create a deep split among social democrats .
there is also a rumor about a -lrb- social democratic -rrb- minority government with parliamentary support from the freedom party , gerlich said . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the center-left social democrats -lrb- spd -rrb- , which govern in a grand coalition with merkel 's party in berlin , polled 18.6 percent , a decline of 1 percentage point from the last state election in 2003 . csu secretary general christine haderthauer said the disastrous result was a black day for the party , which had ruled unchallenged for more than 40 years .
in the last state elections in 2003 , the csu polled 60.7 percent of the vote in the strongly catholic state , where some of germany 's leading companies have their headquarters , including siemens and bmw .
the party 's stated intent had been to retain its absolute majority in the 180-seat parliament in munich .
" we have clearly failed to achieve our goal , " haderthauer said .
beckstein refuses to shoulder the blame bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : beckstein and huber will face an inquest into the defeat state prime minister guenther beckstein , who was elected last year after longtime leader edmund stoiber was toppled in a party revolt , ruled out stepping down to take responsibility for the poor showing .
" the people have shown that they want a csu-led government , but that they do not want the csu to govern bavaria alone , " he said , adding that the party would immediately start to look for a coalition partner .
the most likely contenders are the liberal free democrats -lrb- fdp -rrb- , who polled 8 percent of the vote to enter parliament after an absence of 14 years .
the liberals are eyeing a coalition with the cdu at the national level next year , but shifting alliances in the party landscape could make a wider alliance possible .
another possibility is the free voters , a conservative party that will make its parliamentary debut after winning 10.2 percent on a platform seeking greater local power .
the environmentalist greens won 9.4 percent , but the pro-labor left party at 4.3 percent failed to clear the 5 percent hurdle needed to get into parliament . the csu 's good showing in bavaria in the 2004 general election helped elevate merkel to power , but its popularity has been steadily eroding under beckstein and party chairman erwin huber . losses by the state-owned bank bayernlb , the scrapping of a prestigious super-fast train link to the munich airport and a controversial smoking ban combined to fuel voter discontent .
analysts said the party 's poor performance could increase pressure on the csu leadership , which had been criticized for running a tepid campaign and failing to galvanize voters . the party ran a campaign highlighting the csu 's past successes while pushing for greater tax breaks for commuters and better conditions for working mothers .
state losses could have national ramifications the dramatic losses suffered by the csu in bavaria have ramifications well beyond the borders of germany 's largest state .
the shockwaves reached as far as berlin , where merkel rules in an uneasy grand coalition with the left-of-center social democrats -lrb- spd -rrb- . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel will want answers from the csu leadership analysts said that the outcome could increase tension between the coalition partners and hurt merkel 's chances of retaining power in federal elections scheduled for september 2009 .
foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier , who has been picked by the spd to challenge merkel for the chancellorship , said the vote had far-reaching implications .
" we are not talking about an election result , " he said , " but about an earthquake that has been unleashed by this election in bavaria . "
but he did n't mention that his party 's own performance of just over 18 percent was also its worst-ever showing in the prosperous state of laptops and lederhosen .
analysts said that voters punished the csu for clinging to traditional social values and catholic church doctrine in a europe that has become increasingly secular .
it did not help that beckstein and party chairman erwin huber lacked the charisma of stoiber and failed to galvanize voters to support a fresh vision .
recent state elections have seen coalitions between the cdu and greens in hamburg , and the spd eyeing an alliance with the greens and the left in hesse , where there is a minority cdu caretaker government .
the defeated spd candidate in bavaria , franz maget , even suggested a four-party coalition to unseat the csu , arguing that the ruling party had morally lost the right to govern .
while the greens said they would support such a move , the fdp said it was not interested in " a gaudy coalition of anarchists . " dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

28 , the belgian , dutch and luxembourg governments agreed to inject 11.2 billion euros -lrb- $ 16.4 billion -rrb- into the banking and insurance company fortis after a weekend of high drama .
the presence of trichet , who as ecb head is responsible for safeguarding financial stability in the euro zone , was unprecedented in a commercial bank rescue and underlined the seriousness of concern for the integrity of the euro zone 's financial system .
in the first major bank crisis to hit the euro zone in 13 months of global financial turmoil that began in the united states , fortis looked to be in severe danger with some experts concerned that the tri-nation group could go under by monday if nothing was done to save it .
fortis saw its shares drop by a third last week on investor concerns about its liquidity and funding which stem from last year 's 70 billion euro purchase of dutch bank abn amro with partners royal bank of scotland and spain 's santander .

the dutch ing group was alleged to have bid just 1.5 euros per share .

" ostalgia , " a pun combing " nostalgia and " ost " -lrb- east -rrb- , is on the rise and numerous businesses and individuals are cashing in on the trend .
today , you can have your picture taken with a soviet soldier look-alike at the former checkpoint charlie crossing in berlin or rent a room in a sparsely furnished apartment that is a replica of a 1980s east german accommodation .
you can also take a tour of east berlin in a plastic-body trabi car that east germans had to wait years to buy .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the ' ostel ' hostel in berlin gives visitors a look into the communist gdr " ask the people who run those businesses if they would still want to live in an old , small , box-like flat in a concrete high-rise , " said dagmar schipanski , president of the parliament in the eastern german state of thuringia .
" most of them now own expensive apartments and drive nice cars . "
missing the historical context schipanski makes no attempt to hide her anger when talking about what she regards as " a deliberate exclusion of the real historical context . "
the 65-year-old former scientist , who grew up in the german democratic republic , the eastern part of divided germany , heads a commission that drafted a position paper on eastern germany 's future .
the panel , which also reviewed successes and failures in the eastern region since the wall came down in 1989 , was set up by chancellor angela merkel 's christian democratic party -lrb- cdu -rrb- .
the document , which has been criticized by opposition parties for failing to examine the cdu 's own role in east germany , also suggests strategies for future development .
call for better education a central demand is directed at the education system .
" we need to come to terms with the history of divided germany in our schools , by reforming curricula and teaching practices alike , " said schipanski .
her call is echoed by another recent study assessing the level of knowledge about east and west german history . " pupils know next to nothing , " said klaus schroeder , the berlin professor who headed the survey .
" fewer than one in two knows who built the berlin wall . "
bildunterschrift : not everyone who lived in east germany knows that the berlin wall was built in 1961 on orders from state council chairman walter ulbrich the little they did know they learned from their families or from television shows , which painted a distorted picture , schroeder added .
establishments like die firma -lrb- the firm -rrb- , a pub themed after east germany 's dreaded stasi secret service , which a former stasi informer opened in berlin a few months ago , was " utterly tasteless , " schroeder said .
many students confirmed the findings of the study based on their own experience , jan redmann , a member of the cdu 's youth organization , the ju , told dpa news agency .
" pupils tell us that east germany is often omitted in lessons , " he says .
" that 's also because dealing with the german past for many teachers also means dealing with their own biographies . "
the other side of the story together with other ju members , redmann started an anti-ostalgie campaign three years ago when east german-themed shows first hit german tv screens .
" on these program , celebrities go on about how much fun it was to drive a trabi and to mix their own fuel , " complains campaigner peter tauber .
" but they never mentioned that you had to wait years to get a car in the first place . "
some 700 people have so far signed up to the online campaign , whose web site is decorated with a banana , a symbol of the shortage of imported goods in the soviet-guided east germany .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the new stasi bar in berlin has been frowned upon " citizens were never fully informed about the actual state of the economy , " cdu politician schipanski told dpa .
the upheavals they faced in 1989 were very serious and often meant unemployment or starting a new career from scratch , she said .
" we have to honor their achievements in adapting to a completely different environment . "
she agreed with social scientist schroeder that unemployment and economic deprivation should not be an excuse to paint a glossy picture of life in east germany .
separating state and citizens " we have to make clear that criticizing the system does not mean criticizing the people , " schroeder said .
" but we must improve education about the second german dictatorship , because that 's what it was . "
daniel helbig , who runs the east german-style ostel guesthouse in berlin , did not want to be drawn into the political aspect of the debate .
he pointed out another ostalgie attraction which opened last week in cooperation with his hostel - a 2,200-square-meter -lrb- 23,700-square-foot -rrb- exhibition of artworks commissioned by east germany . dpa news agency -lrb- kjb -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de elections -pipe- 29.09.2008 far right enjoys gains as social democrats win austrian election großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : joerg haider -lrb- left -rrb- and his bzoe far-right party were among those who made electoral gains austria 's social democrats won sunday 's elections ahead of the conservative people 's party , but the far-right freedom party made big gains , interior minister maria fekter said sunday , sept .
28 . the social democrats -lrb- spoe -rrb- took 29.7 percent while the conservatives -lrb- oevp -rrb- secured 25.6 percent , according to official ministry results , which did not include absentee ballots .
the far-right , meanwhile , established itself as the third political force in austria , with 18.0 percent for the freedom party -lrb- fpoe -rrb- and a surprising 11.0 percent for joerg haider 's smaller alliance for austria 's future -lrb- bzoe -rrb- .
the greens had to settle for fifth place with 9.8 percent .
a total 15 parties were listed on the ballot in sunday 's election , the highest number in austrian electoral history , but most of them did not pass the 4.0-percent threshold to get into parliament .
participation stood at 71.4 percent , out of 6.3 million eligible voters , but some 586,700 absentees still had to be taken into account .
these were to be tallied in the next week with full final results expected on oct .
6 .
bildunterschrift : heinz strache , wilhelm molterer , joerg haider , alex van der bellen , werner faymann in the last general elections in october 2006 , voter participation was 78.49 percent , including absentee ballots .
far-right gains due to disillusionment the far-right gains were the most worrying results of the election but experts said the parties got a massive boost because voters were frustrated with the centrist coalition parties and not because of the rightists ' anti-immigration rhetoric .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : strache has aligned himself with people like le pen the results for heinz christian strache 's fpoe were up seven percent from the last elections in 2006 , while haider 's bzoe more than doubled its votes to 11 percent , from 4 percent in 2006 .
" the main reason was that the government 's dismal performance , " political scientist peter gerlich of the vienna university said , explaining voters ' shift to the far right .
the coalition between social democrats and their junior partner , the conservative people 's party -lrb- oevp -rrb- , split in july after 18 months of bickering and political stalemate .
experts also said the two parties were successful at portraying themselves as caring for lower-income voters worried about rising prices .
although the social democrats pushed a package of social spending bills through parliament mere days before the elections , the freedom party had more credibility with social issues , fritz plasser of innsbruck university said .
" supporting the weak helped them , " plasser said .
strache 's anti-european union rhetoric also resonated in a country where 47 percent of the population thinks austria has not benefited from being an eu member .
but despite these factors , there is no denying that strache 's freedom party , and , to a lesser extent , haider 's alliance , banked on voters ' anti-immigrant and anti-islamic sentiments .
controversial electioneering at strache 's final election rally in one of vienna 's working class districts last friday , the crowd cheered loudest not when he spoke about social issues , but when he complained that foreigners were now allowed to live in social housing projects .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : haider made yet another comeback in sunday 's election haider suggested during the election race that all asylum seekers should be made to wear electronic tags to monitor their movements .
although it is clear that both right-wing parties will play a bigger role in austrian politics , both social democrats and conservatives have so far ruled out forming coalitions with strache or haider .
" the spoe will be somewhat tempted , " to cooperate with the freedom party , gerlich said .
but his colleague plasser said that such a coalition would create a deep split among social democrats .
there is also a rumor about a -lrb- social democratic -rrb- minority government with parliamentary support from the freedom party , gerlich said . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

28 . the social democrats -lrb- spoe -rrb- took 29.7 percent while the conservatives -lrb- oevp -rrb- secured 25.6 percent , according to official ministry results , which did not include absentee ballots .
the far-right , meanwhile , established itself as the third political force in austria , with 18.0 percent for the freedom party -lrb- fpoe -rrb- and a surprising 11.0 percent for joerg haider 's smaller alliance for austria 's future -lrb- bzoe -rrb- .
the greens had to settle for fifth place with 9.8 percent .
a total 15 parties were listed on the ballot in sunday 's election , the highest number in austrian electoral history , but most of them did not pass the 4.0-percent threshold to get into parliament .
participation stood at 71.4 percent , out of 6.3 million eligible voters , but some 586,700 absentees still had to be taken into account .
these were to be tallied in the next week with full final results expected on oct .
6 .
bildunterschrift : heinz strache , wilhelm molterer , joerg haider , alex van der bellen , werner faymann in the last general elections in october 2006 , voter participation was 78.49 percent , including absentee ballots .
far-right gains due to disillusionment the far-right gains were the most worrying results of the election but experts said the parties got a massive boost because voters were frustrated with the centrist coalition parties and not because of the rightists ' anti-immigration rhetoric .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : strache has aligned himself with people like le pen the results for heinz christian strache 's fpoe were up seven percent from the last elections in 2006 , while haider 's bzoe more than doubled its votes to 11 percent , from 4 percent in 2006 .
" the main reason was that the government 's dismal performance , " political scientist peter gerlich of the vienna university said , explaining voters ' shift to the far right .
the coalition between social democrats and their junior partner , the conservative people 's party -lrb- oevp -rrb- , split in july after 18 months of bickering and political stalemate .
experts also said the two parties were successful at portraying themselves as caring for lower-income voters worried about rising prices .
although the social democrats pushed a package of social spending bills through parliament mere days before the elections , the freedom party had more credibility with social issues , fritz plasser of innsbruck university said .
" supporting the weak helped them , " plasser said .
strache 's anti-european union rhetoric also resonated in a country where 47 percent of the population thinks austria has not benefited from being an eu member .
but despite these factors , there is no denying that strache 's freedom party , and , to a lesser extent , haider 's alliance , banked on voters ' anti-immigrant and anti-islamic sentiments .
controversial electioneering at strache 's final election rally in one of vienna 's working class districts last friday , the crowd cheered loudest not when he spoke about social issues , but when he complained that foreigners were now allowed to live in social housing projects .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : haider made yet another comeback in sunday 's election haider suggested during the election race that all asylum seekers should be made to wear electronic tags to monitor their movements .
although it is clear that both right-wing parties will play a bigger role in austrian politics , both social democrats and conservatives have so far ruled out forming coalitions with strache or haider .
" the spoe will be somewhat tempted , " to cooperate with the freedom party , gerlich said .
but his colleague plasser said that such a coalition would create a deep split among social democrats .
there is also a rumor about a -lrb- social democratic -rrb- minority government with parliamentary support from the freedom party , gerlich said . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de politics -pipe- 29.09.2008 merkel disappointed by bavarian ally 's drubbing at polls großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel 's expression spoke volumes about the mood in germany 's conservative camp chancellor merkel says her governing conservatives must focus on the economy , jobs and education in the wake of a massive loss for her allies in bavaria that could hurt her bid for re-election in polls next year . a day after her bavarian ally , the christian social union -lrb- csu -rrb- lost their absolute majority it had held in bavaria 's state assembly for nearly half a century , chancellor merkel said she would try harder to win back voters , stressing the economy , creating jobs , education and integrating minorities in her campaign . " we 'll offer germans a vision of the future and steadiness amid globalization , " the chancellor said in berlin on monday , sept 29 . csu loss could hurt merkel 's re-election voters in bavaria on sunday turned their backs on the csu in large numbers , handing big gains to smaller parties . the csu polled just 43.4 per cent of the vote in its worst showing in half a century .
after more than 40 years of solo rule , it will have to embrace one of the minor parties as a coalition partner to retain power .
the munich-based respected daily sueddeutsche zeitung called the conservatives ' drubbing " an unparalleled humiliation . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : in mourning - merkel , center , with bavaria 's premier beckstein , right , and csu leader huber analysts said the drubbing had to do with the conservative party 's lack of vision in bavaria and the compromises it has made on a national level as part of merkel 's uneasy " grand coalition " with the social democrats in berlin .
the social democrats , however , were unable to capitalize on the conservatives ' misery and slipped one point to 18.6 percent . the bavarian election result has alarmed merkel 's conservative christian democratic union -lrb- cdu -rrb- as the chancellor struggles to win re-election next year . merkel 's cdu does not operate in bavaria .
the csu 's federal legislators form a single bloc with the cdu in berlin and are crucial to her hold on power . tensions among cdu and csu amid calls from csu stalwarts for heads to roll , the bavarian party announced a party congress would be held on october 25 . party chairman erwin huber said it would enable " self criticism " of where the party went wrong .
he termed the poll outcome a rebuke , but was tight-lipped about whether or not he would stand down . as analysts predicted that the cdu and csu would have to adopt a harder political edge to attract centre-right voters at germany 's general election next year , merkel said the csu had failed to win confidence in bavaria that it was entitled to rule alone . merkel 's critics have suggested that her steady-as-we-go approach has failed to inspire voters , especially when the cdu has had to soft-pedal its usual centre-right policies to avoid upsetting the social democrats -lrb- spd -rrb- , the other coalition party . huber attacked merkel over her refusal to endorse csu proposals for tax rebates , saying , " we wish the cdu had supported us more . " despite pressure by some senior cdu figures to end the federal grand coalition now , merkel said her government would stay in place until the election , which is scheduled for september 27 , 2009 . the spd polled 18.6 per cent in bavaria , a decline of 1 percentage point from the last state election in 2003 , as voters forsook both big parties for smaller rivals . huber said the csu would invite the small free democrat party , which gained 8 per cent of the vote , or the free voters , a conservative party with 10.2 per cent , into a coalition . guenther beckstein , the csu premier of mainly catholic bavaria , said monday he would insist that the future state coalition put a focus on traditional values including patriotism and social conservatism . dw staff -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the results could have an effect on national elections . the result of the state elections in bavaria is like an earthquake shaking german politics .
the csu 's absolute majority in the state was considered to be a law of nature but now that law has been smashed and the csu must find itself a coalition partner - it 's something only old bavarians know from the 1950s .
the shockwaves from this earthquake reach all the way to berlin .
angela merkel wants to continue as chancellor after next year 's parliamentary election but not as the head of the deeply unpopular grand coalition with the social democrats .
she would much prefer the fdp free market liberals . for that to happen , it 's not just the fdp that needs to ratchet up votes .
the conservatives from merkel 's christian democratic union -lrb- cdu -rrb- and its sister party , the christian social -lrb- csu -rrb- need to hugely boost their support .
right now , however the csu has done just the opposite , by suffering massive losses in bavaria .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : peter stützle admittedly , the earthquake has n't exactly put the brand new chancellor candidate of germany 's social democrats , frank-walter steinmeier , in a better position .
despite the weakness of the ruling csu , the social democrats in bavaria could n't capitalize on the conservatives ' disarray and recorded their worst result in five years .
steinmeier 's dream partners , the greens and the fdp may both have increased their gains but a three-way coalition of the spd , greens and the fdp can only work if the spd becomes stronger - if anything , the party has just gotten a little weaker .
one of the most striking results of the bavarian election has been the continuing erosion of germany 's two biggest traditional parties , the spd and the cdu .
it 's a development that has become apparent in all state elections in recent years and in the general elections in 2005 .
what 's equally striking is that the ensuing political camps remain largely unchanged . disillusioned spd supporters usually turn toward the left party and partly toward the greens while fed-up conservative voters flock to the fdp and , in the case of bavaria , to the free voters .
the free voters , a grassroots organization which largely includes former csu members , attaches great importance to the principle that they are n't beholden to any party line .
the group however will not contest the general elections next year which means that a lot of their voters could return to the csu .
the grand coalition in berlin now needs to roll up their sleeves to finish off what they started . a few important decisions loom in the next weeks such as tax reforms .
it 's not clear how the csu will react in the grand coalition in berlin , whether it will be stubborn or more open to compromise . if the tensions between the ruling parties continue and increase , then this could exacerbate the frustration in the populace which in turn could accelerate the erosion of the two main parties .
in the end , both the conservative bloc as well as the spd may have no other option other than to forge a new large coalition . peter stützle -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

but rarely do enough fans show up to fill the enormous stadium . as a result hertha 's management is currently pondering saying " auf wiedersehen " to the stadium - where legendary black us sprinter jesse owens made athletics history 72 years ago by bagging four olympic gold medals - and building a new " soccer-only " stadium elsewhere in the city .
for hertha , the drawback with the olympic stadium is its size .
the athletics track bordering the pitch also means fans are some distance from the soccer action , unlike crowds at frankfurt , hamburg , borussia dortmund and bayern munich , which itself moved from the munich olympic stadium to the allianz arena for similar reasons , where stands rise just a few meters from the touch-line .
berlin 's olympic stadium has a 76,000 maximum crowd capacity , but about the only time hertha draws a crowd that size is when it plays bayern at home in the league .
at most other games , the stadium remains only about 50 percent occupied .
this has led to discussions at the club , with officials - club manager dieter hoeness among them - openly favoring a " soccer only " club ground .
hertha pay around 4.5 million euros in annual rent for the olympic stadium , and are currently contracted to stay at the olympic stadium until the year 2017 but hoeness says the club is not seeking to change that arrangement .
but he notes that if hertha pursues the idea of building a new club ground a minimum period of seven or eight years planning would be needed before it was realized .
huge home ground swallows smalls crowds bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : no every day can be world cup final day in berlin hertha 's problems were highlighted a fortnight ago when the club entertained dublin side st patrick 's athletic in an uefa cup match at home , and only 13,000 spectators showed up .
similarly at the club 's first two home league matches this season the home ground was barely 50 per cent occupied while last season average attendances of 44,483 were achieved .
berlin city government officials have been surprised by the talk of hertha possibly wanting to exit the olympic stadium .
for erhart koerting , berlin 's social democrat interior and sport minister , the olympic stadium is a world-famous sports facility , as evidenced by its hosting of the 2009 world athletics championships .
it underwent a major 282-million-euro revamp in the run-up to the 2006 world cup , when it was endowed with a spectacular oval-shaped roof , towering 68 meters above its enlarged seating area and bevy of vip loges .
for that reason alone , hertha could not expect financial support from the public purse if it was to build a new stadium , said koerting .
opinion divided over relocation bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : few sides can boast such a spectacular home stadium even hertha league players are divided by talk of a new stadium .
steve von bergen , a club defender , says : " it would be a shame if hertha no longer played at the olympic stadium .
the stadium is a monument .
every day people come to look at it , even when there is n't football activity there . "
club goalkeeper jaroslav drobny takes another view .
" naturally the olympic stadium has a long tradition , but times have changed .
when hertha played st patrick 's recently the stadium was empty , one could hear the fans , but not see them , " he claimed .
" the club deserves to play in a stadium which is 100 per-cent tailored for football , " he reckons .
midfield player fabian lustenberger , on the other hand , says the " football atmosphere " at the stadium is not as bad as it 's often painted .
" in dortmund or hamburg the soccer feeling is great but at bayern munich the atmosphere 's hardly sensational at times , " he points out . dpa news agency -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

she would much prefer the fdp free market liberals . for that to happen , it 's not just the fdp that needs to ratchet up votes .
the conservatives from merkel 's christian democratic union -lrb- cdu -rrb- and its sister party , the christian social -lrb- csu -rrb- need to hugely boost their support .
right now , however the csu has done just the opposite , by suffering massive losses in bavaria .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : peter stützle admittedly , the earthquake has n't exactly put the brand new chancellor candidate of germany 's social democrats , frank-walter steinmeier , in a better position .
despite the weakness of the ruling csu , the social democrats in bavaria could n't capitalize on the conservatives ' disarray and recorded their worst result in five years .
steinmeier 's dream partners , the greens and the fdp may both have increased their gains but a three-way coalition of the spd , greens and the fdp can only work if the spd becomes stronger - if anything , the party has just gotten a little weaker .
one of the most striking results of the bavarian election has been the continuing erosion of germany 's two biggest traditional parties , the spd and the cdu .
it 's a development that has become apparent in all state elections in recent years and in the general elections in 2005 .
what 's equally striking is that the ensuing political camps remain largely unchanged . disillusioned spd supporters usually turn toward the left party and partly toward the greens while fed-up conservative voters flock to the fdp and , in the case of bavaria , to the free voters .
the free voters , a grassroots organization which largely includes former csu members , attaches great importance to the principle that they are n't beholden to any party line .
the group however will not contest the general elections next year which means that a lot of their voters could return to the csu .
the grand coalition in berlin now needs to roll up their sleeves to finish off what they started . a few important decisions loom in the next weeks such as tax reforms .
it 's not clear how the csu will react in the grand coalition in berlin , whether it will be stubborn or more open to compromise . if the tensions between the ruling parties continue and increase , then this could exacerbate the frustration in the populace which in turn could accelerate the erosion of the two main parties .

but rarely do enough fans show up to fill the enormous stadium . as a result hertha 's management is currently pondering saying " auf wiedersehen " to the stadium - where legendary black us sprinter jesse owens made athletics history 72 years ago by bagging four olympic gold medals - and building a new " soccer-only " stadium elsewhere in the city .
for hertha , the drawback with the olympic stadium is its size .
the athletics track bordering the pitch also means fans are some distance from the soccer action , unlike crowds at frankfurt , hamburg , borussia dortmund and bayern munich , which itself moved from the munich olympic stadium to the allianz arena for similar reasons , where stands rise just a few meters from the touch-line .
berlin 's olympic stadium has a 76,000 maximum crowd capacity , but about the only time hertha draws a crowd that size is when it plays bayern at home in the league .
at most other games , the stadium remains only about 50 percent occupied .
this has led to discussions at the club , with officials - club manager dieter hoeness among them - openly favoring a " soccer only " club ground .
hertha pay around 4.5 million euros in annual rent for the olympic stadium , and are currently contracted to stay at the olympic stadium until the year 2017 but hoeness says the club is not seeking to change that arrangement .
but he notes that if hertha pursues the idea of building a new club ground a minimum period of seven or eight years planning would be needed before it was realized .
huge home ground swallows smalls crowds bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : no every day can be world cup final day in berlin hertha 's problems were highlighted a fortnight ago when the club entertained dublin side st patrick 's athletic in an uefa cup match at home , and only 13,000 spectators showed up .
similarly at the club 's first two home league matches this season the home ground was barely 50 per cent occupied while last season average attendances of 44,483 were achieved .
berlin city government officials have been surprised by the talk of hertha possibly wanting to exit the olympic stadium .
for erhart koerting , berlin 's social democrat interior and sport minister , the olympic stadium is a world-famous sports facility , as evidenced by its hosting of the 2009 world athletics championships .
it underwent a major 282-million-euro revamp in the run-up to the 2006 world cup , when it was endowed with a spectacular oval-shaped roof , towering 68 meters above its enlarged seating area and bevy of vip loges .
for that reason alone , hertha could not expect financial support from the public purse if it was to build a new stadium , said koerting .
opinion divided over relocation bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : few sides can boast such a spectacular home stadium even hertha league players are divided by talk of a new stadium .
steve von bergen , a club defender , says : " it would be a shame if hertha no longer played at the olympic stadium .
the stadium is a monument .
every day people come to look at it , even when there is n't football activity there . "
club goalkeeper jaroslav drobny takes another view .
" naturally the olympic stadium has a long tradition , but times have changed .
when hertha played st patrick 's recently the stadium was empty , one could hear the fans , but not see them , " he claimed .
" the club deserves to play in a stadium which is 100 per-cent tailored for football , " he reckons .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de science -pipe- 29.09.2008 german researchers claim alzheimer 's breakthrough großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : scientists involved with the project say the results on mice have been stunning german scientists have developed a new enzyme-blocking method which nearly halts the formation of protein deposits associated with alzheimer 's .
still , it could be years before the treatment becomes reality . for more than a decade , hans-ulrich demuth and his team at a small biotech firm in eastern germany had been researching protein deposits in the brain , deposits that have long been associated with alzheimer 's disease .
“ our question was what are the harmful components of the protein deposits , and is there a way to reduce or eliminate them by blocking the enzyme we know is part of its characteristics ? "
demuth said .
as it turns out , there was .
demuth 's team at probiodrug found the enzyme that was responsible for an extremely small , but extremely harmful part of the deposits .
it 's known as glutaminyl cyclase -lrb- qc -rrb- and the researchers devised a method they believed would block its function in lab mice .
stunning results stefan rossner of the paul flechsig institute at the university of leipzig was contracted to study the brains of the mice .
he discovered stunning results .
" the protein deposits typical of alzheimer 's disease were reduced in the brains of the mice by up to 80 percent , " he said .
dirk montag of the leibniz institute for neurobiology in magdeburg sought to find out the practical results of the reduced instance of protein deposits , performing behavioral and cognitive tests on the mice .
" in general performance , reflexes and the like , the treated mice were the same as the untreated control mice , " he said , adding , " with the exception of mental functioning , that is , which was improved . "
montag also said that he had found no behavioral side effects .
if success on that scale were to be repeated in human trials , the discovery could prove to be a very big one .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : alzheimer 's is a debilitating and terminal disease alzheimer 's is the most common form of dementia and is triggered when nerve cells in the brain die .
up to a million people in germany are estimated to be afflicted by the disease which remains incurable and causes loss of memory , orientation and recognition .
scientists plan a new study to monitor potential side effects more closely .
but the results of this study are nothing sort of a sensation .
the treatment given to the mice to inhibit the qc enzyme reduced not just the particularly harmful matter within protein deposits in brain cells , rather the size and instance of protein deposits altogether .
holding back from ' breakthrough ' the finding has many in the research community excited , and has earned the study 's results a place in the respected journal nature medicine .
but some say the treatment still has much to prove .
lutz froehlich of mannheim 's central institute of mental health told the associated press that he believed a causal relationship between protein deposits and the death of neural cells had yet to be established .
any treatment that focuses on the deposits may end up missing the target of keeping brain cells alive , he said .
of the positive results in cognitive tests of the learning capabilities of the mice , froehlich said , " animal models can never provide us the whole picture of a disease 's effects , just isolated aspects . " he added that he 'd seen too many studies with great results from animal testing produce underwhelming results from humans .
human testing on its way the researchers ' next challenge will be to take what they know and develop a treatment suitable for humans - that is , one that is both non-toxic and still effective at blocking the enzyme .
demuth said , however , that getting toward such a compound should n't take more than a year .
while there 's no telling as to whether the enzyme blocker will work nearly as well on humans as on mice , demuth was hopeful , saying he thought that " the generations that are now 30 , 40 , or 50 years old should definitely benefit from this discovery . "
if tests do succeed , researches say a legitimate anti-alzheimer 's drug could be available to the public within five to eight years . matt hermann send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

still , it could be years before the treatment becomes reality . for more than a decade , hans-ulrich demuth and his team at a small biotech firm in eastern germany had been researching protein deposits in the brain , deposits that have long been associated with alzheimer 's disease .
“ our question was what are the harmful components of the protein deposits , and is there a way to reduce or eliminate them by blocking the enzyme we know is part of its characteristics ? "
demuth said .
as it turns out , there was .
demuth 's team at probiodrug found the enzyme that was responsible for an extremely small , but extremely harmful part of the deposits .
it 's known as glutaminyl cyclase -lrb- qc -rrb- and the researchers devised a method they believed would block its function in lab mice .
stunning results stefan rossner of the paul flechsig institute at the university of leipzig was contracted to study the brains of the mice .
he discovered stunning results .
" the protein deposits typical of alzheimer 's disease were reduced in the brains of the mice by up to 80 percent , " he said .
dirk montag of the leibniz institute for neurobiology in magdeburg sought to find out the practical results of the reduced instance of protein deposits , performing behavioral and cognitive tests on the mice .
" in general performance , reflexes and the like , the treated mice were the same as the untreated control mice , " he said , adding , " with the exception of mental functioning , that is , which was improved . "
montag also said that he had found no behavioral side effects .
if success on that scale were to be repeated in human trials , the discovery could prove to be a very big one .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : alzheimer 's is a debilitating and terminal disease alzheimer 's is the most common form of dementia and is triggered when nerve cells in the brain die .
up to a million people in germany are estimated to be afflicted by the disease which remains incurable and causes loss of memory , orientation and recognition .
scientists plan a new study to monitor potential side effects more closely .
but the results of this study are nothing sort of a sensation .
the treatment given to the mice to inhibit the qc enzyme reduced not just the particularly harmful matter within protein deposits in brain cells , rather the size and instance of protein deposits altogether .
holding back from ' breakthrough ' the finding has many in the research community excited , and has earned the study 's results a place in the respected journal nature medicine .
but some say the treatment still has much to prove .
lutz froehlich of mannheim 's central institute of mental health told the associated press that he believed a causal relationship between protein deposits and the death of neural cells had yet to be established .
any treatment that focuses on the deposits may end up missing the target of keeping brain cells alive , he said .
of the positive results in cognitive tests of the learning capabilities of the mice , froehlich said , " animal models can never provide us the whole picture of a disease 's effects , just isolated aspects . " he added that he 'd seen too many studies with great results from animal testing produce underwhelming results from humans .
human testing on its way the researchers ' next challenge will be to take what they know and develop a treatment suitable for humans - that is , one that is both non-toxic and still effective at blocking the enzyme .
demuth said , however , that getting toward such a compound should n't take more than a year .
while there 's no telling as to whether the enzyme blocker will work nearly as well on humans as on mice , demuth was hopeful , saying he thought that " the generations that are now 30 , 40 , or 50 years old should definitely benefit from this discovery . "

egyptian authorities said the hostages were freed after a mission near the sudan-chad border and that half the kidnappers were killed .
the kidnappers had demanded a six-million-euro ransom for the hostages - to be paid by germany - but authorities insisted no ransom changed hands .
the identity of the kidnappers has still not been confirmed , but reports speculate the bandits may have been connected with a darfur rebel group , a faction of the sudanese liberation army .
however , none of the region 's rebel groups have claimed responsibility for the kidnapping .
steinmeier uncertain over release details german foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier thanked the authorities that contributed toward securing a " happy ending to the hijacking . "
" i hope -lrb- the freed hostages -rrb- will return to germany as soon as possible , " he said , refusing to elaborate on the circumstances surrounding their release .
" i do not want to reveal details at the moment .
we should wait for the safe return of the hostages first , " he said .
italy thanks involved authorities bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the five germans , five italians and one romanian will undergo medical tests before returning home italian foreign affairs minister franco frattini said the release was the result of " international cooperation for which we should be truly grateful to the authorities of the other countries that worked with us . "
the minister said the release was achieved thanks to " activities that can not be revealed in collaboration with the egyptian authorities , " whom he thanked , " in addition to the germans , who collaborated with -lrb- italy -rrb- and the egyptian , sudanese and libyan authorities for permitting the hostages ’ transit through their respective territories . "
he said italian special forces took part in securing the hostages ' release .
the group - consisting of five germans , five italians and a romanian - was kidnapped sept .
19 while on a desert safari in an isolated south-western region of egypt .
the group was believed to have been first moved across the border to sudan to the remote mountain region of jebel uweinat , a plateau that straddles the borders of egypt , libya and sudan , before the bandits took them into chad , according to sudanese officials .
sudden shootout in an unexpected turn of events sunday , gunfire reportedly broke out between sudanese troops and the hostage-takers after the latter were spotted near the sudan-egypt-libya border area .
the clash ended with the death of six of the bandits and the capture of two .
" the problem was solved .
they had agreed to the ransom .
it was merely a matter of receiving the hostages , but then this surprise happened , " an egyptian security official said . dw staff -lrb- dm -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

many of the votes went to another conservative party , the free voters . the freie waehler , or free voters , won 10.2 percent of the vote , surprising everyone , including themselves .
the election result now makes them the third strongest party in bavaria , behind the once mighty csu and the social democrats .
the free voters have contested two previous bavarian state elections but failed on both occasions to win the five percent required to enter parliament .
“ we 've been wall flowers for long enough , ” said the party 's state chairman , hubert aiwanger , after the results from sunday 's election came through .
“ we 're a force that bavaria has long waited for , ” he added .

" we 've been wall flowers for long enough , " said the party 's state chairman , hubert aiwanger , after the results from sunday 's election came through . " we 're a force that bavaria has long waited for , " he added . the main csu party now has to find a coalition partner to form a government .
the liberal free democrats party -lrb- fdp -rrb- is considered the most likely contender .
with eight percent polled , the fdp will enter parliament for the first time in 14 years .
the free voters are considered the second best option , and hubert aiwanger has not ruled out working with the csu . surprise success the party 's success this time around could be linked to one of its newest members : gabriele pauli .
she joined the party earlier this year , after leaving the csu in controversial circumstances last year . it was partly due to her that former csu leader edmund stoiber left the party .
she 'd openly criticised stoiber , and commentators are now asking whether this was the start of the csu 's downward spiral . with pauli on board , the free voters received much more coverage in the media , at a time when voters were looking away from the csu . in terms of policy , the free voters do n't differ greatly from the main csu party .
but in terms of structure , the free voters are miles apart .
they consider themselves a grassroots organization , and do n't have the same hierarchical structures as other political parties .
their only ideology , they say , is that they are not a party . dw staff -lrb- cla -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de politics -pipe- 29.09.2008 merkel disappointed by bavarian ally 's drubbing at polls großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel 's expression spoke volumes about the mood in germany 's conservative camp chancellor merkel says her governing conservatives must focus on the economy , jobs and education in the wake of a massive loss for her allies in bavaria that could hurt her bid for re-election in polls next year . a day after her bavarian ally , the christian social union -lrb- csu -rrb- lost their absolute majority it had held in bavaria 's state assembly for nearly half a century , chancellor merkel said she would try harder to win back voters , stressing the economy , creating jobs , education and integrating minorities in her campaign . " we 'll offer germans a vision of the future and steadiness amid globalization , " the chancellor said in berlin on monday , sept 29 . csu loss could hurt merkel 's re-election voters in bavaria on sunday turned their backs on the csu in large numbers , handing big gains to smaller parties . the csu polled just 43.4 per cent of the vote in its worst showing in half a century .
after more than 40 years of solo rule , it will have to embrace one of the minor parties as a coalition partner to retain power .
the munich-based respected daily sueddeutsche zeitung called the conservatives ' drubbing " an unparalleled humiliation . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : in mourning - merkel , center , with bavaria 's premier beckstein , right , and csu leader huber analysts said the drubbing had to do with the conservative party 's lack of vision in bavaria and the compromises it has made on a national level as part of merkel 's uneasy " grand coalition " with the social democrats in berlin .
the social democrats , however , were unable to capitalize on the conservatives ' misery and slipped one point to 18.6 percent . the bavarian election result has alarmed merkel 's conservative christian democratic union -lrb- cdu -rrb- as the chancellor struggles to win re-election next year . merkel 's cdu does not operate in bavaria .

some mediterranean regions already receive 20 percent less rain than a century ago , the report said , increasing the risk of forest fires and the desertification of the region .
the report labelled glacier retreat in europe a double-edged sword , projecting an overall increase in river floods across europe , but also an increase in river droughts in the south .
" uncertainty in the rate of melting of greenland 's outlet glaciers makes projections of future sea level rise uncertain , " the report said , adding that according to satellite observations the global sea level had risen by as much as 3.1 mm a year in the past 15 years .
europe a global warming hot spot bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : europe is set to struggle under increasing temperatures caused by global warming the report highlighted the widespread vulnerability of europe to global warming-induced climate change , with mountainous regions , coastal zones , the mediterranean and the arctic set to shoulder the lion 's share of the environmental burden .
" global average temperature has increased almost 0.8 of a degree above pre-industrial levels , with even higher temperature increases in europe and northern latitudes , " the report said .
europe has warmed by 1 degree .
the report 's authors said mitigation and adaptation measures against climate change needed to be more widespread in europe and that today 's efforts focus only on flood management and defense .
they also recommended the creation of a european clearing house on climate change impacts , vulnerability and adaptation to make climate change data widely available . dw staff -lrb- dm -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" we 'll offer germans a vision of the future and steadiness amid globalization , " the chancellor said in berlin on monday , sept 29 . csu loss could hurt merkel 's re-election voters in bavaria on sunday turned their backs on the csu in large numbers , handing big gains to smaller parties . the csu polled just 43.4 per cent of the vote in its worst showing in half a century .
after more than 40 years of solo rule , it will have to embrace one of the minor parties as a coalition partner to retain power .
the munich-based respected daily sueddeutsche zeitung called the conservatives ' drubbing " an unparalleled humiliation . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : in mourning - merkel , center , with bavaria 's premier beckstein , right , and csu leader huber analysts said the drubbing had to do with the conservative party 's lack of vision in bavaria and the compromises it has made on a national level as part of merkel 's uneasy " grand coalition " with the social democrats in berlin .
the social democrats , however , were unable to capitalize on the conservatives ' misery and slipped one point to 18.6 percent . the bavarian election result has alarmed merkel 's conservative christian democratic union -lrb- cdu -rrb- as the chancellor struggles to win re-election next year . merkel 's cdu does not operate in bavaria .

egyptian authorities said the hostages were freed after a mission near the sudan-chad border and that half the kidnappers were killed .
the kidnappers had demanded a six-million-euro ransom for the hostages - to be paid by germany - but authorities insisted no ransom changed hands .
the identity of the kidnappers has still not been confirmed , but reports speculate the bandits may have been connected with a darfur rebel group , a faction of the sudanese liberation army .
however , none of the region 's rebel groups have claimed responsibility for the kidnapping .
steinmeier uncertain over release details german foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier thanked the authorities that contributed toward securing a " happy ending to the hijacking . "
" i hope -lrb- the freed hostages -rrb- will return to germany as soon as possible , " he said , refusing to elaborate on the circumstances surrounding their release .
" i do not want to reveal details at the moment .
we should wait for the safe return of the hostages first , " he said .

"
the minister said the release was achieved thanks to " activities that can not be revealed in collaboration with the egyptian authorities , " whom he thanked , " in addition to the germans , who collaborated with -lrb- italy -rrb- and the egyptian , sudanese and libyan authorities for permitting the hostages ’ transit through their respective territories . "
he said italian special forces took part in securing the hostages ' release .
the group - consisting of five germans , five italians and a romanian - was kidnapped sept .
19 while on a desert safari in an isolated south-western region of egypt .
the group was believed to have been first moved across the border to sudan to the remote mountain region of jebel uweinat , a plateau that straddles the borders of egypt , libya and sudan , before the bandits took them into chad , according to sudanese officials .
sudden shootout in an unexpected turn of events sunday , gunfire reportedly broke out between sudanese troops and the hostage-takers after the latter were spotted near the sudan-egypt-libya border area .
the clash ended with the death of six of the bandits and the capture of two .
" the problem was solved .
they had agreed to the ransom .
it was merely a matter of receiving the hostages , but then this surprise happened , " an egyptian security official said . dw staff -lrb- dm -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the german finance ministry in berlin said it has provided hre guarantees for an emergency credit line totalling 35 billion euros -lrb- $ 50 billion -rrb- .
the ministry added that it had no intention of nationalizing the lender . a spokesman said the commitment was needed so that banks could bail out hre , but the actual losses were not that high . sources said the commitment could potentially strain chancellor angela merkel 's federal budget .
germany 's parliament would have to vote on the bailout package .
hre is the first major german casualty of the current worldwide financial crisis . hre said in munich that a consortium of banks came to its rescue overnight as it faced a refinancing squeeze , extending credit to tide over the problems .
hre did not name the banks or disclose the size of the bailout . stock price plummets amid news of bailout as trading began on the frankfurt stock exchange , hre shares plunged 63 percent to 4.95 euros , dragging down other banks . hre had earlier been in urgent talks with german banking regulator bafin and the finance ministry seeking a solution . germany 's second-biggest commercial-property lender , a blue chip among the 30 top companies in the dax stock index , had fallen victim to speculation by its dublin-based unit depfa , which specializes in loans to local governments in germany . depfa had pursued long-term projects with heavy loans and generally ensured refinancing only at the last minute .
it was caught short when it could not raise sufficient short-term money . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the us senate banking committee will decide on the plan hre , which also lends money for commercial and industrial property , said it had entered into talks with the banks " in response to the extremely challenging conditions on the international money markets following the lehman collapse and other market disruptions . " commerzbank , germany 's number-two bank , said it had already secured all the refinancing it needed this year and had no desire to take over hre .
commerzbank stock dipped up to 25 percent monday before clawing back some ground . markets plunge as world waits for us plan approval meanwhile , global stock markets tumbled as the us congress was to vote on a multi-billion dollar bailout deal . us lawmakers agreed over the weekend to a $ 700-billion -lrb- 479-billion-euro -rrb- bailout for debt-stricken wall street banks and sent the legislation aiming to stem the us financial crisis for congress to start voting on monday . meanwhile , there were still doubts about the proposed us financial rescue package , which needs to be approved by congress and offers no guarantee of an end to the credit crunch that has ravaged global markets , dealers said . " in our view , while the ' bailout plan ' reduces the risk of a systemic collapse , many downside risks remain - not least those related to a protracted slowdown in the global economy , " barclays capital analyst david woo told reporters .
" in addition ... the financial market turbulence is seriously affecting the european financial system . " woo added : " the weakness in equities ... suggests the market is pessimistic about the likely effectiveness of the -lrb- us -rrb- treasury 's plan . " the us deal , announced just hours before asian markets opened , is designed to mop up toxic debts from struggling banks and prevent further financial chaos that could tip the world 's largest economy into recession . the unprecedented us bailout would be the largest government economic intervention since the great depression of the 1930s , and aims to shore up an economy in the face of a severe housing slump . us treasury secretary henry paulson said the package " gives us the flexibility to unclog our financial markets -lrb- and -rrb- increase the ability of our financial institutions to deliver the credit that will help create jobs . " ecb offers special loan as france call emergency meeting the european central bank monday announced a special 38-day euro loan to provide euro zone banks with more cash in a bid to balance conditions on extremely tense interbank money markets . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : sarkozy wants to insure the safety of france 's banks also on monday , french president nicolas sarkozy said he will meet with the chief executives of leading french banks and insurance companies to discuss the global financial crisis on tuesday . the meeting at the elysee presidential palace is to " review the situation of financial institutions and the credit level of households and businesses , " said a statement from the presidency on monday . sarkozy warned in a major address last week that france would not be spared from the turmoil unleashed by the us banking crisis . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

many of the votes went to another conservative party , the free voters . the freie waehler , or free voters , won 10.2 percent of the vote , surprising everyone , including themselves .
the election result now makes them the third strongest party in bavaria , behind the once mighty csu and the social democrats .
the free voters have contested two previous bavarian state elections but failed on both occasions to win the five percent required to enter parliament .
“ we 've been wall flowers for long enough , ” said the party 's state chairman , hubert aiwanger , after the results from sunday 's election came through .
“ we 're a force that bavaria has long waited for , ” he added .

" we 've been wall flowers for long enough , " said the party 's state chairman , hubert aiwanger , after the results from sunday 's election came through . " we 're a force that bavaria has long waited for , " he added . the main csu party now has to find a coalition partner to form a government .
the liberal free democrats party -lrb- fdp -rrb- is considered the most likely contender .
with eight percent polled , the fdp will enter parliament for the first time in 14 years .
the free voters are considered the second best option , and hubert aiwanger has not ruled out working with the csu . surprise success the party 's success this time around could be linked to one of its newest members : gabriele pauli .
she joined the party earlier this year , after leaving the csu in controversial circumstances last year . it was partly due to her that former csu leader edmund stoiber left the party .
she 'd openly criticised stoiber , and commentators are now asking whether this was the start of the csu 's downward spiral . with pauli on board , the free voters received much more coverage in the media , at a time when voters were looking away from the csu . in terms of policy , the free voters do n't differ greatly from the main csu party .
but in terms of structure , the free voters are miles apart .
they consider themselves a grassroots organization , and do n't have the same hierarchical structures as other political parties .
their only ideology , they say , is that they are not a party . dw staff -lrb- cla -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de elections -pipe- 29.09.2008 bavarian conservatives lose state majority in damaging defeat großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : beckstein suffered defeat on what was described as a " black day " for conservatives bavaria 's christian social union -lrb- csu -rrb- lost its decades-old absolute majority as voters defected to smaller parties in a state election seen as a test of support ahead of national polls next year . computer projections showed a swing of more than 17 percentage points away from the sister party of chancellor angela merkel 's christian democrats -lrb- cdu -rrb- , forcing it to look for a coalition partner .
the csu polled 43.4 percent of the vote on sunday , sept .
28 , in its worst showing in half a century .
the center-left social democrats -lrb- spd -rrb- , which govern in a grand coalition with merkel 's party in berlin , polled 18.6 percent , a decline of 1 percentage point from the last state election in 2003 . csu secretary general christine haderthauer said the disastrous result was a black day for the party , which had ruled unchallenged for more than 40 years .
in the last state elections in 2003 , the csu polled 60.7 percent of the vote in the strongly catholic state , where some of germany 's leading companies have their headquarters , including siemens and bmw .
the party 's stated intent had been to retain its absolute majority in the 180-seat parliament in munich .
" we have clearly failed to achieve our goal , " haderthauer said .
beckstein refuses to shoulder the blame bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : beckstein and huber will face an inquest into the defeat state prime minister guenther beckstein , who was elected last year after longtime leader edmund stoiber was toppled in a party revolt , ruled out stepping down to take responsibility for the poor showing .
" the people have shown that they want a csu-led government , but that they do not want the csu to govern bavaria alone , " he said , adding that the party would immediately start to look for a coalition partner .
the most likely contenders are the liberal free democrats -lrb- fdp -rrb- , who polled 8 percent of the vote to enter parliament after an absence of 14 years .
the liberals are eyeing a coalition with the cdu at the national level next year , but shifting alliances in the party landscape could make a wider alliance possible .
another possibility is the free voters , a conservative party that will make its parliamentary debut after winning 10.2 percent on a platform seeking greater local power .
the environmentalist greens won 9.4 percent , but the pro-labor left party at 4.3 percent failed to clear the 5 percent hurdle needed to get into parliament . the csu 's good showing in bavaria in the 2004 general election helped elevate merkel to power , but its popularity has been steadily eroding under beckstein and party chairman erwin huber . losses by the state-owned bank bayernlb , the scrapping of a prestigious super-fast train link to the munich airport and a controversial smoking ban combined to fuel voter discontent .
analysts said the party 's poor performance could increase pressure on the csu leadership , which had been criticized for running a tepid campaign and failing to galvanize voters . the party ran a campaign highlighting the csu 's past successes while pushing for greater tax breaks for commuters and better conditions for working mothers .
state losses could have national ramifications the dramatic losses suffered by the csu in bavaria have ramifications well beyond the borders of germany 's largest state .
the shockwaves reached as far as berlin , where merkel rules in an uneasy grand coalition with the left-of-center social democrats -lrb- spd -rrb- . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel will want answers from the csu leadership analysts said that the outcome could increase tension between the coalition partners and hurt merkel 's chances of retaining power in federal elections scheduled for september 2009 .
foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier , who has been picked by the spd to challenge merkel for the chancellorship , said the vote had far-reaching implications .
" we are not talking about an election result , " he said , " but about an earthquake that has been unleashed by this election in bavaria . "

the csu polled 43.4 percent of the vote on sunday , sept .
28 , in its worst showing in half a century .
the center-left social democrats -lrb- spd -rrb- , which govern in a grand coalition with merkel 's party in berlin , polled 18.6 percent , a decline of 1 percentage point from the last state election in 2003 . csu secretary general christine haderthauer said the disastrous result was a black day for the party , which had ruled unchallenged for more than 40 years .
in the last state elections in 2003 , the csu polled 60.7 percent of the vote in the strongly catholic state , where some of germany 's leading companies have their headquarters , including siemens and bmw .
the party 's stated intent had been to retain its absolute majority in the 180-seat parliament in munich .
" we have clearly failed to achieve our goal , " haderthauer said .
beckstein refuses to shoulder the blame bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : beckstein and huber will face an inquest into the defeat state prime minister guenther beckstein , who was elected last year after longtime leader edmund stoiber was toppled in a party revolt , ruled out stepping down to take responsibility for the poor showing .
" the people have shown that they want a csu-led government , but that they do not want the csu to govern bavaria alone , " he said , adding that the party would immediately start to look for a coalition partner .
the most likely contenders are the liberal free democrats -lrb- fdp -rrb- , who polled 8 percent of the vote to enter parliament after an absence of 14 years .
the liberals are eyeing a coalition with the cdu at the national level next year , but shifting alliances in the party landscape could make a wider alliance possible .
another possibility is the free voters , a conservative party that will make its parliamentary debut after winning 10.2 percent on a platform seeking greater local power .
the environmentalist greens won 9.4 percent , but the pro-labor left party at 4.3 percent failed to clear the 5 percent hurdle needed to get into parliament . the csu 's good showing in bavaria in the 2004 general election helped elevate merkel to power , but its popularity has been steadily eroding under beckstein and party chairman erwin huber . losses by the state-owned bank bayernlb , the scrapping of a prestigious super-fast train link to the munich airport and a controversial smoking ban combined to fuel voter discontent .
analysts said the party 's poor performance could increase pressure on the csu leadership , which had been criticized for running a tepid campaign and failing to galvanize voters . the party ran a campaign highlighting the csu 's past successes while pushing for greater tax breaks for commuters and better conditions for working mothers .
state losses could have national ramifications the dramatic losses suffered by the csu in bavaria have ramifications well beyond the borders of germany 's largest state .

foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier , who has been picked by the spd to challenge merkel for the chancellorship , said the vote had far-reaching implications .
" we are not talking about an election result , " he said , " but about an earthquake that has been unleashed by this election in bavaria . "

28 , the belgian , dutch and luxembourg governments agreed to inject 11.2 billion euros -lrb- $ 16.4 billion -rrb- into the banking and insurance company fortis after a weekend of high drama .
the presence of trichet , who as ecb head is responsible for safeguarding financial stability in the euro zone , was unprecedented in a commercial bank rescue and underlined the seriousness of concern for the integrity of the euro zone 's financial system .
in the first major bank crisis to hit the euro zone in 13 months of global financial turmoil that began in the united states , fortis looked to be in severe danger with some experts concerned that the tri-nation group could go under by monday if nothing was done to save it .
fortis saw its shares drop by a third last week on investor concerns about its liquidity and funding which stem from last year 's 70 billion euro purchase of dutch bank abn amro with partners royal bank of scotland and spain 's santander .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : fortis ' troubles can be traced to the purchase of abn shares dived more than 20 percent to 15-year lows on friday despite a statement that the group 's position was solid and a pledge to expand asset sales to as much as 10 billion euros .
the group 's market capitalization also slumped from 50 billion euros after the abn purchase to just 12 billion euros on friday .
fortis group too large not to be saved fortis , with 85,000 staff worldwide , is the biggest private sector employer in belgium and more than 1.5 million households , roughly half the country , bank with the group .
" we could have not intervened , but the question was whether fortis would have survived on monday , " dutch finance minister wouter bos told reporters .
the benelux governments chose a partial state buyout after two private bidders made paltry offers for the group last week .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the fortis nationalization dwarfs that on northen rock each government will take a 49 percent stake in fortis banks in their respective countries .
belgium will put in 4.7 billion euros , the netherlands 4 billion and luxembourg 2.5 billion , the latter in the form of a convertible loan .
the group 's nationalization dwarfs britain 's state takeover of fallen mortgage lender northern rock last year .
france 's bnp paribas allegedly pulled out of a deal last week after offering just 1.60 euros per share for fortis , compared to friday 's closing price of 5.20 , and demanding state guarantees against possible future losses , a source said .
the dutch ing group was alleged to have bid just 1.5 euros per share .
" there was no serious bidder for the intrinsic value of the whole group , " the source told reuters news agency .
bnp paribas and ing declined comment on reports that they had bid for all or part of fortis .
nationalization comes as all eyes turn to us bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the us federal reserve 's ben bernanke feels the pressure fortis said in a statement it expected total negative value adjustments of about 5 billion euros after tax in the third quarter .
it added its core equity would be around 30 billion euros , resulting in a 9.5 billion euro excess core equity .
the group also said that it will sell the parts of abn that it bought last year .
fortis chairman maurice lippens , accused by shareholders of concealing the bank 's troubles for too long , resigned after the news of the nationalization broke .
fortis also named filip dierckx as chief executive on friday evening , hastily replacing caretaker herman verwilst .
the fortis nationalization came as financial groups around the world watch for any movement from us lawmakers who are still debating whether to sign off on a deal to create a $ 700 billion government fund to buy bad debt from ailing us banks in a bid to stem a credit crisis threatening the global economy . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the presence of trichet , who as ecb head is responsible for safeguarding financial stability in the euro zone , was unprecedented in a commercial bank rescue and underlined the seriousness of concern for the integrity of the euro zone 's financial system .
in the first major bank crisis to hit the euro zone in 13 months of global financial turmoil that began in the united states , fortis looked to be in severe danger with some experts concerned that the tri-nation group could go under by monday if nothing was done to save it .
fortis saw its shares drop by a third last week on investor concerns about its liquidity and funding which stem from last year 's 70 billion euro purchase of dutch bank abn amro with partners royal bank of scotland and spain 's santander .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : fortis ' troubles can be traced to the purchase of abn shares dived more than 20 percent to 15-year lows on friday despite a statement that the group 's position was solid and a pledge to expand asset sales to as much as 10 billion euros .
the group 's market capitalization also slumped from 50 billion euros after the abn purchase to just 12 billion euros on friday .
fortis group too large not to be saved fortis , with 85,000 staff worldwide , is the biggest private sector employer in belgium and more than 1.5 million households , roughly half the country , bank with the group .
" we could have not intervened , but the question was whether fortis would have survived on monday , " dutch finance minister wouter bos told reporters .
the benelux governments chose a partial state buyout after two private bidders made paltry offers for the group last week .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the fortis nationalization dwarfs that on northen rock each government will take a 49 percent stake in fortis banks in their respective countries .
belgium will put in 4.7 billion euros , the netherlands 4 billion and luxembourg 2.5 billion , the latter in the form of a convertible loan .
the group 's nationalization dwarfs britain 's state takeover of fallen mortgage lender northern rock last year .
france 's bnp paribas allegedly pulled out of a deal last week after offering just 1.60 euros per share for fortis , compared to friday 's closing price of 5.20 , and demanding state guarantees against possible future losses , a source said .
the dutch ing group was alleged to have bid just 1.5 euros per share .
" there was no serious bidder for the intrinsic value of the whole group , " the source told reuters news agency .
bnp paribas and ing declined comment on reports that they had bid for all or part of fortis .
nationalization comes as all eyes turn to us bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the us federal reserve 's ben bernanke feels the pressure fortis said in a statement it expected total negative value adjustments of about 5 billion euros after tax in the third quarter .
it added its core equity would be around 30 billion euros , resulting in a 9.5 billion euro excess core equity .
the group also said that it will sell the parts of abn that it bought last year .
fortis chairman maurice lippens , accused by shareholders of concealing the bank 's troubles for too long , resigned after the news of the nationalization broke .
fortis also named filip dierckx as chief executive on friday evening , hastily replacing caretaker herman verwilst .
the fortis nationalization came as financial groups around the world watch for any movement from us lawmakers who are still debating whether to sign off on a deal to create a $ 700 billion government fund to buy bad debt from ailing us banks in a bid to stem a credit crisis threatening the global economy . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

28 , the belgian , dutch and luxembourg governments agreed to inject 11.2 billion euros -lrb- $ 16.4 billion -rrb- into the banking and insurance company fortis after a weekend of high drama .
the presence of trichet , who as ecb head is responsible for safeguarding financial stability in the euro zone , was unprecedented in a commercial bank rescue and underlined the seriousness of concern for the integrity of the euro zone 's financial system .
in the first major bank crisis to hit the euro zone in 13 months of global financial turmoil that began in the united states , fortis looked to be in severe danger with some experts concerned that the tri-nation group could go under by monday if nothing was done to save it .
fortis saw its shares drop by a third last week on investor concerns about its liquidity and funding which stem from last year 's 70 billion euro purchase of dutch bank abn amro with partners royal bank of scotland and spain 's santander .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : fortis ' troubles can be traced to the purchase of abn shares dived more than 20 percent to 15-year lows on friday despite a statement that the group 's position was solid and a pledge to expand asset sales to as much as 10 billion euros .
the group 's market capitalization also slumped from 50 billion euros after the abn purchase to just 12 billion euros on friday .
fortis group too large not to be saved fortis , with 85,000 staff worldwide , is the biggest private sector employer in belgium and more than 1.5 million households , roughly half the country , bank with the group .
" we could have not intervened , but the question was whether fortis would have survived on monday , " dutch finance minister wouter bos told reporters .
the benelux governments chose a partial state buyout after two private bidders made paltry offers for the group last week .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the fortis nationalization dwarfs that on northen rock each government will take a 49 percent stake in fortis banks in their respective countries .
belgium will put in 4.7 billion euros , the netherlands 4 billion and luxembourg 2.5 billion , the latter in the form of a convertible loan .
the group 's nationalization dwarfs britain 's state takeover of fallen mortgage lender northern rock last year .
france 's bnp paribas allegedly pulled out of a deal last week after offering just 1.60 euros per share for fortis , compared to friday 's closing price of 5.20 , and demanding state guarantees against possible future losses , a source said .
the dutch ing group was alleged to have bid just 1.5 euros per share .
" there was no serious bidder for the intrinsic value of the whole group , " the source told reuters news agency .
bnp paribas and ing declined comment on reports that they had bid for all or part of fortis .
nationalization comes as all eyes turn to us bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the us federal reserve 's ben bernanke feels the pressure fortis said in a statement it expected total negative value adjustments of about 5 billion euros after tax in the third quarter .
it added its core equity would be around 30 billion euros , resulting in a 9.5 billion euro excess core equity .
the group also said that it will sell the parts of abn that it bought last year .
fortis chairman maurice lippens , accused by shareholders of concealing the bank 's troubles for too long , resigned after the news of the nationalization broke .
fortis also named filip dierckx as chief executive on friday evening , hastily replacing caretaker herman verwilst .
the fortis nationalization came as financial groups around the world watch for any movement from us lawmakers who are still debating whether to sign off on a deal to create a $ 700 billion government fund to buy bad debt from ailing us banks in a bid to stem a credit crisis threatening the global economy . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" ostalgia , " a pun combing " nostalgia and " ost " -lrb- east -rrb- , is on the rise and numerous businesses and individuals are cashing in on the trend .
today , you can have your picture taken with a soviet soldier look-alike at the former checkpoint charlie crossing in berlin or rent a room in a sparsely furnished apartment that is a replica of a 1980s east german accommodation .
you can also take a tour of east berlin in a plastic-body trabi car that east germans had to wait years to buy .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the ' ostel ' hostel in berlin gives visitors a look into the communist gdr " ask the people who run those businesses if they would still want to live in an old , small , box-like flat in a concrete high-rise , " said dagmar schipanski , president of the parliament in the eastern german state of thuringia .
" most of them now own expensive apartments and drive nice cars . "
missing the historical context schipanski makes no attempt to hide her anger when talking about what she regards as " a deliberate exclusion of the real historical context . "
the 65-year-old former scientist , who grew up in the german democratic republic , the eastern part of divided germany , heads a commission that drafted a position paper on eastern germany 's future .
the panel , which also reviewed successes and failures in the eastern region since the wall came down in 1989 , was set up by chancellor angela merkel 's christian democratic party -lrb- cdu -rrb- .
the document , which has been criticized by opposition parties for failing to examine the cdu 's own role in east germany , also suggests strategies for future development .
call for better education a central demand is directed at the education system .
" we need to come to terms with the history of divided germany in our schools , by reforming curricula and teaching practices alike , " said schipanski .
her call is echoed by another recent study assessing the level of knowledge about east and west german history . " pupils know next to nothing , " said klaus schroeder , the berlin professor who headed the survey .
" fewer than one in two knows who built the berlin wall . "
bildunterschrift : not everyone who lived in east germany knows that the berlin wall was built in 1961 on orders from state council chairman walter ulbrich the little they did know they learned from their families or from television shows , which painted a distorted picture , schroeder added .
establishments like die firma -lrb- the firm -rrb- , a pub themed after east germany 's dreaded stasi secret service , which a former stasi informer opened in berlin a few months ago , was " utterly tasteless , " schroeder said .
many students confirmed the findings of the study based on their own experience , jan redmann , a member of the cdu 's youth organization , the ju , told dpa news agency .
" pupils tell us that east germany is often omitted in lessons , " he says .
" that 's also because dealing with the german past for many teachers also means dealing with their own biographies . "
the other side of the story together with other ju members , redmann started an anti-ostalgie campaign three years ago when east german-themed shows first hit german tv screens .
" on these program , celebrities go on about how much fun it was to drive a trabi and to mix their own fuel , " complains campaigner peter tauber .
" but they never mentioned that you had to wait years to get a car in the first place . "
some 700 people have so far signed up to the online campaign , whose web site is decorated with a banana , a symbol of the shortage of imported goods in the soviet-guided east germany .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the new stasi bar in berlin has been frowned upon " citizens were never fully informed about the actual state of the economy , " cdu politician schipanski told dpa .
the upheavals they faced in 1989 were very serious and often meant unemployment or starting a new career from scratch , she said .
" we have to honor their achievements in adapting to a completely different environment . "
she agreed with social scientist schroeder that unemployment and economic deprivation should not be an excuse to paint a glossy picture of life in east germany .
separating state and citizens " we have to make clear that criticizing the system does not mean criticizing the people , " schroeder said .
" but we must improve education about the second german dictatorship , because that 's what it was . "
daniel helbig , who runs the east german-style ostel guesthouse in berlin , did not want to be drawn into the political aspect of the debate .
he pointed out another ostalgie attraction which opened last week in cooperation with his hostel - a 2,200-square-meter -lrb- 23,700-square-foot -rrb- exhibition of artworks commissioned by east germany . dpa news agency -lrb- kjb -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the far-right , meanwhile , established itself as the third political force in austria , with 18.0 percent for the freedom party -lrb- fpoe -rrb- and a surprising 11.0 percent for joerg haider 's smaller alliance for austria 's future -lrb- bzoe -rrb- .
the greens had to settle for fifth place with 9.8 percent .
a total 15 parties were listed on the ballot in sunday 's election , the highest number in austrian electoral history , but most of them did not pass the 4.0-percent threshold to get into parliament .
participation stood at 71.4 percent , out of 6.3 million eligible voters , but some 586,700 absentees still had to be taken into account .
these were to be tallied in the next week with full final results expected on oct .

bildunterschrift : heinz strache , wilhelm molterer , joerg haider , alex van der bellen , werner faymann in the last general elections in october 2006 , voter participation was 78.49 percent , including absentee ballots .
far-right gains due to disillusionment the far-right gains were the most worrying results of the election but experts said the parties got a massive boost because voters were frustrated with the centrist coalition parties and not because of the rightists ' anti-immigration rhetoric .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : strache has aligned himself with people like le pen the results for heinz christian strache 's fpoe were up seven percent from the last elections in 2006 , while haider 's bzoe more than doubled its votes to 11 percent , from 4 percent in 2006 .
" the main reason was that the government 's dismal performance , " political scientist peter gerlich of the vienna university said , explaining voters ' shift to the far right .
the coalition between social democrats and their junior partner , the conservative people 's party -lrb- oevp -rrb- , split in july after 18 months of bickering and political stalemate .
experts also said the two parties were successful at portraying themselves as caring for lower-income voters worried about rising prices .
although the social democrats pushed a package of social spending bills through parliament mere days before the elections , the freedom party had more credibility with social issues , fritz plasser of innsbruck university said .
" supporting the weak helped them , " plasser said .
strache 's anti-european union rhetoric also resonated in a country where 47 percent of the population thinks austria has not benefited from being an eu member .
but despite these factors , there is no denying that strache 's freedom party , and , to a lesser extent , haider 's alliance , banked on voters ' anti-immigrant and anti-islamic sentiments .
controversial electioneering at strache 's final election rally in one of vienna 's working class districts last friday , the crowd cheered loudest not when he spoke about social issues , but when he complained that foreigners were now allowed to live in social housing projects .

although it is clear that both right-wing parties will play a bigger role in austrian politics , both social democrats and conservatives have so far ruled out forming coalitions with strache or haider .
" the spoe will be somewhat tempted , " to cooperate with the freedom party , gerlich said .

bildunterschrift : heinz strache , wilhelm molterer , joerg haider , alex van der bellen , werner faymann in the last general elections in october 2006 , voter participation was 78.49 percent , including absentee ballots .
far-right gains due to disillusionment the far-right gains were the most worrying results of the election but experts said the parties got a massive boost because voters were frustrated with the centrist coalition parties and not because of the rightists ' anti-immigration rhetoric .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : strache has aligned himself with people like le pen the results for heinz christian strache 's fpoe were up seven percent from the last elections in 2006 , while haider 's bzoe more than doubled its votes to 11 percent , from 4 percent in 2006 .
" the main reason was that the government 's dismal performance , " political scientist peter gerlich of the vienna university said , explaining voters ' shift to the far right .
the coalition between social democrats and their junior partner , the conservative people 's party -lrb- oevp -rrb- , split in july after 18 months of bickering and political stalemate .
experts also said the two parties were successful at portraying themselves as caring for lower-income voters worried about rising prices .
although the social democrats pushed a package of social spending bills through parliament mere days before the elections , the freedom party had more credibility with social issues , fritz plasser of innsbruck university said .
" supporting the weak helped them , " plasser said .
strache 's anti-european union rhetoric also resonated in a country where 47 percent of the population thinks austria has not benefited from being an eu member .
but despite these factors , there is no denying that strache 's freedom party , and , to a lesser extent , haider 's alliance , banked on voters ' anti-immigrant and anti-islamic sentiments .
controversial electioneering at strache 's final election rally in one of vienna 's working class districts last friday , the crowd cheered loudest not when he spoke about social issues , but when he complained that foreigners were now allowed to live in social housing projects .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : haider made yet another comeback in sunday 's election haider suggested during the election race that all asylum seekers should be made to wear electronic tags to monitor their movements .
although it is clear that both right-wing parties will play a bigger role in austrian politics , both social democrats and conservatives have so far ruled out forming coalitions with strache or haider .
" the spoe will be somewhat tempted , " to cooperate with the freedom party , gerlich said .
but his colleague plasser said that such a coalition would create a deep split among social democrats .
there is also a rumor about a -lrb- social democratic -rrb- minority government with parliamentary support from the freedom party , gerlich said . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

but rarely do enough fans show up to fill the enormous stadium . as a result hertha 's management is currently pondering saying " auf wiedersehen " to the stadium - where legendary black us sprinter jesse owens made athletics history 72 years ago by bagging four olympic gold medals - and building a new " soccer-only " stadium elsewhere in the city .
for hertha , the drawback with the olympic stadium is its size .
the athletics track bordering the pitch also means fans are some distance from the soccer action , unlike crowds at frankfurt , hamburg , borussia dortmund and bayern munich , which itself moved from the munich olympic stadium to the allianz arena for similar reasons , where stands rise just a few meters from the touch-line .
berlin 's olympic stadium has a 76,000 maximum crowd capacity , but about the only time hertha draws a crowd that size is when it plays bayern at home in the league .
at most other games , the stadium remains only about 50 percent occupied .
this has led to discussions at the club , with officials - club manager dieter hoeness among them - openly favoring a " soccer only " club ground .
hertha pay around 4.5 million euros in annual rent for the olympic stadium , and are currently contracted to stay at the olympic stadium until the year 2017 but hoeness says the club is not seeking to change that arrangement .
but he notes that if hertha pursues the idea of building a new club ground a minimum period of seven or eight years planning would be needed before it was realized .
huge home ground swallows smalls crowds bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : no every day can be world cup final day in berlin hertha 's problems were highlighted a fortnight ago when the club entertained dublin side st patrick 's athletic in an uefa cup match at home , and only 13,000 spectators showed up .
similarly at the club 's first two home league matches this season the home ground was barely 50 per cent occupied while last season average attendances of 44,483 were achieved .
berlin city government officials have been surprised by the talk of hertha possibly wanting to exit the olympic stadium .
for erhart koerting , berlin 's social democrat interior and sport minister , the olympic stadium is a world-famous sports facility , as evidenced by its hosting of the 2009 world athletics championships .
it underwent a major 282-million-euro revamp in the run-up to the 2006 world cup , when it was endowed with a spectacular oval-shaped roof , towering 68 meters above its enlarged seating area and bevy of vip loges .
for that reason alone , hertha could not expect financial support from the public purse if it was to build a new stadium , said koerting .
opinion divided over relocation bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : few sides can boast such a spectacular home stadium even hertha league players are divided by talk of a new stadium .
steve von bergen , a club defender , says : " it would be a shame if hertha no longer played at the olympic stadium .
the stadium is a monument .
every day people come to look at it , even when there is n't football activity there . "
club goalkeeper jaroslav drobny takes another view .
" naturally the olympic stadium has a long tradition , but times have changed .
when hertha played st patrick 's recently the stadium was empty , one could hear the fans , but not see them , " he claimed .
" the club deserves to play in a stadium which is 100 per-cent tailored for football , " he reckons .

but rarely do enough fans show up to fill the enormous stadium . as a result hertha 's management is currently pondering saying " auf wiedersehen " to the stadium - where legendary black us sprinter jesse owens made athletics history 72 years ago by bagging four olympic gold medals - and building a new " soccer-only " stadium elsewhere in the city .
for hertha , the drawback with the olympic stadium is its size .
the athletics track bordering the pitch also means fans are some distance from the soccer action , unlike crowds at frankfurt , hamburg , borussia dortmund and bayern munich , which itself moved from the munich olympic stadium to the allianz arena for similar reasons , where stands rise just a few meters from the touch-line .
berlin 's olympic stadium has a 76,000 maximum crowd capacity , but about the only time hertha draws a crowd that size is when it plays bayern at home in the league .
at most other games , the stadium remains only about 50 percent occupied .
this has led to discussions at the club , with officials - club manager dieter hoeness among them - openly favoring a " soccer only " club ground .
hertha pay around 4.5 million euros in annual rent for the olympic stadium , and are currently contracted to stay at the olympic stadium until the year 2017 but hoeness says the club is not seeking to change that arrangement .
but he notes that if hertha pursues the idea of building a new club ground a minimum period of seven or eight years planning would be needed before it was realized .
huge home ground swallows smalls crowds bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : no every day can be world cup final day in berlin hertha 's problems were highlighted a fortnight ago when the club entertained dublin side st patrick 's athletic in an uefa cup match at home , and only 13,000 spectators showed up .
similarly at the club 's first two home league matches this season the home ground was barely 50 per cent occupied while last season average attendances of 44,483 were achieved .
berlin city government officials have been surprised by the talk of hertha possibly wanting to exit the olympic stadium .
for erhart koerting , berlin 's social democrat interior and sport minister , the olympic stadium is a world-famous sports facility , as evidenced by its hosting of the 2009 world athletics championships .
it underwent a major 282-million-euro revamp in the run-up to the 2006 world cup , when it was endowed with a spectacular oval-shaped roof , towering 68 meters above its enlarged seating area and bevy of vip loges .
for that reason alone , hertha could not expect financial support from the public purse if it was to build a new stadium , said koerting .
opinion divided over relocation bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : few sides can boast such a spectacular home stadium even hertha league players are divided by talk of a new stadium .
steve von bergen , a club defender , says : " it would be a shame if hertha no longer played at the olympic stadium .
the stadium is a monument .
every day people come to look at it , even when there is n't football activity there . "
club goalkeeper jaroslav drobny takes another view .
" naturally the olympic stadium has a long tradition , but times have changed .
when hertha played st patrick 's recently the stadium was empty , one could hear the fans , but not see them , " he claimed .
" the club deserves to play in a stadium which is 100 per-cent tailored for football , " he reckons .
midfield player fabian lustenberger , on the other hand , says the " football atmosphere " at the stadium is not as bad as it 's often painted .
" in dortmund or hamburg the soccer feeling is great but at bayern munich the atmosphere 's hardly sensational at times , " he points out . dpa news agency -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

but rarely do enough fans show up to fill the enormous stadium . as a result hertha 's management is currently pondering saying " auf wiedersehen " to the stadium - where legendary black us sprinter jesse owens made athletics history 72 years ago by bagging four olympic gold medals - and building a new " soccer-only " stadium elsewhere in the city .
for hertha , the drawback with the olympic stadium is its size .
the athletics track bordering the pitch also means fans are some distance from the soccer action , unlike crowds at frankfurt , hamburg , borussia dortmund and bayern munich , which itself moved from the munich olympic stadium to the allianz arena for similar reasons , where stands rise just a few meters from the touch-line .
berlin 's olympic stadium has a 76,000 maximum crowd capacity , but about the only time hertha draws a crowd that size is when it plays bayern at home in the league .
at most other games , the stadium remains only about 50 percent occupied .
this has led to discussions at the club , with officials - club manager dieter hoeness among them - openly favoring a " soccer only " club ground .
hertha pay around 4.5 million euros in annual rent for the olympic stadium , and are currently contracted to stay at the olympic stadium until the year 2017 but hoeness says the club is not seeking to change that arrangement .
but he notes that if hertha pursues the idea of building a new club ground a minimum period of seven or eight years planning would be needed before it was realized .
huge home ground swallows smalls crowds bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : no every day can be world cup final day in berlin hertha 's problems were highlighted a fortnight ago when the club entertained dublin side st patrick 's athletic in an uefa cup match at home , and only 13,000 spectators showed up .
similarly at the club 's first two home league matches this season the home ground was barely 50 per cent occupied while last season average attendances of 44,483 were achieved .
berlin city government officials have been surprised by the talk of hertha possibly wanting to exit the olympic stadium .
for erhart koerting , berlin 's social democrat interior and sport minister , the olympic stadium is a world-famous sports facility , as evidenced by its hosting of the 2009 world athletics championships .
it underwent a major 282-million-euro revamp in the run-up to the 2006 world cup , when it was endowed with a spectacular oval-shaped roof , towering 68 meters above its enlarged seating area and bevy of vip loges .
for that reason alone , hertha could not expect financial support from the public purse if it was to build a new stadium , said koerting .
opinion divided over relocation bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : few sides can boast such a spectacular home stadium even hertha league players are divided by talk of a new stadium .
steve von bergen , a club defender , says : " it would be a shame if hertha no longer played at the olympic stadium .
the stadium is a monument .
every day people come to look at it , even when there is n't football activity there . "
club goalkeeper jaroslav drobny takes another view .
" naturally the olympic stadium has a long tradition , but times have changed .
when hertha played st patrick 's recently the stadium was empty , one could hear the fans , but not see them , " he claimed .
" the club deserves to play in a stadium which is 100 per-cent tailored for football , " he reckons .
midfield player fabian lustenberger , on the other hand , says the " football atmosphere " at the stadium is not as bad as it 's often painted .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de opinion -pipe- 29.09.2008 opinion : the bavarian earthquake sends tremors through berlin großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the shockwaves of the christian social union 's -lrb- csu -rrb- worst showing in half a century of bavarian state elections are being felt in berlin , dw 's peter stützle says .
the results could have an effect on national elections . the result of the state elections in bavaria is like an earthquake shaking german politics .
the csu 's absolute majority in the state was considered to be a law of nature but now that law has been smashed and the csu must find itself a coalition partner - it 's something only old bavarians know from the 1950s .
the shockwaves from this earthquake reach all the way to berlin .
angela merkel wants to continue as chancellor after next year 's parliamentary election but not as the head of the deeply unpopular grand coalition with the social democrats .
she would much prefer the fdp free market liberals . for that to happen , it 's not just the fdp that needs to ratchet up votes .
the conservatives from merkel 's christian democratic union -lrb- cdu -rrb- and its sister party , the christian social -lrb- csu -rrb- need to hugely boost their support .
right now , however the csu has done just the opposite , by suffering massive losses in bavaria .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : peter stützle admittedly , the earthquake has n't exactly put the brand new chancellor candidate of germany 's social democrats , frank-walter steinmeier , in a better position .
despite the weakness of the ruling csu , the social democrats in bavaria could n't capitalize on the conservatives ' disarray and recorded their worst result in five years .
steinmeier 's dream partners , the greens and the fdp may both have increased their gains but a three-way coalition of the spd , greens and the fdp can only work if the spd becomes stronger - if anything , the party has just gotten a little weaker .
one of the most striking results of the bavarian election has been the continuing erosion of germany 's two biggest traditional parties , the spd and the cdu .
it 's a development that has become apparent in all state elections in recent years and in the general elections in 2005 .
what 's equally striking is that the ensuing political camps remain largely unchanged . disillusioned spd supporters usually turn toward the left party and partly toward the greens while fed-up conservative voters flock to the fdp and , in the case of bavaria , to the free voters .
the free voters , a grassroots organization which largely includes former csu members , attaches great importance to the principle that they are n't beholden to any party line .
the group however will not contest the general elections next year which means that a lot of their voters could return to the csu .
the grand coalition in berlin now needs to roll up their sleeves to finish off what they started . a few important decisions loom in the next weeks such as tax reforms .
it 's not clear how the csu will react in the grand coalition in berlin , whether it will be stubborn or more open to compromise . if the tensions between the ruling parties continue and increase , then this could exacerbate the frustration in the populace which in turn could accelerate the erosion of the two main parties .
in the end , both the conservative bloc as well as the spd may have no other option other than to forge a new large coalition . peter stützle -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the results could have an effect on national elections . the result of the state elections in bavaria is like an earthquake shaking german politics .
the csu 's absolute majority in the state was considered to be a law of nature but now that law has been smashed and the csu must find itself a coalition partner - it 's something only old bavarians know from the 1950s .
the shockwaves from this earthquake reach all the way to berlin .
angela merkel wants to continue as chancellor after next year 's parliamentary election but not as the head of the deeply unpopular grand coalition with the social democrats .
she would much prefer the fdp free market liberals . for that to happen , it 's not just the fdp that needs to ratchet up votes .
the conservatives from merkel 's christian democratic union -lrb- cdu -rrb- and its sister party , the christian social -lrb- csu -rrb- need to hugely boost their support .
right now , however the csu has done just the opposite , by suffering massive losses in bavaria .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : peter stützle admittedly , the earthquake has n't exactly put the brand new chancellor candidate of germany 's social democrats , frank-walter steinmeier , in a better position .
despite the weakness of the ruling csu , the social democrats in bavaria could n't capitalize on the conservatives ' disarray and recorded their worst result in five years .
steinmeier 's dream partners , the greens and the fdp may both have increased their gains but a three-way coalition of the spd , greens and the fdp can only work if the spd becomes stronger - if anything , the party has just gotten a little weaker .
one of the most striking results of the bavarian election has been the continuing erosion of germany 's two biggest traditional parties , the spd and the cdu .
it 's a development that has become apparent in all state elections in recent years and in the general elections in 2005 .
what 's equally striking is that the ensuing political camps remain largely unchanged . disillusioned spd supporters usually turn toward the left party and partly toward the greens while fed-up conservative voters flock to the fdp and , in the case of bavaria , to the free voters .
the free voters , a grassroots organization which largely includes former csu members , attaches great importance to the principle that they are n't beholden to any party line .
the group however will not contest the general elections next year which means that a lot of their voters could return to the csu .
the grand coalition in berlin now needs to roll up their sleeves to finish off what they started . a few important decisions loom in the next weeks such as tax reforms .
it 's not clear how the csu will react in the grand coalition in berlin , whether it will be stubborn or more open to compromise . if the tensions between the ruling parties continue and increase , then this could exacerbate the frustration in the populace which in turn could accelerate the erosion of the two main parties .

in the end , both the conservative bloc as well as the spd may have no other option other than to forge a new large coalition . peter stützle -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de east germany -pipe- 29.09.2008 panel calls for end to nostalgia about east germany großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some forget to mention they had to wait years to buy a trabi nearly 20 years after the fall of the berlin wall , a growing number of people are romanticising about what daily life was like in the former communist east germany . " ostalgia , " a pun combing " nostalgia and " ost " -lrb- east -rrb- , is on the rise and numerous businesses and individuals are cashing in on the trend .
today , you can have your picture taken with a soviet soldier look-alike at the former checkpoint charlie crossing in berlin or rent a room in a sparsely furnished apartment that is a replica of a 1980s east german accommodation .
you can also take a tour of east berlin in a plastic-body trabi car that east germans had to wait years to buy .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the ' ostel ' hostel in berlin gives visitors a look into the communist gdr " ask the people who run those businesses if they would still want to live in an old , small , box-like flat in a concrete high-rise , " said dagmar schipanski , president of the parliament in the eastern german state of thuringia .
" most of them now own expensive apartments and drive nice cars . "
missing the historical context schipanski makes no attempt to hide her anger when talking about what she regards as " a deliberate exclusion of the real historical context . "
the 65-year-old former scientist , who grew up in the german democratic republic , the eastern part of divided germany , heads a commission that drafted a position paper on eastern germany 's future .
the panel , which also reviewed successes and failures in the eastern region since the wall came down in 1989 , was set up by chancellor angela merkel 's christian democratic party -lrb- cdu -rrb- .
the document , which has been criticized by opposition parties for failing to examine the cdu 's own role in east germany , also suggests strategies for future development .
call for better education a central demand is directed at the education system .
" we need to come to terms with the history of divided germany in our schools , by reforming curricula and teaching practices alike , " said schipanski .
her call is echoed by another recent study assessing the level of knowledge about east and west german history . " pupils know next to nothing , " said klaus schroeder , the berlin professor who headed the survey .
" fewer than one in two knows who built the berlin wall . "
bildunterschrift : not everyone who lived in east germany knows that the berlin wall was built in 1961 on orders from state council chairman walter ulbrich the little they did know they learned from their families or from television shows , which painted a distorted picture , schroeder added .
establishments like die firma -lrb- the firm -rrb- , a pub themed after east germany 's dreaded stasi secret service , which a former stasi informer opened in berlin a few months ago , was " utterly tasteless , " schroeder said .
many students confirmed the findings of the study based on their own experience , jan redmann , a member of the cdu 's youth organization , the ju , told dpa news agency .
" pupils tell us that east germany is often omitted in lessons , " he says .
" that 's also because dealing with the german past for many teachers also means dealing with their own biographies . "
the other side of the story together with other ju members , redmann started an anti-ostalgie campaign three years ago when east german-themed shows first hit german tv screens .
" on these program , celebrities go on about how much fun it was to drive a trabi and to mix their own fuel , " complains campaigner peter tauber .
" but they never mentioned that you had to wait years to get a car in the first place . "
some 700 people have so far signed up to the online campaign , whose web site is decorated with a banana , a symbol of the shortage of imported goods in the soviet-guided east germany .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the new stasi bar in berlin has been frowned upon " citizens were never fully informed about the actual state of the economy , " cdu politician schipanski told dpa .
the upheavals they faced in 1989 were very serious and often meant unemployment or starting a new career from scratch , she said .
" we have to honor their achievements in adapting to a completely different environment . "
she agreed with social scientist schroeder that unemployment and economic deprivation should not be an excuse to paint a glossy picture of life in east germany .
separating state and citizens " we have to make clear that criticizing the system does not mean criticizing the people , " schroeder said .
" but we must improve education about the second german dictatorship , because that 's what it was . "
daniel helbig , who runs the east german-style ostel guesthouse in berlin , did not want to be drawn into the political aspect of the debate .
he pointed out another ostalgie attraction which opened last week in cooperation with his hostel - a 2,200-square-meter -lrb- 23,700-square-foot -rrb- exhibition of artworks commissioned by east germany . dpa news agency -lrb- kjb -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

missing the historical context schipanski makes no attempt to hide her anger when talking about what she regards as " a deliberate exclusion of the real historical context . "
the 65-year-old former scientist , who grew up in the german democratic republic , the eastern part of divided germany , heads a commission that drafted a position paper on eastern germany 's future .
the panel , which also reviewed successes and failures in the eastern region since the wall came down in 1989 , was set up by chancellor angela merkel 's christian democratic party -lrb- cdu -rrb- .

" pupils tell us that east germany is often omitted in lessons , " he says .
" that 's also because dealing with the german past for many teachers also means dealing with their own biographies . "

" on these program , celebrities go on about how much fun it was to drive a trabi and to mix their own fuel , " complains campaigner peter tauber .

28 . the social democrats -lrb- spoe -rrb- took 29.7 percent while the conservatives -lrb- oevp -rrb- secured 25.6 percent , according to official ministry results , which did not include absentee ballots .
the far-right , meanwhile , established itself as the third political force in austria , with 18.0 percent for the freedom party -lrb- fpoe -rrb- and a surprising 11.0 percent for joerg haider 's smaller alliance for austria 's future -lrb- bzoe -rrb- .
the greens had to settle for fifth place with 9.8 percent .
a total 15 parties were listed on the ballot in sunday 's election , the highest number in austrian electoral history , but most of them did not pass the 4.0-percent threshold to get into parliament .
participation stood at 71.4 percent , out of 6.3 million eligible voters , but some 586,700 absentees still had to be taken into account .
these were to be tallied in the next week with full final results expected on oct .
6 .
bildunterschrift : heinz strache , wilhelm molterer , joerg haider , alex van der bellen , werner faymann in the last general elections in october 2006 , voter participation was 78.49 percent , including absentee ballots .
far-right gains due to disillusionment the far-right gains were the most worrying results of the election but experts said the parties got a massive boost because voters were frustrated with the centrist coalition parties and not because of the rightists ' anti-immigration rhetoric .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : strache has aligned himself with people like le pen the results for heinz christian strache 's fpoe were up seven percent from the last elections in 2006 , while haider 's bzoe more than doubled its votes to 11 percent , from 4 percent in 2006 .
" the main reason was that the government 's dismal performance , " political scientist peter gerlich of the vienna university said , explaining voters ' shift to the far right .
the coalition between social democrats and their junior partner , the conservative people 's party -lrb- oevp -rrb- , split in july after 18 months of bickering and political stalemate .
experts also said the two parties were successful at portraying themselves as caring for lower-income voters worried about rising prices .
although the social democrats pushed a package of social spending bills through parliament mere days before the elections , the freedom party had more credibility with social issues , fritz plasser of innsbruck university said .
" supporting the weak helped them , " plasser said .
strache 's anti-european union rhetoric also resonated in a country where 47 percent of the population thinks austria has not benefited from being an eu member .
but despite these factors , there is no denying that strache 's freedom party , and , to a lesser extent , haider 's alliance , banked on voters ' anti-immigrant and anti-islamic sentiments .
controversial electioneering at strache 's final election rally in one of vienna 's working class districts last friday , the crowd cheered loudest not when he spoke about social issues , but when he complained that foreigners were now allowed to live in social housing projects .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : haider made yet another comeback in sunday 's election haider suggested during the election race that all asylum seekers should be made to wear electronic tags to monitor their movements .
although it is clear that both right-wing parties will play a bigger role in austrian politics , both social democrats and conservatives have so far ruled out forming coalitions with strache or haider .
" the spoe will be somewhat tempted , " to cooperate with the freedom party , gerlich said .
but his colleague plasser said that such a coalition would create a deep split among social democrats .
there is also a rumor about a -lrb- social democratic -rrb- minority government with parliamentary support from the freedom party , gerlich said . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

some mediterranean regions already receive 20 percent less rain than a century ago , the report said , increasing the risk of forest fires and the desertification of the region .
the report labelled glacier retreat in europe a double-edged sword , projecting an overall increase in river floods across europe , but also an increase in river droughts in the south .
" uncertainty in the rate of melting of greenland 's outlet glaciers makes projections of future sea level rise uncertain , " the report said , adding that according to satellite observations the global sea level had risen by as much as 3.1 mm a year in the past 15 years .

" global average temperature has increased almost 0.8 of a degree above pre-industrial levels , with even higher temperature increases in europe and northern latitudes , " the report said .
europe has warmed by 1 degree .
the report 's authors said mitigation and adaptation measures against climate change needed to be more widespread in europe and that today 's efforts focus only on flood management and defense .
they also recommended the creation of a european clearing house on climate change impacts , vulnerability and adaptation to make climate change data widely available . dw staff -lrb- dm -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the csu polled 43.4 percent of the vote on sunday , sept .
28 , in its worst showing in half a century .
the center-left social democrats -lrb- spd -rrb- , which govern in a grand coalition with merkel 's party in berlin , polled 18.6 percent , a decline of 1 percentage point from the last state election in 2003 . csu secretary general christine haderthauer said the disastrous result was a black day for the party , which had ruled unchallenged for more than 40 years .
in the last state elections in 2003 , the csu polled 60.7 percent of the vote in the strongly catholic state , where some of germany 's leading companies have their headquarters , including siemens and bmw .
the party 's stated intent had been to retain its absolute majority in the 180-seat parliament in munich .
" we have clearly failed to achieve our goal , " haderthauer said .
beckstein refuses to shoulder the blame bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : beckstein and huber will face an inquest into the defeat state prime minister guenther beckstein , who was elected last year after longtime leader edmund stoiber was toppled in a party revolt , ruled out stepping down to take responsibility for the poor showing .
" the people have shown that they want a csu-led government , but that they do not want the csu to govern bavaria alone , " he said , adding that the party would immediately start to look for a coalition partner .
the most likely contenders are the liberal free democrats -lrb- fdp -rrb- , who polled 8 percent of the vote to enter parliament after an absence of 14 years .
the liberals are eyeing a coalition with the cdu at the national level next year , but shifting alliances in the party landscape could make a wider alliance possible .
another possibility is the free voters , a conservative party that will make its parliamentary debut after winning 10.2 percent on a platform seeking greater local power .
the environmentalist greens won 9.4 percent , but the pro-labor left party at 4.3 percent failed to clear the 5 percent hurdle needed to get into parliament . the csu 's good showing in bavaria in the 2004 general election helped elevate merkel to power , but its popularity has been steadily eroding under beckstein and party chairman erwin huber . losses by the state-owned bank bayernlb , the scrapping of a prestigious super-fast train link to the munich airport and a controversial smoking ban combined to fuel voter discontent .
analysts said the party 's poor performance could increase pressure on the csu leadership , which had been criticized for running a tepid campaign and failing to galvanize voters . the party ran a campaign highlighting the csu 's past successes while pushing for greater tax breaks for commuters and better conditions for working mothers .
state losses could have national ramifications the dramatic losses suffered by the csu in bavaria have ramifications well beyond the borders of germany 's largest state .
the shockwaves reached as far as berlin , where merkel rules in an uneasy grand coalition with the left-of-center social democrats -lrb- spd -rrb- . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel will want answers from the csu leadership analysts said that the outcome could increase tension between the coalition partners and hurt merkel 's chances of retaining power in federal elections scheduled for september 2009 .
foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier , who has been picked by the spd to challenge merkel for the chancellorship , said the vote had far-reaching implications .
" we are not talking about an election result , " he said , " but about an earthquake that has been unleashed by this election in bavaria . "
but he did n't mention that his party 's own performance of just over 18 percent was also its worst-ever showing in the prosperous state of laptops and lederhosen .
analysts said that voters punished the csu for clinging to traditional social values and catholic church doctrine in a europe that has become increasingly secular .
it did not help that beckstein and party chairman erwin huber lacked the charisma of stoiber and failed to galvanize voters to support a fresh vision .
recent state elections have seen coalitions between the cdu and greens in hamburg , and the spd eyeing an alliance with the greens and the left in hesse , where there is a minority cdu caretaker government .
the defeated spd candidate in bavaria , franz maget , even suggested a four-party coalition to unseat the csu , arguing that the ruling party had morally lost the right to govern .
while the greens said they would support such a move , the fdp said it was not interested in " a gaudy coalition of anarchists . " dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

egyptian authorities said the hostages were freed after a mission near the sudan-chad border and that half the kidnappers were killed .
the kidnappers had demanded a six-million-euro ransom for the hostages - to be paid by germany - but authorities insisted no ransom changed hands .
the identity of the kidnappers has still not been confirmed , but reports speculate the bandits may have been connected with a darfur rebel group , a faction of the sudanese liberation army .
however , none of the region 's rebel groups have claimed responsibility for the kidnapping .
steinmeier uncertain over release details german foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier thanked the authorities that contributed toward securing a " happy ending to the hijacking . "
" i hope -lrb- the freed hostages -rrb- will return to germany as soon as possible , " he said , refusing to elaborate on the circumstances surrounding their release .

"
the minister said the release was achieved thanks to " activities that can not be revealed in collaboration with the egyptian authorities , " whom he thanked , " in addition to the germans , who collaborated with -lrb- italy -rrb- and the egyptian , sudanese and libyan authorities for permitting the hostages ’ transit through their respective territories . "
he said italian special forces took part in securing the hostages ' release .
the group - consisting of five germans , five italians and a romanian - was kidnapped sept .
19 while on a desert safari in an isolated south-western region of egypt .
the group was believed to have been first moved across the border to sudan to the remote mountain region of jebel uweinat , a plateau that straddles the borders of egypt , libya and sudan , before the bandits took them into chad , according to sudanese officials .
sudden shootout in an unexpected turn of events sunday , gunfire reportedly broke out between sudanese troops and the hostage-takers after the latter were spotted near the sudan-egypt-libya border area .
the clash ended with the death of six of the bandits and the capture of two .
" the problem was solved .
they had agreed to the ransom .

" ostalgia , " a pun combing " nostalgia and " ost " -lrb- east -rrb- , is on the rise and numerous businesses and individuals are cashing in on the trend .
today , you can have your picture taken with a soviet soldier look-alike at the former checkpoint charlie crossing in berlin or rent a room in a sparsely furnished apartment that is a replica of a 1980s east german accommodation .
you can also take a tour of east berlin in a plastic-body trabi car that east germans had to wait years to buy .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the ' ostel ' hostel in berlin gives visitors a look into the communist gdr " ask the people who run those businesses if they would still want to live in an old , small , box-like flat in a concrete high-rise , " said dagmar schipanski , president of the parliament in the eastern german state of thuringia .
" most of them now own expensive apartments and drive nice cars . "
missing the historical context schipanski makes no attempt to hide her anger when talking about what she regards as " a deliberate exclusion of the real historical context . "
the 65-year-old former scientist , who grew up in the german democratic republic , the eastern part of divided germany , heads a commission that drafted a position paper on eastern germany 's future .
the panel , which also reviewed successes and failures in the eastern region since the wall came down in 1989 , was set up by chancellor angela merkel 's christian democratic party -lrb- cdu -rrb- .
the document , which has been criticized by opposition parties for failing to examine the cdu 's own role in east germany , also suggests strategies for future development .
call for better education a central demand is directed at the education system .
" we need to come to terms with the history of divided germany in our schools , by reforming curricula and teaching practices alike , " said schipanski .
her call is echoed by another recent study assessing the level of knowledge about east and west german history . " pupils know next to nothing , " said klaus schroeder , the berlin professor who headed the survey .
" fewer than one in two knows who built the berlin wall . "
bildunterschrift : not everyone who lived in east germany knows that the berlin wall was built in 1961 on orders from state council chairman walter ulbrich the little they did know they learned from their families or from television shows , which painted a distorted picture , schroeder added .
establishments like die firma -lrb- the firm -rrb- , a pub themed after east germany 's dreaded stasi secret service , which a former stasi informer opened in berlin a few months ago , was " utterly tasteless , " schroeder said .
many students confirmed the findings of the study based on their own experience , jan redmann , a member of the cdu 's youth organization , the ju , told dpa news agency .
" pupils tell us that east germany is often omitted in lessons , " he says .
" that 's also because dealing with the german past for many teachers also means dealing with their own biographies . "
the other side of the story together with other ju members , redmann started an anti-ostalgie campaign three years ago when east german-themed shows first hit german tv screens .
" on these program , celebrities go on about how much fun it was to drive a trabi and to mix their own fuel , " complains campaigner peter tauber .
" but they never mentioned that you had to wait years to get a car in the first place . "
some 700 people have so far signed up to the online campaign , whose web site is decorated with a banana , a symbol of the shortage of imported goods in the soviet-guided east germany .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the new stasi bar in berlin has been frowned upon " citizens were never fully informed about the actual state of the economy , " cdu politician schipanski told dpa .
the upheavals they faced in 1989 were very serious and often meant unemployment or starting a new career from scratch , she said .
" we have to honor their achievements in adapting to a completely different environment . "
she agreed with social scientist schroeder that unemployment and economic deprivation should not be an excuse to paint a glossy picture of life in east germany .
separating state and citizens " we have to make clear that criticizing the system does not mean criticizing the people , " schroeder said .
" but we must improve education about the second german dictatorship , because that 's what it was . "
daniel helbig , who runs the east german-style ostel guesthouse in berlin , did not want to be drawn into the political aspect of the debate .
he pointed out another ostalgie attraction which opened last week in cooperation with his hostel - a 2,200-square-meter -lrb- 23,700-square-foot -rrb- exhibition of artworks commissioned by east germany . dpa news agency -lrb- kjb -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de elections -pipe- 29.09.2008 far right enjoys gains as social democrats win austrian election großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : joerg haider -lrb- left -rrb- and his bzoe far-right party were among those who made electoral gains austria 's social democrats won sunday 's elections ahead of the conservative people 's party , but the far-right freedom party made big gains , interior minister maria fekter said sunday , sept .
28 . the social democrats -lrb- spoe -rrb- took 29.7 percent while the conservatives -lrb- oevp -rrb- secured 25.6 percent , according to official ministry results , which did not include absentee ballots .
the far-right , meanwhile , established itself as the third political force in austria , with 18.0 percent for the freedom party -lrb- fpoe -rrb- and a surprising 11.0 percent for joerg haider 's smaller alliance for austria 's future -lrb- bzoe -rrb- .
the greens had to settle for fifth place with 9.8 percent .
a total 15 parties were listed on the ballot in sunday 's election , the highest number in austrian electoral history , but most of them did not pass the 4.0-percent threshold to get into parliament .
participation stood at 71.4 percent , out of 6.3 million eligible voters , but some 586,700 absentees still had to be taken into account .
these were to be tallied in the next week with full final results expected on oct .
6 .
bildunterschrift : heinz strache , wilhelm molterer , joerg haider , alex van der bellen , werner faymann in the last general elections in october 2006 , voter participation was 78.49 percent , including absentee ballots .
far-right gains due to disillusionment the far-right gains were the most worrying results of the election but experts said the parties got a massive boost because voters were frustrated with the centrist coalition parties and not because of the rightists ' anti-immigration rhetoric .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : strache has aligned himself with people like le pen the results for heinz christian strache 's fpoe were up seven percent from the last elections in 2006 , while haider 's bzoe more than doubled its votes to 11 percent , from 4 percent in 2006 .
" the main reason was that the government 's dismal performance , " political scientist peter gerlich of the vienna university said , explaining voters ' shift to the far right .
the coalition between social democrats and their junior partner , the conservative people 's party -lrb- oevp -rrb- , split in july after 18 months of bickering and political stalemate .
experts also said the two parties were successful at portraying themselves as caring for lower-income voters worried about rising prices .
although the social democrats pushed a package of social spending bills through parliament mere days before the elections , the freedom party had more credibility with social issues , fritz plasser of innsbruck university said .
" supporting the weak helped them , " plasser said .
strache 's anti-european union rhetoric also resonated in a country where 47 percent of the population thinks austria has not benefited from being an eu member .
but despite these factors , there is no denying that strache 's freedom party , and , to a lesser extent , haider 's alliance , banked on voters ' anti-immigrant and anti-islamic sentiments .
controversial electioneering at strache 's final election rally in one of vienna 's working class districts last friday , the crowd cheered loudest not when he spoke about social issues , but when he complained that foreigners were now allowed to live in social housing projects .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : haider made yet another comeback in sunday 's election haider suggested during the election race that all asylum seekers should be made to wear electronic tags to monitor their movements .
although it is clear that both right-wing parties will play a bigger role in austrian politics , both social democrats and conservatives have so far ruled out forming coalitions with strache or haider .
" the spoe will be somewhat tempted , " to cooperate with the freedom party , gerlich said .
but his colleague plasser said that such a coalition would create a deep split among social democrats .
there is also a rumor about a -lrb- social democratic -rrb- minority government with parliamentary support from the freedom party , gerlich said . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de elections -pipe- 29.09.2008 bavarian conservatives lose state majority in damaging defeat großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : beckstein suffered defeat on what was described as a " black day " for conservatives bavaria 's christian social union -lrb- csu -rrb- lost its decades-old absolute majority as voters defected to smaller parties in a state election seen as a test of support ahead of national polls next year . computer projections showed a swing of more than 17 percentage points away from the sister party of chancellor angela merkel 's christian democrats -lrb- cdu -rrb- , forcing it to look for a coalition partner .
the csu polled 43.4 percent of the vote on sunday , sept .
28 , in its worst showing in half a century .
the center-left social democrats -lrb- spd -rrb- , which govern in a grand coalition with merkel 's party in berlin , polled 18.6 percent , a decline of 1 percentage point from the last state election in 2003 . csu secretary general christine haderthauer said the disastrous result was a black day for the party , which had ruled unchallenged for more than 40 years .
in the last state elections in 2003 , the csu polled 60.7 percent of the vote in the strongly catholic state , where some of germany 's leading companies have their headquarters , including siemens and bmw .
the party 's stated intent had been to retain its absolute majority in the 180-seat parliament in munich .
" we have clearly failed to achieve our goal , " haderthauer said .
beckstein refuses to shoulder the blame bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : beckstein and huber will face an inquest into the defeat state prime minister guenther beckstein , who was elected last year after longtime leader edmund stoiber was toppled in a party revolt , ruled out stepping down to take responsibility for the poor showing .
" the people have shown that they want a csu-led government , but that they do not want the csu to govern bavaria alone , " he said , adding that the party would immediately start to look for a coalition partner .
the most likely contenders are the liberal free democrats -lrb- fdp -rrb- , who polled 8 percent of the vote to enter parliament after an absence of 14 years .
the liberals are eyeing a coalition with the cdu at the national level next year , but shifting alliances in the party landscape could make a wider alliance possible .
another possibility is the free voters , a conservative party that will make its parliamentary debut after winning 10.2 percent on a platform seeking greater local power .
the environmentalist greens won 9.4 percent , but the pro-labor left party at 4.3 percent failed to clear the 5 percent hurdle needed to get into parliament . the csu 's good showing in bavaria in the 2004 general election helped elevate merkel to power , but its popularity has been steadily eroding under beckstein and party chairman erwin huber . losses by the state-owned bank bayernlb , the scrapping of a prestigious super-fast train link to the munich airport and a controversial smoking ban combined to fuel voter discontent .
analysts said the party 's poor performance could increase pressure on the csu leadership , which had been criticized for running a tepid campaign and failing to galvanize voters . the party ran a campaign highlighting the csu 's past successes while pushing for greater tax breaks for commuters and better conditions for working mothers .
state losses could have national ramifications the dramatic losses suffered by the csu in bavaria have ramifications well beyond the borders of germany 's largest state .
the shockwaves reached as far as berlin , where merkel rules in an uneasy grand coalition with the left-of-center social democrats -lrb- spd -rrb- . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel will want answers from the csu leadership analysts said that the outcome could increase tension between the coalition partners and hurt merkel 's chances of retaining power in federal elections scheduled for september 2009 .
foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier , who has been picked by the spd to challenge merkel for the chancellorship , said the vote had far-reaching implications .
" we are not talking about an election result , " he said , " but about an earthquake that has been unleashed by this election in bavaria . "
but he did n't mention that his party 's own performance of just over 18 percent was also its worst-ever showing in the prosperous state of laptops and lederhosen .
analysts said that voters punished the csu for clinging to traditional social values and catholic church doctrine in a europe that has become increasingly secular .
it did not help that beckstein and party chairman erwin huber lacked the charisma of stoiber and failed to galvanize voters to support a fresh vision .
recent state elections have seen coalitions between the cdu and greens in hamburg , and the spd eyeing an alliance with the greens and the left in hesse , where there is a minority cdu caretaker government .
the defeated spd candidate in bavaria , franz maget , even suggested a four-party coalition to unseat the csu , arguing that the ruling party had morally lost the right to govern .
while the greens said they would support such a move , the fdp said it was not interested in " a gaudy coalition of anarchists . " dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" ostalgia , " a pun combing " nostalgia and " ost " -lrb- east -rrb- , is on the rise and numerous businesses and individuals are cashing in on the trend .
today , you can have your picture taken with a soviet soldier look-alike at the former checkpoint charlie crossing in berlin or rent a room in a sparsely furnished apartment that is a replica of a 1980s east german accommodation .
you can also take a tour of east berlin in a plastic-body trabi car that east germans had to wait years to buy .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the ' ostel ' hostel in berlin gives visitors a look into the communist gdr " ask the people who run those businesses if they would still want to live in an old , small , box-like flat in a concrete high-rise , " said dagmar schipanski , president of the parliament in the eastern german state of thuringia .
" most of them now own expensive apartments and drive nice cars . "
missing the historical context schipanski makes no attempt to hide her anger when talking about what she regards as " a deliberate exclusion of the real historical context . "
the 65-year-old former scientist , who grew up in the german democratic republic , the eastern part of divided germany , heads a commission that drafted a position paper on eastern germany 's future .
the panel , which also reviewed successes and failures in the eastern region since the wall came down in 1989 , was set up by chancellor angela merkel 's christian democratic party -lrb- cdu -rrb- .
the document , which has been criticized by opposition parties for failing to examine the cdu 's own role in east germany , also suggests strategies for future development .
call for better education a central demand is directed at the education system .
" we need to come to terms with the history of divided germany in our schools , by reforming curricula and teaching practices alike , " said schipanski .
her call is echoed by another recent study assessing the level of knowledge about east and west german history . " pupils know next to nothing , " said klaus schroeder , the berlin professor who headed the survey .
" fewer than one in two knows who built the berlin wall . "
bildunterschrift : not everyone who lived in east germany knows that the berlin wall was built in 1961 on orders from state council chairman walter ulbrich the little they did know they learned from their families or from television shows , which painted a distorted picture , schroeder added .
establishments like die firma -lrb- the firm -rrb- , a pub themed after east germany 's dreaded stasi secret service , which a former stasi informer opened in berlin a few months ago , was " utterly tasteless , " schroeder said .
many students confirmed the findings of the study based on their own experience , jan redmann , a member of the cdu 's youth organization , the ju , told dpa news agency .
" pupils tell us that east germany is often omitted in lessons , " he says .
" that 's also because dealing with the german past for many teachers also means dealing with their own biographies . "
the other side of the story together with other ju members , redmann started an anti-ostalgie campaign three years ago when east german-themed shows first hit german tv screens .
" on these program , celebrities go on about how much fun it was to drive a trabi and to mix their own fuel , " complains campaigner peter tauber .
" but they never mentioned that you had to wait years to get a car in the first place . "
some 700 people have so far signed up to the online campaign , whose web site is decorated with a banana , a symbol of the shortage of imported goods in the soviet-guided east germany .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the new stasi bar in berlin has been frowned upon " citizens were never fully informed about the actual state of the economy , " cdu politician schipanski told dpa .
the upheavals they faced in 1989 were very serious and often meant unemployment or starting a new career from scratch , she said .
" we have to honor their achievements in adapting to a completely different environment . "
she agreed with social scientist schroeder that unemployment and economic deprivation should not be an excuse to paint a glossy picture of life in east germany .
separating state and citizens " we have to make clear that criticizing the system does not mean criticizing the people , " schroeder said .
" but we must improve education about the second german dictatorship , because that 's what it was . "
daniel helbig , who runs the east german-style ostel guesthouse in berlin , did not want to be drawn into the political aspect of the debate .
he pointed out another ostalgie attraction which opened last week in cooperation with his hostel - a 2,200-square-meter -lrb- 23,700-square-foot -rrb- exhibition of artworks commissioned by east germany . dpa news agency -lrb- kjb -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

some mediterranean regions already receive 20 percent less rain than a century ago , the report said , increasing the risk of forest fires and the desertification of the region .
the report labelled glacier retreat in europe a double-edged sword , projecting an overall increase in river floods across europe , but also an increase in river droughts in the south .
" uncertainty in the rate of melting of greenland 's outlet glaciers makes projections of future sea level rise uncertain , " the report said , adding that according to satellite observations the global sea level had risen by as much as 3.1 mm a year in the past 15 years .

" global average temperature has increased almost 0.8 of a degree above pre-industrial levels , with even higher temperature increases in europe and northern latitudes , " the report said .
europe has warmed by 1 degree .
the report 's authors said mitigation and adaptation measures against climate change needed to be more widespread in europe and that today 's efforts focus only on flood management and defense .

a bilingual television advert narrated by comedian rob brydon and actor daniel evans urges people to make small changes like turning off tv sets .
it aims to educate householders that small behaviour changes can help wales achieve its target of reducing emissions by 3 % every year from 2011 .
opposition ams said ministers should focus on boosting energy efficiency .
in a year , households in wales waste enough electricity by leaving appliances on standby to light 630,000 homes for 12 months .
the campaign aims to show that every action people take can reduce their carbon footprint and save money .
for example , if everyone in wales boiled only the water they needed to make a cup of tea instead of filling the kettle to the top , welsh households could save £ 6m on electricity bills in a year .
this campaign marks a major step in encouraging people in wales to change their habits jane davidson am environment minister jane davidson said it was the responsibility of everyone , from individuals to big businesses , to do their bit to help reduce the carbon footprint .
the changes people made did not have to be radical ones either , she said .
" this can be simply turning off your mobile phone charger when you do n't need it or not running the tap as you clean your teeth , " she said .
" climate change is a real challenge for us all .
this campaign marks a major step in encouraging people in wales to change their habits . "
people are being urged to log on to a new bilingual online carbon calculator , to work out their carbon footprint by gathering simple information about how they use gas , electricity and their travel choices .
the calculator will give people their own action plan showing the actions they can take which will make a difference to wales ' carbon footprint .
the assembly government has already established a climate change commission and published a renewable energy route map for wales .
the opposition have welcomed the campaign , but say it is time for the government to move its policy away from wind farms , and focus solely on boosting energy efficiency .

the authorities decided it was no longer a viable bank , after the recent collapse in its share price , and a developing run on its funds by savers .
the branch network and savings are being moved to the much larger abbey , owned by the spanish bank santander .
the rest , such the mortgages and head office , are now owned by the state .
shares in the firm have been suspended .
is my money safe ?
if you are a saver , yes .
your accounts , with the money in them , have now been transferred to the abbey , along with the branches , call centres and internet operations .
the government says it is " business as usual " so the branches will open as normal and the staff , who are now abbey employees , have been asked to turn up as normal too .
what about my b & b mortgage ?
if you have a mortgage or other loan with the b & b you still owe the money and you must continue to make your regular repayments .
this is not a once in a lifetime opportunity for you to escape your debts .
but you are now paying to a bank owned by the government , not a bank owned by shareholders .
is the b & b insolvent ?
actually no .
which you might think is a bit odd , considering all the fuss about the bank 's future , and now its nationalisation and dismemberment .
its assets still appear to be higher than its debts .
but the lack of confidence in the b & b 's ability to keep going was on the verge of becoming reality .
banks rely absolutely on public and investor confidence to operate , because if everyone asked for their money back all at once , no bank would have enough money to meet the demand as they lend a lot of it out and can not recall it instantly .
are any other banks in similar trouble ?
the entire banking system is still in trouble .
but it appears , so far , that there are no other uk banks quite in the tricky situation that the bradford & bingley , and the northern rock , found themselves .
even so , we do not know what may be lurking in the financial undergrowth .
two small building societies were bailed out recently , with no prior warning , and taken over by the nationwide .
the best advice is if you have more than £ 35,000 in savings , make sure it is spread around among different savings institutions -lrb- that are not all part of the same group -rrb- so all your money is covered by the financial services compensation scheme -lrb- fscs -rrb- .
so people who are account holders with the bradford & bingley , as well as the abbey and cahoot -lrb- its internet bank -rrb- , will be covered , but only for the first £ 35,000 of their savings .
quite a few banks have disappeared , have n't they ?
yes .
the past year has seen the northern rock , b & b , alliance & leicester and hbos lose their independence .
so what ?
well , if you add in the smaller mortgage lenders who specialised in lending via mortgage brokers only , more than 40 % of the mortgage lending capacity of the uk financial services industry that existed in 2007 has evaporated or been swallowed up by rivals .
that is a big contraction in competition and must mean less choice and more expensive deals .
will the bradford & bingley name disappear ?
the b & b says there are no plans to change the name .
but ultimately that will be for the new owners to decide .

well , if you add in the smaller mortgage lenders who specialised in lending via mortgage brokers only , more than 40 % of the mortgage lending capacity of the uk financial services industry that existed in 2007 has evaporated or been swallowed up by rivals .

the authorities decided it was no longer a viable bank , after the recent collapse in its share price , and a developing run on its funds by savers .
the branch network and savings are being moved to the much larger abbey , owned by the spanish bank santander .
the rest , such the mortgages and head office , are now owned by the state .
shares in the firm have been suspended .
is my money safe ?
if you are a saver , yes .
your accounts , with the money in them , have now been transferred to the abbey , along with the branches , call centres and internet operations .
the government says it is " business as usual " so the branches will open as normal and the staff , who are now abbey employees , have been asked to turn up as normal too .
what about my b & b mortgage ?
if you have a mortgage or other loan with the b & b you still owe the money and you must continue to make your regular repayments .
this is not a once in a lifetime opportunity for you to escape your debts .
but you are now paying to a bank owned by the government , not a bank owned by shareholders .
is the b & b insolvent ?
actually no .
which you might think is a bit odd , considering all the fuss about the bank 's future , and now its nationalisation and dismemberment .
its assets still appear to be higher than its debts .
but the lack of confidence in the b & b 's ability to keep going was on the verge of becoming reality .
banks rely absolutely on public and investor confidence to operate , because if everyone asked for their money back all at once , no bank would have enough money to meet the demand as they lend a lot of it out and can not recall it instantly .
are any other banks in similar trouble ?
the entire banking system is still in trouble .
but it appears , so far , that there are no other uk banks quite in the tricky situation that the bradford & bingley , and the northern rock , found themselves .
even so , we do not know what may be lurking in the financial undergrowth .
two small building societies were bailed out recently , with no prior warning , and taken over by the nationwide .
the best advice is if you have more than £ 35,000 in savings , make sure it is spread around among different savings institutions -lrb- that are not all part of the same group -rrb- so all your money is covered by the financial services compensation scheme -lrb- fscs -rrb- .
so people who are account holders with the bradford & bingley , as well as the abbey and cahoot -lrb- its internet bank -rrb- , will be covered , but only for the first £ 35,000 of their savings .
quite a few banks have disappeared , have n't they ?
yes .

here republican and democratic voters from across the us reflect on how the candidates performed .
jessica ross student -pipe- democrat " this debate has made me a stronger supporter of barack obama " age : 23 lives : langhorne , pennsylvania occupation : student and administrative assistant last election voted : republican in 10 words or less : compassionate , spontaneous , opinionated , patient , idealistic , christian , loving , frank , objective voters ' views : main page " as i watched obama and listened to him speak , i felt like i was watching the next president of the united states .
he was collected , prepared and composed .
mccain came off as arrogant , referring to himself as a maverick while dropping names left right and centre .
what stuck out in my mind the most was how john mccain said that ronald reagan was one of the people he looks up to the most .
any african-american person should have shuddered when they heard that statement .
ronald reagan was very much against the civil rights movement and the changes it brought to this country .
obama made many good points , including addressing the problems of the economy , the mistake of invading iraq , and the mishandling of health care .
he did a great job in confronting mccain over the mistake of invading iraq .
both candidates did a good job in clearly presenting their points : mccain in highlighting obama 's lack of experience ; and obama in highlighting the mistakes the republican party has made under the bush administration .
this debate has made me a stronger supporter of barack obama . "
read what the panellists said after the convention you can add your comments and questions on jessica 's views using the form below : your comments : jessica , you bring up very good points .
i too became a stronger supporter of obama after the debate .
mccain was very patronising , intelligent individual is what we need as a leader and i 'm afraid .
mccain wo n't be able to provide what we need .
aisha rahimi , walnut creek , california i do n't know what debate she was watching , but in the one i was obama would n't even answer the questions he was asked about economics .
when asked what spending he would cut as a result of the bailout , he changed the subject .
john mccain quickly said a possible spending freeze wyatt , omaha , ne , usa hi and thank you for your comments .
wyatt - i did not say that obama did a perfect job , both he and mccain danced around a few subjects .
to the " what do you need to change in the budget due to the economic crisis " question , obama basically said it is too soon to really know , which i think was an honest answer .
mccain , under pressure from the moderator to get a direct answer , proposed a spending freeze .
obama then responded to mccain 's idea of a spending freeze , pointing out that it was not a logical idea considering many things in the budget are simply too important to freeze spending .
aisha , i agree that mccain was very patronising and condescending .
while this attitude may be appealing to the die-hard republicans it is not going to sway the independents .

here republican and democratic voters from across the us reflect on how the candidates performed .
jessica ross student -pipe- democrat this debate has made me a stronger supporter of barack obama age : 23 lives : langhorne , pennsylvania occupation : student and administrative assistant last election voted : republican in 10 words or less : compassionate , spontaneous , opinionated , patient , idealistic , christian , loving , frank , objective voters ' views : main page " as i watched obama and listened to him speak , i felt like i was watching the next president of the united states .
he was collected , prepared and composed .
mccain came off as arrogant , referring to himself as a maverick while dropping names left right and centre .
what stuck out in my mind the most was how john mccain said that ronald reagan was one of the people he looks up to the most .
any african-american person should have shuddered when they heard that statement .
ronald reagan was very much against the civil rights movement and the changes it brought to this country .
obama made many good points , including addressing the problems of the economy , the mistake of invading iraq , and the mishandling of health care .
he did a great job in confronting mccain over the mistake of invading iraq .
both candidates did a good job in clearly presenting their points : mccain in highlighting obama 's lack of experience ; and obama in highlighting the mistakes the republican party has made under the bush administration .
this debate has made me a stronger supporter of barack obama . "
read what the panellists said after the convention you can add your comments and questions on jessica 's views using the form below : your comments : jessica , you bring up very good points .
i too became a stronger supporter of obama after the debate .
mccain was very patronising , intelligent individual is what we need as a leader and i 'm afraid .
mccain wo n't be able to provide what we need .
aisha rahimi , walnut creek , california i do n't know what debate she was watching , but in the one i was obama would n't even answer the questions he was asked about economics .
when asked what spending he would cut as a result of the bailout , he changed the subject .
john mccain quickly said a possible spending freeze wyatt , omaha , ne , usa hi and thank you for your comments .
wyatt - i did not say that obama did a perfect job , both he and mccain danced around a few subjects .
to the " what do you need to change in the budget due to the economic crisis " question , obama basically said it is too soon to really know , which i think was an honest answer .
mccain , under pressure from the moderator to get a direct answer , proposed a spending freeze .
obama then responded to mccain 's idea of a spending freeze , pointing out that it was not a logical idea considering many things in the budget are simply too important to freeze spending .
aisha , i agree that mccain was very patronising and condescending .
while this attitude may be appealing to the die-hard republicans it is not going to sway the independents .

here republican and democratic voters from across the us reflect on how the candidates performed .
tom taber retired -pipe- democrat my impression was that both candidates are competent to be president age : 58 lives : san mateo , california occupation : retired last election voted : democrat in 10 words or less : optimistic , outdoor-oriented , physically fit , unconventional , non-conformist , sceptical of authority voters ' views : main page " i was very impressed by both candidates .
i would characterise mccain as experienced and obama as thoughtful .
mccain demonstrated his superior foreign policy knowledge and experience by citing many trips to trouble spots and meetings with foreign leaders .
obama held his own , however , by displaying a thorough knowledge of these issues .
but it was obvious that his knowledge was from second-hand sources .
if it was a sporting event i think it was a virtual tie , with a slight advantage to mccain .
my impression was that both candidates are competent to be president and either would be a big improvement over the current administration .
but both candidates also made contradictory statements which i want to see clarified .
is federal business tax high or low ?
how do the candidates stand on the financial bail-out bill ?
neither answered the question .
and where do they stand on military operations inside pakistan to attack al-qaeda ?
though i am more inclined to vote for obama than mccain , his performance did n't overcome my concern that his knowledge on the issues is not rooted in enough real-life experience .
i suspect that independent undecided voters are still undecided . "
read what the panellists said after the convention you can add your comments and questions on tom 's views using the form below : your comments : tom , i think focusing on obama 's lack of experience in foreign affairs is a wrong angle .
there have been many presidents who have had tons of experience but made horrible presidents .
obama 's forward thinking , collective attitude , and obvious intelligible grasp of issues show that he would be great at foreign affairs .
the real question is do we want to continue to drain our economy by staying in the iraq war for arrogant pride issues ?
aideen rahimi , walnut creek , california to aideen - obama is a fast learner and grasps the issues , but still there is no substitute for first-hand experience with foreign policy issues .
when i visit foreign countries and speak with the locals i understand what is going on much more deeply than if i read an article or a book about it .
also , it sounds as if obama wants to transfer our troops from iraq to afghanistan rather than bringing them home .
how is that going to stop the drain on the economy ?

food queues have become a common sight in egypt in recent months but the one which forms outside the mandarine koueider store in central cairo is different .
each afternoon there is a festive atmosphere as long lines of people wait to buy traditional arabic sweets to eat after the iftar meal which breaks the daily fast .
" every day during ramadan i go and buy desserts , " says hassan clutching two neatly-wrapped packages .
" today i 'm having iftar with a friend .
he wanted basboosa and i wanted baklawa so i bought both . "
" i got basboosa and kunafa for my family , " says riham , a smartly-dressed woman .
" you must have some sweets after your meal in ramadan .
i come here every year . "
but for poor egyptians it is hard to afford the usual ramadan fare .
a few miles away in the tawfikiya souk , laila , a middle-aged housewife furrows her brow as she considers prices at a vegetable stall .
this evening she and her sister are preparing food for a dozen relatives .
" things that we used to buy for one egyptian pound we now buy for two pounds .
what was ten pounds is twenty , " she complains .
food inflation laila says that she never bought subsidised food in the past but now relies on it , buying her full rations from state-run bakeries and grocery shops .
yet the week before ramadan started even the cost of some subsidised goods went up .
ramdan puddings basboosa : dessert made with semolina and yogurt , then soaked in a rose water syrup baklawa : sweet layered pastry filled with nuts and syrup or honey kunafa : cheese cake , with shredded wheat , syrup , ground nuts and raisins " in ramadan people should have mercy and not exploit others , " laila says .
" at this time there is a higher consumption of food because we have a lot of invitations and invite people to iftar . "
as a net importer of food and energy , egypt - with its large population of about 75 million people - has been hit hard by price increases on the global market .
economist , dr samir radwan , has been comparing this year 's figures to those for 2007 .
" in july inflation was 22 % and food inflation 25 % , by august overall inflation had risen to 25 % and food inflation was 35 % .
" these are very telling numbers and they immediately translate into an erosion in the income of the poor because they spend two-thirds of their incomes on food . "
other indicators show the egyptian economy is performing well .
reforms have helped push the overall growth rate above 7 % and exports and foreign investment have soared .
however benefits are not yet trickling down to the poor .
charity reliance the government has raised the salaries of 6 million public workers by 30 % and restructured subsidies but dr radwan says this has not achieved the desired effect .
" there 's a rough , back-of-an-envelope estimate that all the improvements in salaries and subsidies have added 18 % to the income of the poor but at the same time the increase in prices resulting from removing energy subsidies and liberalising some commodity prices have resulted in a loss of 19 % . "
economists are now advising on further short-term measures to protect the poor and long-term measures to boost investment - particularly in agriculture - reform the salaries system and improve productivity .
with more egyptians in need this ramadan there is greater reliance on charity .
this is traditionally provided in the form of zakat -lrb- alms -rrb- and sadaqah -lrb- handouts -rrb- as well as iftar feasts which are set up in the streets .
during the holy month shopkeepers in the zamalek area of cairo provide free food to up to 200 people every day .
" anybody passing who ca n't get iftar at home can get it here , " says an organiser , khaled al-howary .
" we have meat , rice and salad .
a kitchen here makes it and everyone has his own meal . "
but some imams have commented that increasing living costs are affecting people 's generosity .
with eid al-fitr - the feast marking the end of ramadan - now approaching they 've appealed to egyptians who can afford it to remember the many struggling to make ends meet .

food queues have become a common sight in egypt in recent months but the one which forms outside the mandarine koueider store in central cairo is different .
each afternoon there is a festive atmosphere as long lines of people wait to buy traditional arabic sweets to eat after the iftar meal which breaks the daily fast .
" every day during ramadan i go and buy desserts , " says hassan clutching two neatly-wrapped packages .
" today i 'm having iftar with a friend .
he wanted basboosa and i wanted baklawa so i bought both . "
" i got basboosa and kunafa for my family , " says riham , a smartly-dressed woman .
" you must have some sweets after your meal in ramadan .
i come here every year . "
but for poor egyptians it is hard to afford the usual ramadan fare .
a few miles away in the tawfikiya souk , laila , a middle-aged housewife furrows her brow as she considers prices at a vegetable stall .
this evening she and her sister are preparing food for a dozen relatives .
" things that we used to buy for one egyptian pound we now buy for two pounds .
what was ten pounds is twenty , " she complains .
food inflation laila says that she never bought subsidised food in the past but now relies on it , buying her full rations from state-run bakeries and grocery shops .
yet the week before ramadan started even the cost of some subsidised goods went up .
ramdan puddings basboosa : dessert made with semolina and yogurt , then soaked in a rose water syrup baklawa : sweet layered pastry filled with nuts and syrup or honey kunafa : cheese cake , with shredded wheat , syrup , ground nuts and raisins " in ramadan people should have mercy and not exploit others , " laila says .
" at this time there is a higher consumption of food because we have a lot of invitations and invite people to iftar . "
as a net importer of food and energy , egypt - with its large population of about 75 million people - has been hit hard by price increases on the global market .
economist , dr samir radwan , has been comparing this year 's figures to those for 2007 .
" in july inflation was 22 % and food inflation 25 % , by august overall inflation had risen to 25 % and food inflation was 35 % .
" these are very telling numbers and they immediately translate into an erosion in the income of the poor because they spend two-thirds of their incomes on food . "
other indicators show the egyptian economy is performing well .
reforms have helped push the overall growth rate above 7 % and exports and foreign investment have soared .
however benefits are not yet trickling down to the poor .
charity reliance the government has raised the salaries of 6 million public workers by 30 % and restructured subsidies but dr radwan says this has not achieved the desired effect .
food prices have doubled since ramadan last year , shoppers say " there 's a rough , back-of-an-envelope estimate that all the improvements in salaries and subsidies have added 18 % to the income of the poor but at the same time the increase in prices resulting from removing energy subsidies and liberalising some commodity prices have resulted in a loss of 19 % . "
economists are now advising on further short-term measures to protect the poor and long-term measures to boost investment - particularly in agriculture - reform the salaries system and improve productivity .
with more egyptians in need this ramadan there is greater reliance on charity .
this is traditionally provided in the form of zakat -lrb- alms -rrb- and sadaqah -lrb- handouts -rrb- as well as iftar feasts which are set up in the streets .
during the holy month shopkeepers in the zamalek area of cairo provide free food to up to 200 people every day .
" anybody passing who ca n't get iftar at home can get it here , " says an organiser , khaled al-howary .
" we have meat , rice and salad .
a kitchen here makes it and everyone has his own meal . "
but some imams have commented that increasing living costs are affecting people 's generosity .
with eid al-fitr - the feast marking the end of ramadan - now approaching they 've appealed to egyptians who can afford it to remember the many struggling to make ends meet .

" i got basboosa and kunafa for my family , " says riham , a smartly-dressed woman .
" you must have some sweets after your meal in ramadan .
i come here every year . "
but for poor egyptians it is hard to afford the usual ramadan fare .
a few miles away in the tawfikiya souk , laila , a middle-aged housewife furrows her brow as she considers prices at a vegetable stall .
this evening she and her sister are preparing food for a dozen relatives .
" things that we used to buy for one egyptian pound we now buy for two pounds .
what was ten pounds is twenty , " she complains .
food inflation laila says that she never bought subsidised food in the past but now relies on it , buying her full rations from state-run bakeries and grocery shops .
yet the week before ramadan started even the cost of some subsidised goods went up .
ramdan puddings basboosa : dessert made with semolina and yogurt , then soaked in a rose water syrup baklawa : sweet layered pastry filled with nuts and syrup or honey kunafa : cheese cake , with shredded wheat , syrup , ground nuts and raisins " in ramadan people should have mercy and not exploit others , " laila says .
" at this time there is a higher consumption of food because we have a lot of invitations and invite people to iftar . "
as a net importer of food and energy , egypt - with its large population of about 75 million people - has been hit hard by price increases on the global market .
economist , dr samir radwan , has been comparing this year 's figures to those for 2007 .
" in july inflation was 22 % and food inflation 25 % , by august overall inflation had risen to 25 % and food inflation was 35 % .
" these are very telling numbers and they immediately translate into an erosion in the income of the poor because they spend two-thirds of their incomes on food . "
other indicators show the egyptian economy is performing well .
reforms have helped push the overall growth rate above 7 % and exports and foreign investment have soared .
however benefits are not yet trickling down to the poor .
charity reliance the government has raised the salaries of 6 million public workers by 30 % and restructured subsidies but dr radwan says this has not achieved the desired effect .
food prices have doubled since ramadan last year , shoppers say " there 's a rough , back-of-an-envelope estimate that all the improvements in salaries and subsidies have added 18 % to the income of the poor but at the same time the increase in prices resulting from removing energy subsidies and liberalising some commodity prices have resulted in a loss of 19 % . "
economists are now advising on further short-term measures to protect the poor and long-term measures to boost investment - particularly in agriculture - reform the salaries system and improve productivity .
with more egyptians in need this ramadan there is greater reliance on charity .
this is traditionally provided in the form of zakat -lrb- alms -rrb- and sadaqah -lrb- handouts -rrb- as well as iftar feasts which are set up in the streets .
during the holy month shopkeepers in the zamalek area of cairo provide free food to up to 200 people every day .
" anybody passing who ca n't get iftar at home can get it here , " says an organiser , khaled al-howary .
" we have meat , rice and salad .
a kitchen here makes it and everyone has his own meal . "
but some imams have commented that increasing living costs are affecting people 's generosity .
with eid al-fitr - the feast marking the end of ramadan - now approaching they 've appealed to egyptians who can afford it to remember the many struggling to make ends meet .

lib dem transport spokesman norman baker says hazardous cargos such as radioactive material should be banned .
he also wants the limit on fuel being carried reduced from 1,500 litres to 300 litres to reduce the risk of fire .
meanwhile eurotunnel has opened another section of the north tunnel and resumed 40 more daily train services .
it is not yet known what caused the fire but french officials say the fire was near a lorry carrying chemicals .
stricter rules mr baker wants the introduction of fully-enclosed lorry carriages , rather than the partially open-sided ones currently in use .
he says the government has been complacent in not pushing the channel tunnel safety authority to adopt stricter rules .
thirty-two people on a lorry shuttle service were led to safety after the fire in the north tunnel on 11 september .
fourteen were treated for minor injuries , including smoke inhalation .
eurotunnel has said it will take several months before channel tunnel services are operating normally again following the fire .
however , another of the previously-closed sections of the north tunnel has reopened , raising overall capacity from 170 trains a day to 210 .
the london to paris and brussels high-speed eurostar train services will be almost back to normal .
folkestone-to-calais passenger and truck services have increased and rail freight trains are using the tunnel at night .

here republican and democratic voters from across the us reflect on how the candidates performed .
geoffrey nolan salesman -pipe- republican mccain just seemed to have a firmer , clearer grasp of the topics age : 62 lives : miami , florida occupation : canvas awning salesman last election voted : republican in 10 words or fewer : political duellist - fencing with relish but not without pity voters ' views : main page " the general feeling i 'm left with is that mccain is a bi-partisan statesman who seeks a growing , healthy economy .
obama just wants to hand out benefits .
it is as though obama is offering anyone hurt by the present economic conditions a chance to get even with the guilty parties .
when asked where he 'd have to cut spending due to the financial mess , obama launched into a laundry list of benefits that he would not cut .

former chairman of the commission for integrated transport , professor david begg , will talk about getting motorists to change their travel behaviour .
nottingham city council wants to introduce a workplace parking levy in preference to a congestion charge .
professor begg said radical action was needed to deal with the problem which was damaging the city 's economy .
' drag on businesses ' he said good public transport on its own would not tackle traffic congestion .
" it 's not enough just to improve public transport , you 've actually got to make it less attractive for people to travel by car into city centres .
" the biggest drag on businesses in our cities has been congestion - that 's the biggest transport constraint on the future economic development of our cities .
" if we do n't go down this radical line then congestion is just going to continue to increase . "
if approved , a workplace parking tax could be introduced in 2010 .
fair system the city council said a levy will bring congestion benefits in a way that is more simple , fair and better targeted at commuters than road user charging .
the proposed levy would apply to businesses with 10 or more spaces and the initial annual charge would be £ 185 per space from the year 2010 , rising to £ 350 by 2014 .
the council has said money raised from the tax would help make £ 12m to develop nottingham 's tram system .
the department for transport is expected to rule in the next few weeks on whether nottingham city council can go ahead with the plan .

former chairman of the commission for integrated transport , professor david begg , will talk about getting motorists to change their travel behaviour .
nottingham city council wants to introduce a workplace parking levy in preference to a congestion charge .
professor begg said radical action was needed to deal with the problem which was damaging the city 's economy .
' drag on businesses ' he said good public transport on its own would not tackle traffic congestion .
" it 's not enough just to improve public transport , you 've actually got to make it less attractive for people to travel by car into city centres .
" the biggest drag on businesses in our cities has been congestion - that 's the biggest transport constraint on the future economic development of our cities .
" if we do n't go down this radical line then congestion is just going to continue to increase . "
if approved , a workplace parking tax could be introduced in 2010 .
fair system the city council said a levy will bring congestion benefits in a way that is more simple , fair and better targeted at commuters than road user charging .
the proposed levy would apply to businesses with 10 or more spaces and the initial annual charge would be £ 185 per space from the year 2010 , rising to £ 350 by 2014 .
the council has said money raised from the tax would help make £ 12m to develop nottingham 's tram system .
the department for transport is expected to rule in the next few weeks on whether nottingham city council can go ahead with the plan .
