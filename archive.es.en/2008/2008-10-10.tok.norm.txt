his breakthrough as a mediator came in namibia , which achieved independence in 1990 , capping years of work by the finnish national who served as special representative to the united nations secretary general and head of the un 's transition assistance team .
ahtisaari and his wife , eeva , were made honorary citizens of the southern african nation .
formative years ahtisaari has said his interest in peace mediation can be traced to his childhood years .
he was born on june 23 , 1937 in viipuri , a city that finland had to secede to the soviet union during the second world war , forcing 400,000 finns from karelia to relocate to finland .
the experience of being displaced fuelled his interest to promote peace and " help others , " he has said .
a second major achievement was the august 2005 peace deal between indonesia and the separatist free aceh movement -lrb- gam -rrb- aimed at ending a decades-long conflict in the indonesian province , and forged in the wake of the devastation caused by the december 2004 tsunami .
he has said mediation is " an ' art ' rather than an established practice , " adding that each conflict needs to be treated as a separate case .
mediation efforts ahtisaari 's hopes for the 2006 peace prize were dashed as the nobel committee selected muhammad yunus of bangladesh who founded the grameen bank that offers loans to the poor .
after qualifying as a teacher in 1959 , ahtisaari joined the foreign ministry in 1965 .
he served as ambassador to tanzania and held top posts in the foreign ministry and later in the un .
after his term as president 1994-2000 during which finland joined the european union , ahtisaari formed the crisis management initiative -lrb- cmi -rrb- that has been engaged in various mediation efforts .
while in office in 1999 , ahtisaari along with former russian prime minister viktor chernomyrdin and former us deputy secretary of state strobe talbott hammered out a plan to resolve the kosovo crisis that then-yugoslav president slobodan milosevic could accept .
accolades in 2000 he was called in to inspect irish republican army -lrb- ira -rrb- arms caches in northern ireland and later served as un special envoy for the horn of africa .
in recent years , ahtisaari has been engaged in discussing the future of the eu including turkey 's possible membership .
almost three years ago , in november 2005 , he was named special un envoy to kosovo but his efforts to bridge the divisions over kosovo 's status were unsuccessful and he stepped down after presenting his recommendations in february 2008 .
he has won numerous awards including the un cultural organization unesco 's felix houphouet-boigny peace prize for 2008 , named after the late president of ivory coast , as well as several honorary doctorates .
the funds from the unesco award were to be used for a foundation to promote peace , mediation and help post-conflict societies .
crowning glory the nobel , which is worth 10 million kronor -lrb- $ 1.5 million -rrb- , will be handed over at a ceremony in oslo on december 10 .
in 2007 , the peace prize was shared by the united nations climate body , the intergovernmental panel on climate change -lrb- ipcc -rrb- and al gore of the united states for their work on climate change .
for this year 's award , the five-member nobel committee had received 197 nominations for the coveted award including 33 organizations . dpa news agency -lrb- jp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ? 07 radio news listen to world headlines from the top of the hour .

benedict concluded his homily by inviting believers to pray for the beatification of pius .
a declaration of attained blessedness , beatification is the third in the four steps towards earning roman catholic sainthood .
the pope however stopped short on elaborating on whether the vatican has sainthood in store for pius .
holocaust heroics ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some jews praise pius , others condemn him bendict 's commemoration of pius has revived the long-standing debate surrounding the italian-born pope 's role in sheltering jews from the horrors of the holocaust .
while some jews maintain that pius did not intervene enough , pope benedict stated that pius made great efforts to help the jews , albeit his actions were secretive in their nature so as to not provoke the nazis and worsen the situation .
" he often acted in a secret and silent way precisely because , given the real situations of that complex moment in history , he realized that only in this manner could the worst be avoided and the greatest number of jews be saved , " benedict said .
to underline the efforts pius made , in his homily benedict quoted a tribute made when pius died by then israeli foreign minister golda meir saying : " when fearful martyrdom came to our people in the decade of nazi terror , the voice of the pope was raised for the victims . "
rabbi denounces pope 's efforts bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : rabbi cohen said pius did n't do enough to save the jews but on monday , oct .
6 , rabbi shear-yushuv cohen , who became the first jew to address a synod of bishops at the vatican , denounced pius for not coming to the rescue of the jews .
" we remember those religious leaders who did not raise their voice to save our brethren .
we can not forgive and forget , " shear-yashuv cohen said in his address .
he also separately told reporters that pius " should not be seen as a model and he should not be beatified because he did not raise his voice against the holocaust . "
on tuesday , a senior cardinal at the vatican defended pius ' wartime record , reports afp .
in the vatican newspaper , secretary of state tarcisio bertone wrote that if pius xii " had intervened publicly , he would have endangered the lives of thousands of jews who , at his request , were hidden in the 155 convents and monasteries in the city of rome alone . "
pope needs a miracle in his prayers , benedict hoped the process leading to pius ' beatification " can proceed happily . "

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de climate -pipe- 10.10.2008 scientist warns climate change happening faster than predicted großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : scientists warn sea levels are rising faster than predicted global warming calculations have been too optimistic and global sea levels are likely to rise a full meter this century , senior german scientists have warned .
they say un-backed data on climate change is out of date . " we should prepare for a rise of sea levels of one meter this century , " said joachim schellnhuber , head of the potsdam institute for climate impact research -lrb- pik -rrb- , which advises the german government on environmental policy .
the melting rates of glaciers in the himalayas and the greenland ice-sheet have doubled or even tripled in recent years , due partly to increased greenhouse gas emissions by chinese power stations , he said .
his findings used data which was unavailable to the intergovernmental panel on climate change -lrb- ipcc -rrb- when it compiled its most recent global warming report .
in february 2007 , in the first volume of a landmark report , the nobel prize-winning ipcc predicted the oceans would rise by between 18 and 59 centimeters by 2100 .
the umbrella effect bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the earth is hurtling toward a warmer age at a quickening pace , say scientists further causes for concern include a drop in the amount of dirt particles in the air that protect from sunlight .
schellnhuber warned that cleaning air in beijing and in other large cities suffering from pollution problems by limiting car and power-plant emissions may raise global temperatures instead of lowering them .
aerosols , or particles suspended in air , have a cooling effect on the earth , countering global warming linked to carbon dioxide , said schellnhuber , explaining that a drop in aerosols in the atmosphere could cause a rapid rise in temperatures .
airborne pollutants act as an umbrella worldwide while co2 provides insulation , trapping heat attempting to escape into the atmosphere .
a rise in temperature because of declines in aerosols in the atmosphere can be offset by slashing co2 emissions , he said .
by not reducing carbon output , humanity " is closing the last door we have through which we can possibly influence the global climate , " schellnhuber warned .
urgent need for action bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : carbon emissions must be cut back - now the scientist stressed that there is what he called a 50-50 chance of limiting the global temperature rise to 2 degrees celsius -lrb- 3.6 degrees fahrenheit -rrb- before 2100 , which would avert the worst damage of climate change - so long as plans fleshed out by the g8 countries to reduce emissions are realized .
the united nations-sponsored climate-change talks this december in poznan , poland , and next year in copenhagen must reach an agreement to limit co2 , he added .
" there is really no time to spare , " schellnhuber said in an interview with bloomberg .
" technology will play a decisive role in limiting carbon but we have to move to a carbon-free world by the end of the century . "
german environment minister sigmar gabriel -lrb- spd -rrb- has warned that environmental issues risk being neglected because of the global financial crisis .

they say un-backed data on climate change is out of date . " we should prepare for a rise of sea levels of one meter this century , " said joachim schellnhuber , head of the potsdam institute for climate impact research -lrb- pik -rrb- , which advises the german government on environmental policy .
the melting rates of glaciers in the himalayas and the greenland ice-sheet have doubled or even tripled in recent years , due partly to increased greenhouse gas emissions by chinese power stations , he said .
his findings used data which was unavailable to the intergovernmental panel on climate change -lrb- ipcc -rrb- when it compiled its most recent global warming report .
in february 2007 , in the first volume of a landmark report , the nobel prize-winning ipcc predicted the oceans would rise by between 18 and 59 centimeters by 2100 .
the umbrella effect bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the earth is hurtling toward a warmer age at a quickening pace , say scientists further causes for concern include a drop in the amount of dirt particles in the air that protect from sunlight .
schellnhuber warned that cleaning air in beijing and in other large cities suffering from pollution problems by limiting car and power-plant emissions may raise global temperatures instead of lowering them .
aerosols , or particles suspended in air , have a cooling effect on the earth , countering global warming linked to carbon dioxide , said schellnhuber , explaining that a drop in aerosols in the atmosphere could cause a rapid rise in temperatures .
airborne pollutants act as an umbrella worldwide while co2 provides insulation , trapping heat attempting to escape into the atmosphere .
a rise in temperature because of declines in aerosols in the atmosphere can be offset by slashing co2 emissions , he said .
by not reducing carbon output , humanity " is closing the last door we have through which we can possibly influence the global climate , " schellnhuber warned .
urgent need for action bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : carbon emissions must be cut back - now the scientist stressed that there is what he called a 50-50 chance of limiting the global temperature rise to 2 degrees celsius -lrb- 3.6 degrees fahrenheit -rrb- before 2100 , which would avert the worst damage of climate change - so long as plans fleshed out by the g8 countries to reduce emissions are realized .
the united nations-sponsored climate-change talks this december in poznan , poland , and next year in copenhagen must reach an agreement to limit co2 , he added .
" there is really no time to spare , " schellnhuber said in an interview with bloomberg .
" technology will play a decisive role in limiting carbon but we have to move to a carbon-free world by the end of the century . "
german environment minister sigmar gabriel -lrb- spd -rrb- has warned that environmental issues risk being neglected because of the global financial crisis .

10 that the us government was doing all it could to keep the world 's largest economy afloat ahead of a meeting with other g7 leaders in wasiungton . bush 's comments came as global stocks were in free-fall and ministers from the world 's richest nations prepared for a crucial meeting .
bush said a " startling " drop in us stocks in the last few days was being " driven by uncertainty and fear " and insisted the us already had all the tools necessary to resolve the financial crisis .
" this has been a deeply unsettling period for the american people , " bush acknowledged .
" we will continue to act to resolve this crisis and restore stability to our markets . "
us stocks have plummeted more than 10 percent in the last three days and continued falling on a wild trading day friday .
european stocks also tumbled , leading some countries to temporarily halt trading .
bush touts global cooperation bush said that international cooperation was key as finance ministers from the group of seven industrial nations were set to meet in washington .
" the world is sending an unmistakable signal : we 're in this together , we will come through this together , " bush said in a statement outside the white house .
the g7 bloc will also look to reassure the markets in a statement following its first meeting since the financial crisis broadened significantly last month , starting with the bankruptcy of us finance firm lehman brothers .
ministers could announce a joint commitment to intervene in their struggling banking industries .
ministers and central bank heads acknowledged cooperation was the only way forward in a crisis that has spread from the united states to europe and the rest of the world .

" the downward spiral has gathered pace .
case-by-case answers are not going to help any more , even in germany , " he said in washington .
bush will meet with the g7 ministers on saturday , while treasury secretary henry paulson will also be hosting an emergency meeting of finance chiefs from the world 's 20 leading economies , in a sign of how far the crisis has spread .
dominique strauss-kahn , managing director of the international monetary fund , said thursday the world was on the " cusp " of a recession .
the imf and world bank also hold their annual meetings this weekend .
bush announced no new moves to ease the us credit crunch that has curbed the availability of loans to consumers and small businesses .
instead he cited the litany of us government interventions and powers already in play after congress last week passed a $ 700-billion rescue package that gives the treasury broad authority to intervene in the banking system .

10 stepped up diplomatic pressure to regulate financial markets under an eight-point plan , berlin denied it had plans to nationalize commercial banks . however , berlin may inject equity into troubled german banks , its two top financial officials signaled as they arrived in washington for group of seven -lrb- g7 -rrb- talks .
as the stock market crash worsened , finance minister peer steinbrueck said , " the downward spiral has gathered pace .
case by case answers are not going to help any more , even in germany . "
" the financial sector as a whole requires a solution of a stabilizing character , " he added .
axel weber , president of the german bundesbank and a senior board member of the european central bank , said it was a possibility to inject capital into banks temporarily as britain had done .
there was no alternative but to act , said weber .
so far , germany has only had to guarantee a single , 50-billion- euro -lrb- $ 70-billion -rrb- bail-out for a mortgage lender , hypo real estate , and it has been refusing to contribute to a joint eu bail-out for other banks .
instead , its leaders have pointedly criticized deregulated financial markets in britain and the united states and demanded action to bring markets under tighter rules .
merkel keen on regulation bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel and steinbrueck want financial regulation in a speech friday in dresden , german chancellor angela merkel said , " in this crisis , we have to see the opportunity to persuade those who have not been persuaded so far that rules have to be established . "
ahead of a meeting in washington on saturday , finance minister steinbrueck this week offered finance ministers an english translation of the eight-point plan of reforms he unveiled in a speech to parliament on september 26 .
merkel said thursday she would not rule out increased state intervention in the panic , but finance ministry spokesman torsten albig said friday there were " no current considerations " of taking over banks .
albig admitted that government and central bank intervention had failed to stop the world slide in confidence .
" we 've evidently not found a means that fundamentally calms the markets , " he said .
merkel 's deputy spokesman thomas steg added that no decisions about conceivable future actions had been taken .
he denied any disagreement between merkel and steinbrueck , who belong to different political parties .
about half the german retail banking system is already state-run , with the federal and state governments either owning banks of their own or overseeing trustee savings banks and non-profit cooperative banks .
among points in the eight-point plan are a call to put " innovative financial instruments " back onto bank balance sheets and increase bank liquidity " cushions . "
personal legal liability for bankers bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : those responsible for the crisis should take the strain berlin also wants greater personal legal liability imposed on brokers and bank executives as well as changes to their pay incentives to stop them taking big risks to earn more .
in addition , steinbrueck wants to stop banks packaging up mortgages and other loans as securities and selling these completely , eliminating all the bank 's own risk .
in the plan , which has the status of berlin government policy , he also said he wants regulatory authorities in the different countries to confer and work by standard rules . dpa news agency -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

however , british soccer is holding its breath as the credit crunch starts to bite in its top flight . hoeness was quoted in friday 's edition of the bild newspaper as saying that german soccer is well off even though income may drop .
" i believe that german soccer has less to worry than other countries , " said hoeness .
" the big question , however , is if we are moving into a recession where the advertising spending drops and companies are less inclined to pay money for sponsorship . "
the german 1974 world cup winner said that he was concerned for clubs in some other countries .
" here and there clubs could go under , but not the big ones .
chelsea , for instance , has its debts with abramovich , but they are not in danger because the club belongs to him .
there is no bank involved that can close the club , as long as abramovich does not demand his money back , " hoeness said .
" one needs to see if the ice on which everything was built will last . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : we 're in the money : bayern and hoeness are confident hoeness said that it was not certain that foreign investors in english soccer would continue investing such huge sums after losing a lot of money on the stock exchange .
" it would be good for competition if clubs in future actually had to earn the money they spent , " said hoeness .
he said that he was not concerned about his own club bayern munich , as they were financially " in a very strong position . "
meanwhile british soccer is holding its breath to see just how badly it will be affected by the collapse of many of the world 's banks and the ever-worsening financial crisis .
british game suffering backlash once regarded in britain as the people 's game , the sport is now in danger of being torn apart , with several teams ' sponsors already having gone down the pan .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : man utd 's sponsor aig had to be bailed out in the us manchester united shirt sponsor aig was bailed out by the us government , as was newcastle united 's shirt sponsor , northern rock , by the british government .
work on liverpool 's new ground has been delayed as owners keep a close eye on exactly what is happening to their cash .
the overseas investment that had been looked upon as the ideal blueprint by many of the country 's top clubs is now in danger of becoming the poisoned chalice .
what good is investment , many clubs are asking themselves , if it ca n't be guaranteed ?
perhaps the one club most affected so far is west ham united , the east london club for whom the collapse this week of iceland 's second biggest bank , landsbanki , could yet spell disaster for their icelandic owners and for their own future .
rumors persist that the bank - now under the control of the iceland government - could repatriate any overseas assets .
icelandic troubles felt in london 's east end for that , read west ham and their chairman bjorgolfur gudmundsson , who paid 85 million pounds for the club in november 2006 but who may yet be forced to put up the for-sale sign .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : gudmundsson 's west ham is reeling from the icelandic crunch gudmundsson , who was sacked as chairman of the bank on tuesday , has stressed that the club is safe and claims that no players have to be sold .
but west ham vice-chairman asgeir fridgeirsson said on tuesday that players would have to go before any spending could happen in the january transfer window .
" west ham united has one of the biggest squads in the premier league , " fridgeirsson said on tuesday .
" it is very unlikely -lrb- the chairman -rrb- will be willing to put in more money to buy players this january window . "
when he took over as manager in september , gianfranco zola had seemed confident that he would have money to spend in january .
west ham told the dpa news agency on wednesday that zola has yet to request a meeting with the club 's board and nor has one been arranged , but it would seem to be only a matter of time before the italian requests clarification of the situation .
in a statement , placed on the club 's official website on tuesday , west ham chief executive scott duxbury reiterated that players would have to be sold before any new spending could be sanctioned .
" since his appointment , gianfranco zola has made it quite clear that his first team squad is too large and needs to be reduced so he can effectively coach the team , " the statement read .
" once this has happened and if the manager requires further players , then the club will acquire them . "
hammers hammered by credit crunch the collapse of landsbanki followed hot on the heels of the implosion of their shirt sponsor , the tour operator xl , which went bust in september .
that cost the club an estimated 5 million pounds , and with gudmundsson a guarantor of 163 million pounds to xl , west ham 's future looks less than rosy .
the west ham story is just one sorry tale and if the crisis deepens , others could yet be affected in a similar way .
bildunterschrift : the lse has been hit hard and british clubs have shuddered with the resulting tremors the football association chairman lord triesman warned on tuesday that the crisis could cripple some club who are heavily in debt , estimating that english clubs owe a total of 3 billion pounds .
and uefa general secretary david taylor has warned that clubs with huge debt could be excluded from future european competitions would see those clubs finances further depleted .
the biggest worry for west ham is that the crisis may not yet have reached its lowest point and fridgeirsson 's words had a nasty ring to them on tuesday .
" it is , of course , a blow for -lrb- gudmundsson -rrb- and his financial strength , but he himself has a number of other investments that are doing quite well at the moment so there is no reason to fear that he will not honor his commitment to west ham football club , " he said .
" he -lrb- gudmundsson -rrb- is not absolutely sure how this will directly affect him , but one thing he is sure of is that this will have no implications on the other investments of him and his family . "

10 stepped up diplomatic pressure to regulate financial markets under an eight-point plan , berlin denied it had plans to nationalize commercial banks . however , berlin may inject equity into troubled german banks , its two top financial officials signaled as they arrived in washington for group of seven -lrb- g7 -rrb- talks .
as the stock market crash worsened , finance minister peer steinbrueck said , " the downward spiral has gathered pace .
case by case answers are not going to help any more , even in germany . "
" the financial sector as a whole requires a solution of a stabilizing character , " he added .
axel weber , president of the german bundesbank and a senior board member of the european central bank , said it was a possibility to inject capital into banks temporarily as britain had done .
there was no alternative but to act , said weber .
so far , germany has only had to guarantee a single , 50-billion- euro -lrb- $ 70-billion -rrb- bail-out for a mortgage lender , hypo real estate , and it has been refusing to contribute to a joint eu bail-out for other banks .
instead , its leaders have pointedly criticized deregulated financial markets in britain and the united states and demanded action to bring markets under tighter rules .
merkel keen on regulation bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel and steinbrueck want financial regulation in a speech friday in dresden , german chancellor angela merkel said , " in this crisis , we have to see the opportunity to persuade those who have not been persuaded so far that rules have to be established . "
ahead of a meeting in washington on saturday , finance minister steinbrueck this week offered finance ministers an english translation of the eight-point plan of reforms he unveiled in a speech to parliament on september 26 .
merkel said thursday she would not rule out increased state intervention in the panic , but finance ministry spokesman torsten albig said friday there were " no current considerations " of taking over banks .
albig admitted that government and central bank intervention had failed to stop the world slide in confidence .
" we 've evidently not found a means that fundamentally calms the markets , " he said .
merkel 's deputy spokesman thomas steg added that no decisions about conceivable future actions had been taken .
he denied any disagreement between merkel and steinbrueck , who belong to different political parties .
about half the german retail banking system is already state-run , with the federal and state governments either owning banks of their own or overseeing trustee savings banks and non-profit cooperative banks .
among points in the eight-point plan are a call to put " innovative financial instruments " back onto bank balance sheets and increase bank liquidity " cushions . "
personal legal liability for bankers bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : those responsible for the crisis should take the strain berlin also wants greater personal legal liability imposed on brokers and bank executives as well as changes to their pay incentives to stop them taking big risks to earn more .
in addition , steinbrueck wants to stop banks packaging up mortgages and other loans as securities and selling these completely , eliminating all the bank 's own risk .
in the plan , which has the status of berlin government policy , he also said he wants regulatory authorities in the different countries to confer and work by standard rules . dpa news agency -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de climate -pipe- 10.10.2008 scientist warns climate change happening faster than predicted großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : scientists warn sea levels are rising faster than predicted global warming calculations have been too optimistic and global sea levels are likely to rise a full meter this century , senior german scientists have warned .
they say un-backed data on climate change is out of date . " we should prepare for a rise of sea levels of one meter this century , " said joachim schellnhuber , head of the potsdam institute for climate impact research -lrb- pik -rrb- , which advises the german government on environmental policy .
the melting rates of glaciers in the himalayas and the greenland ice-sheet have doubled or even tripled in recent years , due partly to increased greenhouse gas emissions by chinese power stations , he said .
his findings used data which was unavailable to the intergovernmental panel on climate change -lrb- ipcc -rrb- when it compiled its most recent global warming report .
in february 2007 , in the first volume of a landmark report , the nobel prize-winning ipcc predicted the oceans would rise by between 18 and 59 centimeters by 2100 .
the umbrella effect bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the earth is hurtling toward a warmer age at a quickening pace , say scientists further causes for concern include a drop in the amount of dirt particles in the air that protect from sunlight .
schellnhuber warned that cleaning air in beijing and in other large cities suffering from pollution problems by limiting car and power-plant emissions may raise global temperatures instead of lowering them .
aerosols , or particles suspended in air , have a cooling effect on the earth , countering global warming linked to carbon dioxide , said schellnhuber , explaining that a drop in aerosols in the atmosphere could cause a rapid rise in temperatures .
airborne pollutants act as an umbrella worldwide while co2 provides insulation , trapping heat attempting to escape into the atmosphere .
a rise in temperature because of declines in aerosols in the atmosphere can be offset by slashing co2 emissions , he said .
by not reducing carbon output , humanity " is closing the last door we have through which we can possibly influence the global climate , " schellnhuber warned .
urgent need for action bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : carbon emissions must be cut back - now the scientist stressed that there is what he called a 50-50 chance of limiting the global temperature rise to 2 degrees celsius -lrb- 3.6 degrees fahrenheit -rrb- before 2100 , which would avert the worst damage of climate change - so long as plans fleshed out by the g8 countries to reduce emissions are realized .
the united nations-sponsored climate-change talks this december in poznan , poland , and next year in copenhagen must reach an agreement to limit co2 , he added .
" there is really no time to spare , " schellnhuber said in an interview with bloomberg .
" technology will play a decisive role in limiting carbon but we have to move to a carbon-free world by the end of the century . "
german environment minister sigmar gabriel -lrb- spd -rrb- has warned that environmental issues risk being neglected because of the global financial crisis .
" we can spend relatively little money now or vast sums in decades to come , " he was quoted as saying in zeit online .

his breakthrough as a mediator came in namibia , which achieved independence in 1990 , capping years of work by the finnish national who served as special representative to the united nations secretary general and head of the un 's transition assistance team .
ahtisaari and his wife , eeva , were made honorary citizens of the southern african nation .
formative years ahtisaari has said his interest in peace mediation can be traced to his childhood years .
he was born on june 23 , 1937 in viipuri , a city that finland had to secede to the soviet union during the second world war , forcing 400,000 finns from karelia to relocate to finland .
the experience of being displaced fuelled his interest to promote peace and " help others , " he has said .
a second major achievement was the august 2005 peace deal between indonesia and the separatist free aceh movement -lrb- gam -rrb- aimed at ending a decades-long conflict in the indonesian province , and forged in the wake of the devastation caused by the december 2004 tsunami .
he has said mediation is " an ' art ' rather than an established practice , " adding that each conflict needs to be treated as a separate case .
mediation efforts ahtisaari 's hopes for the 2006 peace prize were dashed as the nobel committee selected muhammad yunus of bangladesh who founded the grameen bank that offers loans to the poor .
after qualifying as a teacher in 1959 , ahtisaari joined the foreign ministry in 1965 .
he served as ambassador to tanzania and held top posts in the foreign ministry and later in the un .
after his term as president 1994-2000 during which finland joined the european union , ahtisaari formed the crisis management initiative -lrb- cmi -rrb- that has been engaged in various mediation efforts .
while in office in 1999 , ahtisaari along with former russian prime minister viktor chernomyrdin and former us deputy secretary of state strobe talbott hammered out a plan to resolve the kosovo crisis that then-yugoslav president slobodan milosevic could accept .
accolades in 2000 he was called in to inspect irish republican army -lrb- ira -rrb- arms caches in northern ireland and later served as un special envoy for the horn of africa .
in recent years , ahtisaari has been engaged in discussing the future of the eu including turkey 's possible membership .
almost three years ago , in november 2005 , he was named special un envoy to kosovo but his efforts to bridge the divisions over kosovo 's status were unsuccessful and he stepped down after presenting his recommendations in february 2008 .
he has won numerous awards including the un cultural organization unesco 's felix houphouet-boigny peace prize for 2008 , named after the late president of ivory coast , as well as several honorary doctorates .
the funds from the unesco award were to be used for a foundation to promote peace , mediation and help post-conflict societies .
crowning glory the nobel , which is worth 10 million kronor -lrb- $ 1.5 million -rrb- , will be handed over at a ceremony in oslo on december 10 .
in 2007 , the peace prize was shared by the united nations climate body , the intergovernmental panel on climate change -lrb- ipcc -rrb- and al gore of the united states for their work on climate change .
for this year 's award , the five-member nobel committee had received 197 nominations for the coveted award including 33 organizations . dpa news agency -lrb- jp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

10 to consider resuming high-level talks with russia , after moscow withdrew its troops from buffer zones in georgia . " if russia respects the six-point plan , and this appears to be the case , then we should resume dialogue with russia , " he told reporters at informal nato defense talks in the hungarian capital budapest .
" that means the nato-russia council should resume its work , " he said .
the western alliance froze such high level talks with russia in september , insisting that it could not do " business as usual " following moscow 's military operation in georgia .
russia sent troops into the former soviet republic in early august , after georgia tried to recover its breakaway region of south ossetia which , along with rebel abkhazia , moscow has since recognized as independent .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : jung urged nato to reach out to russia jung said he would like to see a " perspective " for the meetings to resume surface during the next round of talks with his nato counterparts , which is scheduled for february in cracow , poland .
the european union , whose french presidency brokered the six-point russia-georgia ceasefire agreement , is the institution which must decide whether moscow is respecting the accord .
but the bloc remained divided friday over whether that was the case , even after it appeared that russia had withdrawn its forces from the two buffer zones in line with the agreement .
russia sent troops into the former soviet republic in early august , amid a dispute over the breakaway region of south ossetia which , along with rebel abkhazia , moscow has since recognized as independent .
russian forces were still controlling two areas under georgian control prior to the conflict , the akhalgori district in south ossetia and the kodori gorge in abkhazia .
tbilisi insists the russians must leave the two areas to fully comply .
georgian efforts to become part of nato have infuriated russia , which objects to the prospect of its old cold war foe extending to its borders .
russian president dmitry medvedev has even accused nato of provoking the georgia conflict .
nato chief rules out high level talks bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : still no business as usual for nato 's de hoop scheffer nato secretary general jaap de hoop scheffer ruled out resuming high-level talks with russia after the alliance froze the meetings last month insisting that it could not do " business as usual with russia " since its attack on georgia in august .
" it is encouraging that russia seems to withdrawing its forces back to the pre-conflict lines , " scheffer told reporters , after a first ever meeting of the nato-georgia commission at ministerial level .
" but we are not in a situation where we go back to business as usual , " he said .
" it seems premature now to conclude that there will be a nato-russia council meeting in krakow , " scheffer said .
" that requires a discussion .
we are not at that stage yet . " "
us backs nato line on russian relations bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : it 's still too early to talk to russia , says the united states a senior official from the united states , which has staunchly backed georgia since the start , also agreed that it was too early to change nato 's approach , as russia still had to leave outstanding areas .
" there are clearly things that are going to have to be discussed , " he said , and warned : " we need to make sure that we do n't create a risky environment . "
scheffer said that the ministers did not discuss georgia 's nato aspirations , and that the topic would be taken up by alliance foreign ministers when they meet in brussels in december .
georgia 's military needs and reform efforts were addressed , but he insisted that nato would not supply tbilisi with any weapons as the nato chief spoke , french foreign minister bernard kouchner , whose country holds the european union 's rotating presidency , announced that russia had withdrawn from georgian buffer zones but " a long road " lay ahead to resolve other issues .
the european union , whose french presidency brokered the six-point russia-georgia ceasefire agreement , is the institution which must decide whether moscow is respecting the accord .
alliance agrees to target afghan drug lords bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : afghanistan 's opium trade will become a nato target in other developments at the meeting in budapest , nato defense ministers agreed to target drugs traffickers and opium laboratories in afghanistan as part of the alliance 's efforts to undermine the taliban insurgency .
but under a compromise hammered out in budapest , member states participating in nato 's international security assistance force -lrb- isaf -rrb- in afghanistan will be free to opt in or out of any anti-narcotics operations .
nato secretary general jaap de hoop scheffer said ministers had agreed that the " isaf can , in concert with afghan authorities , act against facilities or facilitators supporting the insurgency . "
however , any action would be " subject to the authorization of specific nations , " the nato chief said .
that was a concession to countries like germany , spain and italy , who argue that the fight against drugs should be left to the afghan police .
these countries had also expressed concern that any nato raids on laboratories would kill civilians and undermine the alliance 's popularity among ordinary afghans .
in an effort to address such reservations , ministers also agreed to ensure that civilian casualties be minimized , and that the anti-narcotics fight be conducted mainly in the southern provinces of afghanistan , where cultivations and the insurgency both thrive .
jung said he was " very satisfied with the compromise " and added that the deal would allow german soldiers to " continue to support the training of the afghan security forces " and to limit its role to providing assistance to afghan-led operations through logistical , intelligence and medical support .
opium proceeds funding taliban resurgeance bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the taliban is being funded by the drugs trade nato officials said the plan was " consistent with the appropriate un security council resolutions " and with the isaf 's existing operational plan .
friday 's compromise would be reviewed in february , when defense ministers next meet in poland .
the deal clinched in budapest follows a specific request from afghan defense minister abdel rahim wardak , who on thursday had asked his nato colleagues to help his government target drugs laboratories and seize imports of the chemicals that are needed to turn opium into heroin .
" we have asked nato to support our efforts to destroy the laboratories and to interdict the chemical precursors which are coming from outside the country , " wardak said .
nato military commanders acknowledge that more needs to be done to fight the opium and heroin trade .
us defense secretary robert gates believes that the taliban pocket between 60 and 80 million dollars per year from the sale of drugs .
" it is not only corrosive to good governance , it also directly funds the people that are killing afghans , americans and all our coalition partners , " gates said in budapest on thursday .

london and frankfurt erased more than 10 percent and paris more than nine percent as market turmoil showed no sign of easing , despite coordinated interest rate cuts and billions of dollars ' worth of cash injections . london 's ftse 100 index of leading shares nosedived 10.20 percent to as low as 3,873.99 points - the first time below 4,000 points since july 3 , 2002 - before pulling back to show a loss of 5.08 percent . frankfurt 's dax 30 also shed more than 10.0 percent and in paris the cac 40 dived 9.68 percent , before both markets trimmed their losses somewhat .
earlier , stocks in tokyo ended friday trading lower , with the benchmark nikkei 225 stock average plunging below the psychologically significant mark of 9,000 points for the first time in more than five years .
the fresh wave of worries drove up the gold price by more than 4 per cent with the deepening concerns about the economic outlook sending the oil price down by about 5 percent .
g7 under pressure to take global action us treasury secretary henry paulson , who will host the g7 finance ministers at the us treasury next door to the white house , said the meeting was intended to review steps already taken and ways to " further enhance our collective efforts . "
participants are under a lot of pressure to take constructive steps towards coordinated moves to stem the crisis .
british prime minister gordon brown called for a global solution to the crisis and urged other countries to adopt britain 's actions to save the banking system . other governments should follow britain in putting money into struggling banks and offering guarantees worth hundreds of billions to persuade banks to start lending to each other , brown wrote in an article in the times newspaper . " because this is a global problem , it requires a global solution , " he wrote . in berlin , german chancellor angela merkel said she could not rule out nationalizing any of the country 's banks , following similar moves in other european countries such as britain .

at the post-summit press conference , medvedev told reports that russia was fully complying with an eu-brokered ceasefire to the conflict that called for a return of military personnel to pre-war positions .
" everything that depended on us we 've done .

" there is a formal agreement between the nato nations to fight drug trafficking , " a diplomat confirmed as defense ministers met in the hungarian capital budapest for a two-day meeting to discuss issues ranging from the war in afghanistan to georgia 's nato membership bid and piracy off the somali coast .
nato spokesman james appathurai said the alliance 's international security assistance force -lrb- isaf -rrb- would " act in concert with the afghans , against facilities and facilitators supporting the insurgency . "
the isaf currently has 50,700 soldiers in afghanistan , up from about 45,000 six months ago .
the german parliament agreed tuesday , oct .
7 to increase its contribution by 1,000 soldiers , raising its total to 4,500 .
us lobbies for afghan drug action sources also said that nato 's anti-narcotics efforts would be temporary , and would be open only to those countries willing to participate .
us defense secretary robert gates had pitched hard at the meeting for nato to strike at the heart of the afghan opium trade , which is believed to have contributed substantially to a reinvigorated taliban insurgency aimed at destabilizing president hamid karzai 's government .
" it -lrb- the opium trade -rrb- is not only corrosive to good governance , it also directly funds the people that are killing afghans , americans and all our coalition partners , " gates said in budapest on thursday .
the deal followed a request from afghan defense minister abdel rahim wardak , who on thursday asked nato to help his government target drug laboratories and seize imports of the chemicals needed to turn opium into heroin .
" we have asked nato to support our efforts to destroy the laboratories and to interdict the chemical precursors which are coming from outside the country , " wardak said .
germany in favor of afghan-led operations nato military commanders agreed that more needed to be done to fight the opium and heroin trade , a view shared by most alliance members .
the taliban are thought to be pocketing up to $ 80 million a year from the afghan narcotics industry , which is the source of some 92 percent of the world 's opium and heroin .
germany , spain , greece , poland , romania and italy had expressed scepticism over the plans , saying the fight against the afghan drugs trade was not part of nato 's mandate and should be addressed by the afghans themselves .
german defence minister franz josef jung said thursday germany was willing to assist in reconnaissance of trafficking routes and in training but any operations should be afghan-led .
" if this keeps an afghan face then it 's also in our interest that we support such an activity , " he told reporters on thursday .
ministers also worried that bombing laboratories would kill civilians and undermine the alliance 's popularity among ordinary afghans .
the compromise reached friday is to be reviewed when defense ministers meet again in poland in february . dw staff -lrb- dfm -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" no possibility can be fully ruled out , " merkel said in berlin . last weekend , berlin announced a 50 billion euro -lrb- $ 68 billion -rrb- rescue package for germany 's fourth biggest bank hypo real estate , one of three of the country 's banks that have needed help over the past year .
but merkel 's government has so far not partly or fully nationalized any of its lenders - unlike britain , which on wednesday pledged 64 billion euros -lrb- $ 87 billion -rrb- to buy stakes in the country 's beleaguered banks .

10 that the us government was doing all it could to keep the world 's largest economy afloat ahead of a meeting with other g7 leaders in wasiungton . bush 's comments came as global stocks were in free-fall and ministers from the world 's richest nations prepared for a crucial meeting .
bush said a " startling " drop in us stocks in the last few days was being " driven by uncertainty and fear " and insisted the us already had all the tools necessary to resolve the financial crisis .
" this has been a deeply unsettling period for the american people , " bush acknowledged .
" we will continue to act to resolve this crisis and restore stability to our markets . "
us stocks have plummeted more than 10 percent in the last three days and continued falling on a wild trading day friday .
european stocks also tumbled , leading some countries to temporarily halt trading .
bush touts global cooperation bush said that international cooperation was key as finance ministers from the group of seven industrial nations were set to meet in washington .
" the world is sending an unmistakable signal : we 're in this together , we will come through this together , " bush said in a statement outside the white house .
the g7 bloc will also look to reassure the markets in a statement following its first meeting since the financial crisis broadened significantly last month , starting with the bankruptcy of us finance firm lehman brothers .
ministers could announce a joint commitment to intervene in their struggling banking industries .
ministers and central bank heads acknowledged cooperation was the only way forward in a crisis that has spread from the united states to europe and the rest of the world .
isolated efforts wo n't work : steinbrueck bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : steinbrueck says the crisis is beyond " case-by-case " answers german finance minister peer steinbrueck said germany was weighing its own large-scale rescue of banks in europe 's largest economy .
" the downward spiral has gathered pace .
case-by-case answers are not going to help any more , even in germany , " he said in washington .
bush will meet with the g7 ministers on saturday , while treasury secretary henry paulson will also be hosting an emergency meeting of finance chiefs from the world 's 20 leading economies , in a sign of how far the crisis has spread .
dominique strauss-kahn , managing director of the international monetary fund , said thursday the world was on the " cusp " of a recession .
the imf and world bank also hold their annual meetings this weekend .
bush announced no new moves to ease the us credit crunch that has curbed the availability of loans to consumers and small businesses .
instead he cited the litany of us government interventions and powers already in play after congress last week passed a $ 700-billion rescue package that gives the treasury broad authority to intervene in the banking system .

his breakthrough as a mediator came in namibia , which achieved independence in 1990 , capping years of work by the finnish national who served as special representative to the united nations secretary general and head of the un 's transition assistance team .
ahtisaari and his wife , eeva , were made honorary citizens of the southern african nation .
formative years ahtisaari has said his interest in peace mediation can be traced to his childhood years .
he was born on june 23 , 1937 in viipuri , a city that finland had to secede to the soviet union during the second world war , forcing 400,000 finns from karelia to relocate to finland .
the experience of being displaced fuelled his interest to promote peace and " help others , " he has said .
a second major achievement was the august 2005 peace deal between indonesia and the separatist free aceh movement -lrb- gam -rrb- aimed at ending a decades-long conflict in the indonesian province , and forged in the wake of the devastation caused by the december 2004 tsunami .
he has said mediation is " an ' art ' rather than an established practice , " adding that each conflict needs to be treated as a separate case .
mediation efforts ahtisaari 's hopes for the 2006 peace prize were dashed as the nobel committee selected muhammad yunus of bangladesh who founded the grameen bank that offers loans to the poor .
after qualifying as a teacher in 1959 , ahtisaari joined the foreign ministry in 1965 .
he served as ambassador to tanzania and held top posts in the foreign ministry and later in the un .
after his term as president 1994-2000 during which finland joined the european union , ahtisaari formed the crisis management initiative -lrb- cmi -rrb- that has been engaged in various mediation efforts .
while in office in 1999 , ahtisaari along with former russian prime minister viktor chernomyrdin and former us deputy secretary of state strobe talbott hammered out a plan to resolve the kosovo crisis that then-yugoslav president slobodan milosevic could accept .
accolades in 2000 he was called in to inspect irish republican army -lrb- ira -rrb- arms caches in northern ireland and later served as un special envoy for the horn of africa .
in recent years , ahtisaari has been engaged in discussing the future of the eu including turkey 's possible membership .
almost three years ago , in november 2005 , he was named special un envoy to kosovo but his efforts to bridge the divisions over kosovo 's status were unsuccessful and he stepped down after presenting his recommendations in february 2008 .
he has won numerous awards including the un cultural organization unesco 's felix houphouet-boigny peace prize for 2008 , named after the late president of ivory coast , as well as several honorary doctorates .
the funds from the unesco award were to be used for a foundation to promote peace , mediation and help post-conflict societies .
crowning glory the nobel , which is worth 10 million kronor -lrb- $ 1.5 million -rrb- , will be handed over at a ceremony in oslo on december 10 .
in 2007 , the peace prize was shared by the united nations climate body , the intergovernmental panel on climate change -lrb- ipcc -rrb- and al gore of the united states for their work on climate change .
for this year 's award , the five-member nobel committee had received 197 nominations for the coveted award including 33 organizations . dpa news agency -lrb- jp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the decision was welcomed by the leaders of both countries . the european court of human rights rejected thursday a land claim by ethnic germans who lost homes in poland during the second world war , a decision welcomed by leaders of both countries whose ties have soured over the issue .
the claim was filed by a private company , the prussian claims society , representing 23 germans .
it accused poland of violating the rights of germans who were expelled from their pre-war homes when borders were redrawn in 1945 at the end of the war . judges : poland ca n't be held accountable judges at the european court of human rights in strasbourg however ruled that modern poland bears no responsibility for the expulsion of ethnic germans by the soviets after october 19 , 1994 because it had no governmental control of the land . the court also said it had no jurisdiction to rule on the issue because the expulsion of the germans from their polish homes took place before either country had signed the european convention on human rights .
according to the court , poland thus has no obligation “ to enact laws providing for rehabilitation , restitution of confiscated property or compensation for property lost by the individual applicants . ”
land claim cause of friction the land claim has been a source of friction between the two countries , with polish politicians accusing the group of germans of trying to reverse the outcome of world war ii .
while berlin never viewed any validity in the claim , it was unable to forbid the lawsuit , a position german foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier confirmed upon hearing the ruling .
german foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier welcomed the ruling , saying it confirmed berlin 's own position that there were no outstanding property issues from the second world war between the two nations . dw staff -lrb- ls -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

10 that the us government was doing all it could to keep the world 's largest economy afloat ahead of a meeting with other g7 leaders in wasiungton . bush 's comments came as global stocks were in free-fall and ministers from the world 's richest nations prepared for a crucial meeting .
bush said a " startling " drop in us stocks in the last few days was being " driven by uncertainty and fear " and insisted the us already had all the tools necessary to resolve the financial crisis .
" this has been a deeply unsettling period for the american people , " bush acknowledged .
" we will continue to act to resolve this crisis and restore stability to our markets . "
us stocks have plummeted more than 10 percent in the last three days and continued falling on a wild trading day friday .
european stocks also tumbled , leading some countries to temporarily halt trading .
bush touts global cooperation bush said that international cooperation was key as finance ministers from the group of seven industrial nations were set to meet in washington .
" the world is sending an unmistakable signal : we 're in this together , we will come through this together , " bush said in a statement outside the white house .
the g7 bloc will also look to reassure the markets in a statement following its first meeting since the financial crisis broadened significantly last month , starting with the bankruptcy of us finance firm lehman brothers .
ministers could announce a joint commitment to intervene in their struggling banking industries .
ministers and central bank heads acknowledged cooperation was the only way forward in a crisis that has spread from the united states to europe and the rest of the world .
isolated efforts wo n't work : steinbrueck bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : steinbrueck says the crisis is beyond " case-by-case " answers german finance minister peer steinbrueck said germany was weighing its own large-scale rescue of banks in europe 's largest economy .

case-by-case answers are not going to help any more , even in germany , " he said in washington .
bush will meet with the g7 ministers on saturday , while treasury secretary henry paulson will also be hosting an emergency meeting of finance chiefs from the world 's 20 leading economies , in a sign of how far the crisis has spread .
dominique strauss-kahn , managing director of the international monetary fund , said thursday the world was on the " cusp " of a recession .
the imf and world bank also hold their annual meetings this weekend .
bush announced no new moves to ease the us credit crunch that has curbed the availability of loans to consumers and small businesses .
instead he cited the litany of us government interventions and powers already in play after congress last week passed a $ 700-billion rescue package that gives the treasury broad authority to intervene in the banking system .
" we know what the problems are , we have the tools to fix them and we are working quickly to do so , " bush said . dpa news agency -lrb- dfm -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the decision was welcomed by the leaders of both countries . the european court of human rights rejected thursday a land claim by ethnic germans who lost homes in poland during the second world war , a decision welcomed by leaders of both countries whose ties have soured over the issue .
the claim was filed by a private company , the prussian claims society , representing 23 germans .
it accused poland of violating the rights of germans who were expelled from their pre-war homes when borders were redrawn in 1945 at the end of the war . judges : poland ca n't be held accountable judges at the european court of human rights in strasbourg however ruled that modern poland bears no responsibility for the expulsion of ethnic germans by the soviets after october 19 , 1994 because it had no governmental control of the land . the court also said it had no jurisdiction to rule on the issue because the expulsion of the germans from their polish homes took place before either country had signed the european convention on human rights .
according to the court , poland thus has no obligation “ to enact laws providing for rehabilitation , restitution of confiscated property or compensation for property lost by the individual applicants . ”
land claim cause of friction the land claim has been a source of friction between the two countries , with polish politicians accusing the group of germans of trying to reverse the outcome of world war ii .
while berlin never viewed any validity in the claim , it was unable to forbid the lawsuit , a position german foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier confirmed upon hearing the ruling .
german foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier welcomed the ruling , saying it confirmed berlin 's own position that there were no outstanding property issues from the second world war between the two nations . dw staff -lrb- ls -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

benedict concluded his homily by inviting believers to pray for the beatification of pius .
a declaration of attained blessedness , beatification is the third in the four steps towards earning roman catholic sainthood .
the pope however stopped short on elaborating on whether the vatican has sainthood in store for pius .
holocaust heroics ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some jews praise pius , others condemn him bendict 's commemoration of pius has revived the long-standing debate surrounding the italian-born pope 's role in sheltering jews from the horrors of the holocaust .
while some jews maintain that pius did not intervene enough , pope benedict stated that pius made great efforts to help the jews , albeit his actions were secretive in their nature so as to not provoke the nazis and worsen the situation .
" he often acted in a secret and silent way precisely because , given the real situations of that complex moment in history , he realized that only in this manner could the worst be avoided and the greatest number of jews be saved , " benedict said .
to underline the efforts pius made , in his homily benedict quoted a tribute made when pius died by then israeli foreign minister golda meir saying : " when fearful martyrdom came to our people in the decade of nazi terror , the voice of the pope was raised for the victims . "
rabbi denounces pope 's efforts bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : rabbi cohen said pius did n't do enough to save the jews but on monday , oct .
6 , rabbi shear-yushuv cohen , who became the first jew to address a synod of bishops at the vatican , denounced pius for not coming to the rescue of the jews .
" we remember those religious leaders who did not raise their voice to save our brethren .
we can not forgive and forget , " shear-yashuv cohen said in his address .
he also separately told reporters that pius " should not be seen as a model and he should not be beatified because he did not raise his voice against the holocaust . "
on tuesday , a senior cardinal at the vatican defended pius ' wartime record , reports afp .
in the vatican newspaper , secretary of state tarcisio bertone wrote that if pius xii " had intervened publicly , he would have endangered the lives of thousands of jews who , at his request , were hidden in the 155 convents and monasteries in the city of rome alone . "
pope needs a miracle in his prayers , benedict hoped the process leading to pius ' beatification " can proceed happily . "

benedict concluded his homily by inviting believers to pray for the beatification of pius .
a declaration of attained blessedness , beatification is the third in the four steps towards earning roman catholic sainthood .
the pope however stopped short on elaborating on whether the vatican has sainthood in store for pius .
holocaust heroics ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some jews praise pius , others condemn him bendict 's commemoration of pius has revived the long-standing debate surrounding the italian-born pope 's role in sheltering jews from the horrors of the holocaust .
while some jews maintain that pius did not intervene enough , pope benedict stated that pius made great efforts to help the jews , albeit his actions were secretive in their nature so as to not provoke the nazis and worsen the situation .
" he often acted in a secret and silent way precisely because , given the real situations of that complex moment in history , he realized that only in this manner could the worst be avoided and the greatest number of jews be saved , " benedict said .
to underline the efforts pius made , in his homily benedict quoted a tribute made when pius died by then israeli foreign minister golda meir saying : " when fearful martyrdom came to our people in the decade of nazi terror , the voice of the pope was raised for the victims . "
rabbi denounces pope 's efforts bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : rabbi cohen said pius did n't do enough to save the jews but on monday , oct .
6 , rabbi shear-yushuv cohen , who became the first jew to address a synod of bishops at the vatican , denounced pius for not coming to the rescue of the jews .
" we remember those religious leaders who did not raise their voice to save our brethren .
we can not forgive and forget , " shear-yashuv cohen said in his address .
he also separately told reporters that pius " should not be seen as a model and he should not be beatified because he did not raise his voice against the holocaust . "
on tuesday , a senior cardinal at the vatican defended pius ' wartime record , reports afp .
in the vatican newspaper , secretary of state tarcisio bertone wrote that if pius xii " had intervened publicly , he would have endangered the lives of thousands of jews who , at his request , were hidden in the 155 convents and monasteries in the city of rome alone . "
pope needs a miracle in his prayers , benedict hoped the process leading to pius ' beatification " can proceed happily . "
in order to be canonized , convincing evidence that pius xii performed a miracle must be provided . dw staff -lrb- ls -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

10 to consider resuming high-level talks with russia , after moscow withdrew its troops from buffer zones in georgia . " if russia respects the six-point plan , and this appears to be the case , then we should resume dialogue with russia , " he told reporters at informal nato defense talks in the hungarian capital budapest .
" that means the nato-russia council should resume its work , " he said .
the western alliance froze such high level talks with russia in september , insisting that it could not do " business as usual " following moscow 's military operation in georgia .
russia sent troops into the former soviet republic in early august , after georgia tried to recover its breakaway region of south ossetia which , along with rebel abkhazia , moscow has since recognized as independent .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : jung urged nato to reach out to russia jung said he would like to see a " perspective " for the meetings to resume surface during the next round of talks with his nato counterparts , which is scheduled for february in cracow , poland .
the european union , whose french presidency brokered the six-point russia-georgia ceasefire agreement , is the institution which must decide whether moscow is respecting the accord .
but the bloc remained divided friday over whether that was the case , even after it appeared that russia had withdrawn its forces from the two buffer zones in line with the agreement .
russia sent troops into the former soviet republic in early august , amid a dispute over the breakaway region of south ossetia which , along with rebel abkhazia , moscow has since recognized as independent .
russian forces were still controlling two areas under georgian control prior to the conflict , the akhalgori district in south ossetia and the kodori gorge in abkhazia .
tbilisi insists the russians must leave the two areas to fully comply .
georgian efforts to become part of nato have infuriated russia , which objects to the prospect of its old cold war foe extending to its borders .
russian president dmitry medvedev has even accused nato of provoking the georgia conflict .
nato chief rules out high level talks bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : still no business as usual for nato 's de hoop scheffer nato secretary general jaap de hoop scheffer ruled out resuming high-level talks with russia after the alliance froze the meetings last month insisting that it could not do " business as usual with russia " since its attack on georgia in august .
" it is encouraging that russia seems to withdrawing its forces back to the pre-conflict lines , " scheffer told reporters , after a first ever meeting of the nato-georgia commission at ministerial level .
" but we are not in a situation where we go back to business as usual , " he said .
" it seems premature now to conclude that there will be a nato-russia council meeting in krakow , " scheffer said .
" that requires a discussion .
we are not at that stage yet . " "
us backs nato line on russian relations bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : it 's still too early to talk to russia , says the united states a senior official from the united states , which has staunchly backed georgia since the start , also agreed that it was too early to change nato 's approach , as russia still had to leave outstanding areas .
" there are clearly things that are going to have to be discussed , " he said , and warned : " we need to make sure that we do n't create a risky environment . "
scheffer said that the ministers did not discuss georgia 's nato aspirations , and that the topic would be taken up by alliance foreign ministers when they meet in brussels in december .
georgia 's military needs and reform efforts were addressed , but he insisted that nato would not supply tbilisi with any weapons as the nato chief spoke , french foreign minister bernard kouchner , whose country holds the european union 's rotating presidency , announced that russia had withdrawn from georgian buffer zones but " a long road " lay ahead to resolve other issues .
the european union , whose french presidency brokered the six-point russia-georgia ceasefire agreement , is the institution which must decide whether moscow is respecting the accord .
alliance agrees to target afghan drug lords bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : afghanistan 's opium trade will become a nato target in other developments at the meeting in budapest , nato defense ministers agreed to target drugs traffickers and opium laboratories in afghanistan as part of the alliance 's efforts to undermine the taliban insurgency .
but under a compromise hammered out in budapest , member states participating in nato 's international security assistance force -lrb- isaf -rrb- in afghanistan will be free to opt in or out of any anti-narcotics operations .
nato secretary general jaap de hoop scheffer said ministers had agreed that the " isaf can , in concert with afghan authorities , act against facilities or facilitators supporting the insurgency . "
however , any action would be " subject to the authorization of specific nations , " the nato chief said .
that was a concession to countries like germany , spain and italy , who argue that the fight against drugs should be left to the afghan police .
these countries had also expressed concern that any nato raids on laboratories would kill civilians and undermine the alliance 's popularity among ordinary afghans .
in an effort to address such reservations , ministers also agreed to ensure that civilian casualties be minimized , and that the anti-narcotics fight be conducted mainly in the southern provinces of afghanistan , where cultivations and the insurgency both thrive .
jung said he was " very satisfied with the compromise " and added that the deal would allow german soldiers to " continue to support the training of the afghan security forces " and to limit its role to providing assistance to afghan-led operations through logistical , intelligence and medical support .
opium proceeds funding taliban resurgeance bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the taliban is being funded by the drugs trade nato officials said the plan was " consistent with the appropriate un security council resolutions " and with the isaf 's existing operational plan .
friday 's compromise would be reviewed in february , when defense ministers next meet in poland .
the deal clinched in budapest follows a specific request from afghan defense minister abdel rahim wardak , who on thursday had asked his nato colleagues to help his government target drugs laboratories and seize imports of the chemicals that are needed to turn opium into heroin .
" we have asked nato to support our efforts to destroy the laboratories and to interdict the chemical precursors which are coming from outside the country , " wardak said .
nato military commanders acknowledge that more needs to be done to fight the opium and heroin trade .
us defense secretary robert gates believes that the taliban pocket between 60 and 80 million dollars per year from the sale of drugs .
" it is not only corrosive to good governance , it also directly funds the people that are killing afghans , americans and all our coalition partners , " gates said in budapest on thursday .
poppy cultivations have fallen by 19 per cent since last year , but afghan heroin still accounts for more than 90 per cent of the heroin circulating in europe . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the directory , which telekom maintains had been stolen , had contained the private numbers of high-profile politicians and celebrities , as well as customer mobile phone numbers , addresses , dates of birth and , in some cases , email addresses .
bank information or credit card numbers were not accessed , said the bonn-based firm .
in germany , most wireless-line numbers are ex-directory and confidential .
telekom chief executive rene obermann said at the company 's head office in bonn that in future , the company would voluntarily brief the public on a dedicated web site about " critical data-privacy incidents " undergoing criminal investigation .
" in the race against data theft , we want to be at least one step ahead at all times , " he said .
a seventh board department will be set up to deal with privacy and the company will issue data privacy reports every six months .

they say un-backed data on climate change is out of date . " we should prepare for a rise of sea levels of one meter this century , " said joachim schellnhuber , head of the potsdam institute for climate impact research -lrb- pik -rrb- , which advises the german government on environmental policy .
the melting rates of glaciers in the himalayas and the greenland ice-sheet have doubled or even tripled in recent years , due partly to increased greenhouse gas emissions by chinese power stations , he said .
his findings used data which was unavailable to the intergovernmental panel on climate change -lrb- ipcc -rrb- when it compiled its most recent global warming report .
in february 2007 , in the first volume of a landmark report , the nobel prize-winning ipcc predicted the oceans would rise by between 18 and 59 centimeters by 2100 .
the umbrella effect bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the earth is hurtling toward a warmer age at a quickening pace , say scientists further causes for concern include a drop in the amount of dirt particles in the air that protect from sunlight .
schellnhuber warned that cleaning air in beijing and in other large cities suffering from pollution problems by limiting car and power-plant emissions may raise global temperatures instead of lowering them .
aerosols , or particles suspended in air , have a cooling effect on the earth , countering global warming linked to carbon dioxide , said schellnhuber , explaining that a drop in aerosols in the atmosphere could cause a rapid rise in temperatures .
airborne pollutants act as an umbrella worldwide while co2 provides insulation , trapping heat attempting to escape into the atmosphere .
a rise in temperature because of declines in aerosols in the atmosphere can be offset by slashing co2 emissions , he said .
by not reducing carbon output , humanity " is closing the last door we have through which we can possibly influence the global climate , " schellnhuber warned .
urgent need for action bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : carbon emissions must be cut back - now the scientist stressed that there is what he called a 50-50 chance of limiting the global temperature rise to 2 degrees celsius -lrb- 3.6 degrees fahrenheit -rrb- before 2100 , which would avert the worst damage of climate change - so long as plans fleshed out by the g8 countries to reduce emissions are realized .
the united nations-sponsored climate-change talks this december in poznan , poland , and next year in copenhagen must reach an agreement to limit co2 , he added .
" there is really no time to spare , " schellnhuber said in an interview with bloomberg .
" technology will play a decisive role in limiting carbon but we have to move to a carbon-free world by the end of the century . "
german environment minister sigmar gabriel -lrb- spd -rrb- has warned that environmental issues risk being neglected because of the global financial crisis .
" we can spend relatively little money now or vast sums in decades to come , " he was quoted as saying in zeit online .

10 that the us government was doing all it could to keep the world 's largest economy afloat ahead of a meeting with other g7 leaders in wasiungton . bush 's comments came as global stocks were in free-fall and ministers from the world 's richest nations prepared for a crucial meeting .
bush said a " startling " drop in us stocks in the last few days was being " driven by uncertainty and fear " and insisted the us already had all the tools necessary to resolve the financial crisis .
" this has been a deeply unsettling period for the american people , " bush acknowledged .
" we will continue to act to resolve this crisis and restore stability to our markets . "
us stocks have plummeted more than 10 percent in the last three days and continued falling on a wild trading day friday .
european stocks also tumbled , leading some countries to temporarily halt trading .
bush touts global cooperation bush said that international cooperation was key as finance ministers from the group of seven industrial nations were set to meet in washington .
" the world is sending an unmistakable signal : we 're in this together , we will come through this together , " bush said in a statement outside the white house .
the g7 bloc will also look to reassure the markets in a statement following its first meeting since the financial crisis broadened significantly last month , starting with the bankruptcy of us finance firm lehman brothers .
ministers could announce a joint commitment to intervene in their struggling banking industries .
ministers and central bank heads acknowledged cooperation was the only way forward in a crisis that has spread from the united states to europe and the rest of the world .
isolated efforts wo n't work : steinbrueck bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : steinbrueck says the crisis is beyond " case-by-case " answers german finance minister peer steinbrueck said germany was weighing its own large-scale rescue of banks in europe 's largest economy .
" the downward spiral has gathered pace .
case-by-case answers are not going to help any more , even in germany , " he said in washington .
bush will meet with the g7 ministers on saturday , while treasury secretary henry paulson will also be hosting an emergency meeting of finance chiefs from the world 's 20 leading economies , in a sign of how far the crisis has spread .
dominique strauss-kahn , managing director of the international monetary fund , said thursday the world was on the " cusp " of a recession .
the imf and world bank also hold their annual meetings this weekend .

" considering the crisis the international financial system is going through , it 's necessary to take really effective measures to protect markets and ensure their future stability , " medvedev said thursday , praising the example of european union cooperation in the face of financial crisis .
" we need such coordination if we want to stay competitive and overcome the consequences of the financial crisis with minimal losses , " he told journalists alongside the summit host , kyrgyz president kurmanbek bakiyev .
the nine presidents to attend the commonwealth of independent states -lrb- cis -rrb- meeting jointly called for common economic goals among members and cooperation in combating drug trafficking .
but the summit raised more questions about the group 's relevance than it answered , with high levels of presidential absenteeism at the closing news conference .
presidents in attendance throughout the summit included those of armenia , belarus , kazakhstan , kyrgyzstan , moldova , russia , tajikistan , turkmenistan and uzbekistan .
georgia formally withdrew from the cis after it was invaded by russia in august .
also absent were ukrainian president viktor yushchenko , an ally of georgia , and azerbaijani president ilham aliyev , whose country 's oil exports were disrupted by the war .

at the post-summit press conference , medvedev told reports that russia was fully complying with an eu-brokered ceasefire to the conflict that called for a return of military personnel to pre-war positions .
" everything that depended on us we 've done .
all the obligations we undertook ... we have fulfilled , " he said .

benedict concluded his homily by inviting believers to pray for the beatification of pius .
a declaration of attained blessedness , beatification is the third in the four steps towards earning roman catholic sainthood .
the pope however stopped short on elaborating on whether the vatican has sainthood in store for pius .
holocaust heroics ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some jews praise pius , others condemn him bendict 's commemoration of pius has revived the long-standing debate surrounding the italian-born pope 's role in sheltering jews from the horrors of the holocaust .
while some jews maintain that pius did not intervene enough , pope benedict stated that pius made great efforts to help the jews , albeit his actions were secretive in their nature so as to not provoke the nazis and worsen the situation .
" he often acted in a secret and silent way precisely because , given the real situations of that complex moment in history , he realized that only in this manner could the worst be avoided and the greatest number of jews be saved , " benedict said .
to underline the efforts pius made , in his homily benedict quoted a tribute made when pius died by then israeli foreign minister golda meir saying : " when fearful martyrdom came to our people in the decade of nazi terror , the voice of the pope was raised for the victims . "
rabbi denounces pope 's efforts bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : rabbi cohen said pius did n't do enough to save the jews but on monday , oct .
6 , rabbi shear-yushuv cohen , who became the first jew to address a synod of bishops at the vatican , denounced pius for not coming to the rescue of the jews .
" we remember those religious leaders who did not raise their voice to save our brethren .
we can not forgive and forget , " shear-yashuv cohen said in his address .
he also separately told reporters that pius " should not be seen as a model and he should not be beatified because he did not raise his voice against the holocaust . "
on tuesday , a senior cardinal at the vatican defended pius ' wartime record , reports afp .
in the vatican newspaper , secretary of state tarcisio bertone wrote that if pius xii " had intervened publicly , he would have endangered the lives of thousands of jews who , at his request , were hidden in the 155 convents and monasteries in the city of rome alone . "
pope needs a miracle in his prayers , benedict hoped the process leading to pius ' beatification " can proceed happily . "

the directory , which telekom maintains had been stolen , had contained the private numbers of high-profile politicians and celebrities , as well as customer mobile phone numbers , addresses , dates of birth and , in some cases , email addresses .

telekom chief executive rene obermann said at the company 's head office in bonn that in future , the company would voluntarily brief the public on a dedicated web site about " critical data-privacy incidents " undergoing criminal investigation .
" in the race against data theft , we want to be at least one step ahead at all times , " he said .
a seventh board department will be set up to deal with privacy and the company will issue data privacy reports every six months .

they say un-backed data on climate change is out of date . " we should prepare for a rise of sea levels of one meter this century , " said joachim schellnhuber , head of the potsdam institute for climate impact research -lrb- pik -rrb- , which advises the german government on environmental policy .
the melting rates of glaciers in the himalayas and the greenland ice-sheet have doubled or even tripled in recent years , due partly to increased greenhouse gas emissions by chinese power stations , he said .
his findings used data which was unavailable to the intergovernmental panel on climate change -lrb- ipcc -rrb- when it compiled its most recent global warming report .
in february 2007 , in the first volume of a landmark report , the nobel prize-winning ipcc predicted the oceans would rise by between 18 and 59 centimeters by 2100 .
the umbrella effect bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the earth is hurtling toward a warmer age at a quickening pace , say scientists further causes for concern include a drop in the amount of dirt particles in the air that protect from sunlight .
schellnhuber warned that cleaning air in beijing and in other large cities suffering from pollution problems by limiting car and power-plant emissions may raise global temperatures instead of lowering them .
aerosols , or particles suspended in air , have a cooling effect on the earth , countering global warming linked to carbon dioxide , said schellnhuber , explaining that a drop in aerosols in the atmosphere could cause a rapid rise in temperatures .
airborne pollutants act as an umbrella worldwide while co2 provides insulation , trapping heat attempting to escape into the atmosphere .
a rise in temperature because of declines in aerosols in the atmosphere can be offset by slashing co2 emissions , he said .
by not reducing carbon output , humanity " is closing the last door we have through which we can possibly influence the global climate , " schellnhuber warned .
urgent need for action bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : carbon emissions must be cut back - now the scientist stressed that there is what he called a 50-50 chance of limiting the global temperature rise to 2 degrees celsius -lrb- 3.6 degrees fahrenheit -rrb- before 2100 , which would avert the worst damage of climate change - so long as plans fleshed out by the g8 countries to reduce emissions are realized .
the united nations-sponsored climate-change talks this december in poznan , poland , and next year in copenhagen must reach an agreement to limit co2 , he added .
" there is really no time to spare , " schellnhuber said in an interview with bloomberg .
" technology will play a decisive role in limiting carbon but we have to move to a carbon-free world by the end of the century . "
german environment minister sigmar gabriel -lrb- spd -rrb- has warned that environmental issues risk being neglected because of the global financial crisis .

" there is a formal agreement between the nato nations to fight drug trafficking , " a diplomat confirmed as defense ministers met in the hungarian capital budapest for a two-day meeting to discuss issues ranging from the war in afghanistan to georgia 's nato membership bid and piracy off the somali coast .
nato spokesman james appathurai said the alliance 's international security assistance force -lrb- isaf -rrb- would " act in concert with the afghans , against facilities and facilitators supporting the insurgency . "
the isaf currently has 50,700 soldiers in afghanistan , up from about 45,000 six months ago .
the german parliament agreed tuesday , oct .
7 to increase its contribution by 1,000 soldiers , raising its total to 4,500 .
us lobbies for afghan drug action sources also said that nato 's anti-narcotics efforts would be temporary , and would be open only to those countries willing to participate .
us defense secretary robert gates had pitched hard at the meeting for nato to strike at the heart of the afghan opium trade , which is believed to have contributed substantially to a reinvigorated taliban insurgency aimed at destabilizing president hamid karzai 's government .
" it -lrb- the opium trade -rrb- is not only corrosive to good governance , it also directly funds the people that are killing afghans , americans and all our coalition partners , " gates said in budapest on thursday .
the deal followed a request from afghan defense minister abdel rahim wardak , who on thursday asked nato to help his government target drug laboratories and seize imports of the chemicals needed to turn opium into heroin .
" we have asked nato to support our efforts to destroy the laboratories and to interdict the chemical precursors which are coming from outside the country , " wardak said .
germany in favor of afghan-led operations nato military commanders agreed that more needed to be done to fight the opium and heroin trade , a view shared by most alliance members .
the taliban are thought to be pocketing up to $ 80 million a year from the afghan narcotics industry , which is the source of some 92 percent of the world 's opium and heroin .
germany , spain , greece , poland , romania and italy had expressed scepticism over the plans , saying the fight against the afghan drugs trade was not part of nato 's mandate and should be addressed by the afghans themselves .
german defence minister franz josef jung said thursday germany was willing to assist in reconnaissance of trafficking routes and in training but any operations should be afghan-led .
" if this keeps an afghan face then it 's also in our interest that we support such an activity , " he told reporters on thursday .
ministers also worried that bombing laboratories would kill civilians and undermine the alliance 's popularity among ordinary afghans .
the compromise reached friday is to be reviewed when defense ministers meet again in poland in february . dw staff -lrb- dfm -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the directory , which telekom maintains had been stolen , had contained the private numbers of high-profile politicians and celebrities , as well as customer mobile phone numbers , addresses , dates of birth and , in some cases , email addresses .
bank information or credit card numbers were not accessed , said the bonn-based firm .
in germany , most wireless-line numbers are ex-directory and confidential .
telekom chief executive rene obermann said at the company 's head office in bonn that in future , the company would voluntarily brief the public on a dedicated web site about " critical data-privacy incidents " undergoing criminal investigation .
" in the race against data theft , we want to be at least one step ahead at all times , " he said .
a seventh board department will be set up to deal with privacy and the company will issue data privacy reports every six months .
the former german telecommunications industry monopolizer is also to stop using an internet-style system where any computer can be used to query its databanks using the right password .
employees and sales partners will only be able to access sensitive systems from specific computers .

his breakthrough as a mediator came in namibia , which achieved independence in 1990 , capping years of work by the finnish national who served as special representative to the united nations secretary general and head of the un 's transition assistance team .
ahtisaari and his wife , eeva , were made honorary citizens of the southern african nation .
formative years ahtisaari has said his interest in peace mediation can be traced to his childhood years .
he was born on june 23 , 1937 in viipuri , a city that finland had to secede to the soviet union during the second world war , forcing 400,000 finns from karelia to relocate to finland .
the experience of being displaced fuelled his interest to promote peace and " help others , " he has said .
a second major achievement was the august 2005 peace deal between indonesia and the separatist free aceh movement -lrb- gam -rrb- aimed at ending a decades-long conflict in the indonesian province , and forged in the wake of the devastation caused by the december 2004 tsunami .
he has said mediation is " an ' art ' rather than an established practice , " adding that each conflict needs to be treated as a separate case .
mediation efforts ahtisaari 's hopes for the 2006 peace prize were dashed as the nobel committee selected muhammad yunus of bangladesh who founded the grameen bank that offers loans to the poor .
after qualifying as a teacher in 1959 , ahtisaari joined the foreign ministry in 1965 .
he served as ambassador to tanzania and held top posts in the foreign ministry and later in the un .
after his term as president 1994-2000 during which finland joined the european union , ahtisaari formed the crisis management initiative -lrb- cmi -rrb- that has been engaged in various mediation efforts .
while in office in 1999 , ahtisaari along with former russian prime minister viktor chernomyrdin and former us deputy secretary of state strobe talbott hammered out a plan to resolve the kosovo crisis that then-yugoslav president slobodan milosevic could accept .
accolades in 2000 he was called in to inspect irish republican army -lrb- ira -rrb- arms caches in northern ireland and later served as un special envoy for the horn of africa .
in recent years , ahtisaari has been engaged in discussing the future of the eu including turkey 's possible membership .
almost three years ago , in november 2005 , he was named special un envoy to kosovo but his efforts to bridge the divisions over kosovo 's status were unsuccessful and he stepped down after presenting his recommendations in february 2008 .
he has won numerous awards including the un cultural organization unesco 's felix houphouet-boigny peace prize for 2008 , named after the late president of ivory coast , as well as several honorary doctorates .
the funds from the unesco award were to be used for a foundation to promote peace , mediation and help post-conflict societies .
crowning glory the nobel , which is worth 10 million kronor -lrb- $ 1.5 million -rrb- , will be handed over at a ceremony in oslo on december 10 .
in 2007 , the peace prize was shared by the united nations climate body , the intergovernmental panel on climate change -lrb- ipcc -rrb- and al gore of the united states for their work on climate change .
for this year 's award , the five-member nobel committee had received 197 nominations for the coveted award including 33 organizations . dpa news agency -lrb- jp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" there is a formal agreement between the nato nations to fight drug trafficking , " a diplomat confirmed as defense ministers met in the hungarian capital budapest for a two-day meeting to discuss issues ranging from the war in afghanistan to georgia 's nato membership bid and piracy off the somali coast .
nato spokesman james appathurai said the alliance 's international security assistance force -lrb- isaf -rrb- would " act in concert with the afghans , against facilities and facilitators supporting the insurgency . "
the isaf currently has 50,700 soldiers in afghanistan , up from about 45,000 six months ago .
the german parliament agreed tuesday , oct .
7 to increase its contribution by 1,000 soldiers , raising its total to 4,500 .
us lobbies for afghan drug action sources also said that nato 's anti-narcotics efforts would be temporary , and would be open only to those countries willing to participate .
us defense secretary robert gates had pitched hard at the meeting for nato to strike at the heart of the afghan opium trade , which is believed to have contributed substantially to a reinvigorated taliban insurgency aimed at destabilizing president hamid karzai 's government .
" it -lrb- the opium trade -rrb- is not only corrosive to good governance , it also directly funds the people that are killing afghans , americans and all our coalition partners , " gates said in budapest on thursday .
the deal followed a request from afghan defense minister abdel rahim wardak , who on thursday asked nato to help his government target drug laboratories and seize imports of the chemicals needed to turn opium into heroin .
" we have asked nato to support our efforts to destroy the laboratories and to interdict the chemical precursors which are coming from outside the country , " wardak said .
germany in favor of afghan-led operations nato military commanders agreed that more needed to be done to fight the opium and heroin trade , a view shared by most alliance members .
the taliban are thought to be pocketing up to $ 80 million a year from the afghan narcotics industry , which is the source of some 92 percent of the world 's opium and heroin .
germany , spain , greece , poland , romania and italy had expressed scepticism over the plans , saying the fight against the afghan drugs trade was not part of nato 's mandate and should be addressed by the afghans themselves .
german defence minister franz josef jung said thursday germany was willing to assist in reconnaissance of trafficking routes and in training but any operations should be afghan-led .
" if this keeps an afghan face then it 's also in our interest that we support such an activity , " he told reporters on thursday .
ministers also worried that bombing laboratories would kill civilians and undermine the alliance 's popularity among ordinary afghans .
the compromise reached friday is to be reviewed when defense ministers meet again in poland in february . dw staff -lrb- dfm -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

10 to consider resuming high-level talks with russia , after moscow withdrew its troops from buffer zones in georgia . " if russia respects the six-point plan , and this appears to be the case , then we should resume dialogue with russia , " he told reporters at informal nato defense talks in the hungarian capital budapest .
" that means the nato-russia council should resume its work , " he said .
the western alliance froze such high level talks with russia in september , insisting that it could not do " business as usual " following moscow 's military operation in georgia .
russia sent troops into the former soviet republic in early august , after georgia tried to recover its breakaway region of south ossetia which , along with rebel abkhazia , moscow has since recognized as independent .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : jung urged nato to reach out to russia jung said he would like to see a " perspective " for the meetings to resume surface during the next round of talks with his nato counterparts , which is scheduled for february in cracow , poland .
the european union , whose french presidency brokered the six-point russia-georgia ceasefire agreement , is the institution which must decide whether moscow is respecting the accord .
but the bloc remained divided friday over whether that was the case , even after it appeared that russia had withdrawn its forces from the two buffer zones in line with the agreement .
russia sent troops into the former soviet republic in early august , amid a dispute over the breakaway region of south ossetia which , along with rebel abkhazia , moscow has since recognized as independent .
russian forces were still controlling two areas under georgian control prior to the conflict , the akhalgori district in south ossetia and the kodori gorge in abkhazia .
tbilisi insists the russians must leave the two areas to fully comply .
georgian efforts to become part of nato have infuriated russia , which objects to the prospect of its old cold war foe extending to its borders .
russian president dmitry medvedev has even accused nato of provoking the georgia conflict .
nato chief rules out high level talks bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : still no business as usual for nato 's de hoop scheffer nato secretary general jaap de hoop scheffer ruled out resuming high-level talks with russia after the alliance froze the meetings last month insisting that it could not do " business as usual with russia " since its attack on georgia in august .
" it is encouraging that russia seems to withdrawing its forces back to the pre-conflict lines , " scheffer told reporters , after a first ever meeting of the nato-georgia commission at ministerial level .
" but we are not in a situation where we go back to business as usual , " he said .
" it seems premature now to conclude that there will be a nato-russia council meeting in krakow , " scheffer said .
" that requires a discussion .
we are not at that stage yet . " "
us backs nato line on russian relations bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : it 's still too early to talk to russia , says the united states a senior official from the united states , which has staunchly backed georgia since the start , also agreed that it was too early to change nato 's approach , as russia still had to leave outstanding areas .
" there are clearly things that are going to have to be discussed , " he said , and warned : " we need to make sure that we do n't create a risky environment . "
scheffer said that the ministers did not discuss georgia 's nato aspirations , and that the topic would be taken up by alliance foreign ministers when they meet in brussels in december .
georgia 's military needs and reform efforts were addressed , but he insisted that nato would not supply tbilisi with any weapons as the nato chief spoke , french foreign minister bernard kouchner , whose country holds the european union 's rotating presidency , announced that russia had withdrawn from georgian buffer zones but " a long road " lay ahead to resolve other issues .
the european union , whose french presidency brokered the six-point russia-georgia ceasefire agreement , is the institution which must decide whether moscow is respecting the accord .
alliance agrees to target afghan drug lords bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : afghanistan 's opium trade will become a nato target in other developments at the meeting in budapest , nato defense ministers agreed to target drugs traffickers and opium laboratories in afghanistan as part of the alliance 's efforts to undermine the taliban insurgency .
but under a compromise hammered out in budapest , member states participating in nato 's international security assistance force -lrb- isaf -rrb- in afghanistan will be free to opt in or out of any anti-narcotics operations .
nato secretary general jaap de hoop scheffer said ministers had agreed that the " isaf can , in concert with afghan authorities , act against facilities or facilitators supporting the insurgency . "
however , any action would be " subject to the authorization of specific nations , " the nato chief said .
that was a concession to countries like germany , spain and italy , who argue that the fight against drugs should be left to the afghan police .
these countries had also expressed concern that any nato raids on laboratories would kill civilians and undermine the alliance 's popularity among ordinary afghans .
in an effort to address such reservations , ministers also agreed to ensure that civilian casualties be minimized , and that the anti-narcotics fight be conducted mainly in the southern provinces of afghanistan , where cultivations and the insurgency both thrive .
jung said he was " very satisfied with the compromise " and added that the deal would allow german soldiers to " continue to support the training of the afghan security forces " and to limit its role to providing assistance to afghan-led operations through logistical , intelligence and medical support .
opium proceeds funding taliban resurgeance bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the taliban is being funded by the drugs trade nato officials said the plan was " consistent with the appropriate un security council resolutions " and with the isaf 's existing operational plan .
friday 's compromise would be reviewed in february , when defense ministers next meet in poland .
the deal clinched in budapest follows a specific request from afghan defense minister abdel rahim wardak , who on thursday had asked his nato colleagues to help his government target drugs laboratories and seize imports of the chemicals that are needed to turn opium into heroin .
" we have asked nato to support our efforts to destroy the laboratories and to interdict the chemical precursors which are coming from outside the country , " wardak said .
nato military commanders acknowledge that more needs to be done to fight the opium and heroin trade .
us defense secretary robert gates believes that the taliban pocket between 60 and 80 million dollars per year from the sale of drugs .
" it is not only corrosive to good governance , it also directly funds the people that are killing afghans , americans and all our coalition partners , " gates said in budapest on thursday .

however , british soccer is holding its breath as the credit crunch starts to bite in its top flight . hoeness was quoted in friday 's edition of the bild newspaper as saying that german soccer is well off even though income may drop .
" i believe that german soccer has less to worry than other countries , " said hoeness .
" the big question , however , is if we are moving into a recession where the advertising spending drops and companies are less inclined to pay money for sponsorship . "
the german 1974 world cup winner said that he was concerned for clubs in some other countries .
" here and there clubs could go under , but not the big ones .
chelsea , for instance , has its debts with abramovich , but they are not in danger because the club belongs to him .
there is no bank involved that can close the club , as long as abramovich does not demand his money back , " hoeness said .
" one needs to see if the ice on which everything was built will last . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : we 're in the money : bayern and hoeness are confident hoeness said that it was not certain that foreign investors in english soccer would continue investing such huge sums after losing a lot of money on the stock exchange .
" it would be good for competition if clubs in future actually had to earn the money they spent , " said hoeness .
he said that he was not concerned about his own club bayern munich , as they were financially " in a very strong position . "
meanwhile british soccer is holding its breath to see just how badly it will be affected by the collapse of many of the world 's banks and the ever-worsening financial crisis .
british game suffering backlash once regarded in britain as the people 's game , the sport is now in danger of being torn apart , with several teams ' sponsors already having gone down the pan .

work on liverpool 's new ground has been delayed as owners keep a close eye on exactly what is happening to their cash .
the overseas investment that had been looked upon as the ideal blueprint by many of the country 's top clubs is now in danger of becoming the poisoned chalice .
what good is investment , many clubs are asking themselves , if it ca n't be guaranteed ?
perhaps the one club most affected so far is west ham united , the east london club for whom the collapse this week of iceland 's second biggest bank , landsbanki , could yet spell disaster for their icelandic owners and for their own future .
rumors persist that the bank - now under the control of the iceland government - could repatriate any overseas assets .
icelandic troubles felt in london 's east end for that , read west ham and their chairman bjorgolfur gudmundsson , who paid 85 million pounds for the club in november 2006 but who may yet be forced to put up the for-sale sign .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : gudmundsson 's west ham is reeling from the icelandic crunch gudmundsson , who was sacked as chairman of the bank on tuesday , has stressed that the club is safe and claims that no players have to be sold .
but west ham vice-chairman asgeir fridgeirsson said on tuesday that players would have to go before any spending could happen in the january transfer window .
" west ham united has one of the biggest squads in the premier league , " fridgeirsson said on tuesday .
" it is very unlikely -lrb- the chairman -rrb- will be willing to put in more money to buy players this january window . "
when he took over as manager in september , gianfranco zola had seemed confident that he would have money to spend in january .
west ham told the dpa news agency on wednesday that zola has yet to request a meeting with the club 's board and nor has one been arranged , but it would seem to be only a matter of time before the italian requests clarification of the situation .
in a statement , placed on the club 's official website on tuesday , west ham chief executive scott duxbury reiterated that players would have to be sold before any new spending could be sanctioned .
" since his appointment , gianfranco zola has made it quite clear that his first team squad is too large and needs to be reduced so he can effectively coach the team , " the statement read .
" once this has happened and if the manager requires further players , then the club will acquire them . "
hammers hammered by credit crunch the collapse of landsbanki followed hot on the heels of the implosion of their shirt sponsor , the tour operator xl , which went bust in september .
that cost the club an estimated 5 million pounds , and with gudmundsson a guarantor of 163 million pounds to xl , west ham 's future looks less than rosy .
the west ham story is just one sorry tale and if the crisis deepens , others could yet be affected in a similar way .

the biggest worry for west ham is that the crisis may not yet have reached its lowest point and fridgeirsson 's words had a nasty ring to them on tuesday .
" it is , of course , a blow for -lrb- gudmundsson -rrb- and his financial strength , but he himself has a number of other investments that are doing quite well at the moment so there is no reason to fear that he will not honor his commitment to west ham football club , " he said .

however , british soccer is holding its breath as the credit crunch starts to bite in its top flight . hoeness was quoted in friday 's edition of the bild newspaper as saying that german soccer is well off even though income may drop .
" i believe that german soccer has less to worry than other countries , " said hoeness .
" the big question , however , is if we are moving into a recession where the advertising spending drops and companies are less inclined to pay money for sponsorship . "
the german 1974 world cup winner said that he was concerned for clubs in some other countries .
" here and there clubs could go under , but not the big ones .
chelsea , for instance , has its debts with abramovich , but they are not in danger because the club belongs to him .
there is no bank involved that can close the club , as long as abramovich does not demand his money back , " hoeness said .
" one needs to see if the ice on which everything was built will last . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : we 're in the money : bayern and hoeness are confident hoeness said that it was not certain that foreign investors in english soccer would continue investing such huge sums after losing a lot of money on the stock exchange .
" it would be good for competition if clubs in future actually had to earn the money they spent , " said hoeness .
he said that he was not concerned about his own club bayern munich , as they were financially " in a very strong position . "
meanwhile british soccer is holding its breath to see just how badly it will be affected by the collapse of many of the world 's banks and the ever-worsening financial crisis .
british game suffering backlash once regarded in britain as the people 's game , the sport is now in danger of being torn apart , with several teams ' sponsors already having gone down the pan .

the overseas investment that had been looked upon as the ideal blueprint by many of the country 's top clubs is now in danger of becoming the poisoned chalice .
what good is investment , many clubs are asking themselves , if it ca n't be guaranteed ?
perhaps the one club most affected so far is west ham united , the east london club for whom the collapse this week of iceland 's second biggest bank , landsbanki , could yet spell disaster for their icelandic owners and for their own future .
rumors persist that the bank - now under the control of the iceland government - could repatriate any overseas assets .
icelandic troubles felt in london 's east end for that , read west ham and their chairman bjorgolfur gudmundsson , who paid 85 million pounds for the club in november 2006 but who may yet be forced to put up the for-sale sign .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : gudmundsson 's west ham is reeling from the icelandic crunch gudmundsson , who was sacked as chairman of the bank on tuesday , has stressed that the club is safe and claims that no players have to be sold .

the decision was welcomed by the leaders of both countries . the european court of human rights rejected thursday a land claim by ethnic germans who lost homes in poland during the second world war , a decision welcomed by leaders of both countries whose ties have soured over the issue .
the claim was filed by a private company , the prussian claims society , representing 23 germans .
it accused poland of violating the rights of germans who were expelled from their pre-war homes when borders were redrawn in 1945 at the end of the war . judges : poland ca n't be held accountable judges at the european court of human rights in strasbourg however ruled that modern poland bears no responsibility for the expulsion of ethnic germans by the soviets after october 19 , 1994 because it had no governmental control of the land . the court also said it had no jurisdiction to rule on the issue because the expulsion of the germans from their polish homes took place before either country had signed the european convention on human rights .
according to the court , poland thus has no obligation “ to enact laws providing for rehabilitation , restitution of confiscated property or compensation for property lost by the individual applicants . ”
land claim cause of friction the land claim has been a source of friction between the two countries , with polish politicians accusing the group of germans of trying to reverse the outcome of world war ii .
while berlin never viewed any validity in the claim , it was unable to forbid the lawsuit , a position german foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier confirmed upon hearing the ruling .
german foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier welcomed the ruling , saying it confirmed berlin 's own position that there were no outstanding property issues from the second world war between the two nations . dw staff -lrb- ls -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the decision was welcomed by the leaders of both countries . the european court of human rights rejected thursday a land claim by ethnic germans who lost homes in poland during the second world war , a decision welcomed by leaders of both countries whose ties have soured over the issue .
the claim was filed by a private company , the prussian claims society , representing 23 germans .
it accused poland of violating the rights of germans who were expelled from their pre-war homes when borders were redrawn in 1945 at the end of the war . judges : poland ca n't be held accountable judges at the european court of human rights in strasbourg however ruled that modern poland bears no responsibility for the expulsion of ethnic germans by the soviets after october 19 , 1994 because it had no governmental control of the land . the court also said it had no jurisdiction to rule on the issue because the expulsion of the germans from their polish homes took place before either country had signed the european convention on human rights .
according to the court , poland thus has no obligation “ to enact laws providing for rehabilitation , restitution of confiscated property or compensation for property lost by the individual applicants . ”
land claim cause of friction the land claim has been a source of friction between the two countries , with polish politicians accusing the group of germans of trying to reverse the outcome of world war ii .
while berlin never viewed any validity in the claim , it was unable to forbid the lawsuit , a position german foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier confirmed upon hearing the ruling .
german foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier welcomed the ruling , saying it confirmed berlin 's own position that there were no outstanding property issues from the second world war between the two nations . dw staff -lrb- ls -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de climate -pipe- 10.10.2008 scientist warns climate change happening faster than predicted großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : scientists warn sea levels are rising faster than predicted global warming calculations have been too optimistic and global sea levels are likely to rise a full meter this century , senior german scientists have warned .
they say un-backed data on climate change is out of date . " we should prepare for a rise of sea levels of one meter this century , " said joachim schellnhuber , head of the potsdam institute for climate impact research -lrb- pik -rrb- , which advises the german government on environmental policy .
the melting rates of glaciers in the himalayas and the greenland ice-sheet have doubled or even tripled in recent years , due partly to increased greenhouse gas emissions by chinese power stations , he said .
his findings used data which was unavailable to the intergovernmental panel on climate change -lrb- ipcc -rrb- when it compiled its most recent global warming report .
in february 2007 , in the first volume of a landmark report , the nobel prize-winning ipcc predicted the oceans would rise by between 18 and 59 centimeters by 2100 .
the umbrella effect bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the earth is hurtling toward a warmer age at a quickening pace , say scientists further causes for concern include a drop in the amount of dirt particles in the air that protect from sunlight .
schellnhuber warned that cleaning air in beijing and in other large cities suffering from pollution problems by limiting car and power-plant emissions may raise global temperatures instead of lowering them .
aerosols , or particles suspended in air , have a cooling effect on the earth , countering global warming linked to carbon dioxide , said schellnhuber , explaining that a drop in aerosols in the atmosphere could cause a rapid rise in temperatures .
airborne pollutants act as an umbrella worldwide while co2 provides insulation , trapping heat attempting to escape into the atmosphere .
a rise in temperature because of declines in aerosols in the atmosphere can be offset by slashing co2 emissions , he said .
by not reducing carbon output , humanity " is closing the last door we have through which we can possibly influence the global climate , " schellnhuber warned .
urgent need for action bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : carbon emissions must be cut back - now the scientist stressed that there is what he called a 50-50 chance of limiting the global temperature rise to 2 degrees celsius -lrb- 3.6 degrees fahrenheit -rrb- before 2100 , which would avert the worst damage of climate change - so long as plans fleshed out by the g8 countries to reduce emissions are realized .
the united nations-sponsored climate-change talks this december in poznan , poland , and next year in copenhagen must reach an agreement to limit co2 , he added .
" there is really no time to spare , " schellnhuber said in an interview with bloomberg .
" technology will play a decisive role in limiting carbon but we have to move to a carbon-free world by the end of the century . "
german environment minister sigmar gabriel -lrb- spd -rrb- has warned that environmental issues risk being neglected because of the global financial crisis .
" we can spend relatively little money now or vast sums in decades to come , " he was quoted as saying in zeit online .
" we are wealthy enough to afford climate protection - and we are too badly-off to ignore it . " dw staff -lrb- jp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?
dw-world.de sociologist : climate change is a chance to work together climate change offers europe a chance to change the way the world solves problems by drawing in poorer countries , says sociologist ulrich beck in an exclusive essay for dw-world.de. -lrb- 22.07.2008 -rrb- environmentalists slam g8 's emissions deal as meaningless as g8 leaders trumpeted their landmark deal to cut global emissions by 50 per cent by 2050 , the ' 50/50 ' agreement , which has yet to be sealed , was quickly lambasted by environmentalists as virtually meaningless .

the melting rates of glaciers in the himalayas and the greenland ice-sheet have doubled or even tripled in recent years , due partly to increased greenhouse gas emissions by chinese power stations , he said .
his findings used data which was unavailable to the intergovernmental panel on climate change -lrb- ipcc -rrb- when it compiled its most recent global warming report .
in february 2007 , in the first volume of a landmark report , the nobel prize-winning ipcc predicted the oceans would rise by between 18 and 59 centimeters by 2100 .
the umbrella effect bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the earth is hurtling toward a warmer age at a quickening pace , say scientists further causes for concern include a drop in the amount of dirt particles in the air that protect from sunlight .
schellnhuber warned that cleaning air in beijing and in other large cities suffering from pollution problems by limiting car and power-plant emissions may raise global temperatures instead of lowering them .
aerosols , or particles suspended in air , have a cooling effect on the earth , countering global warming linked to carbon dioxide , said schellnhuber , explaining that a drop in aerosols in the atmosphere could cause a rapid rise in temperatures .
airborne pollutants act as an umbrella worldwide while co2 provides insulation , trapping heat attempting to escape into the atmosphere .
a rise in temperature because of declines in aerosols in the atmosphere can be offset by slashing co2 emissions , he said .
by not reducing carbon output , humanity " is closing the last door we have through which we can possibly influence the global climate , " schellnhuber warned .
urgent need for action bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : carbon emissions must be cut back - now the scientist stressed that there is what he called a 50-50 chance of limiting the global temperature rise to 2 degrees celsius -lrb- 3.6 degrees fahrenheit -rrb- before 2100 , which would avert the worst damage of climate change - so long as plans fleshed out by the g8 countries to reduce emissions are realized .
the united nations-sponsored climate-change talks this december in poznan , poland , and next year in copenhagen must reach an agreement to limit co2 , he added .
" there is really no time to spare , " schellnhuber said in an interview with bloomberg .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de climate -pipe- 10.10.2008 scientist warns climate change happening faster than predicted großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : scientists warn sea levels are rising faster than predicted global warming calculations have been too optimistic and global sea levels are likely to rise a full meter this century , senior german scientists have warned .
they say un-backed data on climate change is out of date . " we should prepare for a rise of sea levels of one meter this century , " said joachim schellnhuber , head of the potsdam institute for climate impact research -lrb- pik -rrb- , which advises the german government on environmental policy .
the melting rates of glaciers in the himalayas and the greenland ice-sheet have doubled or even tripled in recent years , due partly to increased greenhouse gas emissions by chinese power stations , he said .
his findings used data which was unavailable to the intergovernmental panel on climate change -lrb- ipcc -rrb- when it compiled its most recent global warming report .
in february 2007 , in the first volume of a landmark report , the nobel prize-winning ipcc predicted the oceans would rise by between 18 and 59 centimeters by 2100 .
the umbrella effect bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the earth is hurtling toward a warmer age at a quickening pace , say scientists further causes for concern include a drop in the amount of dirt particles in the air that protect from sunlight .
schellnhuber warned that cleaning air in beijing and in other large cities suffering from pollution problems by limiting car and power-plant emissions may raise global temperatures instead of lowering them .
aerosols , or particles suspended in air , have a cooling effect on the earth , countering global warming linked to carbon dioxide , said schellnhuber , explaining that a drop in aerosols in the atmosphere could cause a rapid rise in temperatures .
airborne pollutants act as an umbrella worldwide while co2 provides insulation , trapping heat attempting to escape into the atmosphere .
a rise in temperature because of declines in aerosols in the atmosphere can be offset by slashing co2 emissions , he said .
by not reducing carbon output , humanity " is closing the last door we have through which we can possibly influence the global climate , " schellnhuber warned .
urgent need for action bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : carbon emissions must be cut back - now the scientist stressed that there is what he called a 50-50 chance of limiting the global temperature rise to 2 degrees celsius -lrb- 3.6 degrees fahrenheit -rrb- before 2100 , which would avert the worst damage of climate change - so long as plans fleshed out by the g8 countries to reduce emissions are realized .
the united nations-sponsored climate-change talks this december in poznan , poland , and next year in copenhagen must reach an agreement to limit co2 , he added .
" there is really no time to spare , " schellnhuber said in an interview with bloomberg .
" technology will play a decisive role in limiting carbon but we have to move to a carbon-free world by the end of the century . "
german environment minister sigmar gabriel -lrb- spd -rrb- has warned that environmental issues risk being neglected because of the global financial crisis .
" we can spend relatively little money now or vast sums in decades to come , " he was quoted as saying in zeit online .
" we are wealthy enough to afford climate protection - and we are too badly-off to ignore it . " dw staff -lrb- jp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?
dw-world.de sociologist : climate change is a chance to work together climate change offers europe a chance to change the way the world solves problems by drawing in poorer countries , says sociologist ulrich beck in an exclusive essay for dw-world.de. -lrb- 22.07.2008 -rrb- environmentalists slam g8 's emissions deal as meaningless as g8 leaders trumpeted their landmark deal to cut global emissions by 50 per cent by 2050 , the ' 50/50 ' agreement , which has yet to be sealed , was quickly lambasted by environmentalists as virtually meaningless .
-lrb- 08.07.2008 -rrb- opinion : climate conference is a lesson in irresponsibility combating global warming was the stated focus of the major economies meeting in paris on april 17 and 18 , but according to dw 's helle jeppesen , the conference did n't deserve the designation " climate conference .

his breakthrough as a mediator came in namibia , which achieved independence in 1990 , capping years of work by the finnish national who served as special representative to the united nations secretary general and head of the un 's transition assistance team .
ahtisaari and his wife , eeva , were made honorary citizens of the southern african nation .
formative years ahtisaari has said his interest in peace mediation can be traced to his childhood years .
he was born on june 23 , 1937 in viipuri , a city that finland had to secede to the soviet union during the second world war , forcing 400,000 finns from karelia to relocate to finland .
the experience of being displaced fuelled his interest to promote peace and " help others , " he has said .
a second major achievement was the august 2005 peace deal between indonesia and the separatist free aceh movement -lrb- gam -rrb- aimed at ending a decades-long conflict in the indonesian province , and forged in the wake of the devastation caused by the december 2004 tsunami .
he has said mediation is " an ' art ' rather than an established practice , " adding that each conflict needs to be treated as a separate case .
mediation efforts ahtisaari 's hopes for the 2006 peace prize were dashed as the nobel committee selected muhammad yunus of bangladesh who founded the grameen bank that offers loans to the poor .
after qualifying as a teacher in 1959 , ahtisaari joined the foreign ministry in 1965 .
he served as ambassador to tanzania and held top posts in the foreign ministry and later in the un .
after his term as president 1994-2000 during which finland joined the european union , ahtisaari formed the crisis management initiative -lrb- cmi -rrb- that has been engaged in various mediation efforts .
while in office in 1999 , ahtisaari along with former russian prime minister viktor chernomyrdin and former us deputy secretary of state strobe talbott hammered out a plan to resolve the kosovo crisis that then-yugoslav president slobodan milosevic could accept .
accolades in 2000 he was called in to inspect irish republican army -lrb- ira -rrb- arms caches in northern ireland and later served as un special envoy for the horn of africa .
in recent years , ahtisaari has been engaged in discussing the future of the eu including turkey 's possible membership .
almost three years ago , in november 2005 , he was named special un envoy to kosovo but his efforts to bridge the divisions over kosovo 's status were unsuccessful and he stepped down after presenting his recommendations in february 2008 .
he has won numerous awards including the un cultural organization unesco 's felix houphouet-boigny peace prize for 2008 , named after the late president of ivory coast , as well as several honorary doctorates .
the funds from the unesco award were to be used for a foundation to promote peace , mediation and help post-conflict societies .
crowning glory the nobel , which is worth 10 million kronor -lrb- $ 1.5 million -rrb- , will be handed over at a ceremony in oslo on december 10 .
in 2007 , the peace prize was shared by the united nations climate body , the intergovernmental panel on climate change -lrb- ipcc -rrb- and al gore of the united states for their work on climate change .
for this year 's award , the five-member nobel committee had received 197 nominations for the coveted award including 33 organizations . dpa news agency -lrb- jp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

his breakthrough as a mediator came in namibia , which achieved independence in 1990 , capping years of work by the finnish national who served as special representative to the united nations secretary general and head of the un 's transition assistance team .
ahtisaari and his wife , eeva , were made honorary citizens of the southern african nation .
formative years ahtisaari has said his interest in peace mediation can be traced to his childhood years .
he was born on june 23 , 1937 in viipuri , a city that finland had to secede to the soviet union during the second world war , forcing 400,000 finns from karelia to relocate to finland .
the experience of being displaced fuelled his interest to promote peace and " help others , " he has said .
a second major achievement was the august 2005 peace deal between indonesia and the separatist free aceh movement -lrb- gam -rrb- aimed at ending a decades-long conflict in the indonesian province , and forged in the wake of the devastation caused by the december 2004 tsunami .
he has said mediation is " an ' art ' rather than an established practice , " adding that each conflict needs to be treated as a separate case .
mediation efforts ahtisaari 's hopes for the 2006 peace prize were dashed as the nobel committee selected muhammad yunus of bangladesh who founded the grameen bank that offers loans to the poor .
after qualifying as a teacher in 1959 , ahtisaari joined the foreign ministry in 1965 .
he served as ambassador to tanzania and held top posts in the foreign ministry and later in the un .
after his term as president 1994-2000 during which finland joined the european union , ahtisaari formed the crisis management initiative -lrb- cmi -rrb- that has been engaged in various mediation efforts .
while in office in 1999 , ahtisaari along with former russian prime minister viktor chernomyrdin and former us deputy secretary of state strobe talbott hammered out a plan to resolve the kosovo crisis that then-yugoslav president slobodan milosevic could accept .
accolades in 2000 he was called in to inspect irish republican army -lrb- ira -rrb- arms caches in northern ireland and later served as un special envoy for the horn of africa .
in recent years , ahtisaari has been engaged in discussing the future of the eu including turkey 's possible membership .
almost three years ago , in november 2005 , he was named special un envoy to kosovo but his efforts to bridge the divisions over kosovo 's status were unsuccessful and he stepped down after presenting his recommendations in february 2008 .
he has won numerous awards including the un cultural organization unesco 's felix houphouet-boigny peace prize for 2008 , named after the late president of ivory coast , as well as several honorary doctorates .
the funds from the unesco award were to be used for a foundation to promote peace , mediation and help post-conflict societies .
crowning glory the nobel , which is worth 10 million kronor -lrb- $ 1.5 million -rrb- , will be handed over at a ceremony in oslo on december 10 .
in 2007 , the peace prize was shared by the united nations climate body , the intergovernmental panel on climate change -lrb- ipcc -rrb- and al gore of the united states for their work on climate change .
for this year 's award , the five-member nobel committee had received 197 nominations for the coveted award including 33 organizations . dpa news agency -lrb- jp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ? 9798 radio news listen to world headlines from the top of the hour .

" there is a formal agreement between the nato nations to fight drug trafficking , " a diplomat confirmed as defense ministers met in the hungarian capital budapest for a two-day meeting to discuss issues ranging from the war in afghanistan to georgia 's nato membership bid and piracy off the somali coast .
nato spokesman james appathurai said the alliance 's international security assistance force -lrb- isaf -rrb- would " act in concert with the afghans , against facilities and facilitators supporting the insurgency . "
the isaf currently has 50,700 soldiers in afghanistan , up from about 45,000 six months ago .
the german parliament agreed tuesday , oct .
7 to increase its contribution by 1,000 soldiers , raising its total to 4,500 .
us lobbies for afghan drug action sources also said that nato 's anti-narcotics efforts would be temporary , and would be open only to those countries willing to participate .
us defense secretary robert gates had pitched hard at the meeting for nato to strike at the heart of the afghan opium trade , which is believed to have contributed substantially to a reinvigorated taliban insurgency aimed at destabilizing president hamid karzai 's government .
" it -lrb- the opium trade -rrb- is not only corrosive to good governance , it also directly funds the people that are killing afghans , americans and all our coalition partners , " gates said in budapest on thursday .
the deal followed a request from afghan defense minister abdel rahim wardak , who on thursday asked nato to help his government target drug laboratories and seize imports of the chemicals needed to turn opium into heroin .
" we have asked nato to support our efforts to destroy the laboratories and to interdict the chemical precursors which are coming from outside the country , " wardak said .
germany in favor of afghan-led operations nato military commanders agreed that more needed to be done to fight the opium and heroin trade , a view shared by most alliance members .
the taliban are thought to be pocketing up to $ 80 million a year from the afghan narcotics industry , which is the source of some 92 percent of the world 's opium and heroin .
germany , spain , greece , poland , romania and italy had expressed scepticism over the plans , saying the fight against the afghan drugs trade was not part of nato 's mandate and should be addressed by the afghans themselves .
german defence minister franz josef jung said thursday germany was willing to assist in reconnaissance of trafficking routes and in training but any operations should be afghan-led .
" if this keeps an afghan face then it 's also in our interest that we support such an activity , " he told reporters on thursday .
ministers also worried that bombing laboratories would kill civilians and undermine the alliance 's popularity among ordinary afghans .
the compromise reached friday is to be reviewed when defense ministers meet again in poland in february . dw staff -lrb- dfm -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" there is a formal agreement between the nato nations to fight drug trafficking , " a diplomat confirmed as defense ministers met in the hungarian capital budapest for a two-day meeting to discuss issues ranging from the war in afghanistan to georgia 's nato membership bid and piracy off the somali coast .
nato spokesman james appathurai said the alliance 's international security assistance force -lrb- isaf -rrb- would " act in concert with the afghans , against facilities and facilitators supporting the insurgency . "
the isaf currently has 50,700 soldiers in afghanistan , up from about 45,000 six months ago .
the german parliament agreed tuesday , oct .
7 to increase its contribution by 1,000 soldiers , raising its total to 4,500 .
us lobbies for afghan drug action sources also said that nato 's anti-narcotics efforts would be temporary , and would be open only to those countries willing to participate .
us defense secretary robert gates had pitched hard at the meeting for nato to strike at the heart of the afghan opium trade , which is believed to have contributed substantially to a reinvigorated taliban insurgency aimed at destabilizing president hamid karzai 's government .
" it -lrb- the opium trade -rrb- is not only corrosive to good governance , it also directly funds the people that are killing afghans , americans and all our coalition partners , " gates said in budapest on thursday .
the deal followed a request from afghan defense minister abdel rahim wardak , who on thursday asked nato to help his government target drug laboratories and seize imports of the chemicals needed to turn opium into heroin .
" we have asked nato to support our efforts to destroy the laboratories and to interdict the chemical precursors which are coming from outside the country , " wardak said .
germany in favor of afghan-led operations nato military commanders agreed that more needed to be done to fight the opium and heroin trade , a view shared by most alliance members .
the taliban are thought to be pocketing up to $ 80 million a year from the afghan narcotics industry , which is the source of some 92 percent of the world 's opium and heroin .
germany , spain , greece , poland , romania and italy had expressed scepticism over the plans , saying the fight against the afghan drugs trade was not part of nato 's mandate and should be addressed by the afghans themselves .
german defence minister franz josef jung said thursday germany was willing to assist in reconnaissance of trafficking routes and in training but any operations should be afghan-led .
" if this keeps an afghan face then it 's also in our interest that we support such an activity , " he told reporters on thursday .
ministers also worried that bombing laboratories would kill civilians and undermine the alliance 's popularity among ordinary afghans .
the compromise reached friday is to be reviewed when defense ministers meet again in poland in february . dw staff -lrb- dfm -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" there is a formal agreement between the nato nations to fight drug trafficking , " a diplomat confirmed as defense ministers met in the hungarian capital budapest for a two-day meeting to discuss issues ranging from the war in afghanistan to georgia 's nato membership bid and piracy off the somali coast .
nato spokesman james appathurai said the alliance 's international security assistance force -lrb- isaf -rrb- would " act in concert with the afghans , against facilities and facilitators supporting the insurgency . "
the isaf currently has 50,700 soldiers in afghanistan , up from about 45,000 six months ago .
the german parliament agreed tuesday , oct .
7 to increase its contribution by 1,000 soldiers , raising its total to 4,500 .
us lobbies for afghan drug action sources also said that nato 's anti-narcotics efforts would be temporary , and would be open only to those countries willing to participate .
us defense secretary robert gates had pitched hard at the meeting for nato to strike at the heart of the afghan opium trade , which is believed to have contributed substantially to a reinvigorated taliban insurgency aimed at destabilizing president hamid karzai 's government .
" it -lrb- the opium trade -rrb- is not only corrosive to good governance , it also directly funds the people that are killing afghans , americans and all our coalition partners , " gates said in budapest on thursday .
the deal followed a request from afghan defense minister abdel rahim wardak , who on thursday asked nato to help his government target drug laboratories and seize imports of the chemicals needed to turn opium into heroin .
" we have asked nato to support our efforts to destroy the laboratories and to interdict the chemical precursors which are coming from outside the country , " wardak said .
germany in favor of afghan-led operations nato military commanders agreed that more needed to be done to fight the opium and heroin trade , a view shared by most alliance members .
the taliban are thought to be pocketing up to $ 80 million a year from the afghan narcotics industry , which is the source of some 92 percent of the world 's opium and heroin .
germany , spain , greece , poland , romania and italy had expressed scepticism over the plans , saying the fight against the afghan drugs trade was not part of nato 's mandate and should be addressed by the afghans themselves .
german defence minister franz josef jung said thursday germany was willing to assist in reconnaissance of trafficking routes and in training but any operations should be afghan-led .
" if this keeps an afghan face then it 's also in our interest that we support such an activity , " he told reporters on thursday .
ministers also worried that bombing laboratories would kill civilians and undermine the alliance 's popularity among ordinary afghans .
the compromise reached friday is to be reviewed when defense ministers meet again in poland in february . dw staff -lrb- dfm -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

10 to consider resuming high-level talks with russia , after moscow withdrew its troops from buffer zones in georgia . " if russia respects the six-point plan , and this appears to be the case , then we should resume dialogue with russia , " he told reporters at informal nato defense talks in the hungarian capital budapest .
" that means the nato-russia council should resume its work , " he said .
the western alliance froze such high level talks with russia in september , insisting that it could not do " business as usual " following moscow 's military operation in georgia .
russia sent troops into the former soviet republic in early august , after georgia tried to recover its breakaway region of south ossetia which , along with rebel abkhazia , moscow has since recognized as independent .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : jung urged nato to reach out to russia jung said he would like to see a " perspective " for the meetings to resume surface during the next round of talks with his nato counterparts , which is scheduled for february in cracow , poland .
the european union , whose french presidency brokered the six-point russia-georgia ceasefire agreement , is the institution which must decide whether moscow is respecting the accord .
but the bloc remained divided friday over whether that was the case , even after it appeared that russia had withdrawn its forces from the two buffer zones in line with the agreement .
russia sent troops into the former soviet republic in early august , amid a dispute over the breakaway region of south ossetia which , along with rebel abkhazia , moscow has since recognized as independent .
russian forces were still controlling two areas under georgian control prior to the conflict , the akhalgori district in south ossetia and the kodori gorge in abkhazia .
tbilisi insists the russians must leave the two areas to fully comply .
georgian efforts to become part of nato have infuriated russia , which objects to the prospect of its old cold war foe extending to its borders .
russian president dmitry medvedev has even accused nato of provoking the georgia conflict .

" it is encouraging that russia seems to withdrawing its forces back to the pre-conflict lines , " scheffer told reporters , after a first ever meeting of the nato-georgia commission at ministerial level .
" but we are not in a situation where we go back to business as usual , " he said .
" it seems premature now to conclude that there will be a nato-russia council meeting in krakow , " scheffer said .

" there are clearly things that are going to have to be discussed , " he said , and warned : " we need to make sure that we do n't create a risky environment . "
scheffer said that the ministers did not discuss georgia 's nato aspirations , and that the topic would be taken up by alliance foreign ministers when they meet in brussels in december .
georgia 's military needs and reform efforts were addressed , but he insisted that nato would not supply tbilisi with any weapons as the nato chief spoke , french foreign minister bernard kouchner , whose country holds the european union 's rotating presidency , announced that russia had withdrawn from georgian buffer zones but " a long road " lay ahead to resolve other issues .

alliance agrees to target afghan drug lords bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : afghanistan 's opium trade will become a nato target in other developments at the meeting in budapest , nato defense ministers agreed to target drugs traffickers and opium laboratories in afghanistan as part of the alliance 's efforts to undermine the taliban insurgency .
but under a compromise hammered out in budapest , member states participating in nato 's international security assistance force -lrb- isaf -rrb- in afghanistan will be free to opt in or out of any anti-narcotics operations .
nato secretary general jaap de hoop scheffer said ministers had agreed that the " isaf can , in concert with afghan authorities , act against facilities or facilitators supporting the insurgency . "
however , any action would be " subject to the authorization of specific nations , " the nato chief said .
that was a concession to countries like germany , spain and italy , who argue that the fight against drugs should be left to the afghan police .
these countries had also expressed concern that any nato raids on laboratories would kill civilians and undermine the alliance 's popularity among ordinary afghans .
in an effort to address such reservations , ministers also agreed to ensure that civilian casualties be minimized , and that the anti-narcotics fight be conducted mainly in the southern provinces of afghanistan , where cultivations and the insurgency both thrive .
jung said he was " very satisfied with the compromise " and added that the deal would allow german soldiers to " continue to support the training of the afghan security forces " and to limit its role to providing assistance to afghan-led operations through logistical , intelligence and medical support .
opium proceeds funding taliban resurgeance bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the taliban is being funded by the drugs trade nato officials said the plan was " consistent with the appropriate un security council resolutions " and with the isaf 's existing operational plan .
friday 's compromise would be reviewed in february , when defense ministers next meet in poland .
the deal clinched in budapest follows a specific request from afghan defense minister abdel rahim wardak , who on thursday had asked his nato colleagues to help his government target drugs laboratories and seize imports of the chemicals that are needed to turn opium into heroin .
" we have asked nato to support our efforts to destroy the laboratories and to interdict the chemical precursors which are coming from outside the country , " wardak said .
nato military commanders acknowledge that more needs to be done to fight the opium and heroin trade .
us defense secretary robert gates believes that the taliban pocket between 60 and 80 million dollars per year from the sale of drugs .
" it is not only corrosive to good governance , it also directly funds the people that are killing afghans , americans and all our coalition partners , " gates said in budapest on thursday .

however , british soccer is holding its breath as the credit crunch starts to bite in its top flight . hoeness was quoted in friday 's edition of the bild newspaper as saying that german soccer is well off even though income may drop .
" i believe that german soccer has less to worry than other countries , " said hoeness .
" the big question , however , is if we are moving into a recession where the advertising spending drops and companies are less inclined to pay money for sponsorship . "
the german 1974 world cup winner said that he was concerned for clubs in some other countries .
" here and there clubs could go under , but not the big ones .
chelsea , for instance , has its debts with abramovich , but they are not in danger because the club belongs to him .
there is no bank involved that can close the club , as long as abramovich does not demand his money back , " hoeness said .
" one needs to see if the ice on which everything was built will last . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : we 're in the money : bayern and hoeness are confident hoeness said that it was not certain that foreign investors in english soccer would continue investing such huge sums after losing a lot of money on the stock exchange .
" it would be good for competition if clubs in future actually had to earn the money they spent , " said hoeness .
he said that he was not concerned about his own club bayern munich , as they were financially " in a very strong position . "
meanwhile british soccer is holding its breath to see just how badly it will be affected by the collapse of many of the world 's banks and the ever-worsening financial crisis .
british game suffering backlash once regarded in britain as the people 's game , the sport is now in danger of being torn apart , with several teams ' sponsors already having gone down the pan .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : man utd 's sponsor aig had to be bailed out in the us manchester united shirt sponsor aig was bailed out by the us government , as was newcastle united 's shirt sponsor , northern rock , by the british government .

the overseas investment that had been looked upon as the ideal blueprint by many of the country 's top clubs is now in danger of becoming the poisoned chalice .
what good is investment , many clubs are asking themselves , if it ca n't be guaranteed ?
perhaps the one club most affected so far is west ham united , the east london club for whom the collapse this week of iceland 's second biggest bank , landsbanki , could yet spell disaster for their icelandic owners and for their own future .
rumors persist that the bank - now under the control of the iceland government - could repatriate any overseas assets .
icelandic troubles felt in london 's east end for that , read west ham and their chairman bjorgolfur gudmundsson , who paid 85 million pounds for the club in november 2006 but who may yet be forced to put up the for-sale sign .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : gudmundsson 's west ham is reeling from the icelandic crunch gudmundsson , who was sacked as chairman of the bank on tuesday , has stressed that the club is safe and claims that no players have to be sold .
but west ham vice-chairman asgeir fridgeirsson said on tuesday that players would have to go before any spending could happen in the january transfer window .
" west ham united has one of the biggest squads in the premier league , " fridgeirsson said on tuesday .
" it is very unlikely -lrb- the chairman -rrb- will be willing to put in more money to buy players this january window . "
when he took over as manager in september , gianfranco zola had seemed confident that he would have money to spend in january .
west ham told the dpa news agency on wednesday that zola has yet to request a meeting with the club 's board and nor has one been arranged , but it would seem to be only a matter of time before the italian requests clarification of the situation .
in a statement , placed on the club 's official website on tuesday , west ham chief executive scott duxbury reiterated that players would have to be sold before any new spending could be sanctioned .
" since his appointment , gianfranco zola has made it quite clear that his first team squad is too large and needs to be reduced so he can effectively coach the team , " the statement read .
" once this has happened and if the manager requires further players , then the club will acquire them . "
hammers hammered by credit crunch the collapse of landsbanki followed hot on the heels of the implosion of their shirt sponsor , the tour operator xl , which went bust in september .
that cost the club an estimated 5 million pounds , and with gudmundsson a guarantor of 163 million pounds to xl , west ham 's future looks less than rosy .
the west ham story is just one sorry tale and if the crisis deepens , others could yet be affected in a similar way .
bildunterschrift : the lse has been hit hard and british clubs have shuddered with the resulting tremors the football association chairman lord triesman warned on tuesday that the crisis could cripple some club who are heavily in debt , estimating that english clubs owe a total of 3 billion pounds .
and uefa general secretary david taylor has warned that clubs with huge debt could be excluded from future european competitions would see those clubs finances further depleted .
the biggest worry for west ham is that the crisis may not yet have reached its lowest point and fridgeirsson 's words had a nasty ring to them on tuesday .
" it is , of course , a blow for -lrb- gudmundsson -rrb- and his financial strength , but he himself has a number of other investments that are doing quite well at the moment so there is no reason to fear that he will not honor his commitment to west ham football club , " he said .
" he -lrb- gudmundsson -rrb- is not absolutely sure how this will directly affect him , but one thing he is sure of is that this will have no implications on the other investments of him and his family . "

bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : gudmundsson 's west ham is reeling from the icelandic crunch gudmundsson , who was sacked as chairman of the bank on tuesday , has stressed that the club is safe and claims that no players have to be sold .
but west ham vice-chairman asgeir fridgeirsson said on tuesday that players would have to go before any spending could happen in the january transfer window .
" west ham united has one of the biggest squads in the premier league , " fridgeirsson said on tuesday .
" it is very unlikely -lrb- the chairman -rrb- will be willing to put in more money to buy players this january window . "
when he took over as manager in september , gianfranco zola had seemed confident that he would have money to spend in january .
west ham told the dpa news agency on wednesday that zola has yet to request a meeting with the club 's board and nor has one been arranged , but it would seem to be only a matter of time before the italian requests clarification of the situation .
in a statement , placed on the club 's official website on tuesday , west ham chief executive scott duxbury reiterated that players would have to be sold before any new spending could be sanctioned .
" since his appointment , gianfranco zola has made it quite clear that his first team squad is too large and needs to be reduced so he can effectively coach the team , " the statement read .
" once this has happened and if the manager requires further players , then the club will acquire them . "
hammers hammered by credit crunch the collapse of landsbanki followed hot on the heels of the implosion of their shirt sponsor , the tour operator xl , which went bust in september .
that cost the club an estimated 5 million pounds , and with gudmundsson a guarantor of 163 million pounds to xl , west ham 's future looks less than rosy .
the west ham story is just one sorry tale and if the crisis deepens , others could yet be affected in a similar way .
bildunterschrift : the lse has been hit hard and british clubs have shuddered with the resulting tremors the football association chairman lord triesman warned on tuesday that the crisis could cripple some club who are heavily in debt , estimating that english clubs owe a total of 3 billion pounds .
and uefa general secretary david taylor has warned that clubs with huge debt could be excluded from future european competitions would see those clubs finances further depleted .
the biggest worry for west ham is that the crisis may not yet have reached its lowest point and fridgeirsson 's words had a nasty ring to them on tuesday .
" it is , of course , a blow for -lrb- gudmundsson -rrb- and his financial strength , but he himself has a number of other investments that are doing quite well at the moment so there is no reason to fear that he will not honor his commitment to west ham football club , " he said .
" he -lrb- gudmundsson -rrb- is not absolutely sure how this will directly affect him , but one thing he is sure of is that this will have no implications on the other investments of him and his family . "

as the stock market crash worsened , finance minister peer steinbrueck said , " the downward spiral has gathered pace .
case by case answers are not going to help any more , even in germany . "
" the financial sector as a whole requires a solution of a stabilizing character , " he added .
axel weber , president of the german bundesbank and a senior board member of the european central bank , said it was a possibility to inject capital into banks temporarily as britain had done .
there was no alternative but to act , said weber .
so far , germany has only had to guarantee a single , 50-billion- euro -lrb- $ 70-billion -rrb- bail-out for a mortgage lender , hypo real estate , and it has been refusing to contribute to a joint eu bail-out for other banks .

" considering the crisis the international financial system is going through , it 's necessary to take really effective measures to protect markets and ensure their future stability , " medvedev said thursday , praising the example of european union cooperation in the face of financial crisis .
" we need such coordination if we want to stay competitive and overcome the consequences of the financial crisis with minimal losses , " he told journalists alongside the summit host , kyrgyz president kurmanbek bakiyev .
the nine presidents to attend the commonwealth of independent states -lrb- cis -rrb- meeting jointly called for common economic goals among members and cooperation in combating drug trafficking .
but the summit raised more questions about the group 's relevance than it answered , with high levels of presidential absenteeism at the closing news conference .
presidents in attendance throughout the summit included those of armenia , belarus , kazakhstan , kyrgyzstan , moldova , russia , tajikistan , turkmenistan and uzbekistan .
georgia formally withdrew from the cis after it was invaded by russia in august .
also absent were ukrainian president viktor yushchenko , an ally of georgia , and azerbaijani president ilham aliyev , whose country 's oil exports were disrupted by the war .

at the post-summit press conference , medvedev told reports that russia was fully complying with an eu-brokered ceasefire to the conflict that called for a return of military personnel to pre-war positions .
" everything that depended on us we 've done .
all the obligations we undertook ... we have fulfilled , " he said .
but georgia 's foreign minister eka tkeshelashvili said friday that russia had not fully respected the terms of the ceasefire and warned against a return to normal relations with moscow .

the russian leader insisted , however , that emerging nations be included in the talks .

" considering the crisis the international financial system is going through , it 's necessary to take really effective measures to protect markets and ensure their future stability , " medvedev said thursday , praising the example of european union cooperation in the face of financial crisis .

at the post-summit press conference , medvedev told reports that russia was fully complying with an eu-brokered ceasefire to the conflict that called for a return of military personnel to pre-war positions .
" everything that depended on us we 've done .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de soccer -pipe- 10.10.2008 bundesliga can survive crunch , says hoeness , as uk wobbles großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some leagues are better protected than others from the effects of the financial crisis bayern munich general manager uli hoeness sees the german bundesliga holding firm against the global economic crisis .
however , british soccer is holding its breath as the credit crunch starts to bite in its top flight . hoeness was quoted in friday 's edition of the bild newspaper as saying that german soccer is well off even though income may drop .
" i believe that german soccer has less to worry than other countries , " said hoeness .
" the big question , however , is if we are moving into a recession where the advertising spending drops and companies are less inclined to pay money for sponsorship . "
the german 1974 world cup winner said that he was concerned for clubs in some other countries .
" here and there clubs could go under , but not the big ones .
chelsea , for instance , has its debts with abramovich , but they are not in danger because the club belongs to him .
there is no bank involved that can close the club , as long as abramovich does not demand his money back , " hoeness said .
" one needs to see if the ice on which everything was built will last . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : we 're in the money : bayern and hoeness are confident hoeness said that it was not certain that foreign investors in english soccer would continue investing such huge sums after losing a lot of money on the stock exchange .
" it would be good for competition if clubs in future actually had to earn the money they spent , " said hoeness .
he said that he was not concerned about his own club bayern munich , as they were financially " in a very strong position . "
meanwhile british soccer is holding its breath to see just how badly it will be affected by the collapse of many of the world 's banks and the ever-worsening financial crisis .
british game suffering backlash once regarded in britain as the people 's game , the sport is now in danger of being torn apart , with several teams ' sponsors already having gone down the pan .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : man utd 's sponsor aig had to be bailed out in the us manchester united shirt sponsor aig was bailed out by the us government , as was newcastle united 's shirt sponsor , northern rock , by the british government .
work on liverpool 's new ground has been delayed as owners keep a close eye on exactly what is happening to their cash .
the overseas investment that had been looked upon as the ideal blueprint by many of the country 's top clubs is now in danger of becoming the poisoned chalice .
what good is investment , many clubs are asking themselves , if it ca n't be guaranteed ?
perhaps the one club most affected so far is west ham united , the east london club for whom the collapse this week of iceland 's second biggest bank , landsbanki , could yet spell disaster for their icelandic owners and for their own future .
rumors persist that the bank - now under the control of the iceland government - could repatriate any overseas assets .
icelandic troubles felt in london 's east end for that , read west ham and their chairman bjorgolfur gudmundsson , who paid 85 million pounds for the club in november 2006 but who may yet be forced to put up the for-sale sign .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : gudmundsson 's west ham is reeling from the icelandic crunch gudmundsson , who was sacked as chairman of the bank on tuesday , has stressed that the club is safe and claims that no players have to be sold .
but west ham vice-chairman asgeir fridgeirsson said on tuesday that players would have to go before any spending could happen in the january transfer window .
" west ham united has one of the biggest squads in the premier league , " fridgeirsson said on tuesday .
" it is very unlikely -lrb- the chairman -rrb- will be willing to put in more money to buy players this january window . "
when he took over as manager in september , gianfranco zola had seemed confident that he would have money to spend in january .
west ham told the dpa news agency on wednesday that zola has yet to request a meeting with the club 's board and nor has one been arranged , but it would seem to be only a matter of time before the italian requests clarification of the situation .
in a statement , placed on the club 's official website on tuesday , west ham chief executive scott duxbury reiterated that players would have to be sold before any new spending could be sanctioned .
" since his appointment , gianfranco zola has made it quite clear that his first team squad is too large and needs to be reduced so he can effectively coach the team , " the statement read .
" once this has happened and if the manager requires further players , then the club will acquire them . "
hammers hammered by credit crunch the collapse of landsbanki followed hot on the heels of the implosion of their shirt sponsor , the tour operator xl , which went bust in september .
that cost the club an estimated 5 million pounds , and with gudmundsson a guarantor of 163 million pounds to xl , west ham 's future looks less than rosy .
the west ham story is just one sorry tale and if the crisis deepens , others could yet be affected in a similar way .
bildunterschrift : the lse has been hit hard and british clubs have shuddered with the resulting tremors the football association chairman lord triesman warned on tuesday that the crisis could cripple some club who are heavily in debt , estimating that english clubs owe a total of 3 billion pounds .
and uefa general secretary david taylor has warned that clubs with huge debt could be excluded from future european competitions would see those clubs finances further depleted .

however , british soccer is holding its breath as the credit crunch starts to bite in its top flight . hoeness was quoted in friday 's edition of the bild newspaper as saying that german soccer is well off even though income may drop .
" i believe that german soccer has less to worry than other countries , " said hoeness .
" the big question , however , is if we are moving into a recession where the advertising spending drops and companies are less inclined to pay money for sponsorship . "
the german 1974 world cup winner said that he was concerned for clubs in some other countries .
" here and there clubs could go under , but not the big ones .
chelsea , for instance , has its debts with abramovich , but they are not in danger because the club belongs to him .
there is no bank involved that can close the club , as long as abramovich does not demand his money back , " hoeness said .
" one needs to see if the ice on which everything was built will last . "

" it would be good for competition if clubs in future actually had to earn the money they spent , " said hoeness .
he said that he was not concerned about his own club bayern munich , as they were financially " in a very strong position . "
meanwhile british soccer is holding its breath to see just how badly it will be affected by the collapse of many of the world 's banks and the ever-worsening financial crisis .
british game suffering backlash once regarded in britain as the people 's game , the sport is now in danger of being torn apart , with several teams ' sponsors already having gone down the pan .

perhaps the one club most affected so far is west ham united , the east london club for whom the collapse this week of iceland 's second biggest bank , landsbanki , could yet spell disaster for their icelandic owners and for their own future .
rumors persist that the bank - now under the control of the iceland government - could repatriate any overseas assets .
icelandic troubles felt in london 's east end for that , read west ham and their chairman bjorgolfur gudmundsson , who paid 85 million pounds for the club in november 2006 but who may yet be forced to put up the for-sale sign .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : gudmundsson 's west ham is reeling from the icelandic crunch gudmundsson , who was sacked as chairman of the bank on tuesday , has stressed that the club is safe and claims that no players have to be sold .

" west ham united has one of the biggest squads in the premier league , " fridgeirsson said on tuesday .
" it is very unlikely -lrb- the chairman -rrb- will be willing to put in more money to buy players this january window . "
when he took over as manager in september , gianfranco zola had seemed confident that he would have money to spend in january .
west ham told the dpa news agency on wednesday that zola has yet to request a meeting with the club 's board and nor has one been arranged , but it would seem to be only a matter of time before the italian requests clarification of the situation .
in a statement , placed on the club 's official website on tuesday , west ham chief executive scott duxbury reiterated that players would have to be sold before any new spending could be sanctioned .
" since his appointment , gianfranco zola has made it quite clear that his first team squad is too large and needs to be reduced so he can effectively coach the team , " the statement read .
" once this has happened and if the manager requires further players , then the club will acquire them . "
hammers hammered by credit crunch the collapse of landsbanki followed hot on the heels of the implosion of their shirt sponsor , the tour operator xl , which went bust in september .
that cost the club an estimated 5 million pounds , and with gudmundsson a guarantor of 163 million pounds to xl , west ham 's future looks less than rosy .

" considering the crisis the international financial system is going through , it 's necessary to take really effective measures to protect markets and ensure their future stability , " medvedev said thursday , praising the example of european union cooperation in the face of financial crisis .
" we need such coordination if we want to stay competitive and overcome the consequences of the financial crisis with minimal losses , " he told journalists alongside the summit host , kyrgyz president kurmanbek bakiyev .
the nine presidents to attend the commonwealth of independent states -lrb- cis -rrb- meeting jointly called for common economic goals among members and cooperation in combating drug trafficking .
but the summit raised more questions about the group 's relevance than it answered , with high levels of presidential absenteeism at the closing news conference .

but under a compromise hammered out in budapest , member states participating in nato 's international security assistance force -lrb- isaf -rrb- in afghanistan will be free to opt in or out of any anti-narcotics operations .
nato secretary general jaap de hoop scheffer said ministers had agreed that the " isaf can , in concert with afghan authorities , act against facilities or facilitators supporting the insurgency . "
however , any action would be " subject to the authorization of specific nations , " the nato chief said .
that was a concession to countries like germany , spain and italy , who argue that the fight against drugs should be left to the afghan police .
these countries had also expressed concern that any nato raids on laboratories would kill civilians and undermine the alliance 's popularity among ordinary afghans .
in an effort to address such reservations , ministers also agreed to ensure that civilian casualties be minimized , and that the anti-narcotics fight be conducted mainly in the southern provinces of afghanistan , where cultivations and the insurgency both thrive .
jung said he was " very satisfied with the compromise " and added that the deal would allow german soldiers to " continue to support the training of the afghan security forces " and to limit its role to providing assistance to afghan-led operations through logistical , intelligence and medical support .

" we have asked nato to support our efforts to destroy the laboratories and to interdict the chemical precursors which are coming from outside the country , " wardak said .
nato military commanders acknowledge that more needs to be done to fight the opium and heroin trade .

10 to consider resuming high-level talks with russia , after moscow withdrew its troops from buffer zones in georgia . " if russia respects the six-point plan , and this appears to be the case , then we should resume dialogue with russia , " he told reporters at informal nato defense talks in the hungarian capital budapest .
" that means the nato-russia council should resume its work , " he said .
the western alliance froze such high level talks with russia in september , insisting that it could not do " business as usual " following moscow 's military operation in georgia .
russia sent troops into the former soviet republic in early august , after georgia tried to recover its breakaway region of south ossetia which , along with rebel abkhazia , moscow has since recognized as independent .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : jung urged nato to reach out to russia jung said he would like to see a " perspective " for the meetings to resume surface during the next round of talks with his nato counterparts , which is scheduled for february in cracow , poland .
the european union , whose french presidency brokered the six-point russia-georgia ceasefire agreement , is the institution which must decide whether moscow is respecting the accord .
but the bloc remained divided friday over whether that was the case , even after it appeared that russia had withdrawn its forces from the two buffer zones in line with the agreement .
russia sent troops into the former soviet republic in early august , amid a dispute over the breakaway region of south ossetia which , along with rebel abkhazia , moscow has since recognized as independent .
russian forces were still controlling two areas under georgian control prior to the conflict , the akhalgori district in south ossetia and the kodori gorge in abkhazia .
tbilisi insists the russians must leave the two areas to fully comply .
georgian efforts to become part of nato have infuriated russia , which objects to the prospect of its old cold war foe extending to its borders .
russian president dmitry medvedev has even accused nato of provoking the georgia conflict .
nato chief rules out high level talks bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : still no business as usual for nato 's de hoop scheffer nato secretary general jaap de hoop scheffer ruled out resuming high-level talks with russia after the alliance froze the meetings last month insisting that it could not do " business as usual with russia " since its attack on georgia in august .
" it is encouraging that russia seems to withdrawing its forces back to the pre-conflict lines , " scheffer told reporters , after a first ever meeting of the nato-georgia commission at ministerial level .
" but we are not in a situation where we go back to business as usual , " he said .
" it seems premature now to conclude that there will be a nato-russia council meeting in krakow , " scheffer said .
" that requires a discussion .
we are not at that stage yet . " "
us backs nato line on russian relations bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : it 's still too early to talk to russia , says the united states a senior official from the united states , which has staunchly backed georgia since the start , also agreed that it was too early to change nato 's approach , as russia still had to leave outstanding areas .
" there are clearly things that are going to have to be discussed , " he said , and warned : " we need to make sure that we do n't create a risky environment . "
scheffer said that the ministers did not discuss georgia 's nato aspirations , and that the topic would be taken up by alliance foreign ministers when they meet in brussels in december .
georgia 's military needs and reform efforts were addressed , but he insisted that nato would not supply tbilisi with any weapons as the nato chief spoke , french foreign minister bernard kouchner , whose country holds the european union 's rotating presidency , announced that russia had withdrawn from georgian buffer zones but " a long road " lay ahead to resolve other issues .
the european union , whose french presidency brokered the six-point russia-georgia ceasefire agreement , is the institution which must decide whether moscow is respecting the accord .
alliance agrees to target afghan drug lords bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : afghanistan 's opium trade will become a nato target in other developments at the meeting in budapest , nato defense ministers agreed to target drugs traffickers and opium laboratories in afghanistan as part of the alliance 's efforts to undermine the taliban insurgency .
but under a compromise hammered out in budapest , member states participating in nato 's international security assistance force -lrb- isaf -rrb- in afghanistan will be free to opt in or out of any anti-narcotics operations .
nato secretary general jaap de hoop scheffer said ministers had agreed that the " isaf can , in concert with afghan authorities , act against facilities or facilitators supporting the insurgency . "
however , any action would be " subject to the authorization of specific nations , " the nato chief said .
that was a concession to countries like germany , spain and italy , who argue that the fight against drugs should be left to the afghan police .
these countries had also expressed concern that any nato raids on laboratories would kill civilians and undermine the alliance 's popularity among ordinary afghans .
in an effort to address such reservations , ministers also agreed to ensure that civilian casualties be minimized , and that the anti-narcotics fight be conducted mainly in the southern provinces of afghanistan , where cultivations and the insurgency both thrive .
jung said he was " very satisfied with the compromise " and added that the deal would allow german soldiers to " continue to support the training of the afghan security forces " and to limit its role to providing assistance to afghan-led operations through logistical , intelligence and medical support .
opium proceeds funding taliban resurgeance bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the taliban is being funded by the drugs trade nato officials said the plan was " consistent with the appropriate un security council resolutions " and with the isaf 's existing operational plan .
friday 's compromise would be reviewed in february , when defense ministers next meet in poland .
the deal clinched in budapest follows a specific request from afghan defense minister abdel rahim wardak , who on thursday had asked his nato colleagues to help his government target drugs laboratories and seize imports of the chemicals that are needed to turn opium into heroin .
" we have asked nato to support our efforts to destroy the laboratories and to interdict the chemical precursors which are coming from outside the country , " wardak said .
nato military commanders acknowledge that more needs to be done to fight the opium and heroin trade .
us defense secretary robert gates believes that the taliban pocket between 60 and 80 million dollars per year from the sale of drugs .
" it is not only corrosive to good governance , it also directly funds the people that are killing afghans , americans and all our coalition partners , " gates said in budapest on thursday .

they say un-backed data on climate change is out of date . " we should prepare for a rise of sea levels of one meter this century , " said joachim schellnhuber , head of the potsdam institute for climate impact research -lrb- pik -rrb- , which advises the german government on environmental policy .
the melting rates of glaciers in the himalayas and the greenland ice-sheet have doubled or even tripled in recent years , due partly to increased greenhouse gas emissions by chinese power stations , he said .
his findings used data which was unavailable to the intergovernmental panel on climate change -lrb- ipcc -rrb- when it compiled its most recent global warming report .
in february 2007 , in the first volume of a landmark report , the nobel prize-winning ipcc predicted the oceans would rise by between 18 and 59 centimeters by 2100 .
the umbrella effect bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the earth is hurtling toward a warmer age at a quickening pace , say scientists further causes for concern include a drop in the amount of dirt particles in the air that protect from sunlight .
schellnhuber warned that cleaning air in beijing and in other large cities suffering from pollution problems by limiting car and power-plant emissions may raise global temperatures instead of lowering them .
aerosols , or particles suspended in air , have a cooling effect on the earth , countering global warming linked to carbon dioxide , said schellnhuber , explaining that a drop in aerosols in the atmosphere could cause a rapid rise in temperatures .
airborne pollutants act as an umbrella worldwide while co2 provides insulation , trapping heat attempting to escape into the atmosphere .
a rise in temperature because of declines in aerosols in the atmosphere can be offset by slashing co2 emissions , he said .
by not reducing carbon output , humanity " is closing the last door we have through which we can possibly influence the global climate , " schellnhuber warned .
urgent need for action bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : carbon emissions must be cut back - now the scientist stressed that there is what he called a 50-50 chance of limiting the global temperature rise to 2 degrees celsius -lrb- 3.6 degrees fahrenheit -rrb- before 2100 , which would avert the worst damage of climate change - so long as plans fleshed out by the g8 countries to reduce emissions are realized .
the united nations-sponsored climate-change talks this december in poznan , poland , and next year in copenhagen must reach an agreement to limit co2 , he added .
" there is really no time to spare , " schellnhuber said in an interview with bloomberg .
" technology will play a decisive role in limiting carbon but we have to move to a carbon-free world by the end of the century . "
german environment minister sigmar gabriel -lrb- spd -rrb- has warned that environmental issues risk being neglected because of the global financial crisis .

benedict concluded his homily by inviting believers to pray for the beatification of pius .
a declaration of attained blessedness , beatification is the third in the four steps towards earning roman catholic sainthood .
the pope however stopped short on elaborating on whether the vatican has sainthood in store for pius .
holocaust heroics ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some jews praise pius , others condemn him bendict 's commemoration of pius has revived the long-standing debate surrounding the italian-born pope 's role in sheltering jews from the horrors of the holocaust .
while some jews maintain that pius did not intervene enough , pope benedict stated that pius made great efforts to help the jews , albeit his actions were secretive in their nature so as to not provoke the nazis and worsen the situation .
" he often acted in a secret and silent way precisely because , given the real situations of that complex moment in history , he realized that only in this manner could the worst be avoided and the greatest number of jews be saved , " benedict said .
to underline the efforts pius made , in his homily benedict quoted a tribute made when pius died by then israeli foreign minister golda meir saying : " when fearful martyrdom came to our people in the decade of nazi terror , the voice of the pope was raised for the victims . "
rabbi denounces pope 's efforts bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : rabbi cohen said pius did n't do enough to save the jews but on monday , oct .
6 , rabbi shear-yushuv cohen , who became the first jew to address a synod of bishops at the vatican , denounced pius for not coming to the rescue of the jews .
" we remember those religious leaders who did not raise their voice to save our brethren .
we can not forgive and forget , " shear-yashuv cohen said in his address .
he also separately told reporters that pius " should not be seen as a model and he should not be beatified because he did not raise his voice against the holocaust . "
on tuesday , a senior cardinal at the vatican defended pius ' wartime record , reports afp .
in the vatican newspaper , secretary of state tarcisio bertone wrote that if pius xii " had intervened publicly , he would have endangered the lives of thousands of jews who , at his request , were hidden in the 155 convents and monasteries in the city of rome alone . "
pope needs a miracle in his prayers , benedict hoped the process leading to pius ' beatification " can proceed happily . "
in order to be canonized , convincing evidence that pius xii performed a miracle must be provided . dw staff -lrb- ls -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?
dw-world.de will the vatican 's secret archives shed light on pius xii ?
critics accuse pope pius xii of keeping quiet about the holocaust .

benedict concluded his homily by inviting believers to pray for the beatification of pius .
a declaration of attained blessedness , beatification is the third in the four steps towards earning roman catholic sainthood .
the pope however stopped short on elaborating on whether the vatican has sainthood in store for pius .
holocaust heroics ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some jews praise pius , others condemn him bendict 's commemoration of pius has revived the long-standing debate surrounding the italian-born pope 's role in sheltering jews from the horrors of the holocaust .
while some jews maintain that pius did not intervene enough , pope benedict stated that pius made great efforts to help the jews , albeit his actions were secretive in their nature so as to not provoke the nazis and worsen the situation .
" he often acted in a secret and silent way precisely because , given the real situations of that complex moment in history , he realized that only in this manner could the worst be avoided and the greatest number of jews be saved , " benedict said .
to underline the efforts pius made , in his homily benedict quoted a tribute made when pius died by then israeli foreign minister golda meir saying : " when fearful martyrdom came to our people in the decade of nazi terror , the voice of the pope was raised for the victims . "
rabbi denounces pope 's efforts bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : rabbi cohen said pius did n't do enough to save the jews but on monday , oct .
6 , rabbi shear-yushuv cohen , who became the first jew to address a synod of bishops at the vatican , denounced pius for not coming to the rescue of the jews .
" we remember those religious leaders who did not raise their voice to save our brethren .
we can not forgive and forget , " shear-yashuv cohen said in his address .
he also separately told reporters that pius " should not be seen as a model and he should not be beatified because he did not raise his voice against the holocaust . "
on tuesday , a senior cardinal at the vatican defended pius ' wartime record , reports afp .
in the vatican newspaper , secretary of state tarcisio bertone wrote that if pius xii " had intervened publicly , he would have endangered the lives of thousands of jews who , at his request , were hidden in the 155 convents and monasteries in the city of rome alone . "
pope needs a miracle in his prayers , benedict hoped the process leading to pius ' beatification " can proceed happily . "
in order to be canonized , convincing evidence that pius xii performed a miracle must be provided . dw staff -lrb- ls -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

they say un-backed data on climate change is out of date . " we should prepare for a rise of sea levels of one meter this century , " said joachim schellnhuber , head of the potsdam institute for climate impact research -lrb- pik -rrb- , which advises the german government on environmental policy .
the melting rates of glaciers in the himalayas and the greenland ice-sheet have doubled or even tripled in recent years , due partly to increased greenhouse gas emissions by chinese power stations , he said .
his findings used data which was unavailable to the intergovernmental panel on climate change -lrb- ipcc -rrb- when it compiled its most recent global warming report .
in february 2007 , in the first volume of a landmark report , the nobel prize-winning ipcc predicted the oceans would rise by between 18 and 59 centimeters by 2100 .
the umbrella effect bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the earth is hurtling toward a warmer age at a quickening pace , say scientists further causes for concern include a drop in the amount of dirt particles in the air that protect from sunlight .
schellnhuber warned that cleaning air in beijing and in other large cities suffering from pollution problems by limiting car and power-plant emissions may raise global temperatures instead of lowering them .
aerosols , or particles suspended in air , have a cooling effect on the earth , countering global warming linked to carbon dioxide , said schellnhuber , explaining that a drop in aerosols in the atmosphere could cause a rapid rise in temperatures .
airborne pollutants act as an umbrella worldwide while co2 provides insulation , trapping heat attempting to escape into the atmosphere .
a rise in temperature because of declines in aerosols in the atmosphere can be offset by slashing co2 emissions , he said .
by not reducing carbon output , humanity " is closing the last door we have through which we can possibly influence the global climate , " schellnhuber warned .
urgent need for action bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : carbon emissions must be cut back - now the scientist stressed that there is what he called a 50-50 chance of limiting the global temperature rise to 2 degrees celsius -lrb- 3.6 degrees fahrenheit -rrb- before 2100 , which would avert the worst damage of climate change - so long as plans fleshed out by the g8 countries to reduce emissions are realized .
the united nations-sponsored climate-change talks this december in poznan , poland , and next year in copenhagen must reach an agreement to limit co2 , he added .
" there is really no time to spare , " schellnhuber said in an interview with bloomberg .
" technology will play a decisive role in limiting carbon but we have to move to a carbon-free world by the end of the century . "
german environment minister sigmar gabriel -lrb- spd -rrb- has warned that environmental issues risk being neglected because of the global financial crisis .

the decision was welcomed by the leaders of both countries . the european court of human rights rejected thursday a land claim by ethnic germans who lost homes in poland during the second world war , a decision welcomed by leaders of both countries whose ties have soured over the issue .
the claim was filed by a private company , the prussian claims society , representing 23 germans .
it accused poland of violating the rights of germans who were expelled from their pre-war homes when borders were redrawn in 1945 at the end of the war . judges : poland ca n't be held accountable judges at the european court of human rights in strasbourg however ruled that modern poland bears no responsibility for the expulsion of ethnic germans by the soviets after october 19 , 1994 because it had no governmental control of the land . the court also said it had no jurisdiction to rule on the issue because the expulsion of the germans from their polish homes took place before either country had signed the european convention on human rights .

10 to consider resuming high-level talks with russia , after moscow withdrew its troops from buffer zones in georgia . " if russia respects the six-point plan , and this appears to be the case , then we should resume dialogue with russia , " he told reporters at informal nato defense talks in the hungarian capital budapest .
" that means the nato-russia council should resume its work , " he said .
the western alliance froze such high level talks with russia in september , insisting that it could not do " business as usual " following moscow 's military operation in georgia .
russia sent troops into the former soviet republic in early august , after georgia tried to recover its breakaway region of south ossetia which , along with rebel abkhazia , moscow has since recognized as independent .

russia sent troops into the former soviet republic in early august , amid a dispute over the breakaway region of south ossetia which , along with rebel abkhazia , moscow has since recognized as independent .
russian forces were still controlling two areas under georgian control prior to the conflict , the akhalgori district in south ossetia and the kodori gorge in abkhazia .
tbilisi insists the russians must leave the two areas to fully comply .
georgian efforts to become part of nato have infuriated russia , which objects to the prospect of its old cold war foe extending to its borders .
russian president dmitry medvedev has even accused nato of provoking the georgia conflict .
nato chief rules out high level talks bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : still no business as usual for nato 's de hoop scheffer nato secretary general jaap de hoop scheffer ruled out resuming high-level talks with russia after the alliance froze the meetings last month insisting that it could not do " business as usual with russia " since its attack on georgia in august .
" it is encouraging that russia seems to withdrawing its forces back to the pre-conflict lines , " scheffer told reporters , after a first ever meeting of the nato-georgia commission at ministerial level .
" but we are not in a situation where we go back to business as usual , " he said .
" it seems premature now to conclude that there will be a nato-russia council meeting in krakow , " scheffer said .
" that requires a discussion .
we are not at that stage yet . " "
us backs nato line on russian relations bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : it 's still too early to talk to russia , says the united states a senior official from the united states , which has staunchly backed georgia since the start , also agreed that it was too early to change nato 's approach , as russia still had to leave outstanding areas .
" there are clearly things that are going to have to be discussed , " he said , and warned : " we need to make sure that we do n't create a risky environment . "
scheffer said that the ministers did not discuss georgia 's nato aspirations , and that the topic would be taken up by alliance foreign ministers when they meet in brussels in december .
georgia 's military needs and reform efforts were addressed , but he insisted that nato would not supply tbilisi with any weapons as the nato chief spoke , french foreign minister bernard kouchner , whose country holds the european union 's rotating presidency , announced that russia had withdrawn from georgian buffer zones but " a long road " lay ahead to resolve other issues .

alliance agrees to target afghan drug lords bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : afghanistan 's opium trade will become a nato target in other developments at the meeting in budapest , nato defense ministers agreed to target drugs traffickers and opium laboratories in afghanistan as part of the alliance 's efforts to undermine the taliban insurgency .
but under a compromise hammered out in budapest , member states participating in nato 's international security assistance force -lrb- isaf -rrb- in afghanistan will be free to opt in or out of any anti-narcotics operations .
nato secretary general jaap de hoop scheffer said ministers had agreed that the " isaf can , in concert with afghan authorities , act against facilities or facilitators supporting the insurgency . "
however , any action would be " subject to the authorization of specific nations , " the nato chief said .
that was a concession to countries like germany , spain and italy , who argue that the fight against drugs should be left to the afghan police .
these countries had also expressed concern that any nato raids on laboratories would kill civilians and undermine the alliance 's popularity among ordinary afghans .
in an effort to address such reservations , ministers also agreed to ensure that civilian casualties be minimized , and that the anti-narcotics fight be conducted mainly in the southern provinces of afghanistan , where cultivations and the insurgency both thrive .
jung said he was " very satisfied with the compromise " and added that the deal would allow german soldiers to " continue to support the training of the afghan security forces " and to limit its role to providing assistance to afghan-led operations through logistical , intelligence and medical support .
opium proceeds funding taliban resurgeance bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the taliban is being funded by the drugs trade nato officials said the plan was " consistent with the appropriate un security council resolutions " and with the isaf 's existing operational plan .
friday 's compromise would be reviewed in february , when defense ministers next meet in poland .
the deal clinched in budapest follows a specific request from afghan defense minister abdel rahim wardak , who on thursday had asked his nato colleagues to help his government target drugs laboratories and seize imports of the chemicals that are needed to turn opium into heroin .
" we have asked nato to support our efforts to destroy the laboratories and to interdict the chemical precursors which are coming from outside the country , " wardak said .
nato military commanders acknowledge that more needs to be done to fight the opium and heroin trade .
us defense secretary robert gates believes that the taliban pocket between 60 and 80 million dollars per year from the sale of drugs .
" it is not only corrosive to good governance , it also directly funds the people that are killing afghans , americans and all our coalition partners , " gates said in budapest on thursday .

russia sent troops into the former soviet republic in early august , after georgia tried to recover its breakaway region of south ossetia which , along with rebel abkhazia , moscow has since recognized as independent .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : jung urged nato to reach out to russia jung said he would like to see a " perspective " for the meetings to resume surface during the next round of talks with his nato counterparts , which is scheduled for february in cracow , poland .
the european union , whose french presidency brokered the six-point russia-georgia ceasefire agreement , is the institution which must decide whether moscow is respecting the accord .
but the bloc remained divided friday over whether that was the case , even after it appeared that russia had withdrawn its forces from the two buffer zones in line with the agreement .
russia sent troops into the former soviet republic in early august , amid a dispute over the breakaway region of south ossetia which , along with rebel abkhazia , moscow has since recognized as independent .
russian forces were still controlling two areas under georgian control prior to the conflict , the akhalgori district in south ossetia and the kodori gorge in abkhazia .
tbilisi insists the russians must leave the two areas to fully comply .
georgian efforts to become part of nato have infuriated russia , which objects to the prospect of its old cold war foe extending to its borders .
russian president dmitry medvedev has even accused nato of provoking the georgia conflict .
nato chief rules out high level talks bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : still no business as usual for nato 's de hoop scheffer nato secretary general jaap de hoop scheffer ruled out resuming high-level talks with russia after the alliance froze the meetings last month insisting that it could not do " business as usual with russia " since its attack on georgia in august .
" it is encouraging that russia seems to withdrawing its forces back to the pre-conflict lines , " scheffer told reporters , after a first ever meeting of the nato-georgia commission at ministerial level .
" but we are not in a situation where we go back to business as usual , " he said .
" it seems premature now to conclude that there will be a nato-russia council meeting in krakow , " scheffer said .
" that requires a discussion .
we are not at that stage yet . " "
us backs nato line on russian relations bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : it 's still too early to talk to russia , says the united states a senior official from the united states , which has staunchly backed georgia since the start , also agreed that it was too early to change nato 's approach , as russia still had to leave outstanding areas .
" there are clearly things that are going to have to be discussed , " he said , and warned : " we need to make sure that we do n't create a risky environment . "
scheffer said that the ministers did not discuss georgia 's nato aspirations , and that the topic would be taken up by alliance foreign ministers when they meet in brussels in december .
georgia 's military needs and reform efforts were addressed , but he insisted that nato would not supply tbilisi with any weapons as the nato chief spoke , french foreign minister bernard kouchner , whose country holds the european union 's rotating presidency , announced that russia had withdrawn from georgian buffer zones but " a long road " lay ahead to resolve other issues .
the european union , whose french presidency brokered the six-point russia-georgia ceasefire agreement , is the institution which must decide whether moscow is respecting the accord .
alliance agrees to target afghan drug lords bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : afghanistan 's opium trade will become a nato target in other developments at the meeting in budapest , nato defense ministers agreed to target drugs traffickers and opium laboratories in afghanistan as part of the alliance 's efforts to undermine the taliban insurgency .
but under a compromise hammered out in budapest , member states participating in nato 's international security assistance force -lrb- isaf -rrb- in afghanistan will be free to opt in or out of any anti-narcotics operations .
nato secretary general jaap de hoop scheffer said ministers had agreed that the " isaf can , in concert with afghan authorities , act against facilities or facilitators supporting the insurgency . "
however , any action would be " subject to the authorization of specific nations , " the nato chief said .
that was a concession to countries like germany , spain and italy , who argue that the fight against drugs should be left to the afghan police .
these countries had also expressed concern that any nato raids on laboratories would kill civilians and undermine the alliance 's popularity among ordinary afghans .
in an effort to address such reservations , ministers also agreed to ensure that civilian casualties be minimized , and that the anti-narcotics fight be conducted mainly in the southern provinces of afghanistan , where cultivations and the insurgency both thrive .
jung said he was " very satisfied with the compromise " and added that the deal would allow german soldiers to " continue to support the training of the afghan security forces " and to limit its role to providing assistance to afghan-led operations through logistical , intelligence and medical support .
opium proceeds funding taliban resurgeance bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the taliban is being funded by the drugs trade nato officials said the plan was " consistent with the appropriate un security council resolutions " and with the isaf 's existing operational plan .
friday 's compromise would be reviewed in february , when defense ministers next meet in poland .
the deal clinched in budapest follows a specific request from afghan defense minister abdel rahim wardak , who on thursday had asked his nato colleagues to help his government target drugs laboratories and seize imports of the chemicals that are needed to turn opium into heroin .
" we have asked nato to support our efforts to destroy the laboratories and to interdict the chemical precursors which are coming from outside the country , " wardak said .
nato military commanders acknowledge that more needs to be done to fight the opium and heroin trade .
us defense secretary robert gates believes that the taliban pocket between 60 and 80 million dollars per year from the sale of drugs .
" it is not only corrosive to good governance , it also directly funds the people that are killing afghans , americans and all our coalition partners , " gates said in budapest on thursday .
poppy cultivations have fallen by 19 per cent since last year , but afghan heroin still accounts for more than 90 per cent of the heroin circulating in europe . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the directory , which telekom maintains had been stolen , had contained the private numbers of high-profile politicians and celebrities , as well as customer mobile phone numbers , addresses , dates of birth and , in some cases , email addresses .
bank information or credit card numbers were not accessed , said the bonn-based firm .
in germany , most wireless-line numbers are ex-directory and confidential .
telekom chief executive rene obermann said at the company 's head office in bonn that in future , the company would voluntarily brief the public on a dedicated web site about " critical data-privacy incidents " undergoing criminal investigation .
" in the race against data theft , we want to be at least one step ahead at all times , " he said .
a seventh board department will be set up to deal with privacy and the company will issue data privacy reports every six months .
the former german telecommunications industry monopolizer is also to stop using an internet-style system where any computer can be used to query its databanks using the right password .
employees and sales partners will only be able to access sensitive systems from specific computers .
saturday 's revelation was not telekom 's first brush with data scandals .

" considering the crisis the international financial system is going through , it 's necessary to take really effective measures to protect markets and ensure their future stability , " medvedev said thursday , praising the example of european union cooperation in the face of financial crisis .
" we need such coordination if we want to stay competitive and overcome the consequences of the financial crisis with minimal losses , " he told journalists alongside the summit host , kyrgyz president kurmanbek bakiyev .
the nine presidents to attend the commonwealth of independent states -lrb- cis -rrb- meeting jointly called for common economic goals among members and cooperation in combating drug trafficking .
but the summit raised more questions about the group 's relevance than it answered , with high levels of presidential absenteeism at the closing news conference .
presidents in attendance throughout the summit included those of armenia , belarus , kazakhstan , kyrgyzstan , moldova , russia , tajikistan , turkmenistan and uzbekistan .
georgia formally withdrew from the cis after it was invaded by russia in august .
also absent were ukrainian president viktor yushchenko , an ally of georgia , and azerbaijani president ilham aliyev , whose country 's oil exports were disrupted by the war .
georgia bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : georgia 's president mikhail saakashvili pulled georgia out of the cis in august the absence of the three west-oriented leaders highlighted what russian newspapers referred to as a weakening kremlin grip on its former sphere of influence , made worse by august 's caucasus war in which russian troops surged into georgia in aid of two rebel regions there - south ossetia and abkhazia , which the kremlin went on to recognize as independent states .
at the post-summit press conference , medvedev told reports that russia was fully complying with an eu-brokered ceasefire to the conflict that called for a return of military personnel to pre-war positions .
" everything that depended on us we 've done .
all the obligations we undertook ... we have fulfilled , " he said .
but georgia 's foreign minister eka tkeshelashvili said friday that russia had not fully respected the terms of the ceasefire and warned against a return to normal relations with moscow .

the russian leader insisted , however , that emerging nations be included in the talks .
" it 's necessary to include other key economies that define the financial climate in the world - china , india , brazil , mexico , south africa , " he said . dw staff -lrb- dfm -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" there is a formal agreement between the nato nations to fight drug trafficking , " a diplomat confirmed as defense ministers met in the hungarian capital budapest for a two-day meeting to discuss issues ranging from the war in afghanistan to georgia 's nato membership bid and piracy off the somali coast .
nato spokesman james appathurai said the alliance 's international security assistance force -lrb- isaf -rrb- would " act in concert with the afghans , against facilities and facilitators supporting the insurgency . "
the isaf currently has 50,700 soldiers in afghanistan , up from about 45,000 six months ago .
the german parliament agreed tuesday , oct .
7 to increase its contribution by 1,000 soldiers , raising its total to 4,500 .
us lobbies for afghan drug action sources also said that nato 's anti-narcotics efforts would be temporary , and would be open only to those countries willing to participate .
us defense secretary robert gates had pitched hard at the meeting for nato to strike at the heart of the afghan opium trade , which is believed to have contributed substantially to a reinvigorated taliban insurgency aimed at destabilizing president hamid karzai 's government .
" it -lrb- the opium trade -rrb- is not only corrosive to good governance , it also directly funds the people that are killing afghans , americans and all our coalition partners , " gates said in budapest on thursday .
the deal followed a request from afghan defense minister abdel rahim wardak , who on thursday asked nato to help his government target drug laboratories and seize imports of the chemicals needed to turn opium into heroin .
" we have asked nato to support our efforts to destroy the laboratories and to interdict the chemical precursors which are coming from outside the country , " wardak said .
germany in favor of afghan-led operations nato military commanders agreed that more needed to be done to fight the opium and heroin trade , a view shared by most alliance members .
the taliban are thought to be pocketing up to $ 80 million a year from the afghan narcotics industry , which is the source of some 92 percent of the world 's opium and heroin .
germany , spain , greece , poland , romania and italy had expressed scepticism over the plans , saying the fight against the afghan drugs trade was not part of nato 's mandate and should be addressed by the afghans themselves .
german defence minister franz josef jung said thursday germany was willing to assist in reconnaissance of trafficking routes and in training but any operations should be afghan-led .
" if this keeps an afghan face then it 's also in our interest that we support such an activity , " he told reporters on thursday .

the directory , which telekom maintains had been stolen , had contained the private numbers of high-profile politicians and celebrities , as well as customer mobile phone numbers , addresses , dates of birth and , in some cases , email addresses .
bank information or credit card numbers were not accessed , said the bonn-based firm .
in germany , most wireless-line numbers are ex-directory and confidential .
telekom chief executive rene obermann said at the company 's head office in bonn that in future , the company would voluntarily brief the public on a dedicated web site about " critical data-privacy incidents " undergoing criminal investigation .
" in the race against data theft , we want to be at least one step ahead at all times , " he said .
a seventh board department will be set up to deal with privacy and the company will issue data privacy reports every six months .
the former german telecommunications industry monopolizer is also to stop using an internet-style system where any computer can be used to query its databanks using the right password .
employees and sales partners will only be able to access sensitive systems from specific computers .
saturday 's revelation was not telekom 's first brush with data scandals .
earlier this year , the firm admitted that calls between journalists and board members had been illegally monitored in 2005 and 2006 . dw staff -lrb- dfm -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" if russia respects the six-point plan , and this appears to be the case , then we should resume dialogue with russia , " he told reporters at informal nato defense talks in the hungarian capital budapest .
" that means the nato-russia council should resume its work , " he said .
the western alliance froze such high level talks with russia in september , insisting that it could not do " business as usual " following moscow 's military operation in georgia .
russia sent troops into the former soviet republic in early august , after georgia tried to recover its breakaway region of south ossetia which , along with rebel abkhazia , moscow has since recognized as independent .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : jung urged nato to reach out to russia jung said he would like to see a " perspective " for the meetings to resume surface during the next round of talks with his nato counterparts , which is scheduled for february in cracow , poland .
the european union , whose french presidency brokered the six-point russia-georgia ceasefire agreement , is the institution which must decide whether moscow is respecting the accord .
but the bloc remained divided friday over whether that was the case , even after it appeared that russia had withdrawn its forces from the two buffer zones in line with the agreement .
russia sent troops into the former soviet republic in early august , amid a dispute over the breakaway region of south ossetia which , along with rebel abkhazia , moscow has since recognized as independent .
russian forces were still controlling two areas under georgian control prior to the conflict , the akhalgori district in south ossetia and the kodori gorge in abkhazia .
tbilisi insists the russians must leave the two areas to fully comply .
georgian efforts to become part of nato have infuriated russia , which objects to the prospect of its old cold war foe extending to its borders .
russian president dmitry medvedev has even accused nato of provoking the georgia conflict .
nato chief rules out high level talks bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : still no business as usual for nato 's de hoop scheffer nato secretary general jaap de hoop scheffer ruled out resuming high-level talks with russia after the alliance froze the meetings last month insisting that it could not do " business as usual with russia " since its attack on georgia in august .
" it is encouraging that russia seems to withdrawing its forces back to the pre-conflict lines , " scheffer told reporters , after a first ever meeting of the nato-georgia commission at ministerial level .
" but we are not in a situation where we go back to business as usual , " he said .
" it seems premature now to conclude that there will be a nato-russia council meeting in krakow , " scheffer said .
" that requires a discussion .
we are not at that stage yet . " "
us backs nato line on russian relations bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : it 's still too early to talk to russia , says the united states a senior official from the united states , which has staunchly backed georgia since the start , also agreed that it was too early to change nato 's approach , as russia still had to leave outstanding areas .
" there are clearly things that are going to have to be discussed , " he said , and warned : " we need to make sure that we do n't create a risky environment . "
scheffer said that the ministers did not discuss georgia 's nato aspirations , and that the topic would be taken up by alliance foreign ministers when they meet in brussels in december .
georgia 's military needs and reform efforts were addressed , but he insisted that nato would not supply tbilisi with any weapons as the nato chief spoke , french foreign minister bernard kouchner , whose country holds the european union 's rotating presidency , announced that russia had withdrawn from georgian buffer zones but " a long road " lay ahead to resolve other issues .
the european union , whose french presidency brokered the six-point russia-georgia ceasefire agreement , is the institution which must decide whether moscow is respecting the accord .
alliance agrees to target afghan drug lords bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : afghanistan 's opium trade will become a nato target in other developments at the meeting in budapest , nato defense ministers agreed to target drugs traffickers and opium laboratories in afghanistan as part of the alliance 's efforts to undermine the taliban insurgency .
but under a compromise hammered out in budapest , member states participating in nato 's international security assistance force -lrb- isaf -rrb- in afghanistan will be free to opt in or out of any anti-narcotics operations .
nato secretary general jaap de hoop scheffer said ministers had agreed that the " isaf can , in concert with afghan authorities , act against facilities or facilitators supporting the insurgency . "
however , any action would be " subject to the authorization of specific nations , " the nato chief said .
that was a concession to countries like germany , spain and italy , who argue that the fight against drugs should be left to the afghan police .
these countries had also expressed concern that any nato raids on laboratories would kill civilians and undermine the alliance 's popularity among ordinary afghans .
in an effort to address such reservations , ministers also agreed to ensure that civilian casualties be minimized , and that the anti-narcotics fight be conducted mainly in the southern provinces of afghanistan , where cultivations and the insurgency both thrive .
jung said he was " very satisfied with the compromise " and added that the deal would allow german soldiers to " continue to support the training of the afghan security forces " and to limit its role to providing assistance to afghan-led operations through logistical , intelligence and medical support .
opium proceeds funding taliban resurgeance bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the taliban is being funded by the drugs trade nato officials said the plan was " consistent with the appropriate un security council resolutions " and with the isaf 's existing operational plan .
friday 's compromise would be reviewed in february , when defense ministers next meet in poland .
the deal clinched in budapest follows a specific request from afghan defense minister abdel rahim wardak , who on thursday had asked his nato colleagues to help his government target drugs laboratories and seize imports of the chemicals that are needed to turn opium into heroin .
" we have asked nato to support our efforts to destroy the laboratories and to interdict the chemical precursors which are coming from outside the country , " wardak said .
nato military commanders acknowledge that more needs to be done to fight the opium and heroin trade .
us defense secretary robert gates believes that the taliban pocket between 60 and 80 million dollars per year from the sale of drugs .
" it is not only corrosive to good governance , it also directly funds the people that are killing afghans , americans and all our coalition partners , " gates said in budapest on thursday .
poppy cultivations have fallen by 19 per cent since last year , but afghan heroin still accounts for more than 90 per cent of the heroin circulating in europe . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

10 that the us government was doing all it could to keep the world 's largest economy afloat ahead of a meeting with other g7 leaders in wasiungton . bush 's comments came as global stocks were in free-fall and ministers from the world 's richest nations prepared for a crucial meeting .
bush said a " startling " drop in us stocks in the last few days was being " driven by uncertainty and fear " and insisted the us already had all the tools necessary to resolve the financial crisis .
" this has been a deeply unsettling period for the american people , " bush acknowledged .
" we will continue to act to resolve this crisis and restore stability to our markets . "
us stocks have plummeted more than 10 percent in the last three days and continued falling on a wild trading day friday .
european stocks also tumbled , leading some countries to temporarily halt trading .
bush touts global cooperation bush said that international cooperation was key as finance ministers from the group of seven industrial nations were set to meet in washington .
" the world is sending an unmistakable signal : we 're in this together , we will come through this together , " bush said in a statement outside the white house .
the g7 bloc will also look to reassure the markets in a statement following its first meeting since the financial crisis broadened significantly last month , starting with the bankruptcy of us finance firm lehman brothers .
ministers could announce a joint commitment to intervene in their struggling banking industries .
ministers and central bank heads acknowledged cooperation was the only way forward in a crisis that has spread from the united states to europe and the rest of the world .

bush will meet with the g7 ministers on saturday , while treasury secretary henry paulson will also be hosting an emergency meeting of finance chiefs from the world 's 20 leading economies , in a sign of how far the crisis has spread .
dominique strauss-kahn , managing director of the international monetary fund , said thursday the world was on the " cusp " of a recession .
the imf and world bank also hold their annual meetings this weekend .
bush announced no new moves to ease the us credit crunch that has curbed the availability of loans to consumers and small businesses .
instead he cited the litany of us government interventions and powers already in play after congress last week passed a $ 700-billion rescue package that gives the treasury broad authority to intervene in the banking system .

" considering the crisis the international financial system is going through , it 's necessary to take really effective measures to protect markets and ensure their future stability , " medvedev said thursday , praising the example of european union cooperation in the face of financial crisis .

the nine presidents to attend the commonwealth of independent states -lrb- cis -rrb- meeting jointly called for common economic goals among members and cooperation in combating drug trafficking .

at the post-summit press conference , medvedev told reports that russia was fully complying with an eu-brokered ceasefire to the conflict that called for a return of military personnel to pre-war positions .
" everything that depended on us we 've done .
all the obligations we undertook ... we have fulfilled , " he said .

the decision was welcomed by the leaders of both countries . the european court of human rights rejected thursday a land claim by ethnic germans who lost homes in poland during the second world war , a decision welcomed by leaders of both countries whose ties have soured over the issue .
the claim was filed by a private company , the prussian claims society , representing 23 germans .
it accused poland of violating the rights of germans who were expelled from their pre-war homes when borders were redrawn in 1945 at the end of the war . judges : poland ca n't be held accountable judges at the european court of human rights in strasbourg however ruled that modern poland bears no responsibility for the expulsion of ethnic germans by the soviets after october 19 , 1994 because it had no governmental control of the land . the court also said it had no jurisdiction to rule on the issue because the expulsion of the germans from their polish homes took place before either country had signed the european convention on human rights .
according to the court , poland thus has no obligation “ to enact laws providing for rehabilitation , restitution of confiscated property or compensation for property lost by the individual applicants . ”
land claim cause of friction the land claim has been a source of friction between the two countries , with polish politicians accusing the group of germans of trying to reverse the outcome of world war ii .
while berlin never viewed any validity in the claim , it was unable to forbid the lawsuit , a position german foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier confirmed upon hearing the ruling .
german foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier welcomed the ruling , saying it confirmed berlin 's own position that there were no outstanding property issues from the second world war between the two nations . dw staff -lrb- ls -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de civil rights -pipe- 10.10.2008 former finnish president ahtisaari wins nobel peace prize großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : martti ahtisaari has worked to solve conflicts ranging from northern ireland to kosovo former finnish president martti ahtisaari , 71 , on friday crowned a distinguished career as a diplomat , statesman and peace broker by winning this year 's nobel peace prize . the former finnish president has been involved in numerous missions aimed at solving international conflicts , ranging from northern ireland to the indonesian province of aceh as well as the serbian province of kosovo .
his breakthrough as a mediator came in namibia , which achieved independence in 1990 , capping years of work by the finnish national who served as special representative to the united nations secretary general and head of the un 's transition assistance team .
ahtisaari and his wife , eeva , were made honorary citizens of the southern african nation .
formative years ahtisaari has said his interest in peace mediation can be traced to his childhood years .
he was born on june 23 , 1937 in viipuri , a city that finland had to secede to the soviet union during the second world war , forcing 400,000 finns from karelia to relocate to finland .
the experience of being displaced fuelled his interest to promote peace and " help others , " he has said .
a second major achievement was the august 2005 peace deal between indonesia and the separatist free aceh movement -lrb- gam -rrb- aimed at ending a decades-long conflict in the indonesian province , and forged in the wake of the devastation caused by the december 2004 tsunami .
he has said mediation is " an ' art ' rather than an established practice , " adding that each conflict needs to be treated as a separate case .
mediation efforts ahtisaari 's hopes for the 2006 peace prize were dashed as the nobel committee selected muhammad yunus of bangladesh who founded the grameen bank that offers loans to the poor .
after qualifying as a teacher in 1959 , ahtisaari joined the foreign ministry in 1965 .
he served as ambassador to tanzania and held top posts in the foreign ministry and later in the un .
after his term as president 1994-2000 during which finland joined the european union , ahtisaari formed the crisis management initiative -lrb- cmi -rrb- that has been engaged in various mediation efforts .
while in office in 1999 , ahtisaari along with former russian prime minister viktor chernomyrdin and former us deputy secretary of state strobe talbott hammered out a plan to resolve the kosovo crisis that then-yugoslav president slobodan milosevic could accept .
accolades in 2000 he was called in to inspect irish republican army -lrb- ira -rrb- arms caches in northern ireland and later served as un special envoy for the horn of africa .
in recent years , ahtisaari has been engaged in discussing the future of the eu including turkey 's possible membership .
almost three years ago , in november 2005 , he was named special un envoy to kosovo but his efforts to bridge the divisions over kosovo 's status were unsuccessful and he stepped down after presenting his recommendations in february 2008 .
he has won numerous awards including the un cultural organization unesco 's felix houphouet-boigny peace prize for 2008 , named after the late president of ivory coast , as well as several honorary doctorates .
the funds from the unesco award were to be used for a foundation to promote peace , mediation and help post-conflict societies .
crowning glory the nobel , which is worth 10 million kronor -lrb- $ 1.5 million -rrb- , will be handed over at a ceremony in oslo on december 10 .
in 2007 , the peace prize was shared by the united nations climate body , the intergovernmental panel on climate change -lrb- ipcc -rrb- and al gore of the united states for their work on climate change .
for this year 's award , the five-member nobel committee had received 197 nominations for the coveted award including 33 organizations . dpa news agency -lrb- jp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

bush said a " startling " drop in us stocks in the last few days was being " driven by uncertainty and fear " and insisted the us already had all the tools necessary to resolve the financial crisis .
" this has been a deeply unsettling period for the american people , " bush acknowledged .
" we will continue to act to resolve this crisis and restore stability to our markets . "
us stocks have plummeted more than 10 percent in the last three days and continued falling on a wild trading day friday .
european stocks also tumbled , leading some countries to temporarily halt trading .

" the world is sending an unmistakable signal : we 're in this together , we will come through this together , " bush said in a statement outside the white house .
the g7 bloc will also look to reassure the markets in a statement following its first meeting since the financial crisis broadened significantly last month , starting with the bankruptcy of us finance firm lehman brothers .
ministers could announce a joint commitment to intervene in their struggling banking industries .
ministers and central bank heads acknowledged cooperation was the only way forward in a crisis that has spread from the united states to europe and the rest of the world .

his breakthrough as a mediator came in namibia , which achieved independence in 1990 , capping years of work by the finnish national who served as special representative to the united nations secretary general and head of the un 's transition assistance team .
ahtisaari and his wife , eeva , were made honorary citizens of the southern african nation .
formative years ahtisaari has said his interest in peace mediation can be traced to his childhood years .
he was born on june 23 , 1937 in viipuri , a city that finland had to secede to the soviet union during the second world war , forcing 400,000 finns from karelia to relocate to finland .
the experience of being displaced fuelled his interest to promote peace and " help others , " he has said .
a second major achievement was the august 2005 peace deal between indonesia and the separatist free aceh movement -lrb- gam -rrb- aimed at ending a decades-long conflict in the indonesian province , and forged in the wake of the devastation caused by the december 2004 tsunami .
he has said mediation is " an ' art ' rather than an established practice , " adding that each conflict needs to be treated as a separate case .
mediation efforts ahtisaari 's hopes for the 2006 peace prize were dashed as the nobel committee selected muhammad yunus of bangladesh who founded the grameen bank that offers loans to the poor .
after qualifying as a teacher in 1959 , ahtisaari joined the foreign ministry in 1965 .
he served as ambassador to tanzania and held top posts in the foreign ministry and later in the un .
after his term as president 1994-2000 during which finland joined the european union , ahtisaari formed the crisis management initiative -lrb- cmi -rrb- that has been engaged in various mediation efforts .
while in office in 1999 , ahtisaari along with former russian prime minister viktor chernomyrdin and former us deputy secretary of state strobe talbott hammered out a plan to resolve the kosovo crisis that then-yugoslav president slobodan milosevic could accept .
accolades in 2000 he was called in to inspect irish republican army -lrb- ira -rrb- arms caches in northern ireland and later served as un special envoy for the horn of africa .
in recent years , ahtisaari has been engaged in discussing the future of the eu including turkey 's possible membership .
almost three years ago , in november 2005 , he was named special un envoy to kosovo but his efforts to bridge the divisions over kosovo 's status were unsuccessful and he stepped down after presenting his recommendations in february 2008 .
he has won numerous awards including the un cultural organization unesco 's felix houphouet-boigny peace prize for 2008 , named after the late president of ivory coast , as well as several honorary doctorates .
the funds from the unesco award were to be used for a foundation to promote peace , mediation and help post-conflict societies .
crowning glory the nobel , which is worth 10 million kronor -lrb- $ 1.5 million -rrb- , will be handed over at a ceremony in oslo on december 10 .
in 2007 , the peace prize was shared by the united nations climate body , the intergovernmental panel on climate change -lrb- ipcc -rrb- and al gore of the united states for their work on climate change .

" there is a formal agreement between the nato nations to fight drug trafficking , " a diplomat confirmed as defense ministers met in the hungarian capital budapest for a two-day meeting to discuss issues ranging from the war in afghanistan to georgia 's nato membership bid and piracy off the somali coast .
nato spokesman james appathurai said the alliance 's international security assistance force -lrb- isaf -rrb- would " act in concert with the afghans , against facilities and facilitators supporting the insurgency . "
the isaf currently has 50,700 soldiers in afghanistan , up from about 45,000 six months ago .
the german parliament agreed tuesday , oct .
7 to increase its contribution by 1,000 soldiers , raising its total to 4,500 .
us lobbies for afghan drug action sources also said that nato 's anti-narcotics efforts would be temporary , and would be open only to those countries willing to participate .
us defense secretary robert gates had pitched hard at the meeting for nato to strike at the heart of the afghan opium trade , which is believed to have contributed substantially to a reinvigorated taliban insurgency aimed at destabilizing president hamid karzai 's government .
" it -lrb- the opium trade -rrb- is not only corrosive to good governance , it also directly funds the people that are killing afghans , americans and all our coalition partners , " gates said in budapest on thursday .
the deal followed a request from afghan defense minister abdel rahim wardak , who on thursday asked nato to help his government target drug laboratories and seize imports of the chemicals needed to turn opium into heroin .
" we have asked nato to support our efforts to destroy the laboratories and to interdict the chemical precursors which are coming from outside the country , " wardak said .
germany in favor of afghan-led operations nato military commanders agreed that more needed to be done to fight the opium and heroin trade , a view shared by most alliance members .
the taliban are thought to be pocketing up to $ 80 million a year from the afghan narcotics industry , which is the source of some 92 percent of the world 's opium and heroin .
germany , spain , greece , poland , romania and italy had expressed scepticism over the plans , saying the fight against the afghan drugs trade was not part of nato 's mandate and should be addressed by the afghans themselves .
german defence minister franz josef jung said thursday germany was willing to assist in reconnaissance of trafficking routes and in training but any operations should be afghan-led .
" if this keeps an afghan face then it 's also in our interest that we support such an activity , " he told reporters on thursday .
ministers also worried that bombing laboratories would kill civilians and undermine the alliance 's popularity among ordinary afghans .
the compromise reached friday is to be reviewed when defense ministers meet again in poland in february . dw staff -lrb- dfm -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

however , british soccer is holding its breath as the credit crunch starts to bite in its top flight . hoeness was quoted in friday 's edition of the bild newspaper as saying that german soccer is well off even though income may drop .
" i believe that german soccer has less to worry than other countries , " said hoeness .
" the big question , however , is if we are moving into a recession where the advertising spending drops and companies are less inclined to pay money for sponsorship . "
the german 1974 world cup winner said that he was concerned for clubs in some other countries .
" here and there clubs could go under , but not the big ones .
chelsea , for instance , has its debts with abramovich , but they are not in danger because the club belongs to him .
there is no bank involved that can close the club , as long as abramovich does not demand his money back , " hoeness said .
" one needs to see if the ice on which everything was built will last . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : we 're in the money : bayern and hoeness are confident hoeness said that it was not certain that foreign investors in english soccer would continue investing such huge sums after losing a lot of money on the stock exchange .
" it would be good for competition if clubs in future actually had to earn the money they spent , " said hoeness .
he said that he was not concerned about his own club bayern munich , as they were financially " in a very strong position . "
meanwhile british soccer is holding its breath to see just how badly it will be affected by the collapse of many of the world 's banks and the ever-worsening financial crisis .
british game suffering backlash once regarded in britain as the people 's game , the sport is now in danger of being torn apart , with several teams ' sponsors already having gone down the pan .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : man utd 's sponsor aig had to be bailed out in the us manchester united shirt sponsor aig was bailed out by the us government , as was newcastle united 's shirt sponsor , northern rock , by the british government .
work on liverpool 's new ground has been delayed as owners keep a close eye on exactly what is happening to their cash .
the overseas investment that had been looked upon as the ideal blueprint by many of the country 's top clubs is now in danger of becoming the poisoned chalice .
what good is investment , many clubs are asking themselves , if it ca n't be guaranteed ?
perhaps the one club most affected so far is west ham united , the east london club for whom the collapse this week of iceland 's second biggest bank , landsbanki , could yet spell disaster for their icelandic owners and for their own future .
rumors persist that the bank - now under the control of the iceland government - could repatriate any overseas assets .
icelandic troubles felt in london 's east end for that , read west ham and their chairman bjorgolfur gudmundsson , who paid 85 million pounds for the club in november 2006 but who may yet be forced to put up the for-sale sign .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : gudmundsson 's west ham is reeling from the icelandic crunch gudmundsson , who was sacked as chairman of the bank on tuesday , has stressed that the club is safe and claims that no players have to be sold .
but west ham vice-chairman asgeir fridgeirsson said on tuesday that players would have to go before any spending could happen in the january transfer window .
" west ham united has one of the biggest squads in the premier league , " fridgeirsson said on tuesday .
" it is very unlikely -lrb- the chairman -rrb- will be willing to put in more money to buy players this january window . "
when he took over as manager in september , gianfranco zola had seemed confident that he would have money to spend in january .
west ham told the dpa news agency on wednesday that zola has yet to request a meeting with the club 's board and nor has one been arranged , but it would seem to be only a matter of time before the italian requests clarification of the situation .
in a statement , placed on the club 's official website on tuesday , west ham chief executive scott duxbury reiterated that players would have to be sold before any new spending could be sanctioned .
" since his appointment , gianfranco zola has made it quite clear that his first team squad is too large and needs to be reduced so he can effectively coach the team , " the statement read .
" once this has happened and if the manager requires further players , then the club will acquire them . "
hammers hammered by credit crunch the collapse of landsbanki followed hot on the heels of the implosion of their shirt sponsor , the tour operator xl , which went bust in september .
that cost the club an estimated 5 million pounds , and with gudmundsson a guarantor of 163 million pounds to xl , west ham 's future looks less than rosy .
the west ham story is just one sorry tale and if the crisis deepens , others could yet be affected in a similar way .
bildunterschrift : the lse has been hit hard and british clubs have shuddered with the resulting tremors the football association chairman lord triesman warned on tuesday that the crisis could cripple some club who are heavily in debt , estimating that english clubs owe a total of 3 billion pounds .
and uefa general secretary david taylor has warned that clubs with huge debt could be excluded from future european competitions would see those clubs finances further depleted .
the biggest worry for west ham is that the crisis may not yet have reached its lowest point and fridgeirsson 's words had a nasty ring to them on tuesday .
" it is , of course , a blow for -lrb- gudmundsson -rrb- and his financial strength , but he himself has a number of other investments that are doing quite well at the moment so there is no reason to fear that he will not honor his commitment to west ham football club , " he said .
" he -lrb- gudmundsson -rrb- is not absolutely sure how this will directly affect him , but one thing he is sure of is that this will have no implications on the other investments of him and his family . "

" it is very unlikely -lrb- the chairman -rrb- will be willing to put in more money to buy players this january window . "
when he took over as manager in september , gianfranco zola had seemed confident that he would have money to spend in january .
west ham told the dpa news agency on wednesday that zola has yet to request a meeting with the club 's board and nor has one been arranged , but it would seem to be only a matter of time before the italian requests clarification of the situation .
in a statement , placed on the club 's official website on tuesday , west ham chief executive scott duxbury reiterated that players would have to be sold before any new spending could be sanctioned .
" since his appointment , gianfranco zola has made it quite clear that his first team squad is too large and needs to be reduced so he can effectively coach the team , " the statement read .
" once this has happened and if the manager requires further players , then the club will acquire them . "
hammers hammered by credit crunch the collapse of landsbanki followed hot on the heels of the implosion of their shirt sponsor , the tour operator xl , which went bust in september .
that cost the club an estimated 5 million pounds , and with gudmundsson a guarantor of 163 million pounds to xl , west ham 's future looks less than rosy .
the west ham story is just one sorry tale and if the crisis deepens , others could yet be affected in a similar way .
bildunterschrift : the lse has been hit hard and british clubs have shuddered with the resulting tremors the football association chairman lord triesman warned on tuesday that the crisis could cripple some club who are heavily in debt , estimating that english clubs owe a total of 3 billion pounds .
and uefa general secretary david taylor has warned that clubs with huge debt could be excluded from future european competitions would see those clubs finances further depleted .
the biggest worry for west ham is that the crisis may not yet have reached its lowest point and fridgeirsson 's words had a nasty ring to them on tuesday .
" it is , of course , a blow for -lrb- gudmundsson -rrb- and his financial strength , but he himself has a number of other investments that are doing quite well at the moment so there is no reason to fear that he will not honor his commitment to west ham football club , " he said .

however , british soccer is holding its breath as the credit crunch starts to bite in its top flight . hoeness was quoted in friday 's edition of the bild newspaper as saying that german soccer is well off even though income may drop .
" i believe that german soccer has less to worry than other countries , " said hoeness .
" the big question , however , is if we are moving into a recession where the advertising spending drops and companies are less inclined to pay money for sponsorship . "
the german 1974 world cup winner said that he was concerned for clubs in some other countries .
" here and there clubs could go under , but not the big ones .
chelsea , for instance , has its debts with abramovich , but they are not in danger because the club belongs to him .
there is no bank involved that can close the club , as long as abramovich does not demand his money back , " hoeness said .
" one needs to see if the ice on which everything was built will last . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : we 're in the money : bayern and hoeness are confident hoeness said that it was not certain that foreign investors in english soccer would continue investing such huge sums after losing a lot of money on the stock exchange .
" it would be good for competition if clubs in future actually had to earn the money they spent , " said hoeness .
he said that he was not concerned about his own club bayern munich , as they were financially " in a very strong position . "
meanwhile british soccer is holding its breath to see just how badly it will be affected by the collapse of many of the world 's banks and the ever-worsening financial crisis .
british game suffering backlash once regarded in britain as the people 's game , the sport is now in danger of being torn apart , with several teams ' sponsors already having gone down the pan .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : man utd 's sponsor aig had to be bailed out in the us manchester united shirt sponsor aig was bailed out by the us government , as was newcastle united 's shirt sponsor , northern rock , by the british government .
work on liverpool 's new ground has been delayed as owners keep a close eye on exactly what is happening to their cash .
the overseas investment that had been looked upon as the ideal blueprint by many of the country 's top clubs is now in danger of becoming the poisoned chalice .
what good is investment , many clubs are asking themselves , if it ca n't be guaranteed ?
perhaps the one club most affected so far is west ham united , the east london club for whom the collapse this week of iceland 's second biggest bank , landsbanki , could yet spell disaster for their icelandic owners and for their own future .
rumors persist that the bank - now under the control of the iceland government - could repatriate any overseas assets .
icelandic troubles felt in london 's east end for that , read west ham and their chairman bjorgolfur gudmundsson , who paid 85 million pounds for the club in november 2006 but who may yet be forced to put up the for-sale sign .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : gudmundsson 's west ham is reeling from the icelandic crunch gudmundsson , who was sacked as chairman of the bank on tuesday , has stressed that the club is safe and claims that no players have to be sold .
but west ham vice-chairman asgeir fridgeirsson said on tuesday that players would have to go before any spending could happen in the january transfer window .
" west ham united has one of the biggest squads in the premier league , " fridgeirsson said on tuesday .

" there is a formal agreement between the nato nations to fight drug trafficking , " a diplomat confirmed as defense ministers met in the hungarian capital budapest for a two-day meeting to discuss issues ranging from the war in afghanistan to georgia 's nato membership bid and piracy off the somali coast .
nato spokesman james appathurai said the alliance 's international security assistance force -lrb- isaf -rrb- would " act in concert with the afghans , against facilities and facilitators supporting the insurgency . "
the isaf currently has 50,700 soldiers in afghanistan , up from about 45,000 six months ago .
the german parliament agreed tuesday , oct .
7 to increase its contribution by 1,000 soldiers , raising its total to 4,500 .
us lobbies for afghan drug action sources also said that nato 's anti-narcotics efforts would be temporary , and would be open only to those countries willing to participate .
us defense secretary robert gates had pitched hard at the meeting for nato to strike at the heart of the afghan opium trade , which is believed to have contributed substantially to a reinvigorated taliban insurgency aimed at destabilizing president hamid karzai 's government .
" it -lrb- the opium trade -rrb- is not only corrosive to good governance , it also directly funds the people that are killing afghans , americans and all our coalition partners , " gates said in budapest on thursday .
the deal followed a request from afghan defense minister abdel rahim wardak , who on thursday asked nato to help his government target drug laboratories and seize imports of the chemicals needed to turn opium into heroin .
" we have asked nato to support our efforts to destroy the laboratories and to interdict the chemical precursors which are coming from outside the country , " wardak said .
germany in favor of afghan-led operations nato military commanders agreed that more needed to be done to fight the opium and heroin trade , a view shared by most alliance members .
the taliban are thought to be pocketing up to $ 80 million a year from the afghan narcotics industry , which is the source of some 92 percent of the world 's opium and heroin .
germany , spain , greece , poland , romania and italy had expressed scepticism over the plans , saying the fight against the afghan drugs trade was not part of nato 's mandate and should be addressed by the afghans themselves .
german defence minister franz josef jung said thursday germany was willing to assist in reconnaissance of trafficking routes and in training but any operations should be afghan-led .
" if this keeps an afghan face then it 's also in our interest that we support such an activity , " he told reporters on thursday .
ministers also worried that bombing laboratories would kill civilians and undermine the alliance 's popularity among ordinary afghans .
the compromise reached friday is to be reviewed when defense ministers meet again in poland in february . dw staff -lrb- dfm -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

10 that the us government was doing all it could to keep the world 's largest economy afloat ahead of a meeting with other g7 leaders in wasiungton . bush 's comments came as global stocks were in free-fall and ministers from the world 's richest nations prepared for a crucial meeting .
bush said a " startling " drop in us stocks in the last few days was being " driven by uncertainty and fear " and insisted the us already had all the tools necessary to resolve the financial crisis .
" this has been a deeply unsettling period for the american people , " bush acknowledged .
" we will continue to act to resolve this crisis and restore stability to our markets . "
us stocks have plummeted more than 10 percent in the last three days and continued falling on a wild trading day friday .
european stocks also tumbled , leading some countries to temporarily halt trading .
bush touts global cooperation bush said that international cooperation was key as finance ministers from the group of seven industrial nations were set to meet in washington .
" the world is sending an unmistakable signal : we 're in this together , we will come through this together , " bush said in a statement outside the white house .
the g7 bloc will also look to reassure the markets in a statement following its first meeting since the financial crisis broadened significantly last month , starting with the bankruptcy of us finance firm lehman brothers .
ministers could announce a joint commitment to intervene in their struggling banking industries .
ministers and central bank heads acknowledged cooperation was the only way forward in a crisis that has spread from the united states to europe and the rest of the world .
isolated efforts wo n't work : steinbrueck bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : steinbrueck says the crisis is beyond " case-by-case " answers german finance minister peer steinbrueck said germany was weighing its own large-scale rescue of banks in europe 's largest economy .
" the downward spiral has gathered pace .
case-by-case answers are not going to help any more , even in germany , " he said in washington .
bush will meet with the g7 ministers on saturday , while treasury secretary henry paulson will also be hosting an emergency meeting of finance chiefs from the world 's 20 leading economies , in a sign of how far the crisis has spread .
dominique strauss-kahn , managing director of the international monetary fund , said thursday the world was on the " cusp " of a recession .
the imf and world bank also hold their annual meetings this weekend .
bush announced no new moves to ease the us credit crunch that has curbed the availability of loans to consumers and small businesses .
instead he cited the litany of us government interventions and powers already in play after congress last week passed a $ 700-billion rescue package that gives the treasury broad authority to intervene in the banking system .
" we know what the problems are , we have the tools to fix them and we are working quickly to do so , " bush said . dpa news agency -lrb- dfm -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" there is a formal agreement between the nato nations to fight drug trafficking , " a diplomat confirmed as defense ministers met in the hungarian capital budapest for a two-day meeting to discuss issues ranging from the war in afghanistan to georgia 's nato membership bid and piracy off the somali coast .
nato spokesman james appathurai said the alliance 's international security assistance force -lrb- isaf -rrb- would " act in concert with the afghans , against facilities and facilitators supporting the insurgency . "
the isaf currently has 50,700 soldiers in afghanistan , up from about 45,000 six months ago .
the german parliament agreed tuesday , oct .
7 to increase its contribution by 1,000 soldiers , raising its total to 4,500 .
us lobbies for afghan drug action sources also said that nato 's anti-narcotics efforts would be temporary , and would be open only to those countries willing to participate .
us defense secretary robert gates had pitched hard at the meeting for nato to strike at the heart of the afghan opium trade , which is believed to have contributed substantially to a reinvigorated taliban insurgency aimed at destabilizing president hamid karzai 's government .
" it -lrb- the opium trade -rrb- is not only corrosive to good governance , it also directly funds the people that are killing afghans , americans and all our coalition partners , " gates said in budapest on thursday .
the deal followed a request from afghan defense minister abdel rahim wardak , who on thursday asked nato to help his government target drug laboratories and seize imports of the chemicals needed to turn opium into heroin .
" we have asked nato to support our efforts to destroy the laboratories and to interdict the chemical precursors which are coming from outside the country , " wardak said .
germany in favor of afghan-led operations nato military commanders agreed that more needed to be done to fight the opium and heroin trade , a view shared by most alliance members .
the taliban are thought to be pocketing up to $ 80 million a year from the afghan narcotics industry , which is the source of some 92 percent of the world 's opium and heroin .
germany , spain , greece , poland , romania and italy had expressed scepticism over the plans , saying the fight against the afghan drugs trade was not part of nato 's mandate and should be addressed by the afghans themselves .
german defence minister franz josef jung said thursday germany was willing to assist in reconnaissance of trafficking routes and in training but any operations should be afghan-led .
" if this keeps an afghan face then it 's also in our interest that we support such an activity , " he told reporters on thursday .
ministers also worried that bombing laboratories would kill civilians and undermine the alliance 's popularity among ordinary afghans .
the compromise reached friday is to be reviewed when defense ministers meet again in poland in february . dw staff -lrb- dfm -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

however , british soccer is holding its breath as the credit crunch starts to bite in its top flight . hoeness was quoted in friday 's edition of the bild newspaper as saying that german soccer is well off even though income may drop .
" i believe that german soccer has less to worry than other countries , " said hoeness .
" the big question , however , is if we are moving into a recession where the advertising spending drops and companies are less inclined to pay money for sponsorship . "
the german 1974 world cup winner said that he was concerned for clubs in some other countries .
" here and there clubs could go under , but not the big ones .
chelsea , for instance , has its debts with abramovich , but they are not in danger because the club belongs to him .
there is no bank involved that can close the club , as long as abramovich does not demand his money back , " hoeness said .
" one needs to see if the ice on which everything was built will last . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : we 're in the money : bayern and hoeness are confident hoeness said that it was not certain that foreign investors in english soccer would continue investing such huge sums after losing a lot of money on the stock exchange .
" it would be good for competition if clubs in future actually had to earn the money they spent , " said hoeness .
he said that he was not concerned about his own club bayern munich , as they were financially " in a very strong position . "
meanwhile british soccer is holding its breath to see just how badly it will be affected by the collapse of many of the world 's banks and the ever-worsening financial crisis .
british game suffering backlash once regarded in britain as the people 's game , the sport is now in danger of being torn apart , with several teams ' sponsors already having gone down the pan .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : man utd 's sponsor aig had to be bailed out in the us manchester united shirt sponsor aig was bailed out by the us government , as was newcastle united 's shirt sponsor , northern rock , by the british government .
work on liverpool 's new ground has been delayed as owners keep a close eye on exactly what is happening to their cash .
the overseas investment that had been looked upon as the ideal blueprint by many of the country 's top clubs is now in danger of becoming the poisoned chalice .
what good is investment , many clubs are asking themselves , if it ca n't be guaranteed ?
perhaps the one club most affected so far is west ham united , the east london club for whom the collapse this week of iceland 's second biggest bank , landsbanki , could yet spell disaster for their icelandic owners and for their own future .
rumors persist that the bank - now under the control of the iceland government - could repatriate any overseas assets .
icelandic troubles felt in london 's east end for that , read west ham and their chairman bjorgolfur gudmundsson , who paid 85 million pounds for the club in november 2006 but who may yet be forced to put up the for-sale sign .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : gudmundsson 's west ham is reeling from the icelandic crunch gudmundsson , who was sacked as chairman of the bank on tuesday , has stressed that the club is safe and claims that no players have to be sold .
but west ham vice-chairman asgeir fridgeirsson said on tuesday that players would have to go before any spending could happen in the january transfer window .
" west ham united has one of the biggest squads in the premier league , " fridgeirsson said on tuesday .
" it is very unlikely -lrb- the chairman -rrb- will be willing to put in more money to buy players this january window . "
when he took over as manager in september , gianfranco zola had seemed confident that he would have money to spend in january .
west ham told the dpa news agency on wednesday that zola has yet to request a meeting with the club 's board and nor has one been arranged , but it would seem to be only a matter of time before the italian requests clarification of the situation .
in a statement , placed on the club 's official website on tuesday , west ham chief executive scott duxbury reiterated that players would have to be sold before any new spending could be sanctioned .
" since his appointment , gianfranco zola has made it quite clear that his first team squad is too large and needs to be reduced so he can effectively coach the team , " the statement read .
" once this has happened and if the manager requires further players , then the club will acquire them . "
hammers hammered by credit crunch the collapse of landsbanki followed hot on the heels of the implosion of their shirt sponsor , the tour operator xl , which went bust in september .
that cost the club an estimated 5 million pounds , and with gudmundsson a guarantor of 163 million pounds to xl , west ham 's future looks less than rosy .
the west ham story is just one sorry tale and if the crisis deepens , others could yet be affected in a similar way .
bildunterschrift : the lse has been hit hard and british clubs have shuddered with the resulting tremors the football association chairman lord triesman warned on tuesday that the crisis could cripple some club who are heavily in debt , estimating that english clubs owe a total of 3 billion pounds .
and uefa general secretary david taylor has warned that clubs with huge debt could be excluded from future european competitions would see those clubs finances further depleted .
the biggest worry for west ham is that the crisis may not yet have reached its lowest point and fridgeirsson 's words had a nasty ring to them on tuesday .
" it is , of course , a blow for -lrb- gudmundsson -rrb- and his financial strength , but he himself has a number of other investments that are doing quite well at the moment so there is no reason to fear that he will not honor his commitment to west ham football club , " he said .
" he -lrb- gudmundsson -rrb- is not absolutely sure how this will directly affect him , but one thing he is sure of is that this will have no implications on the other investments of him and his family . "

however , british soccer is holding its breath as the credit crunch starts to bite in its top flight . hoeness was quoted in friday 's edition of the bild newspaper as saying that german soccer is well off even though income may drop .
" i believe that german soccer has less to worry than other countries , " said hoeness .
" the big question , however , is if we are moving into a recession where the advertising spending drops and companies are less inclined to pay money for sponsorship . "
the german 1974 world cup winner said that he was concerned for clubs in some other countries .
" here and there clubs could go under , but not the big ones .
chelsea , for instance , has its debts with abramovich , but they are not in danger because the club belongs to him .
there is no bank involved that can close the club , as long as abramovich does not demand his money back , " hoeness said .
" one needs to see if the ice on which everything was built will last . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : we 're in the money : bayern and hoeness are confident hoeness said that it was not certain that foreign investors in english soccer would continue investing such huge sums after losing a lot of money on the stock exchange .
" it would be good for competition if clubs in future actually had to earn the money they spent , " said hoeness .
he said that he was not concerned about his own club bayern munich , as they were financially " in a very strong position . "
meanwhile british soccer is holding its breath to see just how badly it will be affected by the collapse of many of the world 's banks and the ever-worsening financial crisis .
british game suffering backlash once regarded in britain as the people 's game , the sport is now in danger of being torn apart , with several teams ' sponsors already having gone down the pan .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : man utd 's sponsor aig had to be bailed out in the us manchester united shirt sponsor aig was bailed out by the us government , as was newcastle united 's shirt sponsor , northern rock , by the british government .
work on liverpool 's new ground has been delayed as owners keep a close eye on exactly what is happening to their cash .
the overseas investment that had been looked upon as the ideal blueprint by many of the country 's top clubs is now in danger of becoming the poisoned chalice .
what good is investment , many clubs are asking themselves , if it ca n't be guaranteed ?
perhaps the one club most affected so far is west ham united , the east london club for whom the collapse this week of iceland 's second biggest bank , landsbanki , could yet spell disaster for their icelandic owners and for their own future .
rumors persist that the bank - now under the control of the iceland government - could repatriate any overseas assets .
icelandic troubles felt in london 's east end for that , read west ham and their chairman bjorgolfur gudmundsson , who paid 85 million pounds for the club in november 2006 but who may yet be forced to put up the for-sale sign .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : gudmundsson 's west ham is reeling from the icelandic crunch gudmundsson , who was sacked as chairman of the bank on tuesday , has stressed that the club is safe and claims that no players have to be sold .
but west ham vice-chairman asgeir fridgeirsson said on tuesday that players would have to go before any spending could happen in the january transfer window .
" west ham united has one of the biggest squads in the premier league , " fridgeirsson said on tuesday .
" it is very unlikely -lrb- the chairman -rrb- will be willing to put in more money to buy players this january window . "
when he took over as manager in september , gianfranco zola had seemed confident that he would have money to spend in january .
west ham told the dpa news agency on wednesday that zola has yet to request a meeting with the club 's board and nor has one been arranged , but it would seem to be only a matter of time before the italian requests clarification of the situation .
in a statement , placed on the club 's official website on tuesday , west ham chief executive scott duxbury reiterated that players would have to be sold before any new spending could be sanctioned .
" since his appointment , gianfranco zola has made it quite clear that his first team squad is too large and needs to be reduced so he can effectively coach the team , " the statement read .
" once this has happened and if the manager requires further players , then the club will acquire them . "
hammers hammered by credit crunch the collapse of landsbanki followed hot on the heels of the implosion of their shirt sponsor , the tour operator xl , which went bust in september .
that cost the club an estimated 5 million pounds , and with gudmundsson a guarantor of 163 million pounds to xl , west ham 's future looks less than rosy .
the west ham story is just one sorry tale and if the crisis deepens , others could yet be affected in a similar way .
bildunterschrift : the lse has been hit hard and british clubs have shuddered with the resulting tremors the football association chairman lord triesman warned on tuesday that the crisis could cripple some club who are heavily in debt , estimating that english clubs owe a total of 3 billion pounds .
and uefa general secretary david taylor has warned that clubs with huge debt could be excluded from future european competitions would see those clubs finances further depleted .
the biggest worry for west ham is that the crisis may not yet have reached its lowest point and fridgeirsson 's words had a nasty ring to them on tuesday .
" it is , of course , a blow for -lrb- gudmundsson -rrb- and his financial strength , but he himself has a number of other investments that are doing quite well at the moment so there is no reason to fear that he will not honor his commitment to west ham football club , " he said .
" he -lrb- gudmundsson -rrb- is not absolutely sure how this will directly affect him , but one thing he is sure of is that this will have no implications on the other investments of him and his family . "

the decision was welcomed by the leaders of both countries . the european court of human rights rejected thursday a land claim by ethnic germans who lost homes in poland during the second world war , a decision welcomed by leaders of both countries whose ties have soured over the issue .
the claim was filed by a private company , the prussian claims society , representing 23 germans .
it accused poland of violating the rights of germans who were expelled from their pre-war homes when borders were redrawn in 1945 at the end of the war . judges : poland ca n't be held accountable judges at the european court of human rights in strasbourg however ruled that modern poland bears no responsibility for the expulsion of ethnic germans by the soviets after october 19 , 1994 because it had no governmental control of the land . the court also said it had no jurisdiction to rule on the issue because the expulsion of the germans from their polish homes took place before either country had signed the european convention on human rights .
according to the court , poland thus has no obligation “ to enact laws providing for rehabilitation , restitution of confiscated property or compensation for property lost by the individual applicants . ”
land claim cause of friction the land claim has been a source of friction between the two countries , with polish politicians accusing the group of germans of trying to reverse the outcome of world war ii .
while berlin never viewed any validity in the claim , it was unable to forbid the lawsuit , a position german foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier confirmed upon hearing the ruling .
german foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier welcomed the ruling , saying it confirmed berlin 's own position that there were no outstanding property issues from the second world war between the two nations . dw staff -lrb- ls -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

his breakthrough as a mediator came in namibia , which achieved independence in 1990 , capping years of work by the finnish national who served as special representative to the united nations secretary general and head of the un 's transition assistance team .
ahtisaari and his wife , eeva , were made honorary citizens of the southern african nation .
formative years ahtisaari has said his interest in peace mediation can be traced to his childhood years .
he was born on june 23 , 1937 in viipuri , a city that finland had to secede to the soviet union during the second world war , forcing 400,000 finns from karelia to relocate to finland .
the experience of being displaced fuelled his interest to promote peace and " help others , " he has said .
a second major achievement was the august 2005 peace deal between indonesia and the separatist free aceh movement -lrb- gam -rrb- aimed at ending a decades-long conflict in the indonesian province , and forged in the wake of the devastation caused by the december 2004 tsunami .
he has said mediation is " an ' art ' rather than an established practice , " adding that each conflict needs to be treated as a separate case .
mediation efforts ahtisaari 's hopes for the 2006 peace prize were dashed as the nobel committee selected muhammad yunus of bangladesh who founded the grameen bank that offers loans to the poor .
after qualifying as a teacher in 1959 , ahtisaari joined the foreign ministry in 1965 .
he served as ambassador to tanzania and held top posts in the foreign ministry and later in the un .
after his term as president 1994-2000 during which finland joined the european union , ahtisaari formed the crisis management initiative -lrb- cmi -rrb- that has been engaged in various mediation efforts .
while in office in 1999 , ahtisaari along with former russian prime minister viktor chernomyrdin and former us deputy secretary of state strobe talbott hammered out a plan to resolve the kosovo crisis that then-yugoslav president slobodan milosevic could accept .
accolades in 2000 he was called in to inspect irish republican army -lrb- ira -rrb- arms caches in northern ireland and later served as un special envoy for the horn of africa .
in recent years , ahtisaari has been engaged in discussing the future of the eu including turkey 's possible membership .
almost three years ago , in november 2005 , he was named special un envoy to kosovo but his efforts to bridge the divisions over kosovo 's status were unsuccessful and he stepped down after presenting his recommendations in february 2008 .
he has won numerous awards including the un cultural organization unesco 's felix houphouet-boigny peace prize for 2008 , named after the late president of ivory coast , as well as several honorary doctorates .
the funds from the unesco award were to be used for a foundation to promote peace , mediation and help post-conflict societies .
crowning glory the nobel , which is worth 10 million kronor -lrb- $ 1.5 million -rrb- , will be handed over at a ceremony in oslo on december 10 .
in 2007 , the peace prize was shared by the united nations climate body , the intergovernmental panel on climate change -lrb- ipcc -rrb- and al gore of the united states for their work on climate change .
for this year 's award , the five-member nobel committee had received 197 nominations for the coveted award including 33 organizations . dpa news agency -lrb- jp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

a second major achievement was the august 2005 peace deal between indonesia and the separatist free aceh movement -lrb- gam -rrb- aimed at ending a decades-long conflict in the indonesian province , and forged in the wake of the devastation caused by the december 2004 tsunami .
he has said mediation is " an ' art ' rather than an established practice , " adding that each conflict needs to be treated as a separate case .
mediation efforts ahtisaari 's hopes for the 2006 peace prize were dashed as the nobel committee selected muhammad yunus of bangladesh who founded the grameen bank that offers loans to the poor .
after qualifying as a teacher in 1959 , ahtisaari joined the foreign ministry in 1965 .
he served as ambassador to tanzania and held top posts in the foreign ministry and later in the un .
after his term as president 1994-2000 during which finland joined the european union , ahtisaari formed the crisis management initiative -lrb- cmi -rrb- that has been engaged in various mediation efforts .
while in office in 1999 , ahtisaari along with former russian prime minister viktor chernomyrdin and former us deputy secretary of state strobe talbott hammered out a plan to resolve the kosovo crisis that then-yugoslav president slobodan milosevic could accept .
accolades in 2000 he was called in to inspect irish republican army -lrb- ira -rrb- arms caches in northern ireland and later served as un special envoy for the horn of africa .
in recent years , ahtisaari has been engaged in discussing the future of the eu including turkey 's possible membership .
almost three years ago , in november 2005 , he was named special un envoy to kosovo but his efforts to bridge the divisions over kosovo 's status were unsuccessful and he stepped down after presenting his recommendations in february 2008 .
he has won numerous awards including the un cultural organization unesco 's felix houphouet-boigny peace prize for 2008 , named after the late president of ivory coast , as well as several honorary doctorates .
the funds from the unesco award were to be used for a foundation to promote peace , mediation and help post-conflict societies .
crowning glory the nobel , which is worth 10 million kronor -lrb- $ 1.5 million -rrb- , will be handed over at a ceremony in oslo on december 10 .
in 2007 , the peace prize was shared by the united nations climate body , the intergovernmental panel on climate change -lrb- ipcc -rrb- and al gore of the united states for their work on climate change .

they say un-backed data on climate change is out of date . " we should prepare for a rise of sea levels of one meter this century , " said joachim schellnhuber , head of the potsdam institute for climate impact research -lrb- pik -rrb- , which advises the german government on environmental policy .
the melting rates of glaciers in the himalayas and the greenland ice-sheet have doubled or even tripled in recent years , due partly to increased greenhouse gas emissions by chinese power stations , he said .
his findings used data which was unavailable to the intergovernmental panel on climate change -lrb- ipcc -rrb- when it compiled its most recent global warming report .
in february 2007 , in the first volume of a landmark report , the nobel prize-winning ipcc predicted the oceans would rise by between 18 and 59 centimeters by 2100 .
the umbrella effect bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the earth is hurtling toward a warmer age at a quickening pace , say scientists further causes for concern include a drop in the amount of dirt particles in the air that protect from sunlight .
schellnhuber warned that cleaning air in beijing and in other large cities suffering from pollution problems by limiting car and power-plant emissions may raise global temperatures instead of lowering them .
aerosols , or particles suspended in air , have a cooling effect on the earth , countering global warming linked to carbon dioxide , said schellnhuber , explaining that a drop in aerosols in the atmosphere could cause a rapid rise in temperatures .
airborne pollutants act as an umbrella worldwide while co2 provides insulation , trapping heat attempting to escape into the atmosphere .
a rise in temperature because of declines in aerosols in the atmosphere can be offset by slashing co2 emissions , he said .
by not reducing carbon output , humanity " is closing the last door we have through which we can possibly influence the global climate , " schellnhuber warned .
urgent need for action bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : carbon emissions must be cut back - now the scientist stressed that there is what he called a 50-50 chance of limiting the global temperature rise to 2 degrees celsius -lrb- 3.6 degrees fahrenheit -rrb- before 2100 , which would avert the worst damage of climate change - so long as plans fleshed out by the g8 countries to reduce emissions are realized .
the united nations-sponsored climate-change talks this december in poznan , poland , and next year in copenhagen must reach an agreement to limit co2 , he added .
" there is really no time to spare , " schellnhuber said in an interview with bloomberg .
" technology will play a decisive role in limiting carbon but we have to move to a carbon-free world by the end of the century . "
german environment minister sigmar gabriel -lrb- spd -rrb- has warned that environmental issues risk being neglected because of the global financial crisis .

the umbrella effect bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the earth is hurtling toward a warmer age at a quickening pace , say scientists further causes for concern include a drop in the amount of dirt particles in the air that protect from sunlight .
schellnhuber warned that cleaning air in beijing and in other large cities suffering from pollution problems by limiting car and power-plant emissions may raise global temperatures instead of lowering them .
aerosols , or particles suspended in air , have a cooling effect on the earth , countering global warming linked to carbon dioxide , said schellnhuber , explaining that a drop in aerosols in the atmosphere could cause a rapid rise in temperatures .
airborne pollutants act as an umbrella worldwide while co2 provides insulation , trapping heat attempting to escape into the atmosphere .
a rise in temperature because of declines in aerosols in the atmosphere can be offset by slashing co2 emissions , he said .
by not reducing carbon output , humanity " is closing the last door we have through which we can possibly influence the global climate , " schellnhuber warned .
urgent need for action bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : carbon emissions must be cut back - now the scientist stressed that there is what he called a 50-50 chance of limiting the global temperature rise to 2 degrees celsius -lrb- 3.6 degrees fahrenheit -rrb- before 2100 , which would avert the worst damage of climate change - so long as plans fleshed out by the g8 countries to reduce emissions are realized .
the united nations-sponsored climate-change talks this december in poznan , poland , and next year in copenhagen must reach an agreement to limit co2 , he added .
" there is really no time to spare , " schellnhuber said in an interview with bloomberg .
" technology will play a decisive role in limiting carbon but we have to move to a carbon-free world by the end of the century . "
german environment minister sigmar gabriel -lrb- spd -rrb- has warned that environmental issues risk being neglected because of the global financial crisis .
" we can spend relatively little money now or vast sums in decades to come , " he was quoted as saying in zeit online .
" we are wealthy enough to afford climate protection - and we are too badly-off to ignore it . " dw staff -lrb- jp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de nato -pipe- 10.10.2008 nato-russian relations still on hold despite germany 's efforts großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : nato will not reopen communications with russia despite its withdrawal from georgia german defense minister franz josef jung urged nato allies friday , oct .
10 to consider resuming high-level talks with russia , after moscow withdrew its troops from buffer zones in georgia . " if russia respects the six-point plan , and this appears to be the case , then we should resume dialogue with russia , " he told reporters at informal nato defense talks in the hungarian capital budapest .
" that means the nato-russia council should resume its work , " he said .
the western alliance froze such high level talks with russia in september , insisting that it could not do " business as usual " following moscow 's military operation in georgia .
russia sent troops into the former soviet republic in early august , after georgia tried to recover its breakaway region of south ossetia which , along with rebel abkhazia , moscow has since recognized as independent .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : jung urged nato to reach out to russia jung said he would like to see a " perspective " for the meetings to resume surface during the next round of talks with his nato counterparts , which is scheduled for february in cracow , poland .
the european union , whose french presidency brokered the six-point russia-georgia ceasefire agreement , is the institution which must decide whether moscow is respecting the accord .
but the bloc remained divided friday over whether that was the case , even after it appeared that russia had withdrawn its forces from the two buffer zones in line with the agreement .
russia sent troops into the former soviet republic in early august , amid a dispute over the breakaway region of south ossetia which , along with rebel abkhazia , moscow has since recognized as independent .
russian forces were still controlling two areas under georgian control prior to the conflict , the akhalgori district in south ossetia and the kodori gorge in abkhazia .
tbilisi insists the russians must leave the two areas to fully comply .
georgian efforts to become part of nato have infuriated russia , which objects to the prospect of its old cold war foe extending to its borders .
russian president dmitry medvedev has even accused nato of provoking the georgia conflict .
nato chief rules out high level talks bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : still no business as usual for nato 's de hoop scheffer nato secretary general jaap de hoop scheffer ruled out resuming high-level talks with russia after the alliance froze the meetings last month insisting that it could not do " business as usual with russia " since its attack on georgia in august .
" it is encouraging that russia seems to withdrawing its forces back to the pre-conflict lines , " scheffer told reporters , after a first ever meeting of the nato-georgia commission at ministerial level .
" but we are not in a situation where we go back to business as usual , " he said .
" it seems premature now to conclude that there will be a nato-russia council meeting in krakow , " scheffer said .
" that requires a discussion .
we are not at that stage yet . " "
us backs nato line on russian relations bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : it 's still too early to talk to russia , says the united states a senior official from the united states , which has staunchly backed georgia since the start , also agreed that it was too early to change nato 's approach , as russia still had to leave outstanding areas .
" there are clearly things that are going to have to be discussed , " he said , and warned : " we need to make sure that we do n't create a risky environment . "
scheffer said that the ministers did not discuss georgia 's nato aspirations , and that the topic would be taken up by alliance foreign ministers when they meet in brussels in december .
georgia 's military needs and reform efforts were addressed , but he insisted that nato would not supply tbilisi with any weapons as the nato chief spoke , french foreign minister bernard kouchner , whose country holds the european union 's rotating presidency , announced that russia had withdrawn from georgian buffer zones but " a long road " lay ahead to resolve other issues .
the european union , whose french presidency brokered the six-point russia-georgia ceasefire agreement , is the institution which must decide whether moscow is respecting the accord .
alliance agrees to target afghan drug lords bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : afghanistan 's opium trade will become a nato target in other developments at the meeting in budapest , nato defense ministers agreed to target drugs traffickers and opium laboratories in afghanistan as part of the alliance 's efforts to undermine the taliban insurgency .
but under a compromise hammered out in budapest , member states participating in nato 's international security assistance force -lrb- isaf -rrb- in afghanistan will be free to opt in or out of any anti-narcotics operations .
nato secretary general jaap de hoop scheffer said ministers had agreed that the " isaf can , in concert with afghan authorities , act against facilities or facilitators supporting the insurgency . "
however , any action would be " subject to the authorization of specific nations , " the nato chief said .
that was a concession to countries like germany , spain and italy , who argue that the fight against drugs should be left to the afghan police .
these countries had also expressed concern that any nato raids on laboratories would kill civilians and undermine the alliance 's popularity among ordinary afghans .
in an effort to address such reservations , ministers also agreed to ensure that civilian casualties be minimized , and that the anti-narcotics fight be conducted mainly in the southern provinces of afghanistan , where cultivations and the insurgency both thrive .
jung said he was " very satisfied with the compromise " and added that the deal would allow german soldiers to " continue to support the training of the afghan security forces " and to limit its role to providing assistance to afghan-led operations through logistical , intelligence and medical support .
opium proceeds funding taliban resurgeance bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the taliban is being funded by the drugs trade nato officials said the plan was " consistent with the appropriate un security council resolutions " and with the isaf 's existing operational plan .
friday 's compromise would be reviewed in february , when defense ministers next meet in poland .
the deal clinched in budapest follows a specific request from afghan defense minister abdel rahim wardak , who on thursday had asked his nato colleagues to help his government target drugs laboratories and seize imports of the chemicals that are needed to turn opium into heroin .
" we have asked nato to support our efforts to destroy the laboratories and to interdict the chemical precursors which are coming from outside the country , " wardak said .
nato military commanders acknowledge that more needs to be done to fight the opium and heroin trade .
us defense secretary robert gates believes that the taliban pocket between 60 and 80 million dollars per year from the sale of drugs .
" it is not only corrosive to good governance , it also directly funds the people that are killing afghans , americans and all our coalition partners , " gates said in budapest on thursday .
poppy cultivations have fallen by 19 per cent since last year , but afghan heroin still accounts for more than 90 per cent of the heroin circulating in europe . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" if russia respects the six-point plan , and this appears to be the case , then we should resume dialogue with russia , " he told reporters at informal nato defense talks in the hungarian capital budapest .

the western alliance froze such high level talks with russia in september , insisting that it could not do " business as usual " following moscow 's military operation in georgia .

russia sent troops into the former soviet republic in early august , amid a dispute over the breakaway region of south ossetia which , along with rebel abkhazia , moscow has since recognized as independent .
russian forces were still controlling two areas under georgian control prior to the conflict , the akhalgori district in south ossetia and the kodori gorge in abkhazia .
tbilisi insists the russians must leave the two areas to fully comply .
georgian efforts to become part of nato have infuriated russia , which objects to the prospect of its old cold war foe extending to its borders .
russian president dmitry medvedev has even accused nato of provoking the georgia conflict .

" it is encouraging that russia seems to withdrawing its forces back to the pre-conflict lines , " scheffer told reporters , after a first ever meeting of the nato-georgia commission at ministerial level .
" but we are not in a situation where we go back to business as usual , " he said .

" there are clearly things that are going to have to be discussed , " he said , and warned : " we need to make sure that we do n't create a risky environment . "
scheffer said that the ministers did not discuss georgia 's nato aspirations , and that the topic would be taken up by alliance foreign ministers when they meet in brussels in december .
georgia 's military needs and reform efforts were addressed , but he insisted that nato would not supply tbilisi with any weapons as the nato chief spoke , french foreign minister bernard kouchner , whose country holds the european union 's rotating presidency , announced that russia had withdrawn from georgian buffer zones but " a long road " lay ahead to resolve other issues .

alliance agrees to target afghan drug lords bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : afghanistan 's opium trade will become a nato target in other developments at the meeting in budapest , nato defense ministers agreed to target drugs traffickers and opium laboratories in afghanistan as part of the alliance 's efforts to undermine the taliban insurgency .
but under a compromise hammered out in budapest , member states participating in nato 's international security assistance force -lrb- isaf -rrb- in afghanistan will be free to opt in or out of any anti-narcotics operations .
nato secretary general jaap de hoop scheffer said ministers had agreed that the " isaf can , in concert with afghan authorities , act against facilities or facilitators supporting the insurgency . "
however , any action would be " subject to the authorization of specific nations , " the nato chief said .
that was a concession to countries like germany , spain and italy , who argue that the fight against drugs should be left to the afghan police .
these countries had also expressed concern that any nato raids on laboratories would kill civilians and undermine the alliance 's popularity among ordinary afghans .
in an effort to address such reservations , ministers also agreed to ensure that civilian casualties be minimized , and that the anti-narcotics fight be conducted mainly in the southern provinces of afghanistan , where cultivations and the insurgency both thrive .
jung said he was " very satisfied with the compromise " and added that the deal would allow german soldiers to " continue to support the training of the afghan security forces " and to limit its role to providing assistance to afghan-led operations through logistical , intelligence and medical support .
opium proceeds funding taliban resurgeance bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the taliban is being funded by the drugs trade nato officials said the plan was " consistent with the appropriate un security council resolutions " and with the isaf 's existing operational plan .
friday 's compromise would be reviewed in february , when defense ministers next meet in poland .
the deal clinched in budapest follows a specific request from afghan defense minister abdel rahim wardak , who on thursday had asked his nato colleagues to help his government target drugs laboratories and seize imports of the chemicals that are needed to turn opium into heroin .
" we have asked nato to support our efforts to destroy the laboratories and to interdict the chemical precursors which are coming from outside the country , " wardak said .
nato military commanders acknowledge that more needs to be done to fight the opium and heroin trade .
us defense secretary robert gates believes that the taliban pocket between 60 and 80 million dollars per year from the sale of drugs .
" it is not only corrosive to good governance , it also directly funds the people that are killing afghans , americans and all our coalition partners , " gates said in budapest on thursday .

russian forces were still controlling two areas under georgian control prior to the conflict , the akhalgori district in south ossetia and the kodori gorge in abkhazia .
tbilisi insists the russians must leave the two areas to fully comply .
georgian efforts to become part of nato have infuriated russia , which objects to the prospect of its old cold war foe extending to its borders .
russian president dmitry medvedev has even accused nato of provoking the georgia conflict .
nato chief rules out high level talks bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : still no business as usual for nato 's de hoop scheffer nato secretary general jaap de hoop scheffer ruled out resuming high-level talks with russia after the alliance froze the meetings last month insisting that it could not do " business as usual with russia " since its attack on georgia in august .
" it is encouraging that russia seems to withdrawing its forces back to the pre-conflict lines , " scheffer told reporters , after a first ever meeting of the nato-georgia commission at ministerial level .
" but we are not in a situation where we go back to business as usual , " he said .
" it seems premature now to conclude that there will be a nato-russia council meeting in krakow , " scheffer said .
" that requires a discussion .
we are not at that stage yet . " "
us backs nato line on russian relations bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : it 's still too early to talk to russia , says the united states a senior official from the united states , which has staunchly backed georgia since the start , also agreed that it was too early to change nato 's approach , as russia still had to leave outstanding areas .
" there are clearly things that are going to have to be discussed , " he said , and warned : " we need to make sure that we do n't create a risky environment . "
scheffer said that the ministers did not discuss georgia 's nato aspirations , and that the topic would be taken up by alliance foreign ministers when they meet in brussels in december .
georgia 's military needs and reform efforts were addressed , but he insisted that nato would not supply tbilisi with any weapons as the nato chief spoke , french foreign minister bernard kouchner , whose country holds the european union 's rotating presidency , announced that russia had withdrawn from georgian buffer zones but " a long road " lay ahead to resolve other issues .
the european union , whose french presidency brokered the six-point russia-georgia ceasefire agreement , is the institution which must decide whether moscow is respecting the accord .
alliance agrees to target afghan drug lords bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : afghanistan 's opium trade will become a nato target in other developments at the meeting in budapest , nato defense ministers agreed to target drugs traffickers and opium laboratories in afghanistan as part of the alliance 's efforts to undermine the taliban insurgency .
but under a compromise hammered out in budapest , member states participating in nato 's international security assistance force -lrb- isaf -rrb- in afghanistan will be free to opt in or out of any anti-narcotics operations .
nato secretary general jaap de hoop scheffer said ministers had agreed that the " isaf can , in concert with afghan authorities , act against facilities or facilitators supporting the insurgency . "
however , any action would be " subject to the authorization of specific nations , " the nato chief said .
that was a concession to countries like germany , spain and italy , who argue that the fight against drugs should be left to the afghan police .
these countries had also expressed concern that any nato raids on laboratories would kill civilians and undermine the alliance 's popularity among ordinary afghans .
in an effort to address such reservations , ministers also agreed to ensure that civilian casualties be minimized , and that the anti-narcotics fight be conducted mainly in the southern provinces of afghanistan , where cultivations and the insurgency both thrive .
jung said he was " very satisfied with the compromise " and added that the deal would allow german soldiers to " continue to support the training of the afghan security forces " and to limit its role to providing assistance to afghan-led operations through logistical , intelligence and medical support .
opium proceeds funding taliban resurgeance bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the taliban is being funded by the drugs trade nato officials said the plan was " consistent with the appropriate un security council resolutions " and with the isaf 's existing operational plan .
friday 's compromise would be reviewed in february , when defense ministers next meet in poland .
the deal clinched in budapest follows a specific request from afghan defense minister abdel rahim wardak , who on thursday had asked his nato colleagues to help his government target drugs laboratories and seize imports of the chemicals that are needed to turn opium into heroin .
" we have asked nato to support our efforts to destroy the laboratories and to interdict the chemical precursors which are coming from outside the country , " wardak said .
nato military commanders acknowledge that more needs to be done to fight the opium and heroin trade .
us defense secretary robert gates believes that the taliban pocket between 60 and 80 million dollars per year from the sale of drugs .
" it is not only corrosive to good governance , it also directly funds the people that are killing afghans , americans and all our coalition partners , " gates said in budapest on thursday .
poppy cultivations have fallen by 19 per cent since last year , but afghan heroin still accounts for more than 90 per cent of the heroin circulating in europe . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

they say un-backed data on climate change is out of date . " we should prepare for a rise of sea levels of one meter this century , " said joachim schellnhuber , head of the potsdam institute for climate impact research -lrb- pik -rrb- , which advises the german government on environmental policy .
the melting rates of glaciers in the himalayas and the greenland ice-sheet have doubled or even tripled in recent years , due partly to increased greenhouse gas emissions by chinese power stations , he said .
his findings used data which was unavailable to the intergovernmental panel on climate change -lrb- ipcc -rrb- when it compiled its most recent global warming report .
in february 2007 , in the first volume of a landmark report , the nobel prize-winning ipcc predicted the oceans would rise by between 18 and 59 centimeters by 2100 .
the umbrella effect bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the earth is hurtling toward a warmer age at a quickening pace , say scientists further causes for concern include a drop in the amount of dirt particles in the air that protect from sunlight .
schellnhuber warned that cleaning air in beijing and in other large cities suffering from pollution problems by limiting car and power-plant emissions may raise global temperatures instead of lowering them .
aerosols , or particles suspended in air , have a cooling effect on the earth , countering global warming linked to carbon dioxide , said schellnhuber , explaining that a drop in aerosols in the atmosphere could cause a rapid rise in temperatures .
airborne pollutants act as an umbrella worldwide while co2 provides insulation , trapping heat attempting to escape into the atmosphere .
a rise in temperature because of declines in aerosols in the atmosphere can be offset by slashing co2 emissions , he said .
by not reducing carbon output , humanity " is closing the last door we have through which we can possibly influence the global climate , " schellnhuber warned .
urgent need for action bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : carbon emissions must be cut back - now the scientist stressed that there is what he called a 50-50 chance of limiting the global temperature rise to 2 degrees celsius -lrb- 3.6 degrees fahrenheit -rrb- before 2100 , which would avert the worst damage of climate change - so long as plans fleshed out by the g8 countries to reduce emissions are realized .
the united nations-sponsored climate-change talks this december in poznan , poland , and next year in copenhagen must reach an agreement to limit co2 , he added .
" there is really no time to spare , " schellnhuber said in an interview with bloomberg .
" technology will play a decisive role in limiting carbon but we have to move to a carbon-free world by the end of the century . "
german environment minister sigmar gabriel -lrb- spd -rrb- has warned that environmental issues risk being neglected because of the global financial crisis .
" we can spend relatively little money now or vast sums in decades to come , " he was quoted as saying in zeit online .

his breakthrough as a mediator came in namibia , which achieved independence in 1990 , capping years of work by the finnish national who served as special representative to the united nations secretary general and head of the un 's transition assistance team .
ahtisaari and his wife , eeva , were made honorary citizens of the southern african nation .
formative years ahtisaari has said his interest in peace mediation can be traced to his childhood years .
he was born on june 23 , 1937 in viipuri , a city that finland had to secede to the soviet union during the second world war , forcing 400,000 finns from karelia to relocate to finland .
the experience of being displaced fuelled his interest to promote peace and " help others , " he has said .
a second major achievement was the august 2005 peace deal between indonesia and the separatist free aceh movement -lrb- gam -rrb- aimed at ending a decades-long conflict in the indonesian province , and forged in the wake of the devastation caused by the december 2004 tsunami .
he has said mediation is " an ' art ' rather than an established practice , " adding that each conflict needs to be treated as a separate case .
mediation efforts ahtisaari 's hopes for the 2006 peace prize were dashed as the nobel committee selected muhammad yunus of bangladesh who founded the grameen bank that offers loans to the poor .
after qualifying as a teacher in 1959 , ahtisaari joined the foreign ministry in 1965 .
he served as ambassador to tanzania and held top posts in the foreign ministry and later in the un .
after his term as president 1994-2000 during which finland joined the european union , ahtisaari formed the crisis management initiative -lrb- cmi -rrb- that has been engaged in various mediation efforts .
while in office in 1999 , ahtisaari along with former russian prime minister viktor chernomyrdin and former us deputy secretary of state strobe talbott hammered out a plan to resolve the kosovo crisis that then-yugoslav president slobodan milosevic could accept .
accolades in 2000 he was called in to inspect irish republican army -lrb- ira -rrb- arms caches in northern ireland and later served as un special envoy for the horn of africa .
in recent years , ahtisaari has been engaged in discussing the future of the eu including turkey 's possible membership .
almost three years ago , in november 2005 , he was named special un envoy to kosovo but his efforts to bridge the divisions over kosovo 's status were unsuccessful and he stepped down after presenting his recommendations in february 2008 .
he has won numerous awards including the un cultural organization unesco 's felix houphouet-boigny peace prize for 2008 , named after the late president of ivory coast , as well as several honorary doctorates .
the funds from the unesco award were to be used for a foundation to promote peace , mediation and help post-conflict societies .
crowning glory the nobel , which is worth 10 million kronor -lrb- $ 1.5 million -rrb- , will be handed over at a ceremony in oslo on december 10 .
in 2007 , the peace prize was shared by the united nations climate body , the intergovernmental panel on climate change -lrb- ipcc -rrb- and al gore of the united states for their work on climate change .
for this year 's award , the five-member nobel committee had received 197 nominations for the coveted award including 33 organizations . dpa news agency -lrb- jp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" there is a formal agreement between the nato nations to fight drug trafficking , " a diplomat confirmed as defense ministers met in the hungarian capital budapest for a two-day meeting to discuss issues ranging from the war in afghanistan to georgia 's nato membership bid and piracy off the somali coast .
nato spokesman james appathurai said the alliance 's international security assistance force -lrb- isaf -rrb- would " act in concert with the afghans , against facilities and facilitators supporting the insurgency . "
the isaf currently has 50,700 soldiers in afghanistan , up from about 45,000 six months ago .
the german parliament agreed tuesday , oct .
7 to increase its contribution by 1,000 soldiers , raising its total to 4,500 .
us lobbies for afghan drug action sources also said that nato 's anti-narcotics efforts would be temporary , and would be open only to those countries willing to participate .
us defense secretary robert gates had pitched hard at the meeting for nato to strike at the heart of the afghan opium trade , which is believed to have contributed substantially to a reinvigorated taliban insurgency aimed at destabilizing president hamid karzai 's government .
" it -lrb- the opium trade -rrb- is not only corrosive to good governance , it also directly funds the people that are killing afghans , americans and all our coalition partners , " gates said in budapest on thursday .
the deal followed a request from afghan defense minister abdel rahim wardak , who on thursday asked nato to help his government target drug laboratories and seize imports of the chemicals needed to turn opium into heroin .
" we have asked nato to support our efforts to destroy the laboratories and to interdict the chemical precursors which are coming from outside the country , " wardak said .
germany in favor of afghan-led operations nato military commanders agreed that more needed to be done to fight the opium and heroin trade , a view shared by most alliance members .
the taliban are thought to be pocketing up to $ 80 million a year from the afghan narcotics industry , which is the source of some 92 percent of the world 's opium and heroin .
germany , spain , greece , poland , romania and italy had expressed scepticism over the plans , saying the fight against the afghan drugs trade was not part of nato 's mandate and should be addressed by the afghans themselves .
german defence minister franz josef jung said thursday germany was willing to assist in reconnaissance of trafficking routes and in training but any operations should be afghan-led .
" if this keeps an afghan face then it 's also in our interest that we support such an activity , " he told reporters on thursday .
ministers also worried that bombing laboratories would kill civilians and undermine the alliance 's popularity among ordinary afghans .
the compromise reached friday is to be reviewed when defense ministers meet again in poland in february . dw staff -lrb- dfm -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?
dw-world.de germany proposes fighting drug gangs in afghanistan german troops ought to assist afghan forces cracking down on drug gangs , defence minister franz josef jung said in a radio interview sunday .

his breakthrough as a mediator came in namibia , which achieved independence in 1990 , capping years of work by the finnish national who served as special representative to the united nations secretary general and head of the un 's transition assistance team .
ahtisaari and his wife , eeva , were made honorary citizens of the southern african nation .
formative years ahtisaari has said his interest in peace mediation can be traced to his childhood years .
he was born on june 23 , 1937 in viipuri , a city that finland had to secede to the soviet union during the second world war , forcing 400,000 finns from karelia to relocate to finland .
the experience of being displaced fuelled his interest to promote peace and " help others , " he has said .
a second major achievement was the august 2005 peace deal between indonesia and the separatist free aceh movement -lrb- gam -rrb- aimed at ending a decades-long conflict in the indonesian province , and forged in the wake of the devastation caused by the december 2004 tsunami .
he has said mediation is " an ' art ' rather than an established practice , " adding that each conflict needs to be treated as a separate case .
mediation efforts ahtisaari 's hopes for the 2006 peace prize were dashed as the nobel committee selected muhammad yunus of bangladesh who founded the grameen bank that offers loans to the poor .
after qualifying as a teacher in 1959 , ahtisaari joined the foreign ministry in 1965 .
he served as ambassador to tanzania and held top posts in the foreign ministry and later in the un .
after his term as president 1994-2000 during which finland joined the european union , ahtisaari formed the crisis management initiative -lrb- cmi -rrb- that has been engaged in various mediation efforts .
while in office in 1999 , ahtisaari along with former russian prime minister viktor chernomyrdin and former us deputy secretary of state strobe talbott hammered out a plan to resolve the kosovo crisis that then-yugoslav president slobodan milosevic could accept .
accolades in 2000 he was called in to inspect irish republican army -lrb- ira -rrb- arms caches in northern ireland and later served as un special envoy for the horn of africa .
in recent years , ahtisaari has been engaged in discussing the future of the eu including turkey 's possible membership .
almost three years ago , in november 2005 , he was named special un envoy to kosovo but his efforts to bridge the divisions over kosovo 's status were unsuccessful and he stepped down after presenting his recommendations in february 2008 .
he has won numerous awards including the un cultural organization unesco 's felix houphouet-boigny peace prize for 2008 , named after the late president of ivory coast , as well as several honorary doctorates .
the funds from the unesco award were to be used for a foundation to promote peace , mediation and help post-conflict societies .
crowning glory the nobel , which is worth 10 million kronor -lrb- $ 1.5 million -rrb- , will be handed over at a ceremony in oslo on december 10 .
in 2007 , the peace prize was shared by the united nations climate body , the intergovernmental panel on climate change -lrb- ipcc -rrb- and al gore of the united states for their work on climate change .
for this year 's award , the five-member nobel committee had received 197 nominations for the coveted award including 33 organizations . dpa news agency -lrb- jp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

however , british soccer is holding its breath as the credit crunch starts to bite in its top flight . hoeness was quoted in friday 's edition of the bild newspaper as saying that german soccer is well off even though income may drop .
" i believe that german soccer has less to worry than other countries , " said hoeness .
" the big question , however , is if we are moving into a recession where the advertising spending drops and companies are less inclined to pay money for sponsorship . "
the german 1974 world cup winner said that he was concerned for clubs in some other countries .
" here and there clubs could go under , but not the big ones .
chelsea , for instance , has its debts with abramovich , but they are not in danger because the club belongs to him .
there is no bank involved that can close the club , as long as abramovich does not demand his money back , " hoeness said .
" one needs to see if the ice on which everything was built will last . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : we 're in the money : bayern and hoeness are confident hoeness said that it was not certain that foreign investors in english soccer would continue investing such huge sums after losing a lot of money on the stock exchange .
" it would be good for competition if clubs in future actually had to earn the money they spent , " said hoeness .
he said that he was not concerned about his own club bayern munich , as they were financially " in a very strong position . "
meanwhile british soccer is holding its breath to see just how badly it will be affected by the collapse of many of the world 's banks and the ever-worsening financial crisis .
british game suffering backlash once regarded in britain as the people 's game , the sport is now in danger of being torn apart , with several teams ' sponsors already having gone down the pan .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : man utd 's sponsor aig had to be bailed out in the us manchester united shirt sponsor aig was bailed out by the us government , as was newcastle united 's shirt sponsor , northern rock , by the british government .
work on liverpool 's new ground has been delayed as owners keep a close eye on exactly what is happening to their cash .
the overseas investment that had been looked upon as the ideal blueprint by many of the country 's top clubs is now in danger of becoming the poisoned chalice .
what good is investment , many clubs are asking themselves , if it ca n't be guaranteed ?
perhaps the one club most affected so far is west ham united , the east london club for whom the collapse this week of iceland 's second biggest bank , landsbanki , could yet spell disaster for their icelandic owners and for their own future .
rumors persist that the bank - now under the control of the iceland government - could repatriate any overseas assets .
icelandic troubles felt in london 's east end for that , read west ham and their chairman bjorgolfur gudmundsson , who paid 85 million pounds for the club in november 2006 but who may yet be forced to put up the for-sale sign .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : gudmundsson 's west ham is reeling from the icelandic crunch gudmundsson , who was sacked as chairman of the bank on tuesday , has stressed that the club is safe and claims that no players have to be sold .
but west ham vice-chairman asgeir fridgeirsson said on tuesday that players would have to go before any spending could happen in the january transfer window .
" west ham united has one of the biggest squads in the premier league , " fridgeirsson said on tuesday .
" it is very unlikely -lrb- the chairman -rrb- will be willing to put in more money to buy players this january window . "
when he took over as manager in september , gianfranco zola had seemed confident that he would have money to spend in january .
west ham told the dpa news agency on wednesday that zola has yet to request a meeting with the club 's board and nor has one been arranged , but it would seem to be only a matter of time before the italian requests clarification of the situation .
in a statement , placed on the club 's official website on tuesday , west ham chief executive scott duxbury reiterated that players would have to be sold before any new spending could be sanctioned .
" since his appointment , gianfranco zola has made it quite clear that his first team squad is too large and needs to be reduced so he can effectively coach the team , " the statement read .
" once this has happened and if the manager requires further players , then the club will acquire them . "
hammers hammered by credit crunch the collapse of landsbanki followed hot on the heels of the implosion of their shirt sponsor , the tour operator xl , which went bust in september .
that cost the club an estimated 5 million pounds , and with gudmundsson a guarantor of 163 million pounds to xl , west ham 's future looks less than rosy .
the west ham story is just one sorry tale and if the crisis deepens , others could yet be affected in a similar way .
bildunterschrift : the lse has been hit hard and british clubs have shuddered with the resulting tremors the football association chairman lord triesman warned on tuesday that the crisis could cripple some club who are heavily in debt , estimating that english clubs owe a total of 3 billion pounds .
and uefa general secretary david taylor has warned that clubs with huge debt could be excluded from future european competitions would see those clubs finances further depleted .
the biggest worry for west ham is that the crisis may not yet have reached its lowest point and fridgeirsson 's words had a nasty ring to them on tuesday .
" it is , of course , a blow for -lrb- gudmundsson -rrb- and his financial strength , but he himself has a number of other investments that are doing quite well at the moment so there is no reason to fear that he will not honor his commitment to west ham football club , " he said .
" he -lrb- gudmundsson -rrb- is not absolutely sure how this will directly affect him , but one thing he is sure of is that this will have no implications on the other investments of him and his family . "

he served as ambassador to tanzania and held top posts in the foreign ministry and later in the un .
after his term as president 1994-2000 during which finland joined the european union , ahtisaari formed the crisis management initiative -lrb- cmi -rrb- that has been engaged in various mediation efforts .
while in office in 1999 , ahtisaari along with former russian prime minister viktor chernomyrdin and former us deputy secretary of state strobe talbott hammered out a plan to resolve the kosovo crisis that then-yugoslav president slobodan milosevic could accept .
accolades in 2000 he was called in to inspect irish republican army -lrb- ira -rrb- arms caches in northern ireland and later served as un special envoy for the horn of africa .
in recent years , ahtisaari has been engaged in discussing the future of the eu including turkey 's possible membership .
almost three years ago , in november 2005 , he was named special un envoy to kosovo but his efforts to bridge the divisions over kosovo 's status were unsuccessful and he stepped down after presenting his recommendations in february 2008 .
he has won numerous awards including the un cultural organization unesco 's felix houphouet-boigny peace prize for 2008 , named after the late president of ivory coast , as well as several honorary doctorates .
the funds from the unesco award were to be used for a foundation to promote peace , mediation and help post-conflict societies .
crowning glory the nobel , which is worth 10 million kronor -lrb- $ 1.5 million -rrb- , will be handed over at a ceremony in oslo on december 10 .
in 2007 , the peace prize was shared by the united nations climate body , the intergovernmental panel on climate change -lrb- ipcc -rrb- and al gore of the united states for their work on climate change .
for this year 's award , the five-member nobel committee had received 197 nominations for the coveted award including 33 organizations . dpa news agency -lrb- jp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the directory , which telekom maintains had been stolen , had contained the private numbers of high-profile politicians and celebrities , as well as customer mobile phone numbers , addresses , dates of birth and , in some cases , email addresses .
bank information or credit card numbers were not accessed , said the bonn-based firm .
in germany , most wireless-line numbers are ex-directory and confidential .
telekom chief executive rene obermann said at the company 's head office in bonn that in future , the company would voluntarily brief the public on a dedicated web site about " critical data-privacy incidents " undergoing criminal investigation .
" in the race against data theft , we want to be at least one step ahead at all times , " he said .
a seventh board department will be set up to deal with privacy and the company will issue data privacy reports every six months .
the former german telecommunications industry monopolizer is also to stop using an internet-style system where any computer can be used to query its databanks using the right password .
employees and sales partners will only be able to access sensitive systems from specific computers .

10 stepped up diplomatic pressure to regulate financial markets under an eight-point plan , berlin denied it had plans to nationalize commercial banks . however , berlin may inject equity into troubled german banks , its two top financial officials signaled as they arrived in washington for group of seven -lrb- g7 -rrb- talks .
as the stock market crash worsened , finance minister peer steinbrueck said , " the downward spiral has gathered pace .
case by case answers are not going to help any more , even in germany . "
" the financial sector as a whole requires a solution of a stabilizing character , " he added .
axel weber , president of the german bundesbank and a senior board member of the european central bank , said it was a possibility to inject capital into banks temporarily as britain had done .
there was no alternative but to act , said weber .
so far , germany has only had to guarantee a single , 50-billion- euro -lrb- $ 70-billion -rrb- bail-out for a mortgage lender , hypo real estate , and it has been refusing to contribute to a joint eu bail-out for other banks .
instead , its leaders have pointedly criticized deregulated financial markets in britain and the united states and demanded action to bring markets under tighter rules .
merkel keen on regulation bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel and steinbrueck want financial regulation in a speech friday in dresden , german chancellor angela merkel said , " in this crisis , we have to see the opportunity to persuade those who have not been persuaded so far that rules have to be established . "
ahead of a meeting in washington on saturday , finance minister steinbrueck this week offered finance ministers an english translation of the eight-point plan of reforms he unveiled in a speech to parliament on september 26 .
merkel said thursday she would not rule out increased state intervention in the panic , but finance ministry spokesman torsten albig said friday there were " no current considerations " of taking over banks .
albig admitted that government and central bank intervention had failed to stop the world slide in confidence .
" we 've evidently not found a means that fundamentally calms the markets , " he said .
merkel 's deputy spokesman thomas steg added that no decisions about conceivable future actions had been taken .
he denied any disagreement between merkel and steinbrueck , who belong to different political parties .
about half the german retail banking system is already state-run , with the federal and state governments either owning banks of their own or overseeing trustee savings banks and non-profit cooperative banks .
among points in the eight-point plan are a call to put " innovative financial instruments " back onto bank balance sheets and increase bank liquidity " cushions . "
personal legal liability for bankers bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : those responsible for the crisis should take the strain berlin also wants greater personal legal liability imposed on brokers and bank executives as well as changes to their pay incentives to stop them taking big risks to earn more .
in addition , steinbrueck wants to stop banks packaging up mortgages and other loans as securities and selling these completely , eliminating all the bank 's own risk .
in the plan , which has the status of berlin government policy , he also said he wants regulatory authorities in the different countries to confer and work by standard rules . dpa news agency -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" there is a formal agreement between the nato nations to fight drug trafficking , " a diplomat confirmed as defense ministers met in the hungarian capital budapest for a two-day meeting to discuss issues ranging from the war in afghanistan to georgia 's nato membership bid and piracy off the somali coast .
nato spokesman james appathurai said the alliance 's international security assistance force -lrb- isaf -rrb- would " act in concert with the afghans , against facilities and facilitators supporting the insurgency . "
the isaf currently has 50,700 soldiers in afghanistan , up from about 45,000 six months ago .
the german parliament agreed tuesday , oct .
7 to increase its contribution by 1,000 soldiers , raising its total to 4,500 .
us lobbies for afghan drug action sources also said that nato 's anti-narcotics efforts would be temporary , and would be open only to those countries willing to participate .
us defense secretary robert gates had pitched hard at the meeting for nato to strike at the heart of the afghan opium trade , which is believed to have contributed substantially to a reinvigorated taliban insurgency aimed at destabilizing president hamid karzai 's government .
" it -lrb- the opium trade -rrb- is not only corrosive to good governance , it also directly funds the people that are killing afghans , americans and all our coalition partners , " gates said in budapest on thursday .
the deal followed a request from afghan defense minister abdel rahim wardak , who on thursday asked nato to help his government target drug laboratories and seize imports of the chemicals needed to turn opium into heroin .
" we have asked nato to support our efforts to destroy the laboratories and to interdict the chemical precursors which are coming from outside the country , " wardak said .
germany in favor of afghan-led operations nato military commanders agreed that more needed to be done to fight the opium and heroin trade , a view shared by most alliance members .
the taliban are thought to be pocketing up to $ 80 million a year from the afghan narcotics industry , which is the source of some 92 percent of the world 's opium and heroin .
germany , spain , greece , poland , romania and italy had expressed scepticism over the plans , saying the fight against the afghan drugs trade was not part of nato 's mandate and should be addressed by the afghans themselves .
german defence minister franz josef jung said thursday germany was willing to assist in reconnaissance of trafficking routes and in training but any operations should be afghan-led .
" if this keeps an afghan face then it 's also in our interest that we support such an activity , " he told reporters on thursday .
ministers also worried that bombing laboratories would kill civilians and undermine the alliance 's popularity among ordinary afghans .
the compromise reached friday is to be reviewed when defense ministers meet again in poland in february . dw staff -lrb- dfm -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

they say un-backed data on climate change is out of date . " we should prepare for a rise of sea levels of one meter this century , " said joachim schellnhuber , head of the potsdam institute for climate impact research -lrb- pik -rrb- , which advises the german government on environmental policy .
the melting rates of glaciers in the himalayas and the greenland ice-sheet have doubled or even tripled in recent years , due partly to increased greenhouse gas emissions by chinese power stations , he said .
his findings used data which was unavailable to the intergovernmental panel on climate change -lrb- ipcc -rrb- when it compiled its most recent global warming report .
in february 2007 , in the first volume of a landmark report , the nobel prize-winning ipcc predicted the oceans would rise by between 18 and 59 centimeters by 2100 .

schellnhuber warned that cleaning air in beijing and in other large cities suffering from pollution problems by limiting car and power-plant emissions may raise global temperatures instead of lowering them .
aerosols , or particles suspended in air , have a cooling effect on the earth , countering global warming linked to carbon dioxide , said schellnhuber , explaining that a drop in aerosols in the atmosphere could cause a rapid rise in temperatures .
airborne pollutants act as an umbrella worldwide while co2 provides insulation , trapping heat attempting to escape into the atmosphere .
a rise in temperature because of declines in aerosols in the atmosphere can be offset by slashing co2 emissions , he said .
by not reducing carbon output , humanity " is closing the last door we have through which we can possibly influence the global climate , " schellnhuber warned .
urgent need for action bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : carbon emissions must be cut back - now the scientist stressed that there is what he called a 50-50 chance of limiting the global temperature rise to 2 degrees celsius -lrb- 3.6 degrees fahrenheit -rrb- before 2100 , which would avert the worst damage of climate change - so long as plans fleshed out by the g8 countries to reduce emissions are realized .
the united nations-sponsored climate-change talks this december in poznan , poland , and next year in copenhagen must reach an agreement to limit co2 , he added .

" there is a formal agreement between the nato nations to fight drug trafficking , " a diplomat confirmed as defense ministers met in the hungarian capital budapest for a two-day meeting to discuss issues ranging from the war in afghanistan to georgia 's nato membership bid and piracy off the somali coast .
nato spokesman james appathurai said the alliance 's international security assistance force -lrb- isaf -rrb- would " act in concert with the afghans , against facilities and facilitators supporting the insurgency . "
the isaf currently has 50,700 soldiers in afghanistan , up from about 45,000 six months ago .
the german parliament agreed tuesday , oct .
7 to increase its contribution by 1,000 soldiers , raising its total to 4,500 .
us lobbies for afghan drug action sources also said that nato 's anti-narcotics efforts would be temporary , and would be open only to those countries willing to participate .
us defense secretary robert gates had pitched hard at the meeting for nato to strike at the heart of the afghan opium trade , which is believed to have contributed substantially to a reinvigorated taliban insurgency aimed at destabilizing president hamid karzai 's government .
" it -lrb- the opium trade -rrb- is not only corrosive to good governance , it also directly funds the people that are killing afghans , americans and all our coalition partners , " gates said in budapest on thursday .
the deal followed a request from afghan defense minister abdel rahim wardak , who on thursday asked nato to help his government target drug laboratories and seize imports of the chemicals needed to turn opium into heroin .
" we have asked nato to support our efforts to destroy the laboratories and to interdict the chemical precursors which are coming from outside the country , " wardak said .
germany in favor of afghan-led operations nato military commanders agreed that more needed to be done to fight the opium and heroin trade , a view shared by most alliance members .
the taliban are thought to be pocketing up to $ 80 million a year from the afghan narcotics industry , which is the source of some 92 percent of the world 's opium and heroin .
germany , spain , greece , poland , romania and italy had expressed scepticism over the plans , saying the fight against the afghan drugs trade was not part of nato 's mandate and should be addressed by the afghans themselves .
german defence minister franz josef jung said thursday germany was willing to assist in reconnaissance of trafficking routes and in training but any operations should be afghan-led .
" if this keeps an afghan face then it 's also in our interest that we support such an activity , " he told reporters on thursday .
ministers also worried that bombing laboratories would kill civilians and undermine the alliance 's popularity among ordinary afghans .
the compromise reached friday is to be reviewed when defense ministers meet again in poland in february . dw staff -lrb- dfm -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

however , british soccer is holding its breath as the credit crunch starts to bite in its top flight . hoeness was quoted in friday 's edition of the bild newspaper as saying that german soccer is well off even though income may drop .
" i believe that german soccer has less to worry than other countries , " said hoeness .
" the big question , however , is if we are moving into a recession where the advertising spending drops and companies are less inclined to pay money for sponsorship . "
the german 1974 world cup winner said that he was concerned for clubs in some other countries .
" here and there clubs could go under , but not the big ones .
chelsea , for instance , has its debts with abramovich , but they are not in danger because the club belongs to him .
there is no bank involved that can close the club , as long as abramovich does not demand his money back , " hoeness said .
" one needs to see if the ice on which everything was built will last . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : we 're in the money : bayern and hoeness are confident hoeness said that it was not certain that foreign investors in english soccer would continue investing such huge sums after losing a lot of money on the stock exchange .
" it would be good for competition if clubs in future actually had to earn the money they spent , " said hoeness .
he said that he was not concerned about his own club bayern munich , as they were financially " in a very strong position . "
meanwhile british soccer is holding its breath to see just how badly it will be affected by the collapse of many of the world 's banks and the ever-worsening financial crisis .
british game suffering backlash once regarded in britain as the people 's game , the sport is now in danger of being torn apart , with several teams ' sponsors already having gone down the pan .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : man utd 's sponsor aig had to be bailed out in the us manchester united shirt sponsor aig was bailed out by the us government , as was newcastle united 's shirt sponsor , northern rock , by the british government .
work on liverpool 's new ground has been delayed as owners keep a close eye on exactly what is happening to their cash .
the overseas investment that had been looked upon as the ideal blueprint by many of the country 's top clubs is now in danger of becoming the poisoned chalice .
what good is investment , many clubs are asking themselves , if it ca n't be guaranteed ?
perhaps the one club most affected so far is west ham united , the east london club for whom the collapse this week of iceland 's second biggest bank , landsbanki , could yet spell disaster for their icelandic owners and for their own future .
rumors persist that the bank - now under the control of the iceland government - could repatriate any overseas assets .
icelandic troubles felt in london 's east end for that , read west ham and their chairman bjorgolfur gudmundsson , who paid 85 million pounds for the club in november 2006 but who may yet be forced to put up the for-sale sign .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : gudmundsson 's west ham is reeling from the icelandic crunch gudmundsson , who was sacked as chairman of the bank on tuesday , has stressed that the club is safe and claims that no players have to be sold .
but west ham vice-chairman asgeir fridgeirsson said on tuesday that players would have to go before any spending could happen in the january transfer window .
" west ham united has one of the biggest squads in the premier league , " fridgeirsson said on tuesday .
" it is very unlikely -lrb- the chairman -rrb- will be willing to put in more money to buy players this january window . "
when he took over as manager in september , gianfranco zola had seemed confident that he would have money to spend in january .
west ham told the dpa news agency on wednesday that zola has yet to request a meeting with the club 's board and nor has one been arranged , but it would seem to be only a matter of time before the italian requests clarification of the situation .
in a statement , placed on the club 's official website on tuesday , west ham chief executive scott duxbury reiterated that players would have to be sold before any new spending could be sanctioned .
" since his appointment , gianfranco zola has made it quite clear that his first team squad is too large and needs to be reduced so he can effectively coach the team , " the statement read .
" once this has happened and if the manager requires further players , then the club will acquire them . "
hammers hammered by credit crunch the collapse of landsbanki followed hot on the heels of the implosion of their shirt sponsor , the tour operator xl , which went bust in september .
that cost the club an estimated 5 million pounds , and with gudmundsson a guarantor of 163 million pounds to xl , west ham 's future looks less than rosy .
the west ham story is just one sorry tale and if the crisis deepens , others could yet be affected in a similar way .
bildunterschrift : the lse has been hit hard and british clubs have shuddered with the resulting tremors the football association chairman lord triesman warned on tuesday that the crisis could cripple some club who are heavily in debt , estimating that english clubs owe a total of 3 billion pounds .
and uefa general secretary david taylor has warned that clubs with huge debt could be excluded from future european competitions would see those clubs finances further depleted .
the biggest worry for west ham is that the crisis may not yet have reached its lowest point and fridgeirsson 's words had a nasty ring to them on tuesday .
" it is , of course , a blow for -lrb- gudmundsson -rrb- and his financial strength , but he himself has a number of other investments that are doing quite well at the moment so there is no reason to fear that he will not honor his commitment to west ham football club , " he said .
" he -lrb- gudmundsson -rrb- is not absolutely sure how this will directly affect him , but one thing he is sure of is that this will have no implications on the other investments of him and his family . "

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de climate -pipe- 10.10.2008 scientist warns climate change happening faster than predicted großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : scientists warn sea levels are rising faster than predicted global warming calculations have been too optimistic and global sea levels are likely to rise a full meter this century , senior german scientists have warned .
they say un-backed data on climate change is out of date . " we should prepare for a rise of sea levels of one meter this century , " said joachim schellnhuber , head of the potsdam institute for climate impact research -lrb- pik -rrb- , which advises the german government on environmental policy .
the melting rates of glaciers in the himalayas and the greenland ice-sheet have doubled or even tripled in recent years , due partly to increased greenhouse gas emissions by chinese power stations , he said .
his findings used data which was unavailable to the intergovernmental panel on climate change -lrb- ipcc -rrb- when it compiled its most recent global warming report .
in february 2007 , in the first volume of a landmark report , the nobel prize-winning ipcc predicted the oceans would rise by between 18 and 59 centimeters by 2100 .
the umbrella effect bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the earth is hurtling toward a warmer age at a quickening pace , say scientists further causes for concern include a drop in the amount of dirt particles in the air that protect from sunlight .
schellnhuber warned that cleaning air in beijing and in other large cities suffering from pollution problems by limiting car and power-plant emissions may raise global temperatures instead of lowering them .
aerosols , or particles suspended in air , have a cooling effect on the earth , countering global warming linked to carbon dioxide , said schellnhuber , explaining that a drop in aerosols in the atmosphere could cause a rapid rise in temperatures .
airborne pollutants act as an umbrella worldwide while co2 provides insulation , trapping heat attempting to escape into the atmosphere .
a rise in temperature because of declines in aerosols in the atmosphere can be offset by slashing co2 emissions , he said .
by not reducing carbon output , humanity " is closing the last door we have through which we can possibly influence the global climate , " schellnhuber warned .
urgent need for action bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : carbon emissions must be cut back - now the scientist stressed that there is what he called a 50-50 chance of limiting the global temperature rise to 2 degrees celsius -lrb- 3.6 degrees fahrenheit -rrb- before 2100 , which would avert the worst damage of climate change - so long as plans fleshed out by the g8 countries to reduce emissions are realized .
the united nations-sponsored climate-change talks this december in poznan , poland , and next year in copenhagen must reach an agreement to limit co2 , he added .
" there is really no time to spare , " schellnhuber said in an interview with bloomberg .
" technology will play a decisive role in limiting carbon but we have to move to a carbon-free world by the end of the century . "
german environment minister sigmar gabriel -lrb- spd -rrb- has warned that environmental issues risk being neglected because of the global financial crisis .
" we can spend relatively little money now or vast sums in decades to come , " he was quoted as saying in zeit online .
" we are wealthy enough to afford climate protection - and we are too badly-off to ignore it . " dw staff -lrb- jp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?
dw-world.de sociologist : climate change is a chance to work together climate change offers europe a chance to change the way the world solves problems by drawing in poorer countries , says sociologist ulrich beck in an exclusive essay for dw-world.de. -lrb- 22.07.2008 -rrb- environmentalists slam g8 's emissions deal as meaningless as g8 leaders trumpeted their landmark deal to cut global emissions by 50 per cent by 2050 , the ' 50/50 ' agreement , which has yet to be sealed , was quickly lambasted by environmentalists as virtually meaningless .

as the stock market crash worsened , finance minister peer steinbrueck said , " the downward spiral has gathered pace .
case by case answers are not going to help any more , even in germany . "
" the financial sector as a whole requires a solution of a stabilizing character , " he added .
axel weber , president of the german bundesbank and a senior board member of the european central bank , said it was a possibility to inject capital into banks temporarily as britain had done .
there was no alternative but to act , said weber .
so far , germany has only had to guarantee a single , 50-billion- euro -lrb- $ 70-billion -rrb- bail-out for a mortgage lender , hypo real estate , and it has been refusing to contribute to a joint eu bail-out for other banks .
instead , its leaders have pointedly criticized deregulated financial markets in britain and the united states and demanded action to bring markets under tighter rules .

ahead of a meeting in washington on saturday , finance minister steinbrueck this week offered finance ministers an english translation of the eight-point plan of reforms he unveiled in a speech to parliament on september 26 .
merkel said thursday she would not rule out increased state intervention in the panic , but finance ministry spokesman torsten albig said friday there were " no current considerations " of taking over banks .
albig admitted that government and central bank intervention had failed to stop the world slide in confidence .
" we 've evidently not found a means that fundamentally calms the markets , " he said .
merkel 's deputy spokesman thomas steg added that no decisions about conceivable future actions had been taken .
he denied any disagreement between merkel and steinbrueck , who belong to different political parties .
about half the german retail banking system is already state-run , with the federal and state governments either owning banks of their own or overseeing trustee savings banks and non-profit cooperative banks .
among points in the eight-point plan are a call to put " innovative financial instruments " back onto bank balance sheets and increase bank liquidity " cushions . "

however , british soccer is holding its breath as the credit crunch starts to bite in its top flight . hoeness was quoted in friday 's edition of the bild newspaper as saying that german soccer is well off even though income may drop .
" i believe that german soccer has less to worry than other countries , " said hoeness .
" the big question , however , is if we are moving into a recession where the advertising spending drops and companies are less inclined to pay money for sponsorship . "
the german 1974 world cup winner said that he was concerned for clubs in some other countries .
" here and there clubs could go under , but not the big ones .
chelsea , for instance , has its debts with abramovich , but they are not in danger because the club belongs to him .
there is no bank involved that can close the club , as long as abramovich does not demand his money back , " hoeness said .
" one needs to see if the ice on which everything was built will last . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : we 're in the money : bayern and hoeness are confident hoeness said that it was not certain that foreign investors in english soccer would continue investing such huge sums after losing a lot of money on the stock exchange .
" it would be good for competition if clubs in future actually had to earn the money they spent , " said hoeness .
he said that he was not concerned about his own club bayern munich , as they were financially " in a very strong position . "
meanwhile british soccer is holding its breath to see just how badly it will be affected by the collapse of many of the world 's banks and the ever-worsening financial crisis .
british game suffering backlash once regarded in britain as the people 's game , the sport is now in danger of being torn apart , with several teams ' sponsors already having gone down the pan .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : man utd 's sponsor aig had to be bailed out in the us manchester united shirt sponsor aig was bailed out by the us government , as was newcastle united 's shirt sponsor , northern rock , by the british government .
work on liverpool 's new ground has been delayed as owners keep a close eye on exactly what is happening to their cash .
the overseas investment that had been looked upon as the ideal blueprint by many of the country 's top clubs is now in danger of becoming the poisoned chalice .
what good is investment , many clubs are asking themselves , if it ca n't be guaranteed ?
perhaps the one club most affected so far is west ham united , the east london club for whom the collapse this week of iceland 's second biggest bank , landsbanki , could yet spell disaster for their icelandic owners and for their own future .
rumors persist that the bank - now under the control of the iceland government - could repatriate any overseas assets .
icelandic troubles felt in london 's east end for that , read west ham and their chairman bjorgolfur gudmundsson , who paid 85 million pounds for the club in november 2006 but who may yet be forced to put up the for-sale sign .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : gudmundsson 's west ham is reeling from the icelandic crunch gudmundsson , who was sacked as chairman of the bank on tuesday , has stressed that the club is safe and claims that no players have to be sold .
but west ham vice-chairman asgeir fridgeirsson said on tuesday that players would have to go before any spending could happen in the january transfer window .
" west ham united has one of the biggest squads in the premier league , " fridgeirsson said on tuesday .
" it is very unlikely -lrb- the chairman -rrb- will be willing to put in more money to buy players this january window . "
when he took over as manager in september , gianfranco zola had seemed confident that he would have money to spend in january .
west ham told the dpa news agency on wednesday that zola has yet to request a meeting with the club 's board and nor has one been arranged , but it would seem to be only a matter of time before the italian requests clarification of the situation .
in a statement , placed on the club 's official website on tuesday , west ham chief executive scott duxbury reiterated that players would have to be sold before any new spending could be sanctioned .
" since his appointment , gianfranco zola has made it quite clear that his first team squad is too large and needs to be reduced so he can effectively coach the team , " the statement read .
" once this has happened and if the manager requires further players , then the club will acquire them . "
hammers hammered by credit crunch the collapse of landsbanki followed hot on the heels of the implosion of their shirt sponsor , the tour operator xl , which went bust in september .

however , british soccer is holding its breath as the credit crunch starts to bite in its top flight . hoeness was quoted in friday 's edition of the bild newspaper as saying that german soccer is well off even though income may drop .
" i believe that german soccer has less to worry than other countries , " said hoeness .
" the big question , however , is if we are moving into a recession where the advertising spending drops and companies are less inclined to pay money for sponsorship . "
the german 1974 world cup winner said that he was concerned for clubs in some other countries .
" here and there clubs could go under , but not the big ones .
chelsea , for instance , has its debts with abramovich , but they are not in danger because the club belongs to him .
there is no bank involved that can close the club , as long as abramovich does not demand his money back , " hoeness said .
" one needs to see if the ice on which everything was built will last . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : we 're in the money : bayern and hoeness are confident hoeness said that it was not certain that foreign investors in english soccer would continue investing such huge sums after losing a lot of money on the stock exchange .
" it would be good for competition if clubs in future actually had to earn the money they spent , " said hoeness .
he said that he was not concerned about his own club bayern munich , as they were financially " in a very strong position . "
meanwhile british soccer is holding its breath to see just how badly it will be affected by the collapse of many of the world 's banks and the ever-worsening financial crisis .
british game suffering backlash once regarded in britain as the people 's game , the sport is now in danger of being torn apart , with several teams ' sponsors already having gone down the pan .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : man utd 's sponsor aig had to be bailed out in the us manchester united shirt sponsor aig was bailed out by the us government , as was newcastle united 's shirt sponsor , northern rock , by the british government .
work on liverpool 's new ground has been delayed as owners keep a close eye on exactly what is happening to their cash .
the overseas investment that had been looked upon as the ideal blueprint by many of the country 's top clubs is now in danger of becoming the poisoned chalice .
what good is investment , many clubs are asking themselves , if it ca n't be guaranteed ?
perhaps the one club most affected so far is west ham united , the east london club for whom the collapse this week of iceland 's second biggest bank , landsbanki , could yet spell disaster for their icelandic owners and for their own future .
rumors persist that the bank - now under the control of the iceland government - could repatriate any overseas assets .
icelandic troubles felt in london 's east end for that , read west ham and their chairman bjorgolfur gudmundsson , who paid 85 million pounds for the club in november 2006 but who may yet be forced to put up the for-sale sign .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : gudmundsson 's west ham is reeling from the icelandic crunch gudmundsson , who was sacked as chairman of the bank on tuesday , has stressed that the club is safe and claims that no players have to be sold .
but west ham vice-chairman asgeir fridgeirsson said on tuesday that players would have to go before any spending could happen in the january transfer window .
" west ham united has one of the biggest squads in the premier league , " fridgeirsson said on tuesday .
" it is very unlikely -lrb- the chairman -rrb- will be willing to put in more money to buy players this january window . "
when he took over as manager in september , gianfranco zola had seemed confident that he would have money to spend in january .
west ham told the dpa news agency on wednesday that zola has yet to request a meeting with the club 's board and nor has one been arranged , but it would seem to be only a matter of time before the italian requests clarification of the situation .
in a statement , placed on the club 's official website on tuesday , west ham chief executive scott duxbury reiterated that players would have to be sold before any new spending could be sanctioned .
" since his appointment , gianfranco zola has made it quite clear that his first team squad is too large and needs to be reduced so he can effectively coach the team , " the statement read .
" once this has happened and if the manager requires further players , then the club will acquire them . "
hammers hammered by credit crunch the collapse of landsbanki followed hot on the heels of the implosion of their shirt sponsor , the tour operator xl , which went bust in september .
that cost the club an estimated 5 million pounds , and with gudmundsson a guarantor of 163 million pounds to xl , west ham 's future looks less than rosy .
the west ham story is just one sorry tale and if the crisis deepens , others could yet be affected in a similar way .

" there is a formal agreement between the nato nations to fight drug trafficking , " a diplomat confirmed as defense ministers met in the hungarian capital budapest for a two-day meeting to discuss issues ranging from the war in afghanistan to georgia 's nato membership bid and piracy off the somali coast .
nato spokesman james appathurai said the alliance 's international security assistance force -lrb- isaf -rrb- would " act in concert with the afghans , against facilities and facilitators supporting the insurgency . "
the isaf currently has 50,700 soldiers in afghanistan , up from about 45,000 six months ago .
the german parliament agreed tuesday , oct .
7 to increase its contribution by 1,000 soldiers , raising its total to 4,500 .
us lobbies for afghan drug action sources also said that nato 's anti-narcotics efforts would be temporary , and would be open only to those countries willing to participate .
us defense secretary robert gates had pitched hard at the meeting for nato to strike at the heart of the afghan opium trade , which is believed to have contributed substantially to a reinvigorated taliban insurgency aimed at destabilizing president hamid karzai 's government .
" it -lrb- the opium trade -rrb- is not only corrosive to good governance , it also directly funds the people that are killing afghans , americans and all our coalition partners , " gates said in budapest on thursday .
the deal followed a request from afghan defense minister abdel rahim wardak , who on thursday asked nato to help his government target drug laboratories and seize imports of the chemicals needed to turn opium into heroin .
" we have asked nato to support our efforts to destroy the laboratories and to interdict the chemical precursors which are coming from outside the country , " wardak said .
germany in favor of afghan-led operations nato military commanders agreed that more needed to be done to fight the opium and heroin trade , a view shared by most alliance members .
the taliban are thought to be pocketing up to $ 80 million a year from the afghan narcotics industry , which is the source of some 92 percent of the world 's opium and heroin .
germany , spain , greece , poland , romania and italy had expressed scepticism over the plans , saying the fight against the afghan drugs trade was not part of nato 's mandate and should be addressed by the afghans themselves .
german defence minister franz josef jung said thursday germany was willing to assist in reconnaissance of trafficking routes and in training but any operations should be afghan-led .
" if this keeps an afghan face then it 's also in our interest that we support such an activity , " he told reporters on thursday .
ministers also worried that bombing laboratories would kill civilians and undermine the alliance 's popularity among ordinary afghans .
the compromise reached friday is to be reviewed when defense ministers meet again in poland in february . dw staff -lrb- dfm -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

his breakthrough as a mediator came in namibia , which achieved independence in 1990 , capping years of work by the finnish national who served as special representative to the united nations secretary general and head of the un 's transition assistance team .
ahtisaari and his wife , eeva , were made honorary citizens of the southern african nation .
formative years ahtisaari has said his interest in peace mediation can be traced to his childhood years .
he was born on june 23 , 1937 in viipuri , a city that finland had to secede to the soviet union during the second world war , forcing 400,000 finns from karelia to relocate to finland .
the experience of being displaced fuelled his interest to promote peace and " help others , " he has said .
a second major achievement was the august 2005 peace deal between indonesia and the separatist free aceh movement -lrb- gam -rrb- aimed at ending a decades-long conflict in the indonesian province , and forged in the wake of the devastation caused by the december 2004 tsunami .
he has said mediation is " an ' art ' rather than an established practice , " adding that each conflict needs to be treated as a separate case .
mediation efforts ahtisaari 's hopes for the 2006 peace prize were dashed as the nobel committee selected muhammad yunus of bangladesh who founded the grameen bank that offers loans to the poor .
after qualifying as a teacher in 1959 , ahtisaari joined the foreign ministry in 1965 .
he served as ambassador to tanzania and held top posts in the foreign ministry and later in the un .
after his term as president 1994-2000 during which finland joined the european union , ahtisaari formed the crisis management initiative -lrb- cmi -rrb- that has been engaged in various mediation efforts .
while in office in 1999 , ahtisaari along with former russian prime minister viktor chernomyrdin and former us deputy secretary of state strobe talbott hammered out a plan to resolve the kosovo crisis that then-yugoslav president slobodan milosevic could accept .
accolades in 2000 he was called in to inspect irish republican army -lrb- ira -rrb- arms caches in northern ireland and later served as un special envoy for the horn of africa .
in recent years , ahtisaari has been engaged in discussing the future of the eu including turkey 's possible membership .
almost three years ago , in november 2005 , he was named special un envoy to kosovo but his efforts to bridge the divisions over kosovo 's status were unsuccessful and he stepped down after presenting his recommendations in february 2008 .
he has won numerous awards including the un cultural organization unesco 's felix houphouet-boigny peace prize for 2008 , named after the late president of ivory coast , as well as several honorary doctorates .
the funds from the unesco award were to be used for a foundation to promote peace , mediation and help post-conflict societies .
crowning glory the nobel , which is worth 10 million kronor -lrb- $ 1.5 million -rrb- , will be handed over at a ceremony in oslo on december 10 .
in 2007 , the peace prize was shared by the united nations climate body , the intergovernmental panel on climate change -lrb- ipcc -rrb- and al gore of the united states for their work on climate change .
for this year 's award , the five-member nobel committee had received 197 nominations for the coveted award including 33 organizations . dpa news agency -lrb- jp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

his breakthrough as a mediator came in namibia , which achieved independence in 1990 , capping years of work by the finnish national who served as special representative to the united nations secretary general and head of the un 's transition assistance team .
ahtisaari and his wife , eeva , were made honorary citizens of the southern african nation .
formative years ahtisaari has said his interest in peace mediation can be traced to his childhood years .
he was born on june 23 , 1937 in viipuri , a city that finland had to secede to the soviet union during the second world war , forcing 400,000 finns from karelia to relocate to finland .
the experience of being displaced fuelled his interest to promote peace and " help others , " he has said .
a second major achievement was the august 2005 peace deal between indonesia and the separatist free aceh movement -lrb- gam -rrb- aimed at ending a decades-long conflict in the indonesian province , and forged in the wake of the devastation caused by the december 2004 tsunami .
he has said mediation is " an ' art ' rather than an established practice , " adding that each conflict needs to be treated as a separate case .
mediation efforts ahtisaari 's hopes for the 2006 peace prize were dashed as the nobel committee selected muhammad yunus of bangladesh who founded the grameen bank that offers loans to the poor .
after qualifying as a teacher in 1959 , ahtisaari joined the foreign ministry in 1965 .
he served as ambassador to tanzania and held top posts in the foreign ministry and later in the un .
after his term as president 1994-2000 during which finland joined the european union , ahtisaari formed the crisis management initiative -lrb- cmi -rrb- that has been engaged in various mediation efforts .
while in office in 1999 , ahtisaari along with former russian prime minister viktor chernomyrdin and former us deputy secretary of state strobe talbott hammered out a plan to resolve the kosovo crisis that then-yugoslav president slobodan milosevic could accept .
accolades in 2000 he was called in to inspect irish republican army -lrb- ira -rrb- arms caches in northern ireland and later served as un special envoy for the horn of africa .
in recent years , ahtisaari has been engaged in discussing the future of the eu including turkey 's possible membership .
almost three years ago , in november 2005 , he was named special un envoy to kosovo but his efforts to bridge the divisions over kosovo 's status were unsuccessful and he stepped down after presenting his recommendations in february 2008 .
he has won numerous awards including the un cultural organization unesco 's felix houphouet-boigny peace prize for 2008 , named after the late president of ivory coast , as well as several honorary doctorates .
the funds from the unesco award were to be used for a foundation to promote peace , mediation and help post-conflict societies .
crowning glory the nobel , which is worth 10 million kronor -lrb- $ 1.5 million -rrb- , will be handed over at a ceremony in oslo on december 10 .
in 2007 , the peace prize was shared by the united nations climate body , the intergovernmental panel on climate change -lrb- ipcc -rrb- and al gore of the united states for their work on climate change .
for this year 's award , the five-member nobel committee had received 197 nominations for the coveted award including 33 organizations . dpa news agency -lrb- jp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" there is a formal agreement between the nato nations to fight drug trafficking , " a diplomat confirmed as defense ministers met in the hungarian capital budapest for a two-day meeting to discuss issues ranging from the war in afghanistan to georgia 's nato membership bid and piracy off the somali coast .
nato spokesman james appathurai said the alliance 's international security assistance force -lrb- isaf -rrb- would " act in concert with the afghans , against facilities and facilitators supporting the insurgency . "
the isaf currently has 50,700 soldiers in afghanistan , up from about 45,000 six months ago .
the german parliament agreed tuesday , oct .
7 to increase its contribution by 1,000 soldiers , raising its total to 4,500 .
us lobbies for afghan drug action sources also said that nato 's anti-narcotics efforts would be temporary , and would be open only to those countries willing to participate .
us defense secretary robert gates had pitched hard at the meeting for nato to strike at the heart of the afghan opium trade , which is believed to have contributed substantially to a reinvigorated taliban insurgency aimed at destabilizing president hamid karzai 's government .
" it -lrb- the opium trade -rrb- is not only corrosive to good governance , it also directly funds the people that are killing afghans , americans and all our coalition partners , " gates said in budapest on thursday .
the deal followed a request from afghan defense minister abdel rahim wardak , who on thursday asked nato to help his government target drug laboratories and seize imports of the chemicals needed to turn opium into heroin .
" we have asked nato to support our efforts to destroy the laboratories and to interdict the chemical precursors which are coming from outside the country , " wardak said .
germany in favor of afghan-led operations nato military commanders agreed that more needed to be done to fight the opium and heroin trade , a view shared by most alliance members .
the taliban are thought to be pocketing up to $ 80 million a year from the afghan narcotics industry , which is the source of some 92 percent of the world 's opium and heroin .
germany , spain , greece , poland , romania and italy had expressed scepticism over the plans , saying the fight against the afghan drugs trade was not part of nato 's mandate and should be addressed by the afghans themselves .
german defence minister franz josef jung said thursday germany was willing to assist in reconnaissance of trafficking routes and in training but any operations should be afghan-led .
" if this keeps an afghan face then it 's also in our interest that we support such an activity , " he told reporters on thursday .
ministers also worried that bombing laboratories would kill civilians and undermine the alliance 's popularity among ordinary afghans .
the compromise reached friday is to be reviewed when defense ministers meet again in poland in february . dw staff -lrb- dfm -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

london and frankfurt erased more than 10 percent and paris more than nine percent as market turmoil showed no sign of easing , despite coordinated interest rate cuts and billions of dollars ' worth of cash injections . london 's ftse 100 index of leading shares nosedived 10.20 percent to as low as 3,873.99 points - the first time below 4,000 points since july 3 , 2002 - before pulling back to show a loss of 5.08 percent . frankfurt 's dax 30 also shed more than 10.0 percent and in paris the cac 40 dived 9.68 percent , before both markets trimmed their losses somewhat .
earlier , stocks in tokyo ended friday trading lower , with the benchmark nikkei 225 stock average plunging below the psychologically significant mark of 9,000 points for the first time in more than five years .
the fresh wave of worries drove up the gold price by more than 4 per cent with the deepening concerns about the economic outlook sending the oil price down by about 5 percent .
g7 under pressure to take global action us treasury secretary henry paulson , who will host the g7 finance ministers at the us treasury next door to the white house , said the meeting was intended to review steps already taken and ways to " further enhance our collective efforts . "
participants are under a lot of pressure to take constructive steps towards coordinated moves to stem the crisis .
british prime minister gordon brown called for a global solution to the crisis and urged other countries to adopt britain 's actions to save the banking system . other governments should follow britain in putting money into struggling banks and offering guarantees worth hundreds of billions to persuade banks to start lending to each other , brown wrote in an article in the times newspaper . " because this is a global problem , it requires a global solution , " he wrote . in berlin , german chancellor angela merkel said she could not rule out nationalizing any of the country 's banks , following similar moves in other european countries such as britain .
" no possibility can be fully ruled out , " merkel said in berlin . last weekend , berlin announced a 50 billion euro -lrb- $ 68 billion -rrb- rescue package for germany 's fourth biggest bank hypo real estate , one of three of the country 's banks that have needed help over the past year .
but merkel 's government has so far not partly or fully nationalized any of its lenders - unlike britain , which on wednesday pledged 64 billion euros -lrb- $ 87 billion -rrb- to buy stakes in the country 's beleaguered banks .
bush calls for " common policy " president george w bush on thursday called for a " common policy " between the united states and europe to address the financial crisis that has threatened the world 's economy . bush , meeting with slovak president ivan gasparovic , said he discussed " our common desire to work with our european friends to develop a best as possible common policy . " bush on wednesday spoke with french president nicolas sarkozy , british prime minister gordon brown , german chancellor angela merkel and italian prime minister silvio berlusconi to coordinate efforts to prevent more economic damage . world " on the cusp of recession " as well as the g7 meeting , talks will be held at the international monetary fund -lrb- imf -rrb- in washington . imf chief dominique strauss-kahn said the world was " on the cusp of recession " , but could still recover .
he urged countries to act " quickly , forcefully , and co-operatively " to solve the global economic problems .
he said further coordinated action was necessary to calm financial markets : " all kinds of policy co-operation are to be commended . "

" no possibility can be fully ruled out , " merkel said in berlin . last weekend , berlin announced a 50 billion euro -lrb- $ 68 billion -rrb- rescue package for germany 's fourth biggest bank hypo real estate , one of three of the country 's banks that have needed help over the past year .
but merkel 's government has so far not partly or fully nationalized any of its lenders - unlike britain , which on wednesday pledged 64 billion euros -lrb- $ 87 billion -rrb- to buy stakes in the country 's beleaguered banks .
bush calls for " common policy " president george w bush on thursday called for a " common policy " between the united states and europe to address the financial crisis that has threatened the world 's economy . bush , meeting with slovak president ivan gasparovic , said he discussed " our common desire to work with our european friends to develop a best as possible common policy . " bush on wednesday spoke with french president nicolas sarkozy , british prime minister gordon brown , german chancellor angela merkel and italian prime minister silvio berlusconi to coordinate efforts to prevent more economic damage . world " on the cusp of recession " as well as the g7 meeting , talks will be held at the international monetary fund -lrb- imf -rrb- in washington . imf chief dominique strauss-kahn said the world was " on the cusp of recession " , but could still recover .
he urged countries to act " quickly , forcefully , and co-operatively " to solve the global economic problems .
he said further coordinated action was necessary to calm financial markets : " all kinds of policy co-operation are to be commended . "

the decision was welcomed by the leaders of both countries . the european court of human rights rejected thursday a land claim by ethnic germans who lost homes in poland during the second world war , a decision welcomed by leaders of both countries whose ties have soured over the issue .
the claim was filed by a private company , the prussian claims society , representing 23 germans .
it accused poland of violating the rights of germans who were expelled from their pre-war homes when borders were redrawn in 1945 at the end of the war . judges : poland ca n't be held accountable judges at the european court of human rights in strasbourg however ruled that modern poland bears no responsibility for the expulsion of ethnic germans by the soviets after october 19 , 1994 because it had no governmental control of the land . the court also said it had no jurisdiction to rule on the issue because the expulsion of the germans from their polish homes took place before either country had signed the european convention on human rights .

they say un-backed data on climate change is out of date . " we should prepare for a rise of sea levels of one meter this century , " said joachim schellnhuber , head of the potsdam institute for climate impact research -lrb- pik -rrb- , which advises the german government on environmental policy .
the melting rates of glaciers in the himalayas and the greenland ice-sheet have doubled or even tripled in recent years , due partly to increased greenhouse gas emissions by chinese power stations , he said .
his findings used data which was unavailable to the intergovernmental panel on climate change -lrb- ipcc -rrb- when it compiled its most recent global warming report .
in february 2007 , in the first volume of a landmark report , the nobel prize-winning ipcc predicted the oceans would rise by between 18 and 59 centimeters by 2100 .
the umbrella effect bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the earth is hurtling toward a warmer age at a quickening pace , say scientists further causes for concern include a drop in the amount of dirt particles in the air that protect from sunlight .
schellnhuber warned that cleaning air in beijing and in other large cities suffering from pollution problems by limiting car and power-plant emissions may raise global temperatures instead of lowering them .
aerosols , or particles suspended in air , have a cooling effect on the earth , countering global warming linked to carbon dioxide , said schellnhuber , explaining that a drop in aerosols in the atmosphere could cause a rapid rise in temperatures .
airborne pollutants act as an umbrella worldwide while co2 provides insulation , trapping heat attempting to escape into the atmosphere .
a rise in temperature because of declines in aerosols in the atmosphere can be offset by slashing co2 emissions , he said .
by not reducing carbon output , humanity " is closing the last door we have through which we can possibly influence the global climate , " schellnhuber warned .
urgent need for action bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : carbon emissions must be cut back - now the scientist stressed that there is what he called a 50-50 chance of limiting the global temperature rise to 2 degrees celsius -lrb- 3.6 degrees fahrenheit -rrb- before 2100 , which would avert the worst damage of climate change - so long as plans fleshed out by the g8 countries to reduce emissions are realized .
the united nations-sponsored climate-change talks this december in poznan , poland , and next year in copenhagen must reach an agreement to limit co2 , he added .
" there is really no time to spare , " schellnhuber said in an interview with bloomberg .
" technology will play a decisive role in limiting carbon but we have to move to a carbon-free world by the end of the century . "
german environment minister sigmar gabriel -lrb- spd -rrb- has warned that environmental issues risk being neglected because of the global financial crisis .

however , british soccer is holding its breath as the credit crunch starts to bite in its top flight . hoeness was quoted in friday 's edition of the bild newspaper as saying that german soccer is well off even though income may drop .
" i believe that german soccer has less to worry than other countries , " said hoeness .
" the big question , however , is if we are moving into a recession where the advertising spending drops and companies are less inclined to pay money for sponsorship . "
the german 1974 world cup winner said that he was concerned for clubs in some other countries .
" here and there clubs could go under , but not the big ones .
chelsea , for instance , has its debts with abramovich , but they are not in danger because the club belongs to him .
there is no bank involved that can close the club , as long as abramovich does not demand his money back , " hoeness said .

" it would be good for competition if clubs in future actually had to earn the money they spent , " said hoeness .
he said that he was not concerned about his own club bayern munich , as they were financially " in a very strong position . "
meanwhile british soccer is holding its breath to see just how badly it will be affected by the collapse of many of the world 's banks and the ever-worsening financial crisis .
british game suffering backlash once regarded in britain as the people 's game , the sport is now in danger of being torn apart , with several teams ' sponsors already having gone down the pan .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : man utd 's sponsor aig had to be bailed out in the us manchester united shirt sponsor aig was bailed out by the us government , as was newcastle united 's shirt sponsor , northern rock , by the british government .
work on liverpool 's new ground has been delayed as owners keep a close eye on exactly what is happening to their cash .
the overseas investment that had been looked upon as the ideal blueprint by many of the country 's top clubs is now in danger of becoming the poisoned chalice .
what good is investment , many clubs are asking themselves , if it ca n't be guaranteed ?
perhaps the one club most affected so far is west ham united , the east london club for whom the collapse this week of iceland 's second biggest bank , landsbanki , could yet spell disaster for their icelandic owners and for their own future .
rumors persist that the bank - now under the control of the iceland government - could repatriate any overseas assets .
icelandic troubles felt in london 's east end for that , read west ham and their chairman bjorgolfur gudmundsson , who paid 85 million pounds for the club in november 2006 but who may yet be forced to put up the for-sale sign .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : gudmundsson 's west ham is reeling from the icelandic crunch gudmundsson , who was sacked as chairman of the bank on tuesday , has stressed that the club is safe and claims that no players have to be sold .
but west ham vice-chairman asgeir fridgeirsson said on tuesday that players would have to go before any spending could happen in the january transfer window .
" west ham united has one of the biggest squads in the premier league , " fridgeirsson said on tuesday .
" it is very unlikely -lrb- the chairman -rrb- will be willing to put in more money to buy players this january window . "
when he took over as manager in september , gianfranco zola had seemed confident that he would have money to spend in january .
west ham told the dpa news agency on wednesday that zola has yet to request a meeting with the club 's board and nor has one been arranged , but it would seem to be only a matter of time before the italian requests clarification of the situation .
in a statement , placed on the club 's official website on tuesday , west ham chief executive scott duxbury reiterated that players would have to be sold before any new spending could be sanctioned .
" since his appointment , gianfranco zola has made it quite clear that his first team squad is too large and needs to be reduced so he can effectively coach the team , " the statement read .
" once this has happened and if the manager requires further players , then the club will acquire them . "
hammers hammered by credit crunch the collapse of landsbanki followed hot on the heels of the implosion of their shirt sponsor , the tour operator xl , which went bust in september .
that cost the club an estimated 5 million pounds , and with gudmundsson a guarantor of 163 million pounds to xl , west ham 's future looks less than rosy .
the west ham story is just one sorry tale and if the crisis deepens , others could yet be affected in a similar way .
bildunterschrift : the lse has been hit hard and british clubs have shuddered with the resulting tremors the football association chairman lord triesman warned on tuesday that the crisis could cripple some club who are heavily in debt , estimating that english clubs owe a total of 3 billion pounds .
and uefa general secretary david taylor has warned that clubs with huge debt could be excluded from future european competitions would see those clubs finances further depleted .
the biggest worry for west ham is that the crisis may not yet have reached its lowest point and fridgeirsson 's words had a nasty ring to them on tuesday .
" it is , of course , a blow for -lrb- gudmundsson -rrb- and his financial strength , but he himself has a number of other investments that are doing quite well at the moment so there is no reason to fear that he will not honor his commitment to west ham football club , " he said .
" he -lrb- gudmundsson -rrb- is not absolutely sure how this will directly affect him , but one thing he is sure of is that this will have no implications on the other investments of him and his family . "

however , british soccer is holding its breath as the credit crunch starts to bite in its top flight . hoeness was quoted in friday 's edition of the bild newspaper as saying that german soccer is well off even though income may drop .
" i believe that german soccer has less to worry than other countries , " said hoeness .
" the big question , however , is if we are moving into a recession where the advertising spending drops and companies are less inclined to pay money for sponsorship . "
the german 1974 world cup winner said that he was concerned for clubs in some other countries .
" here and there clubs could go under , but not the big ones .
chelsea , for instance , has its debts with abramovich , but they are not in danger because the club belongs to him .
there is no bank involved that can close the club , as long as abramovich does not demand his money back , " hoeness said .

london and frankfurt erased more than 10 percent and paris more than nine percent as market turmoil showed no sign of easing , despite coordinated interest rate cuts and billions of dollars ' worth of cash injections . london 's ftse 100 index of leading shares nosedived 10.20 percent to as low as 3,873.99 points - the first time below 4,000 points since july 3 , 2002 - before pulling back to show a loss of 5.08 percent . frankfurt 's dax 30 also shed more than 10.0 percent and in paris the cac 40 dived 9.68 percent , before both markets trimmed their losses somewhat .
earlier , stocks in tokyo ended friday trading lower , with the benchmark nikkei 225 stock average plunging below the psychologically significant mark of 9,000 points for the first time in more than five years .
the fresh wave of worries drove up the gold price by more than 4 per cent with the deepening concerns about the economic outlook sending the oil price down by about 5 percent .
g7 under pressure to take global action us treasury secretary henry paulson , who will host the g7 finance ministers at the us treasury next door to the white house , said the meeting was intended to review steps already taken and ways to " further enhance our collective efforts . "
participants are under a lot of pressure to take constructive steps towards coordinated moves to stem the crisis .
british prime minister gordon brown called for a global solution to the crisis and urged other countries to adopt britain 's actions to save the banking system . other governments should follow britain in putting money into struggling banks and offering guarantees worth hundreds of billions to persuade banks to start lending to each other , brown wrote in an article in the times newspaper . " because this is a global problem , it requires a global solution , " he wrote . in berlin , german chancellor angela merkel said she could not rule out nationalizing any of the country 's banks , following similar moves in other european countries such as britain .
" no possibility can be fully ruled out , " merkel said in berlin . last weekend , berlin announced a 50 billion euro -lrb- $ 68 billion -rrb- rescue package for germany 's fourth biggest bank hypo real estate , one of three of the country 's banks that have needed help over the past year .
but merkel 's government has so far not partly or fully nationalized any of its lenders - unlike britain , which on wednesday pledged 64 billion euros -lrb- $ 87 billion -rrb- to buy stakes in the country 's beleaguered banks .
bush calls for " common policy " president george w bush on thursday called for a " common policy " between the united states and europe to address the financial crisis that has threatened the world 's economy . bush , meeting with slovak president ivan gasparovic , said he discussed " our common desire to work with our european friends to develop a best as possible common policy .

he urged countries to act " quickly , forcefully , and co-operatively " to solve the global economic problems .

" considering the crisis the international financial system is going through , it 's necessary to take really effective measures to protect markets and ensure their future stability , " medvedev said thursday , praising the example of european union cooperation in the face of financial crisis .
" we need such coordination if we want to stay competitive and overcome the consequences of the financial crisis with minimal losses , " he told journalists alongside the summit host , kyrgyz president kurmanbek bakiyev .
the nine presidents to attend the commonwealth of independent states -lrb- cis -rrb- meeting jointly called for common economic goals among members and cooperation in combating drug trafficking .
but the summit raised more questions about the group 's relevance than it answered , with high levels of presidential absenteeism at the closing news conference .
presidents in attendance throughout the summit included those of armenia , belarus , kazakhstan , kyrgyzstan , moldova , russia , tajikistan , turkmenistan and uzbekistan .
georgia formally withdrew from the cis after it was invaded by russia in august .
also absent were ukrainian president viktor yushchenko , an ally of georgia , and azerbaijani president ilham aliyev , whose country 's oil exports were disrupted by the war .

at the post-summit press conference , medvedev told reports that russia was fully complying with an eu-brokered ceasefire to the conflict that called for a return of military personnel to pre-war positions .
" everything that depended on us we 've done .
all the obligations we undertook ... we have fulfilled , " he said .
but georgia 's foreign minister eka tkeshelashvili said friday that russia had not fully respected the terms of the ceasefire and warned against a return to normal relations with moscow .

the russian leader insisted , however , that emerging nations be included in the talks .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de climate -pipe- 10.10.2008 scientist warns climate change happening faster than predicted großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : scientists warn sea levels are rising faster than predicted global warming calculations have been too optimistic and global sea levels are likely to rise a full meter this century , senior german scientists have warned .
they say un-backed data on climate change is out of date . " we should prepare for a rise of sea levels of one meter this century , " said joachim schellnhuber , head of the potsdam institute for climate impact research -lrb- pik -rrb- , which advises the german government on environmental policy .
the melting rates of glaciers in the himalayas and the greenland ice-sheet have doubled or even tripled in recent years , due partly to increased greenhouse gas emissions by chinese power stations , he said .
his findings used data which was unavailable to the intergovernmental panel on climate change -lrb- ipcc -rrb- when it compiled its most recent global warming report .
in february 2007 , in the first volume of a landmark report , the nobel prize-winning ipcc predicted the oceans would rise by between 18 and 59 centimeters by 2100 .
the umbrella effect bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the earth is hurtling toward a warmer age at a quickening pace , say scientists further causes for concern include a drop in the amount of dirt particles in the air that protect from sunlight .
schellnhuber warned that cleaning air in beijing and in other large cities suffering from pollution problems by limiting car and power-plant emissions may raise global temperatures instead of lowering them .
aerosols , or particles suspended in air , have a cooling effect on the earth , countering global warming linked to carbon dioxide , said schellnhuber , explaining that a drop in aerosols in the atmosphere could cause a rapid rise in temperatures .
airborne pollutants act as an umbrella worldwide while co2 provides insulation , trapping heat attempting to escape into the atmosphere .
a rise in temperature because of declines in aerosols in the atmosphere can be offset by slashing co2 emissions , he said .
by not reducing carbon output , humanity " is closing the last door we have through which we can possibly influence the global climate , " schellnhuber warned .
urgent need for action bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : carbon emissions must be cut back - now the scientist stressed that there is what he called a 50-50 chance of limiting the global temperature rise to 2 degrees celsius -lrb- 3.6 degrees fahrenheit -rrb- before 2100 , which would avert the worst damage of climate change - so long as plans fleshed out by the g8 countries to reduce emissions are realized .
the united nations-sponsored climate-change talks this december in poznan , poland , and next year in copenhagen must reach an agreement to limit co2 , he added .

they say un-backed data on climate change is out of date . " we should prepare for a rise of sea levels of one meter this century , " said joachim schellnhuber , head of the potsdam institute for climate impact research -lrb- pik -rrb- , which advises the german government on environmental policy .
the melting rates of glaciers in the himalayas and the greenland ice-sheet have doubled or even tripled in recent years , due partly to increased greenhouse gas emissions by chinese power stations , he said .
his findings used data which was unavailable to the intergovernmental panel on climate change -lrb- ipcc -rrb- when it compiled its most recent global warming report .
in february 2007 , in the first volume of a landmark report , the nobel prize-winning ipcc predicted the oceans would rise by between 18 and 59 centimeters by 2100 .
the umbrella effect bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the earth is hurtling toward a warmer age at a quickening pace , say scientists further causes for concern include a drop in the amount of dirt particles in the air that protect from sunlight .
schellnhuber warned that cleaning air in beijing and in other large cities suffering from pollution problems by limiting car and power-plant emissions may raise global temperatures instead of lowering them .
aerosols , or particles suspended in air , have a cooling effect on the earth , countering global warming linked to carbon dioxide , said schellnhuber , explaining that a drop in aerosols in the atmosphere could cause a rapid rise in temperatures .
airborne pollutants act as an umbrella worldwide while co2 provides insulation , trapping heat attempting to escape into the atmosphere .
a rise in temperature because of declines in aerosols in the atmosphere can be offset by slashing co2 emissions , he said .
by not reducing carbon output , humanity " is closing the last door we have through which we can possibly influence the global climate , " schellnhuber warned .
urgent need for action bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : carbon emissions must be cut back - now the scientist stressed that there is what he called a 50-50 chance of limiting the global temperature rise to 2 degrees celsius -lrb- 3.6 degrees fahrenheit -rrb- before 2100 , which would avert the worst damage of climate change - so long as plans fleshed out by the g8 countries to reduce emissions are realized .
the united nations-sponsored climate-change talks this december in poznan , poland , and next year in copenhagen must reach an agreement to limit co2 , he added .

his breakthrough as a mediator came in namibia , which achieved independence in 1990 , capping years of work by the finnish national who served as special representative to the united nations secretary general and head of the un 's transition assistance team .
ahtisaari and his wife , eeva , were made honorary citizens of the southern african nation .
formative years ahtisaari has said his interest in peace mediation can be traced to his childhood years .
he was born on june 23 , 1937 in viipuri , a city that finland had to secede to the soviet union during the second world war , forcing 400,000 finns from karelia to relocate to finland .
the experience of being displaced fuelled his interest to promote peace and " help others , " he has said .
a second major achievement was the august 2005 peace deal between indonesia and the separatist free aceh movement -lrb- gam -rrb- aimed at ending a decades-long conflict in the indonesian province , and forged in the wake of the devastation caused by the december 2004 tsunami .
he has said mediation is " an ' art ' rather than an established practice , " adding that each conflict needs to be treated as a separate case .
mediation efforts ahtisaari 's hopes for the 2006 peace prize were dashed as the nobel committee selected muhammad yunus of bangladesh who founded the grameen bank that offers loans to the poor .
after qualifying as a teacher in 1959 , ahtisaari joined the foreign ministry in 1965 .
he served as ambassador to tanzania and held top posts in the foreign ministry and later in the un .
after his term as president 1994-2000 during which finland joined the european union , ahtisaari formed the crisis management initiative -lrb- cmi -rrb- that has been engaged in various mediation efforts .
while in office in 1999 , ahtisaari along with former russian prime minister viktor chernomyrdin and former us deputy secretary of state strobe talbott hammered out a plan to resolve the kosovo crisis that then-yugoslav president slobodan milosevic could accept .

his breakthrough as a mediator came in namibia , which achieved independence in 1990 , capping years of work by the finnish national who served as special representative to the united nations secretary general and head of the un 's transition assistance team .
ahtisaari and his wife , eeva , were made honorary citizens of the southern african nation .

he has said mediation is " an ' art ' rather than an established practice , " adding that each conflict needs to be treated as a separate case .

his breakthrough as a mediator came in namibia , which achieved independence in 1990 , capping years of work by the finnish national who served as special representative to the united nations secretary general and head of the un 's transition assistance team .
ahtisaari and his wife , eeva , were made honorary citizens of the southern african nation .
formative years ahtisaari has said his interest in peace mediation can be traced to his childhood years .
he was born on june 23 , 1937 in viipuri , a city that finland had to secede to the soviet union during the second world war , forcing 400,000 finns from karelia to relocate to finland .
the experience of being displaced fuelled his interest to promote peace and " help others , " he has said .
a second major achievement was the august 2005 peace deal between indonesia and the separatist free aceh movement -lrb- gam -rrb- aimed at ending a decades-long conflict in the indonesian province , and forged in the wake of the devastation caused by the december 2004 tsunami .
he has said mediation is " an ' art ' rather than an established practice , " adding that each conflict needs to be treated as a separate case .
mediation efforts ahtisaari 's hopes for the 2006 peace prize were dashed as the nobel committee selected muhammad yunus of bangladesh who founded the grameen bank that offers loans to the poor .
after qualifying as a teacher in 1959 , ahtisaari joined the foreign ministry in 1965 .
he served as ambassador to tanzania and held top posts in the foreign ministry and later in the un .
after his term as president 1994-2000 during which finland joined the european union , ahtisaari formed the crisis management initiative -lrb- cmi -rrb- that has been engaged in various mediation efforts .
while in office in 1999 , ahtisaari along with former russian prime minister viktor chernomyrdin and former us deputy secretary of state strobe talbott hammered out a plan to resolve the kosovo crisis that then-yugoslav president slobodan milosevic could accept .
accolades in 2000 he was called in to inspect irish republican army -lrb- ira -rrb- arms caches in northern ireland and later served as un special envoy for the horn of africa .
in recent years , ahtisaari has been engaged in discussing the future of the eu including turkey 's possible membership .
almost three years ago , in november 2005 , he was named special un envoy to kosovo but his efforts to bridge the divisions over kosovo 's status were unsuccessful and he stepped down after presenting his recommendations in february 2008 .
he has won numerous awards including the un cultural organization unesco 's felix houphouet-boigny peace prize for 2008 , named after the late president of ivory coast , as well as several honorary doctorates .
the funds from the unesco award were to be used for a foundation to promote peace , mediation and help post-conflict societies .

" there is a formal agreement between the nato nations to fight drug trafficking , " a diplomat confirmed as defense ministers met in the hungarian capital budapest for a two-day meeting to discuss issues ranging from the war in afghanistan to georgia 's nato membership bid and piracy off the somali coast .
nato spokesman james appathurai said the alliance 's international security assistance force -lrb- isaf -rrb- would " act in concert with the afghans , against facilities and facilitators supporting the insurgency . "
the isaf currently has 50,700 soldiers in afghanistan , up from about 45,000 six months ago .
the german parliament agreed tuesday , oct .
7 to increase its contribution by 1,000 soldiers , raising its total to 4,500 .
us lobbies for afghan drug action sources also said that nato 's anti-narcotics efforts would be temporary , and would be open only to those countries willing to participate .
us defense secretary robert gates had pitched hard at the meeting for nato to strike at the heart of the afghan opium trade , which is believed to have contributed substantially to a reinvigorated taliban insurgency aimed at destabilizing president hamid karzai 's government .
" it -lrb- the opium trade -rrb- is not only corrosive to good governance , it also directly funds the people that are killing afghans , americans and all our coalition partners , " gates said in budapest on thursday .
the deal followed a request from afghan defense minister abdel rahim wardak , who on thursday asked nato to help his government target drug laboratories and seize imports of the chemicals needed to turn opium into heroin .
" we have asked nato to support our efforts to destroy the laboratories and to interdict the chemical precursors which are coming from outside the country , " wardak said .
germany in favor of afghan-led operations nato military commanders agreed that more needed to be done to fight the opium and heroin trade , a view shared by most alliance members .
the taliban are thought to be pocketing up to $ 80 million a year from the afghan narcotics industry , which is the source of some 92 percent of the world 's opium and heroin .
germany , spain , greece , poland , romania and italy had expressed scepticism over the plans , saying the fight against the afghan drugs trade was not part of nato 's mandate and should be addressed by the afghans themselves .
german defence minister franz josef jung said thursday germany was willing to assist in reconnaissance of trafficking routes and in training but any operations should be afghan-led .
" if this keeps an afghan face then it 's also in our interest that we support such an activity , " he told reporters on thursday .
ministers also worried that bombing laboratories would kill civilians and undermine the alliance 's popularity among ordinary afghans .

" there is a formal agreement between the nato nations to fight drug trafficking , " a diplomat confirmed as defense ministers met in the hungarian capital budapest for a two-day meeting to discuss issues ranging from the war in afghanistan to georgia 's nato membership bid and piracy off the somali coast .
nato spokesman james appathurai said the alliance 's international security assistance force -lrb- isaf -rrb- would " act in concert with the afghans , against facilities and facilitators supporting the insurgency . "
the isaf currently has 50,700 soldiers in afghanistan , up from about 45,000 six months ago .
the german parliament agreed tuesday , oct .
7 to increase its contribution by 1,000 soldiers , raising its total to 4,500 .
us lobbies for afghan drug action sources also said that nato 's anti-narcotics efforts would be temporary , and would be open only to those countries willing to participate .
us defense secretary robert gates had pitched hard at the meeting for nato to strike at the heart of the afghan opium trade , which is believed to have contributed substantially to a reinvigorated taliban insurgency aimed at destabilizing president hamid karzai 's government .
" it -lrb- the opium trade -rrb- is not only corrosive to good governance , it also directly funds the people that are killing afghans , americans and all our coalition partners , " gates said in budapest on thursday .
the deal followed a request from afghan defense minister abdel rahim wardak , who on thursday asked nato to help his government target drug laboratories and seize imports of the chemicals needed to turn opium into heroin .
" we have asked nato to support our efforts to destroy the laboratories and to interdict the chemical precursors which are coming from outside the country , " wardak said .
germany in favor of afghan-led operations nato military commanders agreed that more needed to be done to fight the opium and heroin trade , a view shared by most alliance members .
the taliban are thought to be pocketing up to $ 80 million a year from the afghan narcotics industry , which is the source of some 92 percent of the world 's opium and heroin .
germany , spain , greece , poland , romania and italy had expressed scepticism over the plans , saying the fight against the afghan drugs trade was not part of nato 's mandate and should be addressed by the afghans themselves .
german defence minister franz josef jung said thursday germany was willing to assist in reconnaissance of trafficking routes and in training but any operations should be afghan-led .
" if this keeps an afghan face then it 's also in our interest that we support such an activity , " he told reporters on thursday .
ministers also worried that bombing laboratories would kill civilians and undermine the alliance 's popularity among ordinary afghans .

the directory , which telekom maintains had been stolen , had contained the private numbers of high-profile politicians and celebrities , as well as customer mobile phone numbers , addresses , dates of birth and , in some cases , email addresses .
bank information or credit card numbers were not accessed , said the bonn-based firm .
in germany , most wireless-line numbers are ex-directory and confidential .
telekom chief executive rene obermann said at the company 's head office in bonn that in future , the company would voluntarily brief the public on a dedicated web site about " critical data-privacy incidents " undergoing criminal investigation .
" in the race against data theft , we want to be at least one step ahead at all times , " he said .
a seventh board department will be set up to deal with privacy and the company will issue data privacy reports every six months .

employees and sales partners will only be able to access sensitive systems from specific computers .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de soccer -pipe- 10.10.2008 bundesliga can survive crunch , says hoeness , as uk wobbles großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some leagues are better protected than others from the effects of the financial crisis bayern munich general manager uli hoeness sees the german bundesliga holding firm against the global economic crisis .
however , british soccer is holding its breath as the credit crunch starts to bite in its top flight . hoeness was quoted in friday 's edition of the bild newspaper as saying that german soccer is well off even though income may drop .
" i believe that german soccer has less to worry than other countries , " said hoeness .
" the big question , however , is if we are moving into a recession where the advertising spending drops and companies are less inclined to pay money for sponsorship . "
the german 1974 world cup winner said that he was concerned for clubs in some other countries .
" here and there clubs could go under , but not the big ones .
chelsea , for instance , has its debts with abramovich , but they are not in danger because the club belongs to him .
there is no bank involved that can close the club , as long as abramovich does not demand his money back , " hoeness said .
" one needs to see if the ice on which everything was built will last . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : we 're in the money : bayern and hoeness are confident hoeness said that it was not certain that foreign investors in english soccer would continue investing such huge sums after losing a lot of money on the stock exchange .
" it would be good for competition if clubs in future actually had to earn the money they spent , " said hoeness .
he said that he was not concerned about his own club bayern munich , as they were financially " in a very strong position . "
meanwhile british soccer is holding its breath to see just how badly it will be affected by the collapse of many of the world 's banks and the ever-worsening financial crisis .
british game suffering backlash once regarded in britain as the people 's game , the sport is now in danger of being torn apart , with several teams ' sponsors already having gone down the pan .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : man utd 's sponsor aig had to be bailed out in the us manchester united shirt sponsor aig was bailed out by the us government , as was newcastle united 's shirt sponsor , northern rock , by the british government .
work on liverpool 's new ground has been delayed as owners keep a close eye on exactly what is happening to their cash .
the overseas investment that had been looked upon as the ideal blueprint by many of the country 's top clubs is now in danger of becoming the poisoned chalice .
what good is investment , many clubs are asking themselves , if it ca n't be guaranteed ?
perhaps the one club most affected so far is west ham united , the east london club for whom the collapse this week of iceland 's second biggest bank , landsbanki , could yet spell disaster for their icelandic owners and for their own future .
rumors persist that the bank - now under the control of the iceland government - could repatriate any overseas assets .
icelandic troubles felt in london 's east end for that , read west ham and their chairman bjorgolfur gudmundsson , who paid 85 million pounds for the club in november 2006 but who may yet be forced to put up the for-sale sign .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : gudmundsson 's west ham is reeling from the icelandic crunch gudmundsson , who was sacked as chairman of the bank on tuesday , has stressed that the club is safe and claims that no players have to be sold .
but west ham vice-chairman asgeir fridgeirsson said on tuesday that players would have to go before any spending could happen in the january transfer window .
" west ham united has one of the biggest squads in the premier league , " fridgeirsson said on tuesday .
" it is very unlikely -lrb- the chairman -rrb- will be willing to put in more money to buy players this january window . "
when he took over as manager in september , gianfranco zola had seemed confident that he would have money to spend in january .
west ham told the dpa news agency on wednesday that zola has yet to request a meeting with the club 's board and nor has one been arranged , but it would seem to be only a matter of time before the italian requests clarification of the situation .
in a statement , placed on the club 's official website on tuesday , west ham chief executive scott duxbury reiterated that players would have to be sold before any new spending could be sanctioned .
" since his appointment , gianfranco zola has made it quite clear that his first team squad is too large and needs to be reduced so he can effectively coach the team , " the statement read .
" once this has happened and if the manager requires further players , then the club will acquire them . "
hammers hammered by credit crunch the collapse of landsbanki followed hot on the heels of the implosion of their shirt sponsor , the tour operator xl , which went bust in september .
that cost the club an estimated 5 million pounds , and with gudmundsson a guarantor of 163 million pounds to xl , west ham 's future looks less than rosy .
the west ham story is just one sorry tale and if the crisis deepens , others could yet be affected in a similar way .
bildunterschrift : the lse has been hit hard and british clubs have shuddered with the resulting tremors the football association chairman lord triesman warned on tuesday that the crisis could cripple some club who are heavily in debt , estimating that english clubs owe a total of 3 billion pounds .
and uefa general secretary david taylor has warned that clubs with huge debt could be excluded from future european competitions would see those clubs finances further depleted .
the biggest worry for west ham is that the crisis may not yet have reached its lowest point and fridgeirsson 's words had a nasty ring to them on tuesday .
" it is , of course , a blow for -lrb- gudmundsson -rrb- and his financial strength , but he himself has a number of other investments that are doing quite well at the moment so there is no reason to fear that he will not honor his commitment to west ham football club , " he said .
" he -lrb- gudmundsson -rrb- is not absolutely sure how this will directly affect him , but one thing he is sure of is that this will have no implications on the other investments of him and his family . "

however , british soccer is holding its breath as the credit crunch starts to bite in its top flight . hoeness was quoted in friday 's edition of the bild newspaper as saying that german soccer is well off even though income may drop .
" i believe that german soccer has less to worry than other countries , " said hoeness .
" the big question , however , is if we are moving into a recession where the advertising spending drops and companies are less inclined to pay money for sponsorship . "
the german 1974 world cup winner said that he was concerned for clubs in some other countries .
" here and there clubs could go under , but not the big ones .
chelsea , for instance , has its debts with abramovich , but they are not in danger because the club belongs to him .
there is no bank involved that can close the club , as long as abramovich does not demand his money back , " hoeness said .
" one needs to see if the ice on which everything was built will last . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : we 're in the money : bayern and hoeness are confident hoeness said that it was not certain that foreign investors in english soccer would continue investing such huge sums after losing a lot of money on the stock exchange .
" it would be good for competition if clubs in future actually had to earn the money they spent , " said hoeness .
he said that he was not concerned about his own club bayern munich , as they were financially " in a very strong position . "
meanwhile british soccer is holding its breath to see just how badly it will be affected by the collapse of many of the world 's banks and the ever-worsening financial crisis .
british game suffering backlash once regarded in britain as the people 's game , the sport is now in danger of being torn apart , with several teams ' sponsors already having gone down the pan .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : man utd 's sponsor aig had to be bailed out in the us manchester united shirt sponsor aig was bailed out by the us government , as was newcastle united 's shirt sponsor , northern rock , by the british government .
work on liverpool 's new ground has been delayed as owners keep a close eye on exactly what is happening to their cash .
the overseas investment that had been looked upon as the ideal blueprint by many of the country 's top clubs is now in danger of becoming the poisoned chalice .
what good is investment , many clubs are asking themselves , if it ca n't be guaranteed ?
perhaps the one club most affected so far is west ham united , the east london club for whom the collapse this week of iceland 's second biggest bank , landsbanki , could yet spell disaster for their icelandic owners and for their own future .
rumors persist that the bank - now under the control of the iceland government - could repatriate any overseas assets .
icelandic troubles felt in london 's east end for that , read west ham and their chairman bjorgolfur gudmundsson , who paid 85 million pounds for the club in november 2006 but who may yet be forced to put up the for-sale sign .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : gudmundsson 's west ham is reeling from the icelandic crunch gudmundsson , who was sacked as chairman of the bank on tuesday , has stressed that the club is safe and claims that no players have to be sold .
but west ham vice-chairman asgeir fridgeirsson said on tuesday that players would have to go before any spending could happen in the january transfer window .
" west ham united has one of the biggest squads in the premier league , " fridgeirsson said on tuesday .
" it is very unlikely -lrb- the chairman -rrb- will be willing to put in more money to buy players this january window . "
when he took over as manager in september , gianfranco zola had seemed confident that he would have money to spend in january .
west ham told the dpa news agency on wednesday that zola has yet to request a meeting with the club 's board and nor has one been arranged , but it would seem to be only a matter of time before the italian requests clarification of the situation .
in a statement , placed on the club 's official website on tuesday , west ham chief executive scott duxbury reiterated that players would have to be sold before any new spending could be sanctioned .
" since his appointment , gianfranco zola has made it quite clear that his first team squad is too large and needs to be reduced so he can effectively coach the team , " the statement read .
" once this has happened and if the manager requires further players , then the club will acquire them . "
hammers hammered by credit crunch the collapse of landsbanki followed hot on the heels of the implosion of their shirt sponsor , the tour operator xl , which went bust in september .
that cost the club an estimated 5 million pounds , and with gudmundsson a guarantor of 163 million pounds to xl , west ham 's future looks less than rosy .
the west ham story is just one sorry tale and if the crisis deepens , others could yet be affected in a similar way .
bildunterschrift : the lse has been hit hard and british clubs have shuddered with the resulting tremors the football association chairman lord triesman warned on tuesday that the crisis could cripple some club who are heavily in debt , estimating that english clubs owe a total of 3 billion pounds .
and uefa general secretary david taylor has warned that clubs with huge debt could be excluded from future european competitions would see those clubs finances further depleted .
the biggest worry for west ham is that the crisis may not yet have reached its lowest point and fridgeirsson 's words had a nasty ring to them on tuesday .
" it is , of course , a blow for -lrb- gudmundsson -rrb- and his financial strength , but he himself has a number of other investments that are doing quite well at the moment so there is no reason to fear that he will not honor his commitment to west ham football club , " he said .
" he -lrb- gudmundsson -rrb- is not absolutely sure how this will directly affect him , but one thing he is sure of is that this will have no implications on the other investments of him and his family . "

bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : gudmundsson 's west ham is reeling from the icelandic crunch gudmundsson , who was sacked as chairman of the bank on tuesday , has stressed that the club is safe and claims that no players have to be sold .
but west ham vice-chairman asgeir fridgeirsson said on tuesday that players would have to go before any spending could happen in the january transfer window .
" west ham united has one of the biggest squads in the premier league , " fridgeirsson said on tuesday .
" it is very unlikely -lrb- the chairman -rrb- will be willing to put in more money to buy players this january window . "
when he took over as manager in september , gianfranco zola had seemed confident that he would have money to spend in january .
west ham told the dpa news agency on wednesday that zola has yet to request a meeting with the club 's board and nor has one been arranged , but it would seem to be only a matter of time before the italian requests clarification of the situation .
in a statement , placed on the club 's official website on tuesday , west ham chief executive scott duxbury reiterated that players would have to be sold before any new spending could be sanctioned .
" since his appointment , gianfranco zola has made it quite clear that his first team squad is too large and needs to be reduced so he can effectively coach the team , " the statement read .
" once this has happened and if the manager requires further players , then the club will acquire them . "
hammers hammered by credit crunch the collapse of landsbanki followed hot on the heels of the implosion of their shirt sponsor , the tour operator xl , which went bust in september .
that cost the club an estimated 5 million pounds , and with gudmundsson a guarantor of 163 million pounds to xl , west ham 's future looks less than rosy .
the west ham story is just one sorry tale and if the crisis deepens , others could yet be affected in a similar way .
bildunterschrift : the lse has been hit hard and british clubs have shuddered with the resulting tremors the football association chairman lord triesman warned on tuesday that the crisis could cripple some club who are heavily in debt , estimating that english clubs owe a total of 3 billion pounds .
and uefa general secretary david taylor has warned that clubs with huge debt could be excluded from future european competitions would see those clubs finances further depleted .
the biggest worry for west ham is that the crisis may not yet have reached its lowest point and fridgeirsson 's words had a nasty ring to them on tuesday .
" it is , of course , a blow for -lrb- gudmundsson -rrb- and his financial strength , but he himself has a number of other investments that are doing quite well at the moment so there is no reason to fear that he will not honor his commitment to west ham football club , " he said .
" he -lrb- gudmundsson -rrb- is not absolutely sure how this will directly affect him , but one thing he is sure of is that this will have no implications on the other investments of him and his family . "

10 to consider resuming high-level talks with russia , after moscow withdrew its troops from buffer zones in georgia . " if russia respects the six-point plan , and this appears to be the case , then we should resume dialogue with russia , " he told reporters at informal nato defense talks in the hungarian capital budapest .
" that means the nato-russia council should resume its work , " he said .
the western alliance froze such high level talks with russia in september , insisting that it could not do " business as usual " following moscow 's military operation in georgia .
russia sent troops into the former soviet republic in early august , after georgia tried to recover its breakaway region of south ossetia which , along with rebel abkhazia , moscow has since recognized as independent .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : jung urged nato to reach out to russia jung said he would like to see a " perspective " for the meetings to resume surface during the next round of talks with his nato counterparts , which is scheduled for february in cracow , poland .
the european union , whose french presidency brokered the six-point russia-georgia ceasefire agreement , is the institution which must decide whether moscow is respecting the accord .
but the bloc remained divided friday over whether that was the case , even after it appeared that russia had withdrawn its forces from the two buffer zones in line with the agreement .
russia sent troops into the former soviet republic in early august , amid a dispute over the breakaway region of south ossetia which , along with rebel abkhazia , moscow has since recognized as independent .
russian forces were still controlling two areas under georgian control prior to the conflict , the akhalgori district in south ossetia and the kodori gorge in abkhazia .
tbilisi insists the russians must leave the two areas to fully comply .
georgian efforts to become part of nato have infuriated russia , which objects to the prospect of its old cold war foe extending to its borders .
russian president dmitry medvedev has even accused nato of provoking the georgia conflict .
nato chief rules out high level talks bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : still no business as usual for nato 's de hoop scheffer nato secretary general jaap de hoop scheffer ruled out resuming high-level talks with russia after the alliance froze the meetings last month insisting that it could not do " business as usual with russia " since its attack on georgia in august .
" it is encouraging that russia seems to withdrawing its forces back to the pre-conflict lines , " scheffer told reporters , after a first ever meeting of the nato-georgia commission at ministerial level .
" but we are not in a situation where we go back to business as usual , " he said .
" it seems premature now to conclude that there will be a nato-russia council meeting in krakow , " scheffer said .
" that requires a discussion .
we are not at that stage yet . " "
us backs nato line on russian relations bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : it 's still too early to talk to russia , says the united states a senior official from the united states , which has staunchly backed georgia since the start , also agreed that it was too early to change nato 's approach , as russia still had to leave outstanding areas .
" there are clearly things that are going to have to be discussed , " he said , and warned : " we need to make sure that we do n't create a risky environment . "
scheffer said that the ministers did not discuss georgia 's nato aspirations , and that the topic would be taken up by alliance foreign ministers when they meet in brussels in december .
georgia 's military needs and reform efforts were addressed , but he insisted that nato would not supply tbilisi with any weapons as the nato chief spoke , french foreign minister bernard kouchner , whose country holds the european union 's rotating presidency , announced that russia had withdrawn from georgian buffer zones but " a long road " lay ahead to resolve other issues .
the european union , whose french presidency brokered the six-point russia-georgia ceasefire agreement , is the institution which must decide whether moscow is respecting the accord .
alliance agrees to target afghan drug lords bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : afghanistan 's opium trade will become a nato target in other developments at the meeting in budapest , nato defense ministers agreed to target drugs traffickers and opium laboratories in afghanistan as part of the alliance 's efforts to undermine the taliban insurgency .
but under a compromise hammered out in budapest , member states participating in nato 's international security assistance force -lrb- isaf -rrb- in afghanistan will be free to opt in or out of any anti-narcotics operations .
nato secretary general jaap de hoop scheffer said ministers had agreed that the " isaf can , in concert with afghan authorities , act against facilities or facilitators supporting the insurgency . "
however , any action would be " subject to the authorization of specific nations , " the nato chief said .
that was a concession to countries like germany , spain and italy , who argue that the fight against drugs should be left to the afghan police .
these countries had also expressed concern that any nato raids on laboratories would kill civilians and undermine the alliance 's popularity among ordinary afghans .
in an effort to address such reservations , ministers also agreed to ensure that civilian casualties be minimized , and that the anti-narcotics fight be conducted mainly in the southern provinces of afghanistan , where cultivations and the insurgency both thrive .
jung said he was " very satisfied with the compromise " and added that the deal would allow german soldiers to " continue to support the training of the afghan security forces " and to limit its role to providing assistance to afghan-led operations through logistical , intelligence and medical support .
opium proceeds funding taliban resurgeance bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the taliban is being funded by the drugs trade nato officials said the plan was " consistent with the appropriate un security council resolutions " and with the isaf 's existing operational plan .
friday 's compromise would be reviewed in february , when defense ministers next meet in poland .
the deal clinched in budapest follows a specific request from afghan defense minister abdel rahim wardak , who on thursday had asked his nato colleagues to help his government target drugs laboratories and seize imports of the chemicals that are needed to turn opium into heroin .
" we have asked nato to support our efforts to destroy the laboratories and to interdict the chemical precursors which are coming from outside the country , " wardak said .
nato military commanders acknowledge that more needs to be done to fight the opium and heroin trade .
us defense secretary robert gates believes that the taliban pocket between 60 and 80 million dollars per year from the sale of drugs .
" it is not only corrosive to good governance , it also directly funds the people that are killing afghans , americans and all our coalition partners , " gates said in budapest on thursday .
poppy cultivations have fallen by 19 per cent since last year , but afghan heroin still accounts for more than 90 per cent of the heroin circulating in europe . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

russia sent troops into the former soviet republic in early august , amid a dispute over the breakaway region of south ossetia which , along with rebel abkhazia , moscow has since recognized as independent .
russian forces were still controlling two areas under georgian control prior to the conflict , the akhalgori district in south ossetia and the kodori gorge in abkhazia .
tbilisi insists the russians must leave the two areas to fully comply .
georgian efforts to become part of nato have infuriated russia , which objects to the prospect of its old cold war foe extending to its borders .
russian president dmitry medvedev has even accused nato of provoking the georgia conflict .
nato chief rules out high level talks bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : still no business as usual for nato 's de hoop scheffer nato secretary general jaap de hoop scheffer ruled out resuming high-level talks with russia after the alliance froze the meetings last month insisting that it could not do " business as usual with russia " since its attack on georgia in august .
" it is encouraging that russia seems to withdrawing its forces back to the pre-conflict lines , " scheffer told reporters , after a first ever meeting of the nato-georgia commission at ministerial level .
" but we are not in a situation where we go back to business as usual , " he said .
" it seems premature now to conclude that there will be a nato-russia council meeting in krakow , " scheffer said .
" that requires a discussion .
we are not at that stage yet . " "

" there are clearly things that are going to have to be discussed , " he said , and warned : " we need to make sure that we do n't create a risky environment . "
scheffer said that the ministers did not discuss georgia 's nato aspirations , and that the topic would be taken up by alliance foreign ministers when they meet in brussels in december .
georgia 's military needs and reform efforts were addressed , but he insisted that nato would not supply tbilisi with any weapons as the nato chief spoke , french foreign minister bernard kouchner , whose country holds the european union 's rotating presidency , announced that russia had withdrawn from georgian buffer zones but " a long road " lay ahead to resolve other issues .

alliance agrees to target afghan drug lords bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : afghanistan 's opium trade will become a nato target in other developments at the meeting in budapest , nato defense ministers agreed to target drugs traffickers and opium laboratories in afghanistan as part of the alliance 's efforts to undermine the taliban insurgency .
but under a compromise hammered out in budapest , member states participating in nato 's international security assistance force -lrb- isaf -rrb- in afghanistan will be free to opt in or out of any anti-narcotics operations .
nato secretary general jaap de hoop scheffer said ministers had agreed that the " isaf can , in concert with afghan authorities , act against facilities or facilitators supporting the insurgency . "
however , any action would be " subject to the authorization of specific nations , " the nato chief said .
that was a concession to countries like germany , spain and italy , who argue that the fight against drugs should be left to the afghan police .
these countries had also expressed concern that any nato raids on laboratories would kill civilians and undermine the alliance 's popularity among ordinary afghans .
in an effort to address such reservations , ministers also agreed to ensure that civilian casualties be minimized , and that the anti-narcotics fight be conducted mainly in the southern provinces of afghanistan , where cultivations and the insurgency both thrive .
jung said he was " very satisfied with the compromise " and added that the deal would allow german soldiers to " continue to support the training of the afghan security forces " and to limit its role to providing assistance to afghan-led operations through logistical , intelligence and medical support .
opium proceeds funding taliban resurgeance bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the taliban is being funded by the drugs trade nato officials said the plan was " consistent with the appropriate un security council resolutions " and with the isaf 's existing operational plan .
friday 's compromise would be reviewed in february , when defense ministers next meet in poland .
the deal clinched in budapest follows a specific request from afghan defense minister abdel rahim wardak , who on thursday had asked his nato colleagues to help his government target drugs laboratories and seize imports of the chemicals that are needed to turn opium into heroin .
" we have asked nato to support our efforts to destroy the laboratories and to interdict the chemical precursors which are coming from outside the country , " wardak said .
nato military commanders acknowledge that more needs to be done to fight the opium and heroin trade .
us defense secretary robert gates believes that the taliban pocket between 60 and 80 million dollars per year from the sale of drugs .
" it is not only corrosive to good governance , it also directly funds the people that are killing afghans , americans and all our coalition partners , " gates said in budapest on thursday .

" it is encouraging that russia seems to withdrawing its forces back to the pre-conflict lines , " scheffer told reporters , after a first ever meeting of the nato-georgia commission at ministerial level .
" but we are not in a situation where we go back to business as usual , " he said .
" it seems premature now to conclude that there will be a nato-russia council meeting in krakow , " scheffer said .
" that requires a discussion .
we are not at that stage yet . " "
us backs nato line on russian relations bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : it 's still too early to talk to russia , says the united states a senior official from the united states , which has staunchly backed georgia since the start , also agreed that it was too early to change nato 's approach , as russia still had to leave outstanding areas .
" there are clearly things that are going to have to be discussed , " he said , and warned : " we need to make sure that we do n't create a risky environment . "
scheffer said that the ministers did not discuss georgia 's nato aspirations , and that the topic would be taken up by alliance foreign ministers when they meet in brussels in december .
georgia 's military needs and reform efforts were addressed , but he insisted that nato would not supply tbilisi with any weapons as the nato chief spoke , french foreign minister bernard kouchner , whose country holds the european union 's rotating presidency , announced that russia had withdrawn from georgian buffer zones but " a long road " lay ahead to resolve other issues .
the european union , whose french presidency brokered the six-point russia-georgia ceasefire agreement , is the institution which must decide whether moscow is respecting the accord .
alliance agrees to target afghan drug lords bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : afghanistan 's opium trade will become a nato target in other developments at the meeting in budapest , nato defense ministers agreed to target drugs traffickers and opium laboratories in afghanistan as part of the alliance 's efforts to undermine the taliban insurgency .
but under a compromise hammered out in budapest , member states participating in nato 's international security assistance force -lrb- isaf -rrb- in afghanistan will be free to opt in or out of any anti-narcotics operations .
nato secretary general jaap de hoop scheffer said ministers had agreed that the " isaf can , in concert with afghan authorities , act against facilities or facilitators supporting the insurgency . "
however , any action would be " subject to the authorization of specific nations , " the nato chief said .
that was a concession to countries like germany , spain and italy , who argue that the fight against drugs should be left to the afghan police .
these countries had also expressed concern that any nato raids on laboratories would kill civilians and undermine the alliance 's popularity among ordinary afghans .
in an effort to address such reservations , ministers also agreed to ensure that civilian casualties be minimized , and that the anti-narcotics fight be conducted mainly in the southern provinces of afghanistan , where cultivations and the insurgency both thrive .
jung said he was " very satisfied with the compromise " and added that the deal would allow german soldiers to " continue to support the training of the afghan security forces " and to limit its role to providing assistance to afghan-led operations through logistical , intelligence and medical support .
opium proceeds funding taliban resurgeance bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the taliban is being funded by the drugs trade nato officials said the plan was " consistent with the appropriate un security council resolutions " and with the isaf 's existing operational plan .
friday 's compromise would be reviewed in february , when defense ministers next meet in poland .
the deal clinched in budapest follows a specific request from afghan defense minister abdel rahim wardak , who on thursday had asked his nato colleagues to help his government target drugs laboratories and seize imports of the chemicals that are needed to turn opium into heroin .
" we have asked nato to support our efforts to destroy the laboratories and to interdict the chemical precursors which are coming from outside the country , " wardak said .
nato military commanders acknowledge that more needs to be done to fight the opium and heroin trade .
us defense secretary robert gates believes that the taliban pocket between 60 and 80 million dollars per year from the sale of drugs .
" it is not only corrosive to good governance , it also directly funds the people that are killing afghans , americans and all our coalition partners , " gates said in budapest on thursday .

10 to consider resuming high-level talks with russia , after moscow withdrew its troops from buffer zones in georgia . " if russia respects the six-point plan , and this appears to be the case , then we should resume dialogue with russia , " he told reporters at informal nato defense talks in the hungarian capital budapest .
" that means the nato-russia council should resume its work , " he said .
the western alliance froze such high level talks with russia in september , insisting that it could not do " business as usual " following moscow 's military operation in georgia .
russia sent troops into the former soviet republic in early august , after georgia tried to recover its breakaway region of south ossetia which , along with rebel abkhazia , moscow has since recognized as independent .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : jung urged nato to reach out to russia jung said he would like to see a " perspective " for the meetings to resume surface during the next round of talks with his nato counterparts , which is scheduled for february in cracow , poland .
the european union , whose french presidency brokered the six-point russia-georgia ceasefire agreement , is the institution which must decide whether moscow is respecting the accord .
but the bloc remained divided friday over whether that was the case , even after it appeared that russia had withdrawn its forces from the two buffer zones in line with the agreement .
russia sent troops into the former soviet republic in early august , amid a dispute over the breakaway region of south ossetia which , along with rebel abkhazia , moscow has since recognized as independent .
russian forces were still controlling two areas under georgian control prior to the conflict , the akhalgori district in south ossetia and the kodori gorge in abkhazia .
tbilisi insists the russians must leave the two areas to fully comply .
georgian efforts to become part of nato have infuriated russia , which objects to the prospect of its old cold war foe extending to its borders .
russian president dmitry medvedev has even accused nato of provoking the georgia conflict .

however , british soccer is holding its breath as the credit crunch starts to bite in its top flight . hoeness was quoted in friday 's edition of the bild newspaper as saying that german soccer is well off even though income may drop .
" i believe that german soccer has less to worry than other countries , " said hoeness .
" the big question , however , is if we are moving into a recession where the advertising spending drops and companies are less inclined to pay money for sponsorship . "
the german 1974 world cup winner said that he was concerned for clubs in some other countries .
" here and there clubs could go under , but not the big ones .
chelsea , for instance , has its debts with abramovich , but they are not in danger because the club belongs to him .
there is no bank involved that can close the club , as long as abramovich does not demand his money back , " hoeness said .
" one needs to see if the ice on which everything was built will last . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : we 're in the money : bayern and hoeness are confident hoeness said that it was not certain that foreign investors in english soccer would continue investing such huge sums after losing a lot of money on the stock exchange .
" it would be good for competition if clubs in future actually had to earn the money they spent , " said hoeness .
he said that he was not concerned about his own club bayern munich , as they were financially " in a very strong position . "
meanwhile british soccer is holding its breath to see just how badly it will be affected by the collapse of many of the world 's banks and the ever-worsening financial crisis .
british game suffering backlash once regarded in britain as the people 's game , the sport is now in danger of being torn apart , with several teams ' sponsors already having gone down the pan .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : man utd 's sponsor aig had to be bailed out in the us manchester united shirt sponsor aig was bailed out by the us government , as was newcastle united 's shirt sponsor , northern rock , by the british government .
work on liverpool 's new ground has been delayed as owners keep a close eye on exactly what is happening to their cash .
the overseas investment that had been looked upon as the ideal blueprint by many of the country 's top clubs is now in danger of becoming the poisoned chalice .
what good is investment , many clubs are asking themselves , if it ca n't be guaranteed ?
perhaps the one club most affected so far is west ham united , the east london club for whom the collapse this week of iceland 's second biggest bank , landsbanki , could yet spell disaster for their icelandic owners and for their own future .
rumors persist that the bank - now under the control of the iceland government - could repatriate any overseas assets .
icelandic troubles felt in london 's east end for that , read west ham and their chairman bjorgolfur gudmundsson , who paid 85 million pounds for the club in november 2006 but who may yet be forced to put up the for-sale sign .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : gudmundsson 's west ham is reeling from the icelandic crunch gudmundsson , who was sacked as chairman of the bank on tuesday , has stressed that the club is safe and claims that no players have to be sold .
but west ham vice-chairman asgeir fridgeirsson said on tuesday that players would have to go before any spending could happen in the january transfer window .
" west ham united has one of the biggest squads in the premier league , " fridgeirsson said on tuesday .
" it is very unlikely -lrb- the chairman -rrb- will be willing to put in more money to buy players this january window . "
when he took over as manager in september , gianfranco zola had seemed confident that he would have money to spend in january .
west ham told the dpa news agency on wednesday that zola has yet to request a meeting with the club 's board and nor has one been arranged , but it would seem to be only a matter of time before the italian requests clarification of the situation .
in a statement , placed on the club 's official website on tuesday , west ham chief executive scott duxbury reiterated that players would have to be sold before any new spending could be sanctioned .
" since his appointment , gianfranco zola has made it quite clear that his first team squad is too large and needs to be reduced so he can effectively coach the team , " the statement read .
" once this has happened and if the manager requires further players , then the club will acquire them . "
hammers hammered by credit crunch the collapse of landsbanki followed hot on the heels of the implosion of their shirt sponsor , the tour operator xl , which went bust in september .
that cost the club an estimated 5 million pounds , and with gudmundsson a guarantor of 163 million pounds to xl , west ham 's future looks less than rosy .
the west ham story is just one sorry tale and if the crisis deepens , others could yet be affected in a similar way .
bildunterschrift : the lse has been hit hard and british clubs have shuddered with the resulting tremors the football association chairman lord triesman warned on tuesday that the crisis could cripple some club who are heavily in debt , estimating that english clubs owe a total of 3 billion pounds .
and uefa general secretary david taylor has warned that clubs with huge debt could be excluded from future european competitions would see those clubs finances further depleted .
the biggest worry for west ham is that the crisis may not yet have reached its lowest point and fridgeirsson 's words had a nasty ring to them on tuesday .
" it is , of course , a blow for -lrb- gudmundsson -rrb- and his financial strength , but he himself has a number of other investments that are doing quite well at the moment so there is no reason to fear that he will not honor his commitment to west ham football club , " he said .
" he -lrb- gudmundsson -rrb- is not absolutely sure how this will directly affect him , but one thing he is sure of is that this will have no implications on the other investments of him and his family . "

" considering the crisis the international financial system is going through , it 's necessary to take really effective measures to protect markets and ensure their future stability , " medvedev said thursday , praising the example of european union cooperation in the face of financial crisis .
" we need such coordination if we want to stay competitive and overcome the consequences of the financial crisis with minimal losses , " he told journalists alongside the summit host , kyrgyz president kurmanbek bakiyev .
the nine presidents to attend the commonwealth of independent states -lrb- cis -rrb- meeting jointly called for common economic goals among members and cooperation in combating drug trafficking .
but the summit raised more questions about the group 's relevance than it answered , with high levels of presidential absenteeism at the closing news conference .
presidents in attendance throughout the summit included those of armenia , belarus , kazakhstan , kyrgyzstan , moldova , russia , tajikistan , turkmenistan and uzbekistan .
georgia formally withdrew from the cis after it was invaded by russia in august .
also absent were ukrainian president viktor yushchenko , an ally of georgia , and azerbaijani president ilham aliyev , whose country 's oil exports were disrupted by the war .
georgia bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : georgia 's president mikhail saakashvili pulled georgia out of the cis in august the absence of the three west-oriented leaders highlighted what russian newspapers referred to as a weakening kremlin grip on its former sphere of influence , made worse by august 's caucasus war in which russian troops surged into georgia in aid of two rebel regions there - south ossetia and abkhazia , which the kremlin went on to recognize as independent states .
at the post-summit press conference , medvedev told reports that russia was fully complying with an eu-brokered ceasefire to the conflict that called for a return of military personnel to pre-war positions .
" everything that depended on us we 've done .
all the obligations we undertook ... we have fulfilled , " he said .
but georgia 's foreign minister eka tkeshelashvili said friday that russia had not fully respected the terms of the ceasefire and warned against a return to normal relations with moscow .
financial crisis bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : russian president dmitry medvedev says russia has complied with the georgia ceasefire seizing on uncertainty over the global financial crisis , medvedev went on to back calls by japan for an emergency g8 summit to discuss the world 's ailing financial condition .
the russian leader insisted , however , that emerging nations be included in the talks .
" it 's necessary to include other key economies that define the financial climate in the world - china , india , brazil , mexico , south africa , " he said . dw staff -lrb- dfm -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

london and frankfurt erased more than 10 percent and paris more than nine percent as market turmoil showed no sign of easing , despite coordinated interest rate cuts and billions of dollars ' worth of cash injections . london 's ftse 100 index of leading shares nosedived 10.20 percent to as low as 3,873.99 points - the first time below 4,000 points since july 3 , 2002 - before pulling back to show a loss of 5.08 percent . frankfurt 's dax 30 also shed more than 10.0 percent and in paris the cac 40 dived 9.68 percent , before both markets trimmed their losses somewhat .
earlier , stocks in tokyo ended friday trading lower , with the benchmark nikkei 225 stock average plunging below the psychologically significant mark of 9,000 points for the first time in more than five years .
the fresh wave of worries drove up the gold price by more than 4 per cent with the deepening concerns about the economic outlook sending the oil price down by about 5 percent .
g7 under pressure to take global action us treasury secretary henry paulson , who will host the g7 finance ministers at the us treasury next door to the white house , said the meeting was intended to review steps already taken and ways to " further enhance our collective efforts . "
participants are under a lot of pressure to take constructive steps towards coordinated moves to stem the crisis .
british prime minister gordon brown called for a global solution to the crisis and urged other countries to adopt britain 's actions to save the banking system . other governments should follow britain in putting money into struggling banks and offering guarantees worth hundreds of billions to persuade banks to start lending to each other , brown wrote in an article in the times newspaper . " because this is a global problem , it requires a global solution , " he wrote . in berlin , german chancellor angela merkel said she could not rule out nationalizing any of the country 's banks , following similar moves in other european countries such as britain .
" no possibility can be fully ruled out , " merkel said in berlin . last weekend , berlin announced a 50 billion euro -lrb- $ 68 billion -rrb- rescue package for germany 's fourth biggest bank hypo real estate , one of three of the country 's banks that have needed help over the past year .
but merkel 's government has so far not partly or fully nationalized any of its lenders - unlike britain , which on wednesday pledged 64 billion euros -lrb- $ 87 billion -rrb- to buy stakes in the country 's beleaguered banks .
bush calls for " common policy " president george w bush on thursday called for a " common policy " between the united states and europe to address the financial crisis that has threatened the world 's economy . bush , meeting with slovak president ivan gasparovic , said he discussed " our common desire to work with our european friends to develop a best as possible common policy . " bush on wednesday spoke with french president nicolas sarkozy , british prime minister gordon brown , german chancellor angela merkel and italian prime minister silvio berlusconi to coordinate efforts to prevent more economic damage . world " on the cusp of recession " as well as the g7 meeting , talks will be held at the international monetary fund -lrb- imf -rrb- in washington . imf chief dominique strauss-kahn said the world was " on the cusp of recession " , but could still recover .
he urged countries to act " quickly , forcefully , and co-operatively " to solve the global economic problems .
he said further coordinated action was necessary to calm financial markets : " all kinds of policy co-operation are to be commended . "
but he issued a stark warning against countries acting unilaterally to fight the crisis .
" there is no domestic solution to a crisis like this one , " he said . dw staff -lrb- jp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

london and frankfurt erased more than 10 percent and paris more than nine percent as market turmoil showed no sign of easing , despite coordinated interest rate cuts and billions of dollars ' worth of cash injections . london 's ftse 100 index of leading shares nosedived 10.20 percent to as low as 3,873.99 points - the first time below 4,000 points since july 3 , 2002 - before pulling back to show a loss of 5.08 percent . frankfurt 's dax 30 also shed more than 10.0 percent and in paris the cac 40 dived 9.68 percent , before both markets trimmed their losses somewhat .
earlier , stocks in tokyo ended friday trading lower , with the benchmark nikkei 225 stock average plunging below the psychologically significant mark of 9,000 points for the first time in more than five years .
the fresh wave of worries drove up the gold price by more than 4 per cent with the deepening concerns about the economic outlook sending the oil price down by about 5 percent .
g7 under pressure to take global action us treasury secretary henry paulson , who will host the g7 finance ministers at the us treasury next door to the white house , said the meeting was intended to review steps already taken and ways to " further enhance our collective efforts . "
participants are under a lot of pressure to take constructive steps towards coordinated moves to stem the crisis .
british prime minister gordon brown called for a global solution to the crisis and urged other countries to adopt britain 's actions to save the banking system . other governments should follow britain in putting money into struggling banks and offering guarantees worth hundreds of billions to persuade banks to start lending to each other , brown wrote in an article in the times newspaper . " because this is a global problem , it requires a global solution , " he wrote . in berlin , german chancellor angela merkel said she could not rule out nationalizing any of the country 's banks , following similar moves in other european countries such as britain .
" no possibility can be fully ruled out , " merkel said in berlin . last weekend , berlin announced a 50 billion euro -lrb- $ 68 billion -rrb- rescue package for germany 's fourth biggest bank hypo real estate , one of three of the country 's banks that have needed help over the past year .
but merkel 's government has so far not partly or fully nationalized any of its lenders - unlike britain , which on wednesday pledged 64 billion euros -lrb- $ 87 billion -rrb- to buy stakes in the country 's beleaguered banks .
bush calls for " common policy " president george w bush on thursday called for a " common policy " between the united states and europe to address the financial crisis that has threatened the world 's economy . bush , meeting with slovak president ivan gasparovic , said he discussed " our common desire to work with our european friends to develop a best as possible common policy . " bush on wednesday spoke with french president nicolas sarkozy , british prime minister gordon brown , german chancellor angela merkel and italian prime minister silvio berlusconi to coordinate efforts to prevent more economic damage . world " on the cusp of recession " as well as the g7 meeting , talks will be held at the international monetary fund -lrb- imf -rrb- in washington . imf chief dominique strauss-kahn said the world was " on the cusp of recession " , but could still recover .
he urged countries to act " quickly , forcefully , and co-operatively " to solve the global economic problems .
he said further coordinated action was necessary to calm financial markets : " all kinds of policy co-operation are to be commended . "
but he issued a stark warning against countries acting unilaterally to fight the crisis .
" there is no domestic solution to a crisis like this one , " he said . dw staff -lrb- jp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

they say un-backed data on climate change is out of date . " we should prepare for a rise of sea levels of one meter this century , " said joachim schellnhuber , head of the potsdam institute for climate impact research -lrb- pik -rrb- , which advises the german government on environmental policy .
the melting rates of glaciers in the himalayas and the greenland ice-sheet have doubled or even tripled in recent years , due partly to increased greenhouse gas emissions by chinese power stations , he said .
his findings used data which was unavailable to the intergovernmental panel on climate change -lrb- ipcc -rrb- when it compiled its most recent global warming report .
in february 2007 , in the first volume of a landmark report , the nobel prize-winning ipcc predicted the oceans would rise by between 18 and 59 centimeters by 2100 .
the umbrella effect bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the earth is hurtling toward a warmer age at a quickening pace , say scientists further causes for concern include a drop in the amount of dirt particles in the air that protect from sunlight .
schellnhuber warned that cleaning air in beijing and in other large cities suffering from pollution problems by limiting car and power-plant emissions may raise global temperatures instead of lowering them .
aerosols , or particles suspended in air , have a cooling effect on the earth , countering global warming linked to carbon dioxide , said schellnhuber , explaining that a drop in aerosols in the atmosphere could cause a rapid rise in temperatures .
airborne pollutants act as an umbrella worldwide while co2 provides insulation , trapping heat attempting to escape into the atmosphere .
a rise in temperature because of declines in aerosols in the atmosphere can be offset by slashing co2 emissions , he said .
by not reducing carbon output , humanity " is closing the last door we have through which we can possibly influence the global climate , " schellnhuber warned .
urgent need for action bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : carbon emissions must be cut back - now the scientist stressed that there is what he called a 50-50 chance of limiting the global temperature rise to 2 degrees celsius -lrb- 3.6 degrees fahrenheit -rrb- before 2100 , which would avert the worst damage of climate change - so long as plans fleshed out by the g8 countries to reduce emissions are realized .
the united nations-sponsored climate-change talks this december in poznan , poland , and next year in copenhagen must reach an agreement to limit co2 , he added .
" there is really no time to spare , " schellnhuber said in an interview with bloomberg .
" technology will play a decisive role in limiting carbon but we have to move to a carbon-free world by the end of the century . "
german environment minister sigmar gabriel -lrb- spd -rrb- has warned that environmental issues risk being neglected because of the global financial crisis .

10 to consider resuming high-level talks with russia , after moscow withdrew its troops from buffer zones in georgia . " if russia respects the six-point plan , and this appears to be the case , then we should resume dialogue with russia , " he told reporters at informal nato defense talks in the hungarian capital budapest .
" that means the nato-russia council should resume its work , " he said .
the western alliance froze such high level talks with russia in september , insisting that it could not do " business as usual " following moscow 's military operation in georgia .

russia sent troops into the former soviet republic in early august , amid a dispute over the breakaway region of south ossetia which , along with rebel abkhazia , moscow has since recognized as independent .
russian forces were still controlling two areas under georgian control prior to the conflict , the akhalgori district in south ossetia and the kodori gorge in abkhazia .
tbilisi insists the russians must leave the two areas to fully comply .
georgian efforts to become part of nato have infuriated russia , which objects to the prospect of its old cold war foe extending to its borders .
russian president dmitry medvedev has even accused nato of provoking the georgia conflict .
nato chief rules out high level talks bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : still no business as usual for nato 's de hoop scheffer nato secretary general jaap de hoop scheffer ruled out resuming high-level talks with russia after the alliance froze the meetings last month insisting that it could not do " business as usual with russia " since its attack on georgia in august .
" it is encouraging that russia seems to withdrawing its forces back to the pre-conflict lines , " scheffer told reporters , after a first ever meeting of the nato-georgia commission at ministerial level .
" but we are not in a situation where we go back to business as usual , " he said .
" it seems premature now to conclude that there will be a nato-russia council meeting in krakow , " scheffer said .
" that requires a discussion .
we are not at that stage yet . " "

" there are clearly things that are going to have to be discussed , " he said , and warned : " we need to make sure that we do n't create a risky environment . "
scheffer said that the ministers did not discuss georgia 's nato aspirations , and that the topic would be taken up by alliance foreign ministers when they meet in brussels in december .
georgia 's military needs and reform efforts were addressed , but he insisted that nato would not supply tbilisi with any weapons as the nato chief spoke , french foreign minister bernard kouchner , whose country holds the european union 's rotating presidency , announced that russia had withdrawn from georgian buffer zones but " a long road " lay ahead to resolve other issues .

alliance agrees to target afghan drug lords bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : afghanistan 's opium trade will become a nato target in other developments at the meeting in budapest , nato defense ministers agreed to target drugs traffickers and opium laboratories in afghanistan as part of the alliance 's efforts to undermine the taliban insurgency .
but under a compromise hammered out in budapest , member states participating in nato 's international security assistance force -lrb- isaf -rrb- in afghanistan will be free to opt in or out of any anti-narcotics operations .
nato secretary general jaap de hoop scheffer said ministers had agreed that the " isaf can , in concert with afghan authorities , act against facilities or facilitators supporting the insurgency . "
however , any action would be " subject to the authorization of specific nations , " the nato chief said .
that was a concession to countries like germany , spain and italy , who argue that the fight against drugs should be left to the afghan police .
these countries had also expressed concern that any nato raids on laboratories would kill civilians and undermine the alliance 's popularity among ordinary afghans .
in an effort to address such reservations , ministers also agreed to ensure that civilian casualties be minimized , and that the anti-narcotics fight be conducted mainly in the southern provinces of afghanistan , where cultivations and the insurgency both thrive .
jung said he was " very satisfied with the compromise " and added that the deal would allow german soldiers to " continue to support the training of the afghan security forces " and to limit its role to providing assistance to afghan-led operations through logistical , intelligence and medical support .
opium proceeds funding taliban resurgeance bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the taliban is being funded by the drugs trade nato officials said the plan was " consistent with the appropriate un security council resolutions " and with the isaf 's existing operational plan .
friday 's compromise would be reviewed in february , when defense ministers next meet in poland .
the deal clinched in budapest follows a specific request from afghan defense minister abdel rahim wardak , who on thursday had asked his nato colleagues to help his government target drugs laboratories and seize imports of the chemicals that are needed to turn opium into heroin .
" we have asked nato to support our efforts to destroy the laboratories and to interdict the chemical precursors which are coming from outside the country , " wardak said .
nato military commanders acknowledge that more needs to be done to fight the opium and heroin trade .
us defense secretary robert gates believes that the taliban pocket between 60 and 80 million dollars per year from the sale of drugs .
" it is not only corrosive to good governance , it also directly funds the people that are killing afghans , americans and all our coalition partners , " gates said in budapest on thursday .

10 to consider resuming high-level talks with russia , after moscow withdrew its troops from buffer zones in georgia . " if russia respects the six-point plan , and this appears to be the case , then we should resume dialogue with russia , " he told reporters at informal nato defense talks in the hungarian capital budapest .
" that means the nato-russia council should resume its work , " he said .
the western alliance froze such high level talks with russia in september , insisting that it could not do " business as usual " following moscow 's military operation in georgia .
russia sent troops into the former soviet republic in early august , after georgia tried to recover its breakaway region of south ossetia which , along with rebel abkhazia , moscow has since recognized as independent .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : jung urged nato to reach out to russia jung said he would like to see a " perspective " for the meetings to resume surface during the next round of talks with his nato counterparts , which is scheduled for february in cracow , poland .
the european union , whose french presidency brokered the six-point russia-georgia ceasefire agreement , is the institution which must decide whether moscow is respecting the accord .
but the bloc remained divided friday over whether that was the case , even after it appeared that russia had withdrawn its forces from the two buffer zones in line with the agreement .
russia sent troops into the former soviet republic in early august , amid a dispute over the breakaway region of south ossetia which , along with rebel abkhazia , moscow has since recognized as independent .
russian forces were still controlling two areas under georgian control prior to the conflict , the akhalgori district in south ossetia and the kodori gorge in abkhazia .
tbilisi insists the russians must leave the two areas to fully comply .
georgian efforts to become part of nato have infuriated russia , which objects to the prospect of its old cold war foe extending to its borders .
russian president dmitry medvedev has even accused nato of provoking the georgia conflict .
nato chief rules out high level talks bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : still no business as usual for nato 's de hoop scheffer nato secretary general jaap de hoop scheffer ruled out resuming high-level talks with russia after the alliance froze the meetings last month insisting that it could not do " business as usual with russia " since its attack on georgia in august .
" it is encouraging that russia seems to withdrawing its forces back to the pre-conflict lines , " scheffer told reporters , after a first ever meeting of the nato-georgia commission at ministerial level .
" but we are not in a situation where we go back to business as usual , " he said .
" it seems premature now to conclude that there will be a nato-russia council meeting in krakow , " scheffer said .
" that requires a discussion .
we are not at that stage yet . " "
us backs nato line on russian relations bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : it 's still too early to talk to russia , says the united states a senior official from the united states , which has staunchly backed georgia since the start , also agreed that it was too early to change nato 's approach , as russia still had to leave outstanding areas .
" there are clearly things that are going to have to be discussed , " he said , and warned : " we need to make sure that we do n't create a risky environment . "
scheffer said that the ministers did not discuss georgia 's nato aspirations , and that the topic would be taken up by alliance foreign ministers when they meet in brussels in december .
georgia 's military needs and reform efforts were addressed , but he insisted that nato would not supply tbilisi with any weapons as the nato chief spoke , french foreign minister bernard kouchner , whose country holds the european union 's rotating presidency , announced that russia had withdrawn from georgian buffer zones but " a long road " lay ahead to resolve other issues .
the european union , whose french presidency brokered the six-point russia-georgia ceasefire agreement , is the institution which must decide whether moscow is respecting the accord .
alliance agrees to target afghan drug lords bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : afghanistan 's opium trade will become a nato target in other developments at the meeting in budapest , nato defense ministers agreed to target drugs traffickers and opium laboratories in afghanistan as part of the alliance 's efforts to undermine the taliban insurgency .
but under a compromise hammered out in budapest , member states participating in nato 's international security assistance force -lrb- isaf -rrb- in afghanistan will be free to opt in or out of any anti-narcotics operations .
nato secretary general jaap de hoop scheffer said ministers had agreed that the " isaf can , in concert with afghan authorities , act against facilities or facilitators supporting the insurgency . "
however , any action would be " subject to the authorization of specific nations , " the nato chief said .
that was a concession to countries like germany , spain and italy , who argue that the fight against drugs should be left to the afghan police .
these countries had also expressed concern that any nato raids on laboratories would kill civilians and undermine the alliance 's popularity among ordinary afghans .
in an effort to address such reservations , ministers also agreed to ensure that civilian casualties be minimized , and that the anti-narcotics fight be conducted mainly in the southern provinces of afghanistan , where cultivations and the insurgency both thrive .
jung said he was " very satisfied with the compromise " and added that the deal would allow german soldiers to " continue to support the training of the afghan security forces " and to limit its role to providing assistance to afghan-led operations through logistical , intelligence and medical support .
opium proceeds funding taliban resurgeance bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the taliban is being funded by the drugs trade nato officials said the plan was " consistent with the appropriate un security council resolutions " and with the isaf 's existing operational plan .
friday 's compromise would be reviewed in february , when defense ministers next meet in poland .
the deal clinched in budapest follows a specific request from afghan defense minister abdel rahim wardak , who on thursday had asked his nato colleagues to help his government target drugs laboratories and seize imports of the chemicals that are needed to turn opium into heroin .
" we have asked nato to support our efforts to destroy the laboratories and to interdict the chemical precursors which are coming from outside the country , " wardak said .
nato military commanders acknowledge that more needs to be done to fight the opium and heroin trade .
us defense secretary robert gates believes that the taliban pocket between 60 and 80 million dollars per year from the sale of drugs .
" it is not only corrosive to good governance , it also directly funds the people that are killing afghans , americans and all our coalition partners , " gates said in budapest on thursday .
poppy cultivations have fallen by 19 per cent since last year , but afghan heroin still accounts for more than 90 per cent of the heroin circulating in europe . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : jung urged nato to reach out to russia jung said he would like to see a " perspective " for the meetings to resume surface during the next round of talks with his nato counterparts , which is scheduled for february in cracow , poland .
the european union , whose french presidency brokered the six-point russia-georgia ceasefire agreement , is the institution which must decide whether moscow is respecting the accord .
but the bloc remained divided friday over whether that was the case , even after it appeared that russia had withdrawn its forces from the two buffer zones in line with the agreement .
russia sent troops into the former soviet republic in early august , amid a dispute over the breakaway region of south ossetia which , along with rebel abkhazia , moscow has since recognized as independent .
russian forces were still controlling two areas under georgian control prior to the conflict , the akhalgori district in south ossetia and the kodori gorge in abkhazia .
tbilisi insists the russians must leave the two areas to fully comply .
georgian efforts to become part of nato have infuriated russia , which objects to the prospect of its old cold war foe extending to its borders .
russian president dmitry medvedev has even accused nato of provoking the georgia conflict .
nato chief rules out high level talks bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : still no business as usual for nato 's de hoop scheffer nato secretary general jaap de hoop scheffer ruled out resuming high-level talks with russia after the alliance froze the meetings last month insisting that it could not do " business as usual with russia " since its attack on georgia in august .
" it is encouraging that russia seems to withdrawing its forces back to the pre-conflict lines , " scheffer told reporters , after a first ever meeting of the nato-georgia commission at ministerial level .
" but we are not in a situation where we go back to business as usual , " he said .
" it seems premature now to conclude that there will be a nato-russia council meeting in krakow , " scheffer said .
" that requires a discussion .
we are not at that stage yet . " "
us backs nato line on russian relations bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : it 's still too early to talk to russia , says the united states a senior official from the united states , which has staunchly backed georgia since the start , also agreed that it was too early to change nato 's approach , as russia still had to leave outstanding areas .
" there are clearly things that are going to have to be discussed , " he said , and warned : " we need to make sure that we do n't create a risky environment . "
scheffer said that the ministers did not discuss georgia 's nato aspirations , and that the topic would be taken up by alliance foreign ministers when they meet in brussels in december .
georgia 's military needs and reform efforts were addressed , but he insisted that nato would not supply tbilisi with any weapons as the nato chief spoke , french foreign minister bernard kouchner , whose country holds the european union 's rotating presidency , announced that russia had withdrawn from georgian buffer zones but " a long road " lay ahead to resolve other issues .
the european union , whose french presidency brokered the six-point russia-georgia ceasefire agreement , is the institution which must decide whether moscow is respecting the accord .
alliance agrees to target afghan drug lords bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : afghanistan 's opium trade will become a nato target in other developments at the meeting in budapest , nato defense ministers agreed to target drugs traffickers and opium laboratories in afghanistan as part of the alliance 's efforts to undermine the taliban insurgency .
but under a compromise hammered out in budapest , member states participating in nato 's international security assistance force -lrb- isaf -rrb- in afghanistan will be free to opt in or out of any anti-narcotics operations .
nato secretary general jaap de hoop scheffer said ministers had agreed that the " isaf can , in concert with afghan authorities , act against facilities or facilitators supporting the insurgency . "
however , any action would be " subject to the authorization of specific nations , " the nato chief said .
that was a concession to countries like germany , spain and italy , who argue that the fight against drugs should be left to the afghan police .
these countries had also expressed concern that any nato raids on laboratories would kill civilians and undermine the alliance 's popularity among ordinary afghans .
in an effort to address such reservations , ministers also agreed to ensure that civilian casualties be minimized , and that the anti-narcotics fight be conducted mainly in the southern provinces of afghanistan , where cultivations and the insurgency both thrive .
jung said he was " very satisfied with the compromise " and added that the deal would allow german soldiers to " continue to support the training of the afghan security forces " and to limit its role to providing assistance to afghan-led operations through logistical , intelligence and medical support .
opium proceeds funding taliban resurgeance bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the taliban is being funded by the drugs trade nato officials said the plan was " consistent with the appropriate un security council resolutions " and with the isaf 's existing operational plan .
friday 's compromise would be reviewed in february , when defense ministers next meet in poland .
the deal clinched in budapest follows a specific request from afghan defense minister abdel rahim wardak , who on thursday had asked his nato colleagues to help his government target drugs laboratories and seize imports of the chemicals that are needed to turn opium into heroin .
" we have asked nato to support our efforts to destroy the laboratories and to interdict the chemical precursors which are coming from outside the country , " wardak said .
nato military commanders acknowledge that more needs to be done to fight the opium and heroin trade .
us defense secretary robert gates believes that the taliban pocket between 60 and 80 million dollars per year from the sale of drugs .
" it is not only corrosive to good governance , it also directly funds the people that are killing afghans , americans and all our coalition partners , " gates said in budapest on thursday .
poppy cultivations have fallen by 19 per cent since last year , but afghan heroin still accounts for more than 90 per cent of the heroin circulating in europe . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

however , british soccer is holding its breath as the credit crunch starts to bite in its top flight . hoeness was quoted in friday 's edition of the bild newspaper as saying that german soccer is well off even though income may drop .
" i believe that german soccer has less to worry than other countries , " said hoeness .
" the big question , however , is if we are moving into a recession where the advertising spending drops and companies are less inclined to pay money for sponsorship . "
the german 1974 world cup winner said that he was concerned for clubs in some other countries .
" here and there clubs could go under , but not the big ones .
chelsea , for instance , has its debts with abramovich , but they are not in danger because the club belongs to him .
there is no bank involved that can close the club , as long as abramovich does not demand his money back , " hoeness said .
" one needs to see if the ice on which everything was built will last . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : we 're in the money : bayern and hoeness are confident hoeness said that it was not certain that foreign investors in english soccer would continue investing such huge sums after losing a lot of money on the stock exchange .
" it would be good for competition if clubs in future actually had to earn the money they spent , " said hoeness .
he said that he was not concerned about his own club bayern munich , as they were financially " in a very strong position . "
meanwhile british soccer is holding its breath to see just how badly it will be affected by the collapse of many of the world 's banks and the ever-worsening financial crisis .

perhaps the one club most affected so far is west ham united , the east london club for whom the collapse this week of iceland 's second biggest bank , landsbanki , could yet spell disaster for their icelandic owners and for their own future .
rumors persist that the bank - now under the control of the iceland government - could repatriate any overseas assets .
icelandic troubles felt in london 's east end for that , read west ham and their chairman bjorgolfur gudmundsson , who paid 85 million pounds for the club in november 2006 but who may yet be forced to put up the for-sale sign .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : gudmundsson 's west ham is reeling from the icelandic crunch gudmundsson , who was sacked as chairman of the bank on tuesday , has stressed that the club is safe and claims that no players have to be sold .
but west ham vice-chairman asgeir fridgeirsson said on tuesday that players would have to go before any spending could happen in the january transfer window .
" west ham united has one of the biggest squads in the premier league , " fridgeirsson said on tuesday .
" it is very unlikely -lrb- the chairman -rrb- will be willing to put in more money to buy players this january window . "
when he took over as manager in september , gianfranco zola had seemed confident that he would have money to spend in january .
west ham told the dpa news agency on wednesday that zola has yet to request a meeting with the club 's board and nor has one been arranged , but it would seem to be only a matter of time before the italian requests clarification of the situation .
in a statement , placed on the club 's official website on tuesday , west ham chief executive scott duxbury reiterated that players would have to be sold before any new spending could be sanctioned .
" since his appointment , gianfranco zola has made it quite clear that his first team squad is too large and needs to be reduced so he can effectively coach the team , " the statement read .
" once this has happened and if the manager requires further players , then the club will acquire them . "
hammers hammered by credit crunch the collapse of landsbanki followed hot on the heels of the implosion of their shirt sponsor , the tour operator xl , which went bust in september .
that cost the club an estimated 5 million pounds , and with gudmundsson a guarantor of 163 million pounds to xl , west ham 's future looks less than rosy .
the west ham story is just one sorry tale and if the crisis deepens , others could yet be affected in a similar way .
bildunterschrift : the lse has been hit hard and british clubs have shuddered with the resulting tremors the football association chairman lord triesman warned on tuesday that the crisis could cripple some club who are heavily in debt , estimating that english clubs owe a total of 3 billion pounds .
and uefa general secretary david taylor has warned that clubs with huge debt could be excluded from future european competitions would see those clubs finances further depleted .
the biggest worry for west ham is that the crisis may not yet have reached its lowest point and fridgeirsson 's words had a nasty ring to them on tuesday .
" it is , of course , a blow for -lrb- gudmundsson -rrb- and his financial strength , but he himself has a number of other investments that are doing quite well at the moment so there is no reason to fear that he will not honor his commitment to west ham football club , " he said .
" he -lrb- gudmundsson -rrb- is not absolutely sure how this will directly affect him , but one thing he is sure of is that this will have no implications on the other investments of him and his family . "

west ham told the dpa news agency on wednesday that zola has yet to request a meeting with the club 's board and nor has one been arranged , but it would seem to be only a matter of time before the italian requests clarification of the situation .
in a statement , placed on the club 's official website on tuesday , west ham chief executive scott duxbury reiterated that players would have to be sold before any new spending could be sanctioned .
" since his appointment , gianfranco zola has made it quite clear that his first team squad is too large and needs to be reduced so he can effectively coach the team , " the statement read .
" once this has happened and if the manager requires further players , then the club will acquire them . "
hammers hammered by credit crunch the collapse of landsbanki followed hot on the heels of the implosion of their shirt sponsor , the tour operator xl , which went bust in september .

however , british soccer is holding its breath as the credit crunch starts to bite in its top flight . hoeness was quoted in friday 's edition of the bild newspaper as saying that german soccer is well off even though income may drop .
" i believe that german soccer has less to worry than other countries , " said hoeness .
" the big question , however , is if we are moving into a recession where the advertising spending drops and companies are less inclined to pay money for sponsorship . "
the german 1974 world cup winner said that he was concerned for clubs in some other countries .
" here and there clubs could go under , but not the big ones .
chelsea , for instance , has its debts with abramovich , but they are not in danger because the club belongs to him .
there is no bank involved that can close the club , as long as abramovich does not demand his money back , " hoeness said .
" one needs to see if the ice on which everything was built will last . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : we 're in the money : bayern and hoeness are confident hoeness said that it was not certain that foreign investors in english soccer would continue investing such huge sums after losing a lot of money on the stock exchange .
" it would be good for competition if clubs in future actually had to earn the money they spent , " said hoeness .
he said that he was not concerned about his own club bayern munich , as they were financially " in a very strong position . "
meanwhile british soccer is holding its breath to see just how badly it will be affected by the collapse of many of the world 's banks and the ever-worsening financial crisis .
british game suffering backlash once regarded in britain as the people 's game , the sport is now in danger of being torn apart , with several teams ' sponsors already having gone down the pan .

the overseas investment that had been looked upon as the ideal blueprint by many of the country 's top clubs is now in danger of becoming the poisoned chalice .
what good is investment , many clubs are asking themselves , if it ca n't be guaranteed ?
perhaps the one club most affected so far is west ham united , the east london club for whom the collapse this week of iceland 's second biggest bank , landsbanki , could yet spell disaster for their icelandic owners and for their own future .
rumors persist that the bank - now under the control of the iceland government - could repatriate any overseas assets .
icelandic troubles felt in london 's east end for that , read west ham and their chairman bjorgolfur gudmundsson , who paid 85 million pounds for the club in november 2006 but who may yet be forced to put up the for-sale sign .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : gudmundsson 's west ham is reeling from the icelandic crunch gudmundsson , who was sacked as chairman of the bank on tuesday , has stressed that the club is safe and claims that no players have to be sold .

" considering the crisis the international financial system is going through , it 's necessary to take really effective measures to protect markets and ensure their future stability , " medvedev said thursday , praising the example of european union cooperation in the face of financial crisis .
" we need such coordination if we want to stay competitive and overcome the consequences of the financial crisis with minimal losses , " he told journalists alongside the summit host , kyrgyz president kurmanbek bakiyev .
the nine presidents to attend the commonwealth of independent states -lrb- cis -rrb- meeting jointly called for common economic goals among members and cooperation in combating drug trafficking .
but the summit raised more questions about the group 's relevance than it answered , with high levels of presidential absenteeism at the closing news conference .

at the post-summit press conference , medvedev told reports that russia was fully complying with an eu-brokered ceasefire to the conflict that called for a return of military personnel to pre-war positions .
" everything that depended on us we 've done .
all the obligations we undertook ... we have fulfilled , " he said .

10 that the us government was doing all it could to keep the world 's largest economy afloat ahead of a meeting with other g7 leaders in wasiungton . bush 's comments came as global stocks were in free-fall and ministers from the world 's richest nations prepared for a crucial meeting .
bush said a " startling " drop in us stocks in the last few days was being " driven by uncertainty and fear " and insisted the us already had all the tools necessary to resolve the financial crisis .
" this has been a deeply unsettling period for the american people , " bush acknowledged .
" we will continue to act to resolve this crisis and restore stability to our markets . "
us stocks have plummeted more than 10 percent in the last three days and continued falling on a wild trading day friday .
european stocks also tumbled , leading some countries to temporarily halt trading .
bush touts global cooperation bush said that international cooperation was key as finance ministers from the group of seven industrial nations were set to meet in washington .
" the world is sending an unmistakable signal : we 're in this together , we will come through this together , " bush said in a statement outside the white house .
the g7 bloc will also look to reassure the markets in a statement following its first meeting since the financial crisis broadened significantly last month , starting with the bankruptcy of us finance firm lehman brothers .
ministers could announce a joint commitment to intervene in their struggling banking industries .
ministers and central bank heads acknowledged cooperation was the only way forward in a crisis that has spread from the united states to europe and the rest of the world .
isolated efforts wo n't work : steinbrueck bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : steinbrueck says the crisis is beyond " case-by-case " answers german finance minister peer steinbrueck said germany was weighing its own large-scale rescue of banks in europe 's largest economy .
" the downward spiral has gathered pace .
case-by-case answers are not going to help any more , even in germany , " he said in washington .
bush will meet with the g7 ministers on saturday , while treasury secretary henry paulson will also be hosting an emergency meeting of finance chiefs from the world 's 20 leading economies , in a sign of how far the crisis has spread .
dominique strauss-kahn , managing director of the international monetary fund , said thursday the world was on the " cusp " of a recession .
the imf and world bank also hold their annual meetings this weekend .
bush announced no new moves to ease the us credit crunch that has curbed the availability of loans to consumers and small businesses .
instead he cited the litany of us government interventions and powers already in play after congress last week passed a $ 700-billion rescue package that gives the treasury broad authority to intervene in the banking system .
" we know what the problems are , we have the tools to fix them and we are working quickly to do so , " bush said . dpa news agency -lrb- dfm -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the directory , which telekom maintains had been stolen , had contained the private numbers of high-profile politicians and celebrities , as well as customer mobile phone numbers , addresses , dates of birth and , in some cases , email addresses .
bank information or credit card numbers were not accessed , said the bonn-based firm .
in germany , most wireless-line numbers are ex-directory and confidential .
telekom chief executive rene obermann said at the company 's head office in bonn that in future , the company would voluntarily brief the public on a dedicated web site about " critical data-privacy incidents " undergoing criminal investigation .
" in the race against data theft , we want to be at least one step ahead at all times , " he said .
a seventh board department will be set up to deal with privacy and the company will issue data privacy reports every six months .
the former german telecommunications industry monopolizer is also to stop using an internet-style system where any computer can be used to query its databanks using the right password .
employees and sales partners will only be able to access sensitive systems from specific computers .
saturday 's revelation was not telekom 's first brush with data scandals .
earlier this year , the firm admitted that calls between journalists and board members had been illegally monitored in 2005 and 2006 . dw staff -lrb- dfm -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" there is a formal agreement between the nato nations to fight drug trafficking , " a diplomat confirmed as defense ministers met in the hungarian capital budapest for a two-day meeting to discuss issues ranging from the war in afghanistan to georgia 's nato membership bid and piracy off the somali coast .
nato spokesman james appathurai said the alliance 's international security assistance force -lrb- isaf -rrb- would " act in concert with the afghans , against facilities and facilitators supporting the insurgency . "
the isaf currently has 50,700 soldiers in afghanistan , up from about 45,000 six months ago .
the german parliament agreed tuesday , oct .
7 to increase its contribution by 1,000 soldiers , raising its total to 4,500 .
us lobbies for afghan drug action sources also said that nato 's anti-narcotics efforts would be temporary , and would be open only to those countries willing to participate .
us defense secretary robert gates had pitched hard at the meeting for nato to strike at the heart of the afghan opium trade , which is believed to have contributed substantially to a reinvigorated taliban insurgency aimed at destabilizing president hamid karzai 's government .
" it -lrb- the opium trade -rrb- is not only corrosive to good governance , it also directly funds the people that are killing afghans , americans and all our coalition partners , " gates said in budapest on thursday .
the deal followed a request from afghan defense minister abdel rahim wardak , who on thursday asked nato to help his government target drug laboratories and seize imports of the chemicals needed to turn opium into heroin .
" we have asked nato to support our efforts to destroy the laboratories and to interdict the chemical precursors which are coming from outside the country , " wardak said .
germany in favor of afghan-led operations nato military commanders agreed that more needed to be done to fight the opium and heroin trade , a view shared by most alliance members .
the taliban are thought to be pocketing up to $ 80 million a year from the afghan narcotics industry , which is the source of some 92 percent of the world 's opium and heroin .
germany , spain , greece , poland , romania and italy had expressed scepticism over the plans , saying the fight against the afghan drugs trade was not part of nato 's mandate and should be addressed by the afghans themselves .
german defence minister franz josef jung said thursday germany was willing to assist in reconnaissance of trafficking routes and in training but any operations should be afghan-led .
" if this keeps an afghan face then it 's also in our interest that we support such an activity , " he told reporters on thursday .
ministers also worried that bombing laboratories would kill civilians and undermine the alliance 's popularity among ordinary afghans .

his breakthrough as a mediator came in namibia , which achieved independence in 1990 , capping years of work by the finnish national who served as special representative to the united nations secretary general and head of the un 's transition assistance team .
ahtisaari and his wife , eeva , were made honorary citizens of the southern african nation .
formative years ahtisaari has said his interest in peace mediation can be traced to his childhood years .
he was born on june 23 , 1937 in viipuri , a city that finland had to secede to the soviet union during the second world war , forcing 400,000 finns from karelia to relocate to finland .
the experience of being displaced fuelled his interest to promote peace and " help others , " he has said .
a second major achievement was the august 2005 peace deal between indonesia and the separatist free aceh movement -lrb- gam -rrb- aimed at ending a decades-long conflict in the indonesian province , and forged in the wake of the devastation caused by the december 2004 tsunami .
he has said mediation is " an ' art ' rather than an established practice , " adding that each conflict needs to be treated as a separate case .
mediation efforts ahtisaari 's hopes for the 2006 peace prize were dashed as the nobel committee selected muhammad yunus of bangladesh who founded the grameen bank that offers loans to the poor .
after qualifying as a teacher in 1959 , ahtisaari joined the foreign ministry in 1965 .
he served as ambassador to tanzania and held top posts in the foreign ministry and later in the un .
after his term as president 1994-2000 during which finland joined the european union , ahtisaari formed the crisis management initiative -lrb- cmi -rrb- that has been engaged in various mediation efforts .
while in office in 1999 , ahtisaari along with former russian prime minister viktor chernomyrdin and former us deputy secretary of state strobe talbott hammered out a plan to resolve the kosovo crisis that then-yugoslav president slobodan milosevic could accept .
accolades in 2000 he was called in to inspect irish republican army -lrb- ira -rrb- arms caches in northern ireland and later served as un special envoy for the horn of africa .
in recent years , ahtisaari has been engaged in discussing the future of the eu including turkey 's possible membership .
almost three years ago , in november 2005 , he was named special un envoy to kosovo but his efforts to bridge the divisions over kosovo 's status were unsuccessful and he stepped down after presenting his recommendations in february 2008 .
he has won numerous awards including the un cultural organization unesco 's felix houphouet-boigny peace prize for 2008 , named after the late president of ivory coast , as well as several honorary doctorates .
the funds from the unesco award were to be used for a foundation to promote peace , mediation and help post-conflict societies .
crowning glory the nobel , which is worth 10 million kronor -lrb- $ 1.5 million -rrb- , will be handed over at a ceremony in oslo on december 10 .
in 2007 , the peace prize was shared by the united nations climate body , the intergovernmental panel on climate change -lrb- ipcc -rrb- and al gore of the united states for their work on climate change .
for this year 's award , the five-member nobel committee had received 197 nominations for the coveted award including 33 organizations . dpa news agency -lrb- jp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

he was born on june 23 , 1937 in viipuri , a city that finland had to secede to the soviet union during the second world war , forcing 400,000 finns from karelia to relocate to finland .
the experience of being displaced fuelled his interest to promote peace and " help others , " he has said .
a second major achievement was the august 2005 peace deal between indonesia and the separatist free aceh movement -lrb- gam -rrb- aimed at ending a decades-long conflict in the indonesian province , and forged in the wake of the devastation caused by the december 2004 tsunami .
he has said mediation is " an ' art ' rather than an established practice , " adding that each conflict needs to be treated as a separate case .
mediation efforts ahtisaari 's hopes for the 2006 peace prize were dashed as the nobel committee selected muhammad yunus of bangladesh who founded the grameen bank that offers loans to the poor .
after qualifying as a teacher in 1959 , ahtisaari joined the foreign ministry in 1965 .
he served as ambassador to tanzania and held top posts in the foreign ministry and later in the un .
after his term as president 1994-2000 during which finland joined the european union , ahtisaari formed the crisis management initiative -lrb- cmi -rrb- that has been engaged in various mediation efforts .
while in office in 1999 , ahtisaari along with former russian prime minister viktor chernomyrdin and former us deputy secretary of state strobe talbott hammered out a plan to resolve the kosovo crisis that then-yugoslav president slobodan milosevic could accept .
accolades in 2000 he was called in to inspect irish republican army -lrb- ira -rrb- arms caches in northern ireland and later served as un special envoy for the horn of africa .
in recent years , ahtisaari has been engaged in discussing the future of the eu including turkey 's possible membership .
almost three years ago , in november 2005 , he was named special un envoy to kosovo but his efforts to bridge the divisions over kosovo 's status were unsuccessful and he stepped down after presenting his recommendations in february 2008 .
he has won numerous awards including the un cultural organization unesco 's felix houphouet-boigny peace prize for 2008 , named after the late president of ivory coast , as well as several honorary doctorates .
the funds from the unesco award were to be used for a foundation to promote peace , mediation and help post-conflict societies .
crowning glory the nobel , which is worth 10 million kronor -lrb- $ 1.5 million -rrb- , will be handed over at a ceremony in oslo on december 10 .
in 2007 , the peace prize was shared by the united nations climate body , the intergovernmental panel on climate change -lrb- ipcc -rrb- and al gore of the united states for their work on climate change .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de climate -pipe- 10.10.2008 scientist warns climate change happening faster than predicted großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : scientists warn sea levels are rising faster than predicted global warming calculations have been too optimistic and global sea levels are likely to rise a full meter this century , senior german scientists have warned .
they say un-backed data on climate change is out of date . " we should prepare for a rise of sea levels of one meter this century , " said joachim schellnhuber , head of the potsdam institute for climate impact research -lrb- pik -rrb- , which advises the german government on environmental policy .
the melting rates of glaciers in the himalayas and the greenland ice-sheet have doubled or even tripled in recent years , due partly to increased greenhouse gas emissions by chinese power stations , he said .
his findings used data which was unavailable to the intergovernmental panel on climate change -lrb- ipcc -rrb- when it compiled its most recent global warming report .
in february 2007 , in the first volume of a landmark report , the nobel prize-winning ipcc predicted the oceans would rise by between 18 and 59 centimeters by 2100 .
the umbrella effect bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the earth is hurtling toward a warmer age at a quickening pace , say scientists further causes for concern include a drop in the amount of dirt particles in the air that protect from sunlight .
schellnhuber warned that cleaning air in beijing and in other large cities suffering from pollution problems by limiting car and power-plant emissions may raise global temperatures instead of lowering them .
aerosols , or particles suspended in air , have a cooling effect on the earth , countering global warming linked to carbon dioxide , said schellnhuber , explaining that a drop in aerosols in the atmosphere could cause a rapid rise in temperatures .
airborne pollutants act as an umbrella worldwide while co2 provides insulation , trapping heat attempting to escape into the atmosphere .
a rise in temperature because of declines in aerosols in the atmosphere can be offset by slashing co2 emissions , he said .
by not reducing carbon output , humanity " is closing the last door we have through which we can possibly influence the global climate , " schellnhuber warned .
urgent need for action bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : carbon emissions must be cut back - now the scientist stressed that there is what he called a 50-50 chance of limiting the global temperature rise to 2 degrees celsius -lrb- 3.6 degrees fahrenheit -rrb- before 2100 , which would avert the worst damage of climate change - so long as plans fleshed out by the g8 countries to reduce emissions are realized .
the united nations-sponsored climate-change talks this december in poznan , poland , and next year in copenhagen must reach an agreement to limit co2 , he added .
" there is really no time to spare , " schellnhuber said in an interview with bloomberg .
" technology will play a decisive role in limiting carbon but we have to move to a carbon-free world by the end of the century . "
german environment minister sigmar gabriel -lrb- spd -rrb- has warned that environmental issues risk being neglected because of the global financial crisis .
" we can spend relatively little money now or vast sums in decades to come , " he was quoted as saying in zeit online .
" we are wealthy enough to afford climate protection - and we are too badly-off to ignore it . " dw staff -lrb- jp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?
dw-world.de sociologist : climate change is a chance to work together climate change offers europe a chance to change the way the world solves problems by drawing in poorer countries , says sociologist ulrich beck in an exclusive essay for dw-world.de. -lrb- 22.07.2008 -rrb- environmentalists slam g8 's emissions deal as meaningless as g8 leaders trumpeted their landmark deal to cut global emissions by 50 per cent by 2050 , the ' 50/50 ' agreement , which has yet to be sealed , was quickly lambasted by environmentalists as virtually meaningless .

london and frankfurt erased more than 10 percent and paris more than nine percent as market turmoil showed no sign of easing , despite coordinated interest rate cuts and billions of dollars ' worth of cash injections . london 's ftse 100 index of leading shares nosedived 10.20 percent to as low as 3,873.99 points - the first time below 4,000 points since july 3 , 2002 - before pulling back to show a loss of 5.08 percent . frankfurt 's dax 30 also shed more than 10.0 percent and in paris the cac 40 dived 9.68 percent , before both markets trimmed their losses somewhat .
earlier , stocks in tokyo ended friday trading lower , with the benchmark nikkei 225 stock average plunging below the psychologically significant mark of 9,000 points for the first time in more than five years .
the fresh wave of worries drove up the gold price by more than 4 per cent with the deepening concerns about the economic outlook sending the oil price down by about 5 percent .
g7 under pressure to take global action us treasury secretary henry paulson , who will host the g7 finance ministers at the us treasury next door to the white house , said the meeting was intended to review steps already taken and ways to " further enhance our collective efforts . "
participants are under a lot of pressure to take constructive steps towards coordinated moves to stem the crisis .
british prime minister gordon brown called for a global solution to the crisis and urged other countries to adopt britain 's actions to save the banking system . other governments should follow britain in putting money into struggling banks and offering guarantees worth hundreds of billions to persuade banks to start lending to each other , brown wrote in an article in the times newspaper . " because this is a global problem , it requires a global solution , " he wrote . in berlin , german chancellor angela merkel said she could not rule out nationalizing any of the country 's banks , following similar moves in other european countries such as britain .
" no possibility can be fully ruled out , " merkel said in berlin . last weekend , berlin announced a 50 billion euro -lrb- $ 68 billion -rrb- rescue package for germany 's fourth biggest bank hypo real estate , one of three of the country 's banks that have needed help over the past year .
but merkel 's government has so far not partly or fully nationalized any of its lenders - unlike britain , which on wednesday pledged 64 billion euros -lrb- $ 87 billion -rrb- to buy stakes in the country 's beleaguered banks .
bush calls for " common policy " president george w bush on thursday called for a " common policy " between the united states and europe to address the financial crisis that has threatened the world 's economy . bush , meeting with slovak president ivan gasparovic , said he discussed " our common desire to work with our european friends to develop a best as possible common policy . " bush on wednesday spoke with french president nicolas sarkozy , british prime minister gordon brown , german chancellor angela merkel and italian prime minister silvio berlusconi to coordinate efforts to prevent more economic damage . world " on the cusp of recession " as well as the g7 meeting , talks will be held at the international monetary fund -lrb- imf -rrb- in washington . imf chief dominique strauss-kahn said the world was " on the cusp of recession " , but could still recover .
he urged countries to act " quickly , forcefully , and co-operatively " to solve the global economic problems .
he said further coordinated action was necessary to calm financial markets : " all kinds of policy co-operation are to be commended . "
but he issued a stark warning against countries acting unilaterally to fight the crisis .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de finance -pipe- 10.10.2008 bush seeks to calm global financial fears ahead of g7 meeting großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : president bush said the us already had the tools necessary to halt the crisis us president george w. bush offered assurances friday , oct .
10 that the us government was doing all it could to keep the world 's largest economy afloat ahead of a meeting with other g7 leaders in wasiungton . bush 's comments came as global stocks were in free-fall and ministers from the world 's richest nations prepared for a crucial meeting .
bush said a " startling " drop in us stocks in the last few days was being " driven by uncertainty and fear " and insisted the us already had all the tools necessary to resolve the financial crisis .
" this has been a deeply unsettling period for the american people , " bush acknowledged .
" we will continue to act to resolve this crisis and restore stability to our markets . "
us stocks have plummeted more than 10 percent in the last three days and continued falling on a wild trading day friday .
european stocks also tumbled , leading some countries to temporarily halt trading .
bush touts global cooperation bush said that international cooperation was key as finance ministers from the group of seven industrial nations were set to meet in washington .
" the world is sending an unmistakable signal : we 're in this together , we will come through this together , " bush said in a statement outside the white house .
the g7 bloc will also look to reassure the markets in a statement following its first meeting since the financial crisis broadened significantly last month , starting with the bankruptcy of us finance firm lehman brothers .
ministers could announce a joint commitment to intervene in their struggling banking industries .
ministers and central bank heads acknowledged cooperation was the only way forward in a crisis that has spread from the united states to europe and the rest of the world .
isolated efforts wo n't work : steinbrueck bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : steinbrueck says the crisis is beyond " case-by-case " answers german finance minister peer steinbrueck said germany was weighing its own large-scale rescue of banks in europe 's largest economy .
" the downward spiral has gathered pace .
case-by-case answers are not going to help any more , even in germany , " he said in washington .
bush will meet with the g7 ministers on saturday , while treasury secretary henry paulson will also be hosting an emergency meeting of finance chiefs from the world 's 20 leading economies , in a sign of how far the crisis has spread .
dominique strauss-kahn , managing director of the international monetary fund , said thursday the world was on the " cusp " of a recession .
the imf and world bank also hold their annual meetings this weekend .
bush announced no new moves to ease the us credit crunch that has curbed the availability of loans to consumers and small businesses .
instead he cited the litany of us government interventions and powers already in play after congress last week passed a $ 700-billion rescue package that gives the treasury broad authority to intervene in the banking system .
" we know what the problems are , we have the tools to fix them and we are working quickly to do so , " bush said . dpa news agency -lrb- dfm -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

10 that the us government was doing all it could to keep the world 's largest economy afloat ahead of a meeting with other g7 leaders in wasiungton . bush 's comments came as global stocks were in free-fall and ministers from the world 's richest nations prepared for a crucial meeting .
bush said a " startling " drop in us stocks in the last few days was being " driven by uncertainty and fear " and insisted the us already had all the tools necessary to resolve the financial crisis .
" this has been a deeply unsettling period for the american people , " bush acknowledged .
" we will continue to act to resolve this crisis and restore stability to our markets . "
us stocks have plummeted more than 10 percent in the last three days and continued falling on a wild trading day friday .
european stocks also tumbled , leading some countries to temporarily halt trading .
bush touts global cooperation bush said that international cooperation was key as finance ministers from the group of seven industrial nations were set to meet in washington .
" the world is sending an unmistakable signal : we 're in this together , we will come through this together , " bush said in a statement outside the white house .
the g7 bloc will also look to reassure the markets in a statement following its first meeting since the financial crisis broadened significantly last month , starting with the bankruptcy of us finance firm lehman brothers .
ministers could announce a joint commitment to intervene in their struggling banking industries .
ministers and central bank heads acknowledged cooperation was the only way forward in a crisis that has spread from the united states to europe and the rest of the world .
isolated efforts wo n't work : steinbrueck bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : steinbrueck says the crisis is beyond " case-by-case " answers german finance minister peer steinbrueck said germany was weighing its own large-scale rescue of banks in europe 's largest economy .
" the downward spiral has gathered pace .
case-by-case answers are not going to help any more , even in germany , " he said in washington .
bush will meet with the g7 ministers on saturday , while treasury secretary henry paulson will also be hosting an emergency meeting of finance chiefs from the world 's 20 leading economies , in a sign of how far the crisis has spread .
dominique strauss-kahn , managing director of the international monetary fund , said thursday the world was on the " cusp " of a recession .
the imf and world bank also hold their annual meetings this weekend .
bush announced no new moves to ease the us credit crunch that has curbed the availability of loans to consumers and small businesses .
instead he cited the litany of us government interventions and powers already in play after congress last week passed a $ 700-billion rescue package that gives the treasury broad authority to intervene in the banking system .
" we know what the problems are , we have the tools to fix them and we are working quickly to do so , " bush said . dpa news agency -lrb- dfm -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

10 to consider resuming high-level talks with russia , after moscow withdrew its troops from buffer zones in georgia . " if russia respects the six-point plan , and this appears to be the case , then we should resume dialogue with russia , " he told reporters at informal nato defense talks in the hungarian capital budapest .
" that means the nato-russia council should resume its work , " he said .
the western alliance froze such high level talks with russia in september , insisting that it could not do " business as usual " following moscow 's military operation in georgia .
russia sent troops into the former soviet republic in early august , after georgia tried to recover its breakaway region of south ossetia which , along with rebel abkhazia , moscow has since recognized as independent .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : jung urged nato to reach out to russia jung said he would like to see a " perspective " for the meetings to resume surface during the next round of talks with his nato counterparts , which is scheduled for february in cracow , poland .
the european union , whose french presidency brokered the six-point russia-georgia ceasefire agreement , is the institution which must decide whether moscow is respecting the accord .
but the bloc remained divided friday over whether that was the case , even after it appeared that russia had withdrawn its forces from the two buffer zones in line with the agreement .
russia sent troops into the former soviet republic in early august , amid a dispute over the breakaway region of south ossetia which , along with rebel abkhazia , moscow has since recognized as independent .
russian forces were still controlling two areas under georgian control prior to the conflict , the akhalgori district in south ossetia and the kodori gorge in abkhazia .
tbilisi insists the russians must leave the two areas to fully comply .
georgian efforts to become part of nato have infuriated russia , which objects to the prospect of its old cold war foe extending to its borders .
russian president dmitry medvedev has even accused nato of provoking the georgia conflict .
nato chief rules out high level talks bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : still no business as usual for nato 's de hoop scheffer nato secretary general jaap de hoop scheffer ruled out resuming high-level talks with russia after the alliance froze the meetings last month insisting that it could not do " business as usual with russia " since its attack on georgia in august .
" it is encouraging that russia seems to withdrawing its forces back to the pre-conflict lines , " scheffer told reporters , after a first ever meeting of the nato-georgia commission at ministerial level .
" but we are not in a situation where we go back to business as usual , " he said .
" it seems premature now to conclude that there will be a nato-russia council meeting in krakow , " scheffer said .
" that requires a discussion .
we are not at that stage yet . " "
us backs nato line on russian relations bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : it 's still too early to talk to russia , says the united states a senior official from the united states , which has staunchly backed georgia since the start , also agreed that it was too early to change nato 's approach , as russia still had to leave outstanding areas .
" there are clearly things that are going to have to be discussed , " he said , and warned : " we need to make sure that we do n't create a risky environment . "
scheffer said that the ministers did not discuss georgia 's nato aspirations , and that the topic would be taken up by alliance foreign ministers when they meet in brussels in december .
georgia 's military needs and reform efforts were addressed , but he insisted that nato would not supply tbilisi with any weapons as the nato chief spoke , french foreign minister bernard kouchner , whose country holds the european union 's rotating presidency , announced that russia had withdrawn from georgian buffer zones but " a long road " lay ahead to resolve other issues .
the european union , whose french presidency brokered the six-point russia-georgia ceasefire agreement , is the institution which must decide whether moscow is respecting the accord .
alliance agrees to target afghan drug lords bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : afghanistan 's opium trade will become a nato target in other developments at the meeting in budapest , nato defense ministers agreed to target drugs traffickers and opium laboratories in afghanistan as part of the alliance 's efforts to undermine the taliban insurgency .
but under a compromise hammered out in budapest , member states participating in nato 's international security assistance force -lrb- isaf -rrb- in afghanistan will be free to opt in or out of any anti-narcotics operations .
nato secretary general jaap de hoop scheffer said ministers had agreed that the " isaf can , in concert with afghan authorities , act against facilities or facilitators supporting the insurgency . "
however , any action would be " subject to the authorization of specific nations , " the nato chief said .
that was a concession to countries like germany , spain and italy , who argue that the fight against drugs should be left to the afghan police .
these countries had also expressed concern that any nato raids on laboratories would kill civilians and undermine the alliance 's popularity among ordinary afghans .
in an effort to address such reservations , ministers also agreed to ensure that civilian casualties be minimized , and that the anti-narcotics fight be conducted mainly in the southern provinces of afghanistan , where cultivations and the insurgency both thrive .
jung said he was " very satisfied with the compromise " and added that the deal would allow german soldiers to " continue to support the training of the afghan security forces " and to limit its role to providing assistance to afghan-led operations through logistical , intelligence and medical support .
opium proceeds funding taliban resurgeance bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the taliban is being funded by the drugs trade nato officials said the plan was " consistent with the appropriate un security council resolutions " and with the isaf 's existing operational plan .
friday 's compromise would be reviewed in february , when defense ministers next meet in poland .
the deal clinched in budapest follows a specific request from afghan defense minister abdel rahim wardak , who on thursday had asked his nato colleagues to help his government target drugs laboratories and seize imports of the chemicals that are needed to turn opium into heroin .
" we have asked nato to support our efforts to destroy the laboratories and to interdict the chemical precursors which are coming from outside the country , " wardak said .
nato military commanders acknowledge that more needs to be done to fight the opium and heroin trade .
us defense secretary robert gates believes that the taliban pocket between 60 and 80 million dollars per year from the sale of drugs .
" it is not only corrosive to good governance , it also directly funds the people that are killing afghans , americans and all our coalition partners , " gates said in budapest on thursday .
poppy cultivations have fallen by 19 per cent since last year , but afghan heroin still accounts for more than 90 per cent of the heroin circulating in europe . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

however , british soccer is holding its breath as the credit crunch starts to bite in its top flight . hoeness was quoted in friday 's edition of the bild newspaper as saying that german soccer is well off even though income may drop .
" i believe that german soccer has less to worry than other countries , " said hoeness .
" the big question , however , is if we are moving into a recession where the advertising spending drops and companies are less inclined to pay money for sponsorship . "
the german 1974 world cup winner said that he was concerned for clubs in some other countries .
" here and there clubs could go under , but not the big ones .
chelsea , for instance , has its debts with abramovich , but they are not in danger because the club belongs to him .
there is no bank involved that can close the club , as long as abramovich does not demand his money back , " hoeness said .
" one needs to see if the ice on which everything was built will last . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : we 're in the money : bayern and hoeness are confident hoeness said that it was not certain that foreign investors in english soccer would continue investing such huge sums after losing a lot of money on the stock exchange .
" it would be good for competition if clubs in future actually had to earn the money they spent , " said hoeness .
he said that he was not concerned about his own club bayern munich , as they were financially " in a very strong position . "
meanwhile british soccer is holding its breath to see just how badly it will be affected by the collapse of many of the world 's banks and the ever-worsening financial crisis .
british game suffering backlash once regarded in britain as the people 's game , the sport is now in danger of being torn apart , with several teams ' sponsors already having gone down the pan .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : man utd 's sponsor aig had to be bailed out in the us manchester united shirt sponsor aig was bailed out by the us government , as was newcastle united 's shirt sponsor , northern rock , by the british government .
work on liverpool 's new ground has been delayed as owners keep a close eye on exactly what is happening to their cash .
the overseas investment that had been looked upon as the ideal blueprint by many of the country 's top clubs is now in danger of becoming the poisoned chalice .
what good is investment , many clubs are asking themselves , if it ca n't be guaranteed ?
perhaps the one club most affected so far is west ham united , the east london club for whom the collapse this week of iceland 's second biggest bank , landsbanki , could yet spell disaster for their icelandic owners and for their own future .
rumors persist that the bank - now under the control of the iceland government - could repatriate any overseas assets .
icelandic troubles felt in london 's east end for that , read west ham and their chairman bjorgolfur gudmundsson , who paid 85 million pounds for the club in november 2006 but who may yet be forced to put up the for-sale sign .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : gudmundsson 's west ham is reeling from the icelandic crunch gudmundsson , who was sacked as chairman of the bank on tuesday , has stressed that the club is safe and claims that no players have to be sold .
but west ham vice-chairman asgeir fridgeirsson said on tuesday that players would have to go before any spending could happen in the january transfer window .
" west ham united has one of the biggest squads in the premier league , " fridgeirsson said on tuesday .
" it is very unlikely -lrb- the chairman -rrb- will be willing to put in more money to buy players this january window . "
when he took over as manager in september , gianfranco zola had seemed confident that he would have money to spend in january .
west ham told the dpa news agency on wednesday that zola has yet to request a meeting with the club 's board and nor has one been arranged , but it would seem to be only a matter of time before the italian requests clarification of the situation .
in a statement , placed on the club 's official website on tuesday , west ham chief executive scott duxbury reiterated that players would have to be sold before any new spending could be sanctioned .
" since his appointment , gianfranco zola has made it quite clear that his first team squad is too large and needs to be reduced so he can effectively coach the team , " the statement read .
" once this has happened and if the manager requires further players , then the club will acquire them . "
hammers hammered by credit crunch the collapse of landsbanki followed hot on the heels of the implosion of their shirt sponsor , the tour operator xl , which went bust in september .
that cost the club an estimated 5 million pounds , and with gudmundsson a guarantor of 163 million pounds to xl , west ham 's future looks less than rosy .
the west ham story is just one sorry tale and if the crisis deepens , others could yet be affected in a similar way .
bildunterschrift : the lse has been hit hard and british clubs have shuddered with the resulting tremors the football association chairman lord triesman warned on tuesday that the crisis could cripple some club who are heavily in debt , estimating that english clubs owe a total of 3 billion pounds .
and uefa general secretary david taylor has warned that clubs with huge debt could be excluded from future european competitions would see those clubs finances further depleted .
the biggest worry for west ham is that the crisis may not yet have reached its lowest point and fridgeirsson 's words had a nasty ring to them on tuesday .
" it is , of course , a blow for -lrb- gudmundsson -rrb- and his financial strength , but he himself has a number of other investments that are doing quite well at the moment so there is no reason to fear that he will not honor his commitment to west ham football club , " he said .
" he -lrb- gudmundsson -rrb- is not absolutely sure how this will directly affect him , but one thing he is sure of is that this will have no implications on the other investments of him and his family . "

his breakthrough as a mediator came in namibia , which achieved independence in 1990 , capping years of work by the finnish national who served as special representative to the united nations secretary general and head of the un 's transition assistance team .
ahtisaari and his wife , eeva , were made honorary citizens of the southern african nation .
formative years ahtisaari has said his interest in peace mediation can be traced to his childhood years .
he was born on june 23 , 1937 in viipuri , a city that finland had to secede to the soviet union during the second world war , forcing 400,000 finns from karelia to relocate to finland .
the experience of being displaced fuelled his interest to promote peace and " help others , " he has said .
a second major achievement was the august 2005 peace deal between indonesia and the separatist free aceh movement -lrb- gam -rrb- aimed at ending a decades-long conflict in the indonesian province , and forged in the wake of the devastation caused by the december 2004 tsunami .
he has said mediation is " an ' art ' rather than an established practice , " adding that each conflict needs to be treated as a separate case .
mediation efforts ahtisaari 's hopes for the 2006 peace prize were dashed as the nobel committee selected muhammad yunus of bangladesh who founded the grameen bank that offers loans to the poor .
after qualifying as a teacher in 1959 , ahtisaari joined the foreign ministry in 1965 .
he served as ambassador to tanzania and held top posts in the foreign ministry and later in the un .
after his term as president 1994-2000 during which finland joined the european union , ahtisaari formed the crisis management initiative -lrb- cmi -rrb- that has been engaged in various mediation efforts .
while in office in 1999 , ahtisaari along with former russian prime minister viktor chernomyrdin and former us deputy secretary of state strobe talbott hammered out a plan to resolve the kosovo crisis that then-yugoslav president slobodan milosevic could accept .
accolades in 2000 he was called in to inspect irish republican army -lrb- ira -rrb- arms caches in northern ireland and later served as un special envoy for the horn of africa .
in recent years , ahtisaari has been engaged in discussing the future of the eu including turkey 's possible membership .
almost three years ago , in november 2005 , he was named special un envoy to kosovo but his efforts to bridge the divisions over kosovo 's status were unsuccessful and he stepped down after presenting his recommendations in february 2008 .
he has won numerous awards including the un cultural organization unesco 's felix houphouet-boigny peace prize for 2008 , named after the late president of ivory coast , as well as several honorary doctorates .
the funds from the unesco award were to be used for a foundation to promote peace , mediation and help post-conflict societies .
crowning glory the nobel , which is worth 10 million kronor -lrb- $ 1.5 million -rrb- , will be handed over at a ceremony in oslo on december 10 .
in 2007 , the peace prize was shared by the united nations climate body , the intergovernmental panel on climate change -lrb- ipcc -rrb- and al gore of the united states for their work on climate change .
for this year 's award , the five-member nobel committee had received 197 nominations for the coveted award including 33 organizations . dpa news agency -lrb- jp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the british olympic association -lrb- boa -rrb- is pressing ahead with plans to field a great britain football team in 2012 .
boa chief executive simon clegg said he was " disappointed " that the football association of wales -lrb- faw -rrb- had refused approaches to discuss the matter .
the faw said the world cup and european championships were more important .
the football governing bodies of wales , northern ireland and scotland are all opposed to a great britain team , fearing the implications for their own futures as separate entities .
a source within the football association , english football 's governing body , said there would be a gb team at london 2012 even if it meant fielding 11 englishmen .
our supporters and the media wishes to see wales playing in the world cup and the european championship faw secretary david collins the boa said it would be " madness " if there was no gb team at the event .
" we 've had three meetings now on this issue and i 'm disappointed , obviously , that there has n't been any engagement at all -lsb- from the faw -rsb- , " said mr clegg in an interview with bbc wales ' dragon 's eye political programme .
" whether we like it or not , football is an integral part of the olympic games .
" and it would seem madness to me , incompatible for me , to host that event and actually not have representation in what is our national sport . "
but mr clegg said he had a " great deal of sympathy " with the faw 's position .
" i think we have to work with the ioc -lsb- international olympic committee -rsb- , fifa -lsb- world football 's governing body -rsb- to get the faw into a position where they are given the comfort they need so they are not depriving their athletes of participating in this event , " he said .
the faw said its views had always been made known , along with the governing bodies of football in scotland and northern ireland .
faw secretary david collins said : " our supporters and the media wishes to see wales playing in the world cup and the european championship .
your views why is football in the olympic games ?
i thought there was already an event for synchronised diving charles pooter , london " the european championship and the world cup are the major events and we are not willing to jeopardise our future in those competitions for one year in the olympics . "
wales under-21 boss and former wales player brian flynn said : " we 're welsh , welsh and more welsh .
" our association alongside scotland and -lsb- northern -rsb- ireland ... the party line is we want to keep our independence and that 's so important to us . "
plaid cymru mp adam price said it was not worth risking the future of the wales football team for a one-off event .
" it would be absolutely pig-headed if the boa was willing to risk our football heritage in wales for the sake of having a bit of pr and for them being able to say they have a great british football side , " he said .
labour am lesley griffiths has also expressed concern about plans for a gb football team at the london olympics .
" for the sake of a handful of matches over the course of a fortnight four years hence , i think it 's simply not worth it and therefore i could not support it , " she said .

in 2004 , a 100 jobs were lost with the closure of the hedstrom toy factory in holyhead .
prior to that , the great lakes bromine plant shut its operation at amlwch with the loss of another 100 posts .
in april this year , eastman chemicals said it was closing it peboc site at llangefni , ending 40 years association with the town , at the cost of 65 staff .
there is also an uncertain future for the islands two biggest employers - anglesey aluminium and wylfa nuclear power station .
the power station is set to halt generation in 2010 , when decommissioning of the ageing reactor begins .
it also supplies the bulk of the electricity needed to run the power-hungry operations at the aluminium site .
between them , the two operations employ around 1,500 people .
' major blow ' dewi lloyd , the manager of holyhead regeneration , said eaton 's announcement would be challenging for both the town and the island .
" it 's going to be a major blow , " he said .
" a lot of the people working there live near the factory - they are going to find it very difficult .
" it 's definitely true that we 've seen a decline in particularly manufacturing on the island over the years , while we have seen gains in the service and retail sector .
" however , many of those retail jobs are part-time - not the full-time skilled manufacturing posts we have at somewhere like eaton . "
mr lloyd also pointed to positive developments on the island , including the imminent opening of a morrisons supermarket , bringing 350 jobs .
raf valley is expanding its role as the uk 's fast jet training centre and mr lloyd said he hoped work could be found in civilian developments there for some of the eaton workforce .
however , recent economic figures for anglesey show it faces an uphill battle on the jobs front .
in august , the number of people claiming job seeker 's allowance on the island stood at nearly 1,200 , which at 3 % of the working age population remains higher than averages for wales or england .

francis wu , electrical engineer , shanghai , china in order to overcome the awful situation , i have to squeeze my daily life expenses .
i do n't do a lot of shopping and i have n't been out at a restaurant for a long time .
i have a car .
i try not to use it too often because petrol prices are quite high compared to my salary .
so instead , i get around by riding my bicycle .
i enjoy having a glass of wine and beer , but i have cut down on alcohol too .
i have invested in the chinese stock market for a long time but the returns have been reduced .
this year i have lost all the gains before i got any .
lex barker , retired banker , perth , australia many australians thought they were immune from the financial crisis .
but in the last few days anxiety has increased because of what is happening elsewhere .
a real problem over here is that many people have over extended themselves .
they are asking if they are able to repay their credit cards and mortgage debt . "
people who have been comfortably well off are now getting concerned " lex barker , australia there has been a great price increase in my weekly shopping .
when i retired in 2001 , it cost 100 australian dollars .
now , the price has jumped to $ 178 .
people who have been comfortably well off are now getting concerned .
i 've found that i have lost a third of my savings , and the stock exchange has plunged .
australia exports hugely on mineral commodities such as coal , iron ore , and aluminium to places like japan and the us .
but because markets there have been volatile , we have found the export sector is slowing .
gustavo caracante , restaurateur , sao paulo , brazil i was looking for a new car but because the interest rates are high , i have changed my mind .
brazil has one of the highest interest rates in the world .
we have to pay five months worth of our annual salary towards tax , so things are difficult naturally .
i try not to go out so much .
i have n't got any savings but the money i do have goes into my business .
i own an arabic restaurant .
i do n't know if it is a coincidence but i have noticed that since the crisis began , the restaurant has n't been busy as it has been before .
pinakin patel , computer sales and services , surat , india here in india people are not even visiting my shop to see the new products .
the inflation rate is very high compared with last year , so most people are saving and not spending daily .
the middle class and small business owners have been badly affected by the crisis , as most of them invested in the stock market and are now in a very difficult position .
so , my usual clients have no money to buy computers and it is also very difficult to get credit to buy computers .
martin smith , project manager , julich , germany have your say map : are you concerned about the global crisis ?
i do n't think many germans are particularly worried .
but if people stop buying german goods like washing machines or cars then it might be a different story .
i work in the industrial heartland where there is a lot of manufacturing .
there are plenty of jobs in engineering and in this part of the country , the unemployment rate is low .
i have accepted a job in the uk recently which will be a four year contract .
in germany , if i become unemployed , the benefits are much better than they are in the uk .
i would be worried that if i could n't get another job in the uk , how would i be able to survive on the low benefits ?
the lending principles are much tighter over here .
you ca n't get a mortgage unless you have a 10 or 15 % deposit .
james sweet , computer engineer , new york , usa i do n't think there is a single solution that will solve the financial crisis .
the rate cut and bailout will help but there needs to be a long period of adjustment .
recently i have seen lots of small businesses close .
a friend of mine works for a small it company .
because customers who owe money do n't have the cash to pay , the company is going bankrupt .
i have a fixed rate mortgage so i 'm ok for the time being , but i would like to re-finance .
our city has n't been hit too hard but i do worry .
if new york follows the national trend in the housing market , i may not be able to re-finance for home improvements that can boost the equity .
i think the main cause of the crisis was the wealth that was created during the dot.com boom in the mid-90s .
but i do n't think we will hit rock bottom as we did in 1929 .
tony patricolo , accountant , wales , uk the interest rate cut will marginally help with my monthly mortgage payments .
but i think the rate should 've been even lower in order for it to be greatly beneficial . "
i have noticed my shopping bills have gone up but my salary remains where it is " tony patricolo , wales i think the central banks should help those who face repossession and provide bigger tax credits .
a big problem is the over valuation of property .
also , too much credit has been given to people .
because of all of this , we have to pay for the credit crunch problem .
instead of lending customers three times their salary for a mortgage , banks seem to have no limit to how much they lend .
i have noticed my shopping bills have gone up but my salary remains where it is .
andrew graham , lecturer , johannesburg , south africa i have lived in south africa for ten years but my savings are in accounts in the uk so i am worried about what will happen to my money .
only this week has there been media coverage of the crisis .
many people here regard the financial crisis as a problem in america and europe and they feel they will not be affected .
the majority of the population has little anyway and many do n't have bank accounts .
the main concerns here are about the anc , zimbabwe , rugby and cricket .
i talked to my students about the financial crisis but they are unaware of what has been happening .
sultan mahmood , transport company worker , uae i moved to the uae eleven years ago from pakistan .
i 'm 38 and am married with 4 young children .
three months ago i bought 100 thousand dirhams worth of shares in local companies .
at the time , the prices were good and i thought it was a sensible investment .
i thought i could make a profit to provide extra money for my family .
with the recent crisis i am facing a big loss and i am watching the value of my shares decrease .
imagine how it feels to watch your savings disappear .
i can not sell the shares .
i wonder what will happen and how this problem is going to be resolved .
all i can do is hope that things will get better so i can get my savings back .
all my savings from the last ten years are at stake .
meanwhile the cost of all life 's necessities are going up day by day and we can not manage .
we have to cut down on extra expenditure and are being careful with our money .

francis wu , electrical engineer , shanghai , china in order to overcome the awful situation , i have to squeeze my daily life expenses .
i do n't do a lot of shopping and i have n't been out at a restaurant for a long time .
i have a car .
i try not to use it too often because petrol prices are quite high compared to my salary .
so instead , i get around by riding my bicycle .
i enjoy having a glass of wine and beer , but i have cut down on alcohol too .
i have invested in the chinese stock market for a long time but the returns have been reduced .
this year i have lost all the gains before i got any .
lex barker , retired banker , perth , australia many australians thought they were immune from the financial crisis .
but in the last few days anxiety has increased because of what is happening elsewhere .
a real problem over here is that many people have over extended themselves .
they are asking if they are able to repay their credit cards and mortgage debt .
people who have been comfortably well off are now getting concerned lex barker , australia there has been a great price increase in my weekly shopping .
when i retired in 2001 , it cost 100 australian dollars .
now , the price has jumped to $ 178 .
people who have been comfortably well off are now getting concerned .
i 've found that i have lost a third of my savings , and the stock exchange has plunged .
australia exports hugely on mineral commodities such as coal , iron ore , and aluminium to places like japan and the us .
but because markets there have been volatile , we have found the export sector is slowing .
gustavo caracante , restaurateur , sao paulo , brazil i was looking for a new car but because the interest rates are high , i have changed my mind .
brazil has one of the highest interest rates in the world .
we have to pay five months worth of our annual salary towards tax , so things are difficult naturally .
i try not to go out so much .
i have n't got any savings but the money i do have goes into my business .
i own an arabic restaurant .
i do n't know if it is a coincidence but i have noticed that since the crisis began , the restaurant has n't been busy as it has been before .
pinakin patel , computer sales and services , surat , india here in india people are not even visiting my shop to see the new products .
the inflation rate is very high compared with last year , so most people are saving and not spending daily .
the middle class and small business owners have been badly affected by the crisis , as most of them invested in the stock market and are now in a very difficult position .
so , my usual clients have no money to buy computers and it is also very difficult to get credit to buy computers .
martin smith , project manager , julich , germany have your say map : are you concerned about the global crisis ?
i do n't think many germans are particularly worried .
but if people stop buying german goods like washing machines or cars then it might be a different story .
i work in the industrial heartland where there is a lot of manufacturing .
there are plenty of jobs in engineering and in this part of the country , the unemployment rate is low .
i have accepted a job in the uk recently which will be a four year contract .
in germany , if i become unemployed , the benefits are much better than they are in the uk .
i would be worried that if i could n't get another job in the uk , how would i be able to survive on the low benefits ?
the lending principles are much tighter over here .
you ca n't get a mortgage unless you have a 10 or 15 % deposit .
james sweet , computer engineer , new york , usa i do n't think there is a single solution that will solve the financial crisis .
the rate cut and bailout will help but there needs to be a long period of adjustment .
recently i have seen lots of small businesses close .
a friend of mine works for a small it company .
because customers who owe money do n't have the cash to pay , the company is going bankrupt .
i have a fixed rate mortgage so i 'm ok for the time being , but i would like to re-finance .
our city has n't been hit too hard but i do worry .
if new york follows the national trend in the housing market , i may not be able to re-finance for home improvements that can boost the equity .
i think the main cause of the crisis was the wealth that was created during the dot.com boom in the mid-90s .
but i do n't think we will hit rock bottom as we did in 1929 .
tony patricolo , accountant , wales , uk the interest rate cut will marginally help with my monthly mortgage payments .
but i think the rate should 've been even lower in order for it to be greatly beneficial .
i have noticed my shopping bills have gone up but my salary remains where it is tony patricolo , wales i think the central banks should help those who face repossession and provide bigger tax credits .
a big problem is the over valuation of property .
also , too much credit has been given to people .
because of all of this , we have to pay for the credit crunch problem .
instead of lending customers three times their salary for a mortgage , banks seem to have no limit to how much they lend .
i have noticed my shopping bills have gone up but my salary remains where it is .
andrew graham , lecturer , johannesburg , south africa i have lived in south africa for ten years but my savings are in accounts in the uk so i am worried about what will happen to my money .
only this week has there been media coverage of the crisis .
many people here regard the financial crisis as a problem in america and europe and they feel they will not be affected .
the majority of the population has little anyway and many do n't have bank accounts .
the main concerns here are about the anc , zimbabwe , rugby and cricket .
i talked to my students about the financial crisis but they are unaware of what has been happening .
sultan mahmood , transport company worker , uae i moved to the uae eleven years ago from pakistan .
i 'm 38 and am married with 4 young children .
three months ago i bought 100 thousand dirhams worth of shares in local companies .
at the time , the prices were good and i thought it was a sensible investment .
i thought i could make a profit to provide extra money for my family .
with the recent crisis i am facing a big loss and i am watching the value of my shares decrease .
imagine how it feels to watch your savings disappear .
i can not sell the shares .
i wonder what will happen and how this problem is going to be resolved .
all i can do is hope that things will get better so i can get my savings back .
all my savings from the last ten years are at stake .
meanwhile the cost of all life 's necessities are going up day by day and we can not manage .
we have to cut down on extra expenditure and are being careful with our money .

brazil has one of the highest interest rates in the world .
we have to pay five months worth of our annual salary towards tax , so things are difficult naturally .
i try not to go out so much .
i have n't got any savings but the money i do have goes into my business .
i own an arabic restaurant .
i do n't know if it is a coincidence but i have noticed that since the crisis began , the restaurant has n't been busy as it has been before .
pinakin patel , computer sales and services , surat , india here in india people are not even visiting my shop to see the new products .
the inflation rate is very high compared with last year , so most people are saving and not spending daily .
the middle class and small business owners have been badly affected by the crisis , as most of them invested in the stock market and are now in a very difficult position .
so , my usual clients have no money to buy computers and it is also very difficult to get credit to buy computers .
martin smith , project manager , julich , germany have your say map : are you concerned about the global crisis ?
i do n't think many germans are particularly worried .
but if people stop buying german goods like washing machines or cars then it might be a different story .
i work in the industrial heartland where there is a lot of manufacturing .
there are plenty of jobs in engineering and in this part of the country , the unemployment rate is low .
i have accepted a job in the uk recently which will be a four year contract .
in germany , if i become unemployed , the benefits are much better than they are in the uk .
i would be worried that if i could n't get another job in the uk , how would i be able to survive on the low benefits ?
the lending principles are much tighter over here .
you ca n't get a mortgage unless you have a 10 or 15 % deposit .
james sweet , computer engineer , new york , usa i do n't think there is a single solution that will solve the financial crisis .
the rate cut and bailout will help but there needs to be a long period of adjustment .
recently i have seen lots of small businesses close .
a friend of mine works for a small it company .
because customers who owe money do n't have the cash to pay , the company is going bankrupt .
i have a fixed rate mortgage so i 'm ok for the time being , but i would like to re-finance .
our city has n't been hit too hard but i do worry .
if new york follows the national trend in the housing market , i may not be able to re-finance for home improvements that can boost the equity .
i think the main cause of the crisis was the wealth that was created during the dot.com boom in the mid-90s .
but i do n't think we will hit rock bottom as we did in 1929 .
tony patricolo , accountant , wales , uk the interest rate cut will marginally help with my monthly mortgage payments .
but i think the rate should 've been even lower in order for it to be greatly beneficial .
i have noticed my shopping bills have gone up but my salary remains where it is tony patricolo , wales i think the central banks should help those who face repossession and provide bigger tax credits .
a big problem is the over valuation of property .
also , too much credit has been given to people .
because of all of this , we have to pay for the credit crunch problem .
instead of lending customers three times their salary for a mortgage , banks seem to have no limit to how much they lend .
i have noticed my shopping bills have gone up but my salary remains where it is .
andrew graham , lecturer , johannesburg , south africa i have lived in south africa for ten years but my savings are in accounts in the uk so i am worried about what will happen to my money .
only this week has there been media coverage of the crisis .
many people here regard the financial crisis as a problem in america and europe and they feel they will not be affected .
the majority of the population has little anyway and many do n't have bank accounts .
the main concerns here are about the anc , zimbabwe , rugby and cricket .
i talked to my students about the financial crisis but they are unaware of what has been happening .
sultan mahmood , transport company worker , uae i moved to the uae eleven years ago from pakistan .
i 'm 38 and am married with 4 young children .
three months ago i bought 100 thousand dirhams worth of shares in local companies .
at the time , the prices were good and i thought it was a sensible investment .
i thought i could make a profit to provide extra money for my family .
with the recent crisis i am facing a big loss and i am watching the value of my shares decrease .
imagine how it feels to watch your savings disappear .
i can not sell the shares .
i wonder what will happen and how this problem is going to be resolved .
all i can do is hope that things will get better so i can get my savings back .
all my savings from the last ten years are at stake .
meanwhile the cost of all life 's necessities are going up day by day and we can not manage .
we have to cut down on extra expenditure and are being careful with our money .

francis wu , electrical engineer , shanghai , china in order to overcome the awful situation , i have to squeeze my daily life expenses .
i do n't do a lot of shopping and i have n't been out at a restaurant for a long time .
i have a car .
i try not to use it too often because petrol prices are quite high compared to my salary .
so instead , i get around by riding my bicycle .
i enjoy having a glass of wine and beer , but i have cut down on alcohol too .
i have invested in the chinese stock market for a long time but the returns have been reduced .
this year i have lost all the gains before i got any .
lex barker , retired banker , perth , australia many australians thought they were immune from the financial crisis .
but in the last few days anxiety has increased because of what is happening elsewhere .
a real problem over here is that many people have over extended themselves .
they are asking if they are able to repay their credit cards and mortgage debt .
people who have been comfortably well off are now getting concerned lex barker , australia there has been a great price increase in my weekly shopping .
when i retired in 2001 , it cost 100 australian dollars .
now , the price has jumped to $ 178 .
people who have been comfortably well off are now getting concerned .
i 've found that i have lost a third of my savings , and the stock exchange has plunged .
australia exports hugely on mineral commodities such as coal , iron ore , and aluminium to places like japan and the us .
but because markets there have been volatile , we have found the export sector is slowing .
gustavo caracante , restaurateur , sao paulo , brazil i was looking for a new car but because the interest rates are high , i have changed my mind .
brazil has one of the highest interest rates in the world .
we have to pay five months worth of our annual salary towards tax , so things are difficult naturally .
i try not to go out so much .
i have n't got any savings but the money i do have goes into my business .
i own an arabic restaurant .
i do n't know if it is a coincidence but i have noticed that since the crisis began , the restaurant has n't been busy as it has been before .
pinakin patel , computer sales and services , surat , india here in india people are not even visiting my shop to see the new products .
the inflation rate is very high compared with last year , so most people are saving and not spending daily .
the middle class and small business owners have been badly affected by the crisis , as most of them invested in the stock market and are now in a very difficult position .
so , my usual clients have no money to buy computers and it is also very difficult to get credit to buy computers .
martin smith , project manager , julich , germany have your say map : are you concerned about the global crisis ?
i do n't think many germans are particularly worried .
but if people stop buying german goods like washing machines or cars then it might be a different story .
i work in the industrial heartland where there is a lot of manufacturing .
there are plenty of jobs in engineering and in this part of the country , the unemployment rate is low .
i have accepted a job in the uk recently which will be a four year contract .
in germany , if i become unemployed , the benefits are much better than they are in the uk .
i would be worried that if i could n't get another job in the uk , how would i be able to survive on the low benefits ?
the lending principles are much tighter over here .
you ca n't get a mortgage unless you have a 10 or 15 % deposit .
james sweet , computer engineer , new york , usa i do n't think there is a single solution that will solve the financial crisis .
the rate cut and bailout will help but there needs to be a long period of adjustment .
recently i have seen lots of small businesses close .
a friend of mine works for a small it company .
because customers who owe money do n't have the cash to pay , the company is going bankrupt .
i have a fixed rate mortgage so i 'm ok for the time being , but i would like to re-finance .
our city has n't been hit too hard but i do worry .
if new york follows the national trend in the housing market , i may not be able to re-finance for home improvements that can boost the equity .
i think the main cause of the crisis was the wealth that was created during the dot.com boom in the mid-90s .

the singer has been given a new look for his full-scale launch the set is adorned with stunningly attractive extras and a band which plays live with every painstaking take - but they are not the centre of attention .
star of the show is x factor winner leon jackson , who is returning almost a year after his unexpected triumph to launch a new single and debut album .
the mild-mannered 19-year-old singer says - in the middle of his own video set - he is just an ordinary guy .
" i just went for lunch and someone was holding an umbrella for me , and i said ' do n't be daft , i 'll hold it myself .
it 's weird people doing stuff for you . "
while jackson secured last year 's christmas number one after winning the x factor , he had to share the video shoot with three other finalists and admits to nerves at being the focus of attention .
' stigma ' after the frenzy of the x factor died down , the scot dipped out of sight to make the new album and be matured for stardom .
jackson , serious and resolute beyond his years , insists that he has had a leading role in deciding his musical future .

" my ultimate dream is to be a really credible , respected musician - a songwriter as well as a singer and performer , " adds jackson , from whitburn , west lothian .
some of the teenager 's predecessors in the x factor winners ' hall of fame withered on the vine after albums of questionable quality were rushed out .
but last year 's victor , leona lewis , was also given a period out of the limelight while her success was plotted .
" she has shifted that whole stigma of winning the x factor a wee bit , " explains jackson .
" only a couple of winners like leona and shayne ward have broken through , so hopefully i can take the same route . "

he returns to the stage of his triumph at the weekend , with an appearance on the new series of the programme .
making the most of jackson 's inexorable x factor link , his new song , do n't call this love , will be released digitally at midnight after saturday 's show .
my ultimate dream is to be a really credible , respected musician leon jackson the young singer , meanwhile , is concerned about his chance to advise a new crop of hopefuls .
" i 'll tell them not to be afraid to show their emotions and wear your heart on your sleeve .
enjoy it and smile . "
he brought judge and mentor dannii minogue success in her first season on the show , and there is still a bond between them .
" i speak to and text her regularly .
she 's very proud and said that it 's the first time that she 's ever felt maternal , " he says .
" i 'll always be eternally grateful to her .
she gave me my break . "
jackson just has time to declare that the x factor is the " best thing on the box " and has " years ahead of it " , before returning to his video .
back on the set of the hazy bar , jackson works hard , but still has time to relax and chat with the extras between takes .
for a singer who is only just embarking on his quest for lasting stardom , he looks very comfortable at the centre of things .
do n't call this love by leon jackson is released on 13 october .
his debut album , right now , follows a week later .

she recently won three mtv awards after a period which saw her lose custody of her sons and be admitted to hospital .
' you just cope ' in a taster for the documentary , spears reflects on erratic behaviour which characterised her troubled period .

her sixth studio album , circus , is due to be released on 2 december , which is her 27th birthday .
spears is also due to visit the uk to appear on the x factor , expected to coincide with the release of her new record .

the line is in the indian-administered part of kashmir and could have a dramatic impact on people 's lives .
the bbc 's geeta pandey has been to see the work in progress .
finishing touches are being given at this spanking new railway station in ompura town in indian-administered kashmir .
the granite on the walls is being brightened and the floor is being polished .
as you enter the station , you see the gleaming new platform and the railway tracks .
behind the station , parked in the shed , is the brand new train .
a dozen gun-toting personnel of the paramilitary railway protection force keep a watch .
ompura , in budgam district , is a station on the soon-to-be-opened railway line in indian-administered kashmir .
the rail link will connect baramullah town in the north with qazigund in the south - a distance of 73 miles -lrb- 117km -rrb- .
trial run railway officials say the line would be ready by the summer of 2009 , but a 44-mile -lrb- 72km -rrb- stretch from anantnag to rajwansher via srinagar is ready and the indian prime minister manmohan singh is due to inaugurate it on 11 october .
" a trial run with the speed of 110km -lrb- 68 miles -rrb- has been completed and we are ready to go , " said a senior official of the indian railways construction company -lrb- ircon -rrb- which is running the project .
the project was first announced in 2,000 and has been eight years in the making .
constructed at the cost of $ 466m -lrb- 20bn rupees -rrb- , it is the first railway project to join the dots between the various parts of kashmir valley .
ircon officials say the project " will transform the region " , bringing development to some of the remotest areas of indian-administered kashmir .
" at the moment , it takes three hours to travel by road from qazigund to srinagar .
the train will do the same distance in 45 minutes , " a senior official said .
" it will be useful for students who will be able to travel to srinagar easily .
it will also be a boon to those who need to get to the hospital in the capital city in a medical emergency , " he said .
residents of villages and towns along the track agree .
" once it becomes operational , the train will definitely help us a lot , " said mohammad yaseen who lives in baramullah .
most ambitious " it will hugely cut down on our travel time and the authorities have said the fares will be kept low , so it will be good for us , " he said .
the railway project is one of the most ambitious undertaken by indian railways .
more than 5,000 workers , headed by hundreds of civil engineers , toiled for years to lay the tracks , build 900 bridges - including 100 major ones - and construct dozens of platforms .
finishing touches are being given at the railway station in ompura but the biggest challenge , officials say , was building the network through some of the areas worst affected by the last two decades of insurgency by militants trying to end indian rule in kashmir .
tight security was provided at the work sites with the police and paramilitary troops deployed in large numbers , but the security cordon was still breached on more than one occasion .
" one of our engineers was kidnapped in 2005 along with his brother and they were killed , " a senior ircon official said .
" our workers were attacked many times by militants .
and every time the labourers were attacked , they would all run away , making it difficult for the work to go on . "
kashmir 's inhospitable terrain and harsh winters also posed problems for the project .
symbolic " kashmir 's winters are too harsh for the outdoor work , which meant in a year effectively the work could go on only for five months , " the official said .
however , some in kashmir say the railway link is more symbolic and will not have much impact on how people live and commute here .
the train has had a successful trial run " it is most probably a train for tourists .
the coaches have big glass windows from where tourists can have a good unrestricted view of kashmir 's beautiful landscape , " says mubeen shah , president of the kashmir chamber of commerce and industry .
says the state 's former deputy chief minister muzaffar hussain baig , " the train will provide a degree of comfort .
but it will not be as dramatic as a railway link with the rest of the country . "
that , say ircon officials , is part two of the project which will connect the track at qazigund with udhampur in the south .
and the rest of india .
but that stretch is many more years in the making .

" a trial run with the speed of 110km -lrb- 68 miles -rrb- has been completed and we are ready to go , " said a senior official of the indian railways construction company -lrb- ircon -rrb- which is running the project .
the project was first announced in 2,000 and has been eight years in the making .
constructed at the cost of $ 466m -lrb- 20bn rupees -rrb- , it is the first railway project to join the dots between the various parts of kashmir valley .
ircon officials say the project " will transform the region " , bringing development to some of the remotest areas of indian-administered kashmir .
" at the moment , it takes three hours to travel by road from qazigund to srinagar .
the train will do the same distance in 45 minutes , " a senior official said .
" it will be useful for students who will be able to travel to srinagar easily .
it will also be a boon to those who need to get to the hospital in the capital city in a medical emergency , " he said .
residents of villages and towns along the track agree .
" once it becomes operational , the train will definitely help us a lot , " said mohammad yaseen who lives in baramullah .
most ambitious " it will hugely cut down on our travel time and the authorities have said the fares will be kept low , so it will be good for us , " he said .
the railway project is one of the most ambitious undertaken by indian railways .
more than 5,000 workers , headed by hundreds of civil engineers , toiled for years to lay the tracks , build 900 bridges - including 100 major ones - and construct dozens of platforms .
finishing touches are being given at the railway station in ompura but the biggest challenge , officials say , was building the network through some of the areas worst affected by the last two decades of insurgency by militants trying to end indian rule in kashmir .
tight security was provided at the work sites with the police and paramilitary troops deployed in large numbers , but the security cordon was still breached on more than one occasion .
" one of our engineers was kidnapped in 2005 along with his brother and they were killed , " a senior ircon official said .
" our workers were attacked many times by militants .
and every time the labourers were attacked , they would all run away , making it difficult for the work to go on . "
kashmir 's inhospitable terrain and harsh winters also posed problems for the project .
symbolic " kashmir 's winters are too harsh for the outdoor work , which meant in a year effectively the work could go on only for five months , " the official said .
however , some in kashmir say the railway link is more symbolic and will not have much impact on how people live and commute here .
the train has had a successful trial run " it is most probably a train for tourists .
the coaches have big glass windows from where tourists can have a good unrestricted view of kashmir 's beautiful landscape , " says mubeen shah , president of the kashmir chamber of commerce and industry .
says the state 's former deputy chief minister muzaffar hussain baig , " the train will provide a degree of comfort .
but it will not be as dramatic as a railway link with the rest of the country . "
that , say ircon officials , is part two of the project which will connect the track at qazigund with udhampur in the south .
and the rest of india .
but that stretch is many more years in the making .

" a trial run with the speed of 110km -lrb- 68 miles -rrb- has been completed and we are ready to go , " said a senior official of the indian railways construction company -lrb- ircon -rrb- which is running the project .
the project was first announced in 2,000 and has been eight years in the making .
constructed at the cost of $ 466m -lrb- 20bn rupees -rrb- , it is the first railway project to join the dots between the various parts of kashmir valley .
ircon officials say the project " will transform the region " , bringing development to some of the remotest areas of indian-administered kashmir .
" at the moment , it takes three hours to travel by road from qazigund to srinagar .
the train will do the same distance in 45 minutes , " a senior official said .
" it will be useful for students who will be able to travel to srinagar easily .
it will also be a boon to those who need to get to the hospital in the capital city in a medical emergency , " he said .
residents of villages and towns along the track agree .
" once it becomes operational , the train will definitely help us a lot , " said mohammad yaseen who lives in baramullah .
most ambitious " it will hugely cut down on our travel time and the authorities have said the fares will be kept low , so it will be good for us , " he said .
the railway project is one of the most ambitious undertaken by indian railways .
more than 5,000 workers , headed by hundreds of civil engineers , toiled for years to lay the tracks , build 900 bridges - including 100 major ones - and construct dozens of platforms .
finishing touches are being given at the railway station in ompura but the biggest challenge , officials say , was building the network through some of the areas worst affected by the last two decades of insurgency by militants trying to end indian rule in kashmir .
tight security was provided at the work sites with the police and paramilitary troops deployed in large numbers , but the security cordon was still breached on more than one occasion .
" one of our engineers was kidnapped in 2005 along with his brother and they were killed , " a senior ircon official said .
" our workers were attacked many times by militants .
and every time the labourers were attacked , they would all run away , making it difficult for the work to go on . "
kashmir 's inhospitable terrain and harsh winters also posed problems for the project .
symbolic " kashmir 's winters are too harsh for the outdoor work , which meant in a year effectively the work could go on only for five months , " the official said .
however , some in kashmir say the railway link is more symbolic and will not have much impact on how people live and commute here .
the train has had a successful trial run " it is most probably a train for tourists .
the coaches have big glass windows from where tourists can have a good unrestricted view of kashmir 's beautiful landscape , " says mubeen shah , president of the kashmir chamber of commerce and industry .
says the state 's former deputy chief minister muzaffar hussain baig , " the train will provide a degree of comfort .
but it will not be as dramatic as a railway link with the rest of the country . "
that , say ircon officials , is part two of the project which will connect the track at qazigund with udhampur in the south .
and the rest of india .
but that stretch is many more years in the making .

the rail link will connect baramullah town in the north with qazigund in the south - a distance of 73 miles -lrb- 117km -rrb- .
trial run railway officials say the line would be ready by the summer of 2009 , but a 44-mile -lrb- 72km -rrb- stretch from anantnag to rajwansher via srinagar is ready and the indian prime minister manmohan singh is due to inaugurate it on 11 october .
" a trial run with the speed of 110km -lrb- 68 miles -rrb- has been completed and we are ready to go , " said a senior official of the indian railways construction company -lrb- ircon -rrb- which is running the project .
the project was first announced in 2,000 and has been eight years in the making .
constructed at the cost of $ 466m -lrb- 20bn rupees -rrb- , it is the first railway project to join the dots between the various parts of kashmir valley .
ircon officials say the project " will transform the region " , bringing development to some of the remotest areas of indian-administered kashmir .
" at the moment , it takes three hours to travel by road from qazigund to srinagar .
the train will do the same distance in 45 minutes , " a senior official said .
" it will be useful for students who will be able to travel to srinagar easily .
it will also be a boon to those who need to get to the hospital in the capital city in a medical emergency , " he said .
residents of villages and towns along the track agree .
" once it becomes operational , the train will definitely help us a lot , " said mohammad yaseen who lives in baramullah .
most ambitious " it will hugely cut down on our travel time and the authorities have said the fares will be kept low , so it will be good for us , " he said .
the railway project is one of the most ambitious undertaken by indian railways .
more than 5,000 workers , headed by hundreds of civil engineers , toiled for years to lay the tracks , build 900 bridges - including 100 major ones - and construct dozens of platforms .
finishing touches are being given at the railway station in ompura but the biggest challenge , officials say , was building the network through some of the areas worst affected by the last two decades of insurgency by militants trying to end indian rule in kashmir .
tight security was provided at the work sites with the police and paramilitary troops deployed in large numbers , but the security cordon was still breached on more than one occasion .
" one of our engineers was kidnapped in 2005 along with his brother and they were killed , " a senior ircon official said .
" our workers were attacked many times by militants .
and every time the labourers were attacked , they would all run away , making it difficult for the work to go on . "
kashmir 's inhospitable terrain and harsh winters also posed problems for the project .
symbolic " kashmir 's winters are too harsh for the outdoor work , which meant in a year effectively the work could go on only for five months , " the official said .
however , some in kashmir say the railway link is more symbolic and will not have much impact on how people live and commute here .
the train has had a successful trial run " it is most probably a train for tourists .
the coaches have big glass windows from where tourists can have a good unrestricted view of kashmir 's beautiful landscape , " says mubeen shah , president of the kashmir chamber of commerce and industry .
says the state 's former deputy chief minister muzaffar hussain baig , " the train will provide a degree of comfort .
but it will not be as dramatic as a railway link with the rest of the country . "
that , say ircon officials , is part two of the project which will connect the track at qazigund with udhampur in the south .
and the rest of india .
but that stretch is many more years in the making .

it looked at how ppi was sold alongside a loan and found that very few customers were told that the cost of the cover would be added to their loan and that they would have to pay interest on it .
only half of people sold ppi were told what the limitations and exclusions of the policy were , which allows the customer to decide if they would be eligible to claim .
many people were also not told about both the monthly and the total cost of the policy , with the worst performing firms offering adequate information on cost to very few customers .
the fsa is considering how best to tackle the problem .
possible sanctions include financial penalties , stopping certain firms selling ppi , and action against individuals .
the fsa says it has told companies what is expected of them and if firms are unable to meet the criteria , the regulator says they should stop selling ppi policies .

it found that it is highly profitable for distributors and there is little competition between providers .
its report also found that there is little scope for customers to search for alternatives and switch products .
separately , the financial services authority is taking action against unfair practices by ppi providers .
' overcharging ppi is typically sold alongside a loan and provides cover if the debt repayments can not be met .
in june this year , the competition commission concluded that banks and credit card companies were overcharging their ppi customers by a total of £ 1.4bn a year .
it blamed a lack of competition at the point of sale when people took out a loan , and suggested that selling ppi at the same time as approving a loan might be banned .

they said at any one time they can see hundreds of the mammals in the water off walney island and which regularly raid their nets .
seals have not been culled in the uk since the 1970s .
however , sea bass fisherman tony tyson said the seal population had increased dramatically in the last decade and needed to be tackled .
during a seal count this year , the cumbria wildlife trust counted 90 mammals in the area , down from 130 in 2007 .
but mr tyson said he often spotted hundreds in the water .
' free meal ' he said : " there used to be about a dozen seals in the bay but you can now regularly see between 200 and 300 .
" whenever you are out there , they make a beeline for the nets and if there are any fish in it they clean it out and all you are pulling in is the heads of sea bass , it 's a free meal for them .
" everyone has been absolutely pestered to death with seals this year , it has been a nightmare .
" i am an animal lover but it is very frustrating . "
mike douglas , of the cumbria wildlife trust , said he was sympathetic with the fishermen but ruled out culling .
he said : " it is often an easy way out to blame natural predators for dwindling catches , but what we need to do is prove there is substantial damage to fishing .
" the trust would not back a cull at all giving the small numbers of animals we have .
" we need to work around natural predators rather than against them . "

they said at any one time they can see hundreds of the mammals in the water off walney island and which regularly raid their nets .
seals have not been culled in the uk since the 1970s .
however , sea bass fisherman tony tyson said the seal population had increased dramatically in the last decade and needed to be tackled .
during a seal count this year , the cumbria wildlife trust counted 90 mammals in the area , down from 130 in 2007 .
but mr tyson said he often spotted hundreds in the water .
' free meal ' he said : " there used to be about a dozen seals in the bay but you can now regularly see between 200 and 300 .
" whenever you are out there , they make a beeline for the nets and if there are any fish in it they clean it out and all you are pulling in is the heads of sea bass , it 's a free meal for them .
" everyone has been absolutely pestered to death with seals this year , it has been a nightmare .
" i am an animal lover but it is very frustrating . "
mike douglas , of the cumbria wildlife trust , said he was sympathetic with the fishermen but ruled out culling .
he said : " it is often an easy way out to blame natural predators for dwindling catches , but what we need to do is prove there is substantial damage to fishing .
" the trust would not back a cull at all giving the small numbers of animals we have .
" we need to work around natural predators rather than against them . "

they said at any one time they can see hundreds of the mammals in the water off walney island and which regularly raid their nets .
seals have not been culled in the uk since the 1970s .
however , sea bass fisherman tony tyson said the seal population had increased dramatically in the last decade and needed to be tackled .
during a seal count this year , the cumbria wildlife trust counted 90 mammals in the area , down from 130 in 2007 .
but mr tyson said he often spotted hundreds in the water .
' free meal ' he said : " there used to be about a dozen seals in the bay but you can now regularly see between 200 and 300 .
" whenever you are out there , they make a beeline for the nets and if there are any fish in it they clean it out and all you are pulling in is the heads of sea bass , it 's a free meal for them .
" everyone has been absolutely pestered to death with seals this year , it has been a nightmare .
" i am an animal lover but it is very frustrating . "
mike douglas , of the cumbria wildlife trust , said he was sympathetic with the fishermen but ruled out culling .
he said : " it is often an easy way out to blame natural predators for dwindling catches , but what we need to do is prove there is substantial damage to fishing .
" the trust would not back a cull at all giving the small numbers of animals we have .
" we need to work around natural predators rather than against them . "

eaton electric , which makes miniature circuit breakers in holyhead , would close the plant in december 2009 .
the company said it reflected efforts to " increase efficiency and continue to optimize global competitiveness " .
it plans to move work to plants in europe where production costs are up to 35 % lower .
the deputy first minister said it was a " very grave blow " .
workers were told they could go home early on thursday after being told of the consultation over possible closure .
i want the workers at holyhead to know that the assembly government is ready to do everything within its powers to influence eaton corporation to maintain a presence on the holyhead site deputy first minister ieuan wyn jones the birmingham-based company said the first job losses , if they go ahead , will start next march .
a spokesman said in a statement : " we greatly respect the outstanding employees at this facility and appreciate their hard work and dedication in this highly competitive environment . "
the company said it would offer " extensive support " to workers in finding new jobs and would offer a severance package .
" eaton also appreciates the tremendous support and hospitality that has been provided to the company and its employees by the local community and regrets the impact this may have , " said the spokesman .
the changes follow the us-owned company buying the moeller electronics group and wanting to transfer production there .
the holyhead factory makes three million circuit breakers a year but moeller in europe makes 60m a year , giving it significant economies of scale .
the workers were allowed home on thursday you may as well close the town down holyhead councillor cliff everett deputy first minister ieuan wyn jones will meet the corporation 's operations director for europe on friday .
mr jones , who is also the local assembly member , said : " i know that the company has always been more than satisfied with the skills and commitment of its anglesey workforce and its relationship with the assembly government ..
" the threat to the future of the operation stems from eaton 's purchase of other electrical companies which make 20 times more circuit breakers a year than the holyhead plant .
the company wants to standardise on the continental product .
" however , i want the workers at holyhead to know that the assembly government is ready to do everything within its powers to influence eaton corporation to maintain a presence on the holyhead site where it has operated so successfully . "
black cloud holyhead councillor cliff everett said he knew a number of husband and wife teams at the factory .
" it 's not a question of losing one job in a family but losing two . "
he said the area was already under the " black cloud " of job losses at anglesey aluminium .
" you may as well close the town down .
if there 's no money being spent in the town , then the knock-on effect could affect hundreds of jobs . "
the holyhead plant closure would take place from march to december 2009 .
it opened as the midland electric manufacturing company in 1960 , and was taken over by eaton five years ago .
meanwhile , 54 people are losing their jobs at a company in newport , south wales manufacturing components for electrical equipment .
international rectifier limited said the jobs are being cut at its cardiff road plant to save costs .

eaton electric , which makes miniature circuit breakers in holyhead , would close the plant in december 2009 .
the company said it reflected efforts to " increase efficiency and continue to optimize global competitiveness " .
it plans to move work to plants in europe where production costs are up to 35 % lower .
the deputy first minister said it was a " very grave blow " .
workers were told they could go home early on thursday after being told of the consultation over possible closure .
i want the workers at holyhead to know that the assembly government is ready to do everything within its powers to influence eaton corporation to maintain a presence on the holyhead site deputy first minister ieuan wyn jones the birmingham-based company said the first job losses , if they go ahead , will start next march .
a spokesman said in a statement : " we greatly respect the outstanding employees at this facility and appreciate their hard work and dedication in this highly competitive environment . "
the company said it would offer " extensive support " to workers in finding new jobs and would offer a severance package .
" eaton also appreciates the tremendous support and hospitality that has been provided to the company and its employees by the local community and regrets the impact this may have , " said the spokesman .
the changes follow the us-owned company buying the moeller electronics group and wanting to transfer production there .
the holyhead factory makes three million circuit breakers a year but moeller in europe makes 60m a year , giving it significant economies of scale .
the workers were allowed home on thursday you may as well close the town down holyhead councillor cliff everett deputy first minister ieuan wyn jones will meet the corporation 's operations director for europe on friday .
mr jones , who is also the local assembly member , said : " i know that the company has always been more than satisfied with the skills and commitment of its anglesey workforce and its relationship with the assembly government ..
" the threat to the future of the operation stems from eaton 's purchase of other electrical companies which make 20 times more circuit breakers a year than the holyhead plant .
the company wants to standardise on the continental product .
" however , i want the workers at holyhead to know that the assembly government is ready to do everything within its powers to influence eaton corporation to maintain a presence on the holyhead site where it has operated so successfully . "
black cloud holyhead councillor cliff everett said he knew a number of husband and wife teams at the factory .
" it 's not a question of losing one job in a family but losing two . "
he said the area was already under the " black cloud " of job losses at anglesey aluminium .
" you may as well close the town down .
if there 's no money being spent in the town , then the knock-on effect could affect hundreds of jobs . "
the holyhead plant closure would take place from march to december 2009 .
it opened as the midland electric manufacturing company in 1960 , and was taken over by eaton five years ago .
meanwhile , 54 people are losing their jobs at a company in newport , south wales manufacturing components for electrical equipment .
international rectifier limited said the jobs are being cut at its cardiff road plant to save costs .
some workers have already left and the remainder will go by the new year .

the festival , which showcases new and original work , will put on wainwright 's prima donna during its 2009 event .
it follows the festival 's much-lauded premiere in 2007 of monkey : journey to the west , which saw another popular music act turn to opera - gorillaz .
with a paris setting prima donna will be about a fading opera star .
wainwright has said his inspirations included the 1981 movie diva and interviews recorded by maria callas in her unhappy retirement .
it was originally due to premiere at the new york metropolitan opera , but the production ran into trouble when wainwright refused to translate his french libretto into english .
explaining his decision to scrap the opera , met manager peter gelb told the new york times : " presenting a new opera that is not in english at the met when it could be in english is an immediate impediment to its potential success with audiences . "
' exceptional gift ' in manchester , prima donna will feature soprano janis kelly in the lead role madame , soprano rebecca bottone , tenor william joyner and baritone jonathan summers .
wainwright , who already has several albums of melodic pop songs under his belt , will not be performing .
" rufus wainwright has an exceptional gift for melody and clearly has a deep affinity with opera , " festival director alex poots said .
" we 're delighted to be working with him as he moves into this new form . "
prima donna is being produced in partnership with opera north whose orchestra will be performing .
five performances will be held at the manchester palace theatre from 10 july .
other festival commissions will include everybody loves a winner at manchester 's royal exchange .
the theatre will become a bingo hall , with added music , dancing - and possibly a chance to win some cash .
and zaha hadid architects will create a unique environment within manchester art gallery for bach 's solo works .
the manchester international festival 2009 will run from 2 to 19 july .

the environment agency revealed at a public meeting in louth it wants to create two storage reservoirs to stop a repeat of last summer 's flooding .
about 120 properties in the town were damaged last year after heavy rain led to the river lud bursting its banks .
but the agency warned the bid , along with a similar project in horncastle , faced competition for government cash .
in the wake of the floods , some residents said the environment agency should have done more to dredge the lud , allowing water to flow more freely .
safe capacity at thursday 's meeting , it said it had removed more than 2,000 tonnes of debris from the river and was monitoring its condition .
the agency also said studies had indicated the best protection for the town would come from tanks to store extra rainfall .
flood risk manager with the agency , ian russell , said : " the scheme would really make a major difference to louth .
" we are talking about a scheme which could save the town from the devastation that it suffered last summer .
" we know what the safe capacity of the river is and this scheme would make sure that safe amount is only what comes through the town . "
