parliament always has the final say in foreign troop deployments , the court said . the german government erred in getting involved in the lead-up to the iraq war without parliamentary approval , according to a wednesday , may 7 decision from germany 's highest court .
the german center-left government under then-chancellor gerhard schroeder should have gotten prior approval from the bundestag , germany 's lower house of parliament , before taking part in a surveillance mission to turkey in 2003 , the court ruled .
parliamentary disapproval bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the ruling strengthens parliamentary power germany 's parliament had refused to join in the us military invasion of iraq .
but schroeder 's government agreed to supply troops for the turkey flights .
this outraged members of germany 's free democratic party -lrb- fdp -rrb- , a free-market liberal party .
five years ago the fdp asked a court for an emergency injunction to stop the deployment .
the german constitution requires parliamentary approval for all foreign armed deployments , and turkey qualified , the fdp said .
germany had sent its airborne warning and control system -lrb- awacs -rrb- planes at the request of its nato ally , turkey .
germany provided crews to man nato planes that flew surveillance flights near turkey 's southern border which were meant to protect turkey against an iraqi attack during the us-led invasion .
schroeder 's government described the 2003 deployment as a " routine " nato operation .
a lower court agreed , lifting the fdp 's injunction .
flights were form of deployment bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : not a " routine " operation yet the constitutional court reversed that decision wednesday .
the court ruled that there was a real possibility german military personnel could have been drawn into a conflict .
the court equated the flights with " armed deployment " which needs parliamentary approval .
" it is important that the responsibility for the deployment of armed troops remains in the hands of the representative body of the people , " i.e. parliament , the judges said in the ruling .
fdp head guido westerwelle hailed the constitutional court ruling as " historic , " saying that it would keep the german army under parliamentary control and prevent it from being turned into a tool of the government .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : schroeder went ahead without parliamentary approval while the law suggests that the parliament has to approve all foreign armed deployments , previous rulings suggest that in cases of acute threat , the government may seek parliamentary approval after the fact .
the decision is unlikely to have any legal consequences for schroeder or other members of his government but will influence the military policy-making of future administrations .
the german military currently has parliamentary mandates for missions around the world including deployments in afghanistan , bosnia , kosovo and the horn of africa .

mistakes can be made .
but what happens when somebody ’ s name is wrongly added to such a list ? after the attacks on the united states on september 11 , 2001 , the fight against islamic terrorists started in earnest .
lists of suspects , like those championed by the us and the united nations , led the way in tracking down potential threats .
terror lists contain data on persons and organizations suspected of supporting , financing or even being terrorists .
but not all the information the lists contain can be trusted as accurate and sometimes the wrong information finds its way onto the list .
this is what happened to nabil sayadi .
sayadi lives in the quiet belgian town of putte , south of antwerp .
he describes the rural idyll with its apple blossoms and content chickens as his private island .
away from the pleasant surroundings of putte , sayadi faces the distrustful looks and probing questions of friends and colleagues .
this has been his life outside putte ever since the united nations put his and the name of his wife on its list of terrorist suspects .
for five years , the muslim couple have been suspected of being al qaeda sympathizers , helping to finance the organization 's jihad behind the facade of a charitable organization , secours mondial .
names remain on terror list despite court clearances for sayadi , the accusation is incredible .
his organization has been recognized as authentic after being probed by the belgian government before its charitable status was approved .
" we even had a certificate from the minister of finance and can show donation receipts , " sayadi said .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the belgian government allowed the un to take names despite all the controls which have been observed before and after the organization was set up , and despite its involvement at many levels of these processes , the belgian government allowed sayadi and his wife patricia vinck to be put on the un list .
to this day , they have yet to receive any explanation as to why .
nabil sayadi is still labeled a terrorist despite being proved innocent a number of times in separate court cases throughout the belgian legal system .
this is something georges-henri beauthier , the family 's belgian lawyer , can confirm .
" there was nothing one could accuse them of , " beauthier said .
" there was no proof . "
the lawyer also explained that one civil court even ruled that the names of sayadi and his wife should be removed from the list .
but this has still not happened which is why the family is now five years into a lawsuit against the belgian state .
family imprisoned in belgium by red tape it is not only the parents which suffer .
sayadi and his wife have four children .
all of them have had their rights curtailed as a result of the terror list with the family name on it .
they can not leave the country ; the police hold their passports and the bank accounts of the family have been closed .
nabil sayadi is a dental technician but he no longer goes to work .
his last employer fired him when the terrorist list became public knowledge .
now no-one will employ him .
today , the family survives on child benefit and the mother 's invalid pension .
in total , their budget per month is a mere 1500 euros -lsb- $ 2,338 -rsb- , almost half of which goes on rent .
" we pray that nothing happens to any of us which would costs a lot of money , " said patricia vinck .
" if there is an urgent doctor 's visit or a car accident or a school excursion which we must suddenly pay for , then we must run up debts . "
case to go to the european court of justice together with his lawyer , nabil sayadi is locked in a battle for the freedom of his family .
he has submitted a complaint to the united nations .
since the names of the belgians can only be wiped off the list with a unanimous decision from the security council , and united states has so far blocked this , sayadi hopes for the support of the european court of justice in luxembourg .
while any decision in favor of sayadi and his wife by the court would have no judicial effect over the united nations , it could have a symbolic effect .
at least this is what georges-henri beauthier hopes .
" the advocate general in luxembourg has already said that these lists infringe on human rights , " the lawyer said .
only when this assertion is confirmed by a judgment , can the terror lists be finally abolished .
until then , the sayadis must wait to see if something , finally , changes and that they can lead a normal life again . ruth reichstein -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

these account for approximately 65 percent of all cases of hiv in germany . germany 's hiv infection rate has increased steadily since 2001 , a phenomenon that could be partially attributed to early diagnosis and a larger number of people being tested for hiv . a simultaneous increase in syphilis cases joerg hacker , president of the robert koch institute , also offered another reason for the increase . " one of the little-known reasons for this increase is the high number of syphilis infections in germany , " hacker said .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de asia -pipe- 07.05.2008 despite disaster , a glimmer of hope for burma 's future großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : opening up to foreign aid could herald a change in burma as western groups urge burma 's military regime to remove red tape delaying a large international aid operation , dw-world.de spoke with an expert about whether the tragedy could result in positive change in burma . with large swathes of the irrawaddy delta under water , an estimated one million people are in dire need of shelter , water , medicine and food . international groups and governments around the world are pressuring burma 's military regime to allow unrestricted access to aid workers to get in emergency supplies .
dw-world.de spoke with marco bünte , an expert on burma at the global institute of global and area studies in hamburg . after the cylone that has killed more than 22,000 people and left hundreds of thousands homeless , burma 's military rulers have appealed to the west for help .
what do you make of this unusual move ?
it shows that the military regime does not have the means to offer help and aid swiftly and on such a huge scale .
the state and the authorities are too weak to deliver aid after this huge humanitarian catastrophe .
some 24 million people live in the irrawady region , which was hit by the cyclone .
large areas still remain inaccessible .
that explains why the regime is appealing to foreign countries for help .
usually the burmese state is very proud that it makes its own decisions and does n't have to rely on outside help .
that was the case during the tsunami in 2004 when they refused foreign aid . do you think the move to ask for foreign aid will open the door to more international contact ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : cyclone nargis ripped through burma 's main city , yangon that 's a possibility .
but it 's difficult to say right now because many aid organizations are complaining about a lack of cooperation with the authorities in burma .
questions also remain about whether these foreign aid groups will stay in the country in the long-term or whether they will only provide emergency aid for immediate needs such as food and drinking water .
we need to be critical about how the military regime deals with international aid groups .
after all , the regime is n't allowing immediate access to all affected areas , but rather it continues to impose restrictions on the organizations .
why is that ?
is the military regime worried about ceding some of its control ?
yes , of course .
it 's the result of politics that the burmese regime has pursued for many years - the leaders remain extremely mistrustful of any foreign agencies , in particular those from the west .
they 're afraid these foreign groups could become politically active or bring in ideas that could lead to changes or unrest .
their policy has always been to remain open to aid but only under very stringent and restrictive conditions .
that 's why it 's very significant if the regime does actually open the door a bit further to let in more international aid groups .
despite international criticism , burma 's military junta seems determined to go ahead with a controversial referendum on the new constitution which would further cement the military 's power .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : burma 's military generals have a firm grip on power the burmese military has already announced that with the exception of 47 of the worst affected regions where the vote will be postponed , the planned referendum will go ahead .
in the past weeks , the regime has made several efforts to ensure that the referendum results in a positive outcome .
they have unleashed a propaganda campaign to urge people to accept the constitution .
soldiers have been deployed in towns and villages to secure the vote .
the military regime is doing everything it can to ensure that it gets a vote in favor of the new constitution and is thus not prepared to postpone it .
there have been some reports of rising anger among the population towards the government for failing to warn people about the cyclone and a lack of help in the crisis .
is there potential for a protest movement ?
there 's definitely potential for protests in the face of the fragile social situation in many regions and the glaring failure of the military government to provide basic help .
but it 's difficult to say whether the resentment and dissatisfaction with the government is strong enough to actually lead to social unrest or protests .
sometimes you need just a single matchstick to light a fire of protest and sometimes it takes longer .
in the past months , food prices and the cost of basic amenities has shot up and led to strong disaffection among the people .
last autumn , anger against rising prices as well as violence against monks spilled over into street protests .
this time , the same has n't happened and at the moment it 's difficult to say because we do n't know exactly what the situation is like .
it 's also possible that in the end people in burma will end up increasingly focusing on securing their food supplies and repairing their homes and limit themselves to the absolute necessities rather than turning on the government .
at the same time , the military regime remains inscrutable - we do n't know for sure whether there are disgruntled members in the military who are also unhappy with the situation in the country .
however , the crushing of mass protests last autumn and the stability and unity of the military regime shows it still has an iron grip on the country .
at the moment there are no signs of dissent or divisions within the ranks .
the eu and the us have offered burma humanitarian relief and aid .
is there any way the tragedy could bring about positive change to burma ?
it would be nice but for that the military regime would have to give up its resistance and open the door to all western organizations .
that 's exactly what the us is demanding by linking its offer of help to access .
however , i doubt whether the military is willing to give that kind of access to aid groups because it fears it will then lose some of its control on a regional and local level .
i do n't think the crisis will lead to a real opening up of the country .
at the same time , there is a possibility that the tense relationship between burma and the international community will be eased somewhat and that cooperation might work better .
it 's also possible that letting in foreign aid will also help burma gradually let go of the fears it harbors towards western agencies and may result in more freedom to travel .
but these are all small changes .
they do not include any far-reaching political change .
what can the west do to further help the people of burma ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the cyclone has ravaged the lives of thousands of burmese i 've always believed that the west has to rethink its sanctions on burma .
that 's because the sanctions also block aid from the world bank and other international organizations .
all the sanctions allow are small projects within the framework of humanitarian relief .
what 's needed is help for myanmar on a much wider scale that is n't tied to political change and to finance the rebuilding of the country without any strings attached . interview : sonia phalnikar send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

mistakes can be made .
but what happens when somebody ’ s name is wrongly added to such a list ? after the attacks on the united states on september 11 , 2001 , the fight against islamic terrorists started in earnest .
lists of suspects , like those championed by the us and the united nations , led the way in tracking down potential threats .
terror lists contain data on persons and organizations suspected of supporting , financing or even being terrorists .
but not all the information the lists contain can be trusted as accurate and sometimes the wrong information finds its way onto the list .
this is what happened to nabil sayadi .
sayadi lives in the quiet belgian town of putte , south of antwerp .
he describes the rural idyll with its apple blossoms and content chickens as his private island .
away from the pleasant surroundings of putte , sayadi faces the distrustful looks and probing questions of friends and colleagues .
this has been his life outside putte ever since the united nations put his and the name of his wife on its list of terrorist suspects .
for five years , the muslim couple have been suspected of being al qaeda sympathizers , helping to finance the organization 's jihad behind the facade of a charitable organization , secours mondial .
names remain on terror list despite court clearances for sayadi , the accusation is incredible .
his organization has been recognized as authentic after being probed by the belgian government before its charitable status was approved .
" we even had a certificate from the minister of finance and can show donation receipts , " sayadi said .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the belgian government allowed the un to take names despite all the controls which have been observed before and after the organization was set up , and despite its involvement at many levels of these processes , the belgian government allowed sayadi and his wife patricia vinck to be put on the un list .
to this day , they have yet to receive any explanation as to why .
nabil sayadi is still labeled a terrorist despite being proved innocent a number of times in separate court cases throughout the belgian legal system .
this is something georges-henri beauthier , the family 's belgian lawyer , can confirm .
" there was nothing one could accuse them of , " beauthier said .
" there was no proof . "
the lawyer also explained that one civil court even ruled that the names of sayadi and his wife should be removed from the list .
but this has still not happened which is why the family is now five years into a lawsuit against the belgian state .
family imprisoned in belgium by red tape it is not only the parents which suffer .
sayadi and his wife have four children .
all of them have had their rights curtailed as a result of the terror list with the family name on it .
they can not leave the country ; the police hold their passports and the bank accounts of the family have been closed .
nabil sayadi is a dental technician but he no longer goes to work .
his last employer fired him when the terrorist list became public knowledge .
now no-one will employ him .
today , the family survives on child benefit and the mother 's invalid pension .
in total , their budget per month is a mere 1500 euros -lsb- $ 2,338 -rsb- , almost half of which goes on rent .
" we pray that nothing happens to any of us which would costs a lot of money , " said patricia vinck .
" if there is an urgent doctor 's visit or a car accident or a school excursion which we must suddenly pay for , then we must run up debts . "
case to go to the european court of justice together with his lawyer , nabil sayadi is locked in a battle for the freedom of his family .
he has submitted a complaint to the united nations .
since the names of the belgians can only be wiped off the list with a unanimous decision from the security council , and united states has so far blocked this , sayadi hopes for the support of the european court of justice in luxembourg .
while any decision in favor of sayadi and his wife by the court would have no judicial effect over the united nations , it could have a symbolic effect .
at least this is what georges-henri beauthier hopes .
" the advocate general in luxembourg has already said that these lists infringe on human rights , " the lawyer said .
only when this assertion is confirmed by a judgment , can the terror lists be finally abolished .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de terrorism -pipe- 07.05.2008 falsely accused couple fight to wipe names from un terror list großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the case of nabil sayadi and his wife is heading to the european court of justice the united nations ' terrorist lists and the way they are compiled are not infallible .
mistakes can be made .
but what happens when somebody ’ s name is wrongly added to such a list ? after the attacks on the united states on september 11 , 2001 , the fight against islamic terrorists started in earnest .
lists of suspects , like those championed by the us and the united nations , led the way in tracking down potential threats .
terror lists contain data on persons and organizations suspected of supporting , financing or even being terrorists .
but not all the information the lists contain can be trusted as accurate and sometimes the wrong information finds its way onto the list .
this is what happened to nabil sayadi .
sayadi lives in the quiet belgian town of putte , south of antwerp .
he describes the rural idyll with its apple blossoms and content chickens as his private island .
away from the pleasant surroundings of putte , sayadi faces the distrustful looks and probing questions of friends and colleagues .
this has been his life outside putte ever since the united nations put his and the name of his wife on its list of terrorist suspects .
for five years , the muslim couple have been suspected of being al qaeda sympathizers , helping to finance the organization 's jihad behind the facade of a charitable organization , secours mondial .
names remain on terror list despite court clearances for sayadi , the accusation is incredible .
his organization has been recognized as authentic after being probed by the belgian government before its charitable status was approved .
" we even had a certificate from the minister of finance and can show donation receipts , " sayadi said .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the belgian government allowed the un to take names despite all the controls which have been observed before and after the organization was set up , and despite its involvement at many levels of these processes , the belgian government allowed sayadi and his wife patricia vinck to be put on the un list .
to this day , they have yet to receive any explanation as to why .
nabil sayadi is still labeled a terrorist despite being proved innocent a number of times in separate court cases throughout the belgian legal system .
this is something georges-henri beauthier , the family 's belgian lawyer , can confirm .
" there was nothing one could accuse them of , " beauthier said .
" there was no proof . "
the lawyer also explained that one civil court even ruled that the names of sayadi and his wife should be removed from the list .
but this has still not happened which is why the family is now five years into a lawsuit against the belgian state .
family imprisoned in belgium by red tape it is not only the parents which suffer .
sayadi and his wife have four children .
all of them have had their rights curtailed as a result of the terror list with the family name on it .
they can not leave the country ; the police hold their passports and the bank accounts of the family have been closed .
nabil sayadi is a dental technician but he no longer goes to work .
his last employer fired him when the terrorist list became public knowledge .
now no-one will employ him .
today , the family survives on child benefit and the mother 's invalid pension .
in total , their budget per month is a mere 1500 euros -lsb- $ 2,338 -rsb- , almost half of which goes on rent .
" we pray that nothing happens to any of us which would costs a lot of money , " said patricia vinck .
" if there is an urgent doctor 's visit or a car accident or a school excursion which we must suddenly pay for , then we must run up debts . "
case to go to the european court of justice together with his lawyer , nabil sayadi is locked in a battle for the freedom of his family .
he has submitted a complaint to the united nations .
since the names of the belgians can only be wiped off the list with a unanimous decision from the security council , and united states has so far blocked this , sayadi hopes for the support of the european court of justice in luxembourg .
while any decision in favor of sayadi and his wife by the court would have no judicial effect over the united nations , it could have a symbolic effect .
at least this is what georges-henri beauthier hopes .
" the advocate general in luxembourg has already said that these lists infringe on human rights , " the lawyer said .
only when this assertion is confirmed by a judgment , can the terror lists be finally abolished .
until then , the sayadis must wait to see if something , finally , changes and that they can lead a normal life again . ruth reichstein -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

merkel calls on brazil to make biofuel production sustainable german minister calls for reversal of eu agricultural policy as biofuels fall from grace , a new generation grabs spotlight illegal logging gives eu massive eco-headache energy -pipe- 07.05.2008 germany defends biofuels , hedges bets on energy goals großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : fuel or food ?
the german government rejected claims tuesday that fuel crops were causing a worldwide spike in food prices .
berlin plans to announce a plan for easing the world food crisis by july , agriculture minister seehofer said . germany can not reach its climate change goals unless it dedicates land to growing biofuels , germany 's agriculture minister horst seehofer said after talks in berlin on tuesday , may 6 .
seehofer defended biofuels against growing criticism that they are responsible for food prices increasing globally , which has caused rioting and hunger in developing countries .
" there would also be hunger without biofuel , " seehofer said , who promised that the government would announce this summer what it will do to help ease the global food crisis .
in many countries , the hunger crisis is caused by population increases and the increasing demand for food in developing and emerging countries , said seehofer .
ethanol under scrutiny only 2 percent of cropland worldwide was being used to produce ethanol , a popular biofuel often made from corn , seehofer said .
ethanol has come under heavy criticism recently and which forms an important part of germany 's biofuel targets .
many farmers are switching from growing corn and wheat for food to instead focus on producing biofuel crops .
environment minister sigmar gabriel also promised tuesday that germany will stick to its biofuel strategy , which calls for increasing reliance on plant fuels by 2020 .
gabriel acknowledged that the government 's goal of having 17 percent of energy come from biofuel by 2020 might be overly optimistic and said the german parliament will decide in the near future whether to hold to a 2009 goal of having biofuel make up 6.25 percent of overall fuel consumption .
call for relaxed meat restrictions in a time of increasing prices for all types of food , seehofer said the german government will seek to increase meat production by pushing through rule changes to allow ground-up animal remains can be fed to pigs and poultry .
eight years ago the european union banned the use of ground-up animal carcasses as cheap feed after determining that cattle were catching bovine spongiform encephalopathy -lrb- bse -rrb- from eating brains of dead cows .

the german government rejected claims tuesday that fuel crops were causing a worldwide spike in food prices .
berlin plans to announce a plan for easing the world food crisis by july , agriculture minister seehofer said . germany can not reach its climate change goals unless it dedicates land to growing biofuels , germany 's agriculture minister horst seehofer said after talks in berlin on tuesday , may 6 .
seehofer defended biofuels against growing criticism that they are responsible for food prices increasing globally , which has caused rioting and hunger in developing countries .
" there would also be hunger without biofuel , " seehofer said , who promised that the government would announce this summer what it will do to help ease the global food crisis .
in many countries , the hunger crisis is caused by population increases and the increasing demand for food in developing and emerging countries , said seehofer .
ethanol under scrutiny only 2 percent of cropland worldwide was being used to produce ethanol , a popular biofuel often made from corn , seehofer said .
ethanol has come under heavy criticism recently and which forms an important part of germany 's biofuel targets .
many farmers are switching from growing corn and wheat for food to instead focus on producing biofuel crops .
environment minister sigmar gabriel also promised tuesday that germany will stick to its biofuel strategy , which calls for increasing reliance on plant fuels by 2020 .
gabriel acknowledged that the government 's goal of having 17 percent of energy come from biofuel by 2020 might be overly optimistic and said the german parliament will decide in the near future whether to hold to a 2009 goal of having biofuel make up 6.25 percent of overall fuel consumption .
call for relaxed meat restrictions in a time of increasing prices for all types of food , seehofer said the german government will seek to increase meat production by pushing through rule changes to allow ground-up animal remains can be fed to pigs and poultry .
eight years ago the european union banned the use of ground-up animal carcasses as cheap feed after determining that cattle were catching bovine spongiform encephalopathy -lrb- bse -rrb- from eating brains of dead cows .

" too many adults still fail to acquire even basic skills , with enormous effects on their individual lives and on their countries ' economic and social well-being , " unesco said . the statement came ahead of a unesco-organized conference this month in azerbaijan , which will focus on literacy in central , eastern and southeastern europe . dw staff -lrb- th -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

experts say the fallout from the affair may actually have led to a shift towards cleaner business practices . the ancient proverb that “ a fish always stinks from the head down ” can be easily applied to the latest scandals that have been sweeping big , blue chip german companies in the last few years , denting the reputation of munich-based siemens ag in particular . ever since the global slush fund scandal that involved payoffs for huge foreign contracts broke in 2006 , bribery revelations at europe ’ s largest industrial conglomerate have reached an estimated 1.3 billion euros -lrb- about $ 2 billion -rrb- . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : former ceo klaus kleinfeld was forced to resign last year the scandal , which is the biggest ever in germany ’ s corporate history , has not only brought shame to siemens , but within the past year , the entire top management team has been purged .
even though ex-ceo klaus kleinfeld had presided over a period of record profits and was never personally implicated in the scandal , he was forced to resign after losing the board ’ s vote of confidence last year and replaced by peter löscher , an outsider . former supervisory board chairman heinrich von pierer , who had also been kleinfeld ’ s predecessor , had been so highly regarded among germany ’ s business elite that chancellor angela merkel had even tapped him to become technology advisor , an offer that was recently withdrawn . since siemens is also listed on the new york stock exchange , the sec , the us watchdog agency , has also been on the company ’ s heels to comply with anti-corruption regulations .

the corporate culture against bribes is changing .

dw-world.de spoke with marco bünte , an expert on burma at the global institute of global and area studies in hamburg . after the cylone that has killed more than 22,000 people and left hundreds of thousands homeless , burma 's military rulers have appealed to the west for help .
what do you make of this unusual move ?
it shows that the military regime does not have the means to offer help and aid swiftly and on such a huge scale .
the state and the authorities are too weak to deliver aid after this huge humanitarian catastrophe .
some 24 million people live in the irrawady region , which was hit by the cyclone .
large areas still remain inaccessible .
that explains why the regime is appealing to foreign countries for help .
usually the burmese state is very proud that it makes its own decisions and does n't have to rely on outside help .
that was the case during the tsunami in 2004 when they refused foreign aid . do you think the move to ask for foreign aid will open the door to more international contact ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : cyclone nargis ripped through burma 's main city , yangon that 's a possibility .
but it 's difficult to say right now because many aid organizations are complaining about a lack of cooperation with the authorities in burma .
questions also remain about whether these foreign aid groups will stay in the country in the long-term or whether they will only provide emergency aid for immediate needs such as food and drinking water .
we need to be critical about how the military regime deals with international aid groups .
after all , the regime is n't allowing immediate access to all affected areas , but rather it continues to impose restrictions on the organizations .
why is that ?
is the military regime worried about ceding some of its control ?
yes , of course .
it 's the result of politics that the burmese regime has pursued for many years - the leaders remain extremely mistrustful of any foreign agencies , in particular those from the west .
they 're afraid these foreign groups could become politically active or bring in ideas that could lead to changes or unrest .
their policy has always been to remain open to aid but only under very stringent and restrictive conditions .
that 's why it 's very significant if the regime does actually open the door a bit further to let in more international aid groups .
despite international criticism , burma 's military junta seems determined to go ahead with a controversial referendum on the new constitution which would further cement the military 's power .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : burma 's military generals have a firm grip on power the burmese military has already announced that with the exception of 47 of the worst affected regions where the vote will be postponed , the planned referendum will go ahead .
in the past weeks , the regime has made several efforts to ensure that the referendum results in a positive outcome .
they have unleashed a propaganda campaign to urge people to accept the constitution .
soldiers have been deployed in towns and villages to secure the vote .
the military regime is doing everything it can to ensure that it gets a vote in favor of the new constitution and is thus not prepared to postpone it .
there have been some reports of rising anger among the population towards the government for failing to warn people about the cyclone and a lack of help in the crisis .
is there potential for a protest movement ?
there 's definitely potential for protests in the face of the fragile social situation in many regions and the glaring failure of the military government to provide basic help .
but it 's difficult to say whether the resentment and dissatisfaction with the government is strong enough to actually lead to social unrest or protests .
sometimes you need just a single matchstick to light a fire of protest and sometimes it takes longer .
in the past months , food prices and the cost of basic amenities has shot up and led to strong disaffection among the people .
last autumn , anger against rising prices as well as violence against monks spilled over into street protests .
this time , the same has n't happened and at the moment it 's difficult to say because we do n't know exactly what the situation is like .
it 's also possible that in the end people in burma will end up increasingly focusing on securing their food supplies and repairing their homes and limit themselves to the absolute necessities rather than turning on the government .
at the same time , the military regime remains inscrutable - we do n't know for sure whether there are disgruntled members in the military who are also unhappy with the situation in the country .
however , the crushing of mass protests last autumn and the stability and unity of the military regime shows it still has an iron grip on the country .
at the moment there are no signs of dissent or divisions within the ranks .
the eu and the us have offered burma humanitarian relief and aid .
is there any way the tragedy could bring about positive change to burma ?
it would be nice but for that the military regime would have to give up its resistance and open the door to all western organizations .
that 's exactly what the us is demanding by linking its offer of help to access .
however , i doubt whether the military is willing to give that kind of access to aid groups because it fears it will then lose some of its control on a regional and local level .
i do n't think the crisis will lead to a real opening up of the country .
at the same time , there is a possibility that the tense relationship between burma and the international community will be eased somewhat and that cooperation might work better .
it 's also possible that letting in foreign aid will also help burma gradually let go of the fears it harbors towards western agencies and may result in more freedom to travel .
but these are all small changes .
they do not include any far-reaching political change .
what can the west do to further help the people of burma ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the cyclone has ravaged the lives of thousands of burmese i 've always believed that the west has to rethink its sanctions on burma .
that 's because the sanctions also block aid from the world bank and other international organizations .
all the sanctions allow are small projects within the framework of humanitarian relief .
what 's needed is help for myanmar on a much wider scale that is n't tied to political change and to finance the rebuilding of the country without any strings attached . interview : sonia phalnikar send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de asia -pipe- 07.05.2008 despite disaster , a glimmer of hope for burma 's future großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : opening up to foreign aid could herald a change in burma as western groups urge burma 's military regime to remove red tape delaying a large international aid operation , dw-world.de spoke with an expert about whether the tragedy could result in positive change in burma . with large swathes of the irrawaddy delta under water , an estimated one million people are in dire need of shelter , water , medicine and food . international groups and governments around the world are pressuring burma 's military regime to allow unrestricted access to aid workers to get in emergency supplies .
dw-world.de spoke with marco bünte , an expert on burma at the global institute of global and area studies in hamburg . after the cylone that has killed more than 22,000 people and left hundreds of thousands homeless , burma 's military rulers have appealed to the west for help .
what do you make of this unusual move ?
it shows that the military regime does not have the means to offer help and aid swiftly and on such a huge scale .
the state and the authorities are too weak to deliver aid after this huge humanitarian catastrophe .
some 24 million people live in the irrawady region , which was hit by the cyclone .
large areas still remain inaccessible .
that explains why the regime is appealing to foreign countries for help .
usually the burmese state is very proud that it makes its own decisions and does n't have to rely on outside help .
that was the case during the tsunami in 2004 when they refused foreign aid . do you think the move to ask for foreign aid will open the door to more international contact ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : cyclone nargis ripped through burma 's main city , yangon that 's a possibility .
but it 's difficult to say right now because many aid organizations are complaining about a lack of cooperation with the authorities in burma .
questions also remain about whether these foreign aid groups will stay in the country in the long-term or whether they will only provide emergency aid for immediate needs such as food and drinking water .
we need to be critical about how the military regime deals with international aid groups .
after all , the regime is n't allowing immediate access to all affected areas , but rather it continues to impose restrictions on the organizations .
why is that ?
is the military regime worried about ceding some of its control ?
yes , of course .
it 's the result of politics that the burmese regime has pursued for many years - the leaders remain extremely mistrustful of any foreign agencies , in particular those from the west .
they 're afraid these foreign groups could become politically active or bring in ideas that could lead to changes or unrest .
their policy has always been to remain open to aid but only under very stringent and restrictive conditions .
that 's why it 's very significant if the regime does actually open the door a bit further to let in more international aid groups .
despite international criticism , burma 's military junta seems determined to go ahead with a controversial referendum on the new constitution which would further cement the military 's power .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : burma 's military generals have a firm grip on power the burmese military has already announced that with the exception of 47 of the worst affected regions where the vote will be postponed , the planned referendum will go ahead .
in the past weeks , the regime has made several efforts to ensure that the referendum results in a positive outcome .
they have unleashed a propaganda campaign to urge people to accept the constitution .
soldiers have been deployed in towns and villages to secure the vote .
the military regime is doing everything it can to ensure that it gets a vote in favor of the new constitution and is thus not prepared to postpone it .
there have been some reports of rising anger among the population towards the government for failing to warn people about the cyclone and a lack of help in the crisis .
is there potential for a protest movement ?
there 's definitely potential for protests in the face of the fragile social situation in many regions and the glaring failure of the military government to provide basic help .
but it 's difficult to say whether the resentment and dissatisfaction with the government is strong enough to actually lead to social unrest or protests .
sometimes you need just a single matchstick to light a fire of protest and sometimes it takes longer .
in the past months , food prices and the cost of basic amenities has shot up and led to strong disaffection among the people .
last autumn , anger against rising prices as well as violence against monks spilled over into street protests .
this time , the same has n't happened and at the moment it 's difficult to say because we do n't know exactly what the situation is like .
it 's also possible that in the end people in burma will end up increasingly focusing on securing their food supplies and repairing their homes and limit themselves to the absolute necessities rather than turning on the government .
at the same time , the military regime remains inscrutable - we do n't know for sure whether there are disgruntled members in the military who are also unhappy with the situation in the country .
however , the crushing of mass protests last autumn and the stability and unity of the military regime shows it still has an iron grip on the country .
at the moment there are no signs of dissent or divisions within the ranks .
the eu and the us have offered burma humanitarian relief and aid .
is there any way the tragedy could bring about positive change to burma ?
it would be nice but for that the military regime would have to give up its resistance and open the door to all western organizations .
that 's exactly what the us is demanding by linking its offer of help to access .
however , i doubt whether the military is willing to give that kind of access to aid groups because it fears it will then lose some of its control on a regional and local level .
i do n't think the crisis will lead to a real opening up of the country .
at the same time , there is a possibility that the tense relationship between burma and the international community will be eased somewhat and that cooperation might work better .
it 's also possible that letting in foreign aid will also help burma gradually let go of the fears it harbors towards western agencies and may result in more freedom to travel .
but these are all small changes .
they do not include any far-reaching political change .
what can the west do to further help the people of burma ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the cyclone has ravaged the lives of thousands of burmese i 've always believed that the west has to rethink its sanctions on burma .
that 's because the sanctions also block aid from the world bank and other international organizations .
all the sanctions allow are small projects within the framework of humanitarian relief .
what 's needed is help for myanmar on a much wider scale that is n't tied to political change and to finance the rebuilding of the country without any strings attached . interview : sonia phalnikar send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

questions also remain about whether these foreign aid groups will stay in the country in the long-term or whether they will only provide emergency aid for immediate needs such as food and drinking water .
we need to be critical about how the military regime deals with international aid groups .
after all , the regime is n't allowing immediate access to all affected areas , but rather it continues to impose restrictions on the organizations .
why is that ?
is the military regime worried about ceding some of its control ?
yes , of course .
it 's the result of politics that the burmese regime has pursued for many years - the leaders remain extremely mistrustful of any foreign agencies , in particular those from the west .
they 're afraid these foreign groups could become politically active or bring in ideas that could lead to changes or unrest .
their policy has always been to remain open to aid but only under very stringent and restrictive conditions .
that 's why it 's very significant if the regime does actually open the door a bit further to let in more international aid groups .
despite international criticism , burma 's military junta seems determined to go ahead with a controversial referendum on the new constitution which would further cement the military 's power .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : burma 's military generals have a firm grip on power the burmese military has already announced that with the exception of 47 of the worst affected regions where the vote will be postponed , the planned referendum will go ahead .
in the past weeks , the regime has made several efforts to ensure that the referendum results in a positive outcome .
they have unleashed a propaganda campaign to urge people to accept the constitution .
soldiers have been deployed in towns and villages to secure the vote .
the military regime is doing everything it can to ensure that it gets a vote in favor of the new constitution and is thus not prepared to postpone it .
there have been some reports of rising anger among the population towards the government for failing to warn people about the cyclone and a lack of help in the crisis .
is there potential for a protest movement ?
there 's definitely potential for protests in the face of the fragile social situation in many regions and the glaring failure of the military government to provide basic help .
but it 's difficult to say whether the resentment and dissatisfaction with the government is strong enough to actually lead to social unrest or protests .
sometimes you need just a single matchstick to light a fire of protest and sometimes it takes longer .
in the past months , food prices and the cost of basic amenities has shot up and led to strong disaffection among the people .
last autumn , anger against rising prices as well as violence against monks spilled over into street protests .
this time , the same has n't happened and at the moment it 's difficult to say because we do n't know exactly what the situation is like .
it 's also possible that in the end people in burma will end up increasingly focusing on securing their food supplies and repairing their homes and limit themselves to the absolute necessities rather than turning on the government .
at the same time , the military regime remains inscrutable - we do n't know for sure whether there are disgruntled members in the military who are also unhappy with the situation in the country .
however , the crushing of mass protests last autumn and the stability and unity of the military regime shows it still has an iron grip on the country .
at the moment there are no signs of dissent or divisions within the ranks .
the eu and the us have offered burma humanitarian relief and aid .
is there any way the tragedy could bring about positive change to burma ?
it would be nice but for that the military regime would have to give up its resistance and open the door to all western organizations .
that 's exactly what the us is demanding by linking its offer of help to access .
however , i doubt whether the military is willing to give that kind of access to aid groups because it fears it will then lose some of its control on a regional and local level .
i do n't think the crisis will lead to a real opening up of the country .
at the same time , there is a possibility that the tense relationship between burma and the international community will be eased somewhat and that cooperation might work better .
it 's also possible that letting in foreign aid will also help burma gradually let go of the fears it harbors towards western agencies and may result in more freedom to travel .
but these are all small changes .
they do not include any far-reaching political change .
what can the west do to further help the people of burma ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the cyclone has ravaged the lives of thousands of burmese i 've always believed that the west has to rethink its sanctions on burma .
that 's because the sanctions also block aid from the world bank and other international organizations .

dw-world.de spoke with marco bünte , an expert on burma at the global institute of global and area studies in hamburg . after the cylone that has killed more than 22,000 people and left hundreds of thousands homeless , burma 's military rulers have appealed to the west for help .
what do you make of this unusual move ?
it shows that the military regime does not have the means to offer help and aid swiftly and on such a huge scale .
the state and the authorities are too weak to deliver aid after this huge humanitarian catastrophe .
some 24 million people live in the irrawady region , which was hit by the cyclone .
large areas still remain inaccessible .
that explains why the regime is appealing to foreign countries for help .
usually the burmese state is very proud that it makes its own decisions and does n't have to rely on outside help .
that was the case during the tsunami in 2004 when they refused foreign aid . do you think the move to ask for foreign aid will open the door to more international contact ?

1 , 2009 . in statements issued in brussels and frankfurt , the two european bodies said slovakia had met all of the necessary economic criteria that were required of it . " slovakia has achieved a high degree of sustainable economic convergence and is ready to adopt the euro on 1 january 2009 , " said eu commissioner for economic and monetary affairs joaquin almunia . at the same time , almunia urged slovakia to " pursue its efforts to maintain a low-inflation environment , be more ambitious with regard to budgetary consolidation and strengthen its competitiveness position .
" it must also now speed up its practical preparations to ensure that the changeover takes place smoothly , as it did in cyprus and malta in january 2008 , " the commissioner added . in its report , the ecb said slovakia had met the tough fiscal targets for adopting the euro , but also warned bratislava that it still faced " upside risks to inflation . "
the ecb said this was the result of surging energy prices and of its tight labor market . at 2.2 percent of gross domestic product , slovakia 's budget deficit is comfortably within the strict 3-percent rule for euro member states .
likewise , the country 's public debt is about half the 60 per cent of gdp that is required under the maastricht treaty for joining the euro .
slovakia 's 2.2-percent inflation rate is also well below the 3.2-percent reference rate for euro candidate states .
bratislava must ensure sustainability but in its report , the ecb also went on to call on slovakia to take steps to ensure the sustainability of its key fiscal parameters , especially inflation . " achieving an environment conducive to sustainable convergence in slovakia requires , inter alia , the implementation of a sustainable and credible fiscal consolidation path , " wrote the ecb . this included measures to address high structural unemployment , to ensure wage increases are linked to labor productivity as well as pressing on with the liberalization of its economy . the news was welcomed in bratislava . " we are satisfied with the result .
this is a very important decision on slovakia 's way to the euro , " the country 's central banker , ivan sramko , told news agency dpa . addressing the issues raised by the ecb report , sramko said the country would be taking its recommendations " very seriously . " once the decision is ratified by the european parliament and eu governments , slovakia will become europe 's second former communist nation to join the euro , after slovenia .
others have more to do in its report wednesday , the european commission said none of the other nine eu countries planning to join the euro had met " all of the convergence criteria . " the nine countries are : bulgaria , the czech republic , estonia , latvia , lithuania , hungary , poland , romania and sweden . in another widely-expected move , the eu executive also proposed closing the excessive deficit procedures that it had brought against italy , poland , portugal and slovakia . dw staff / dpa -lrb- ncy -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

parliament always has the final say in foreign troop deployments , the court said . the german government erred in getting involved in the lead-up to the iraq war without parliamentary approval , according to a wednesday , may 7 decision from germany 's highest court .
the german center-left government under then-chancellor gerhard schroeder should have gotten prior approval from the bundestag , germany 's lower house of parliament , before taking part in a surveillance mission to turkey in 2003 , the court ruled .
parliamentary disapproval bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the ruling strengthens parliamentary power germany 's parliament had refused to join in the us military invasion of iraq .
but schroeder 's government agreed to supply troops for the turkey flights .
this outraged members of germany 's free democratic party -lrb- fdp -rrb- , a free-market liberal party .
five years ago the fdp asked a court for an emergency injunction to stop the deployment .
the german constitution requires parliamentary approval for all foreign armed deployments , and turkey qualified , the fdp said .
germany had sent its airborne warning and control system -lrb- awacs -rrb- planes at the request of its nato ally , turkey .
germany provided crews to man nato planes that flew surveillance flights near turkey 's southern border which were meant to protect turkey against an iraqi attack during the us-led invasion .
schroeder 's government described the 2003 deployment as a " routine " nato operation .
a lower court agreed , lifting the fdp 's injunction .
flights were form of deployment bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : not a " routine " operation yet the constitutional court reversed that decision wednesday .
the court ruled that there was a real possibility german military personnel could have been drawn into a conflict .
the court equated the flights with " armed deployment " which needs parliamentary approval .
" it is important that the responsibility for the deployment of armed troops remains in the hands of the representative body of the people , " i.e. parliament , the judges said in the ruling .
fdp head guido westerwelle hailed the constitutional court ruling as " historic , " saying that it would keep the german army under parliamentary control and prevent it from being turned into a tool of the government .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : schroeder went ahead without parliamentary approval while the law suggests that the parliament has to approve all foreign armed deployments , previous rulings suggest that in cases of acute threat , the government may seek parliamentary approval after the fact .
the decision is unlikely to have any legal consequences for schroeder or other members of his government but will influence the military policy-making of future administrations .

parliament always has the final say in foreign troop deployments , the court said . the german government erred in getting involved in the lead-up to the iraq war without parliamentary approval , according to a wednesday , may 7 decision from germany 's highest court .
the german center-left government under then-chancellor gerhard schroeder should have gotten prior approval from the bundestag , germany 's lower house of parliament , before taking part in a surveillance mission to turkey in 2003 , the court ruled .
parliamentary disapproval bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the ruling strengthens parliamentary power germany 's parliament had refused to join in the us military invasion of iraq .
but schroeder 's government agreed to supply troops for the turkey flights .
this outraged members of germany 's free democratic party -lrb- fdp -rrb- , a free-market liberal party .
five years ago the fdp asked a court for an emergency injunction to stop the deployment .
the german constitution requires parliamentary approval for all foreign armed deployments , and turkey qualified , the fdp said .
germany had sent its airborne warning and control system -lrb- awacs -rrb- planes at the request of its nato ally , turkey .
germany provided crews to man nato planes that flew surveillance flights near turkey 's southern border which were meant to protect turkey against an iraqi attack during the us-led invasion .
schroeder 's government described the 2003 deployment as a " routine " nato operation .
a lower court agreed , lifting the fdp 's injunction .
flights were form of deployment bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : not a " routine " operation yet the constitutional court reversed that decision wednesday .
the court ruled that there was a real possibility german military personnel could have been drawn into a conflict .
the court equated the flights with " armed deployment " which needs parliamentary approval .
" it is important that the responsibility for the deployment of armed troops remains in the hands of the representative body of the people , " i.e. parliament , the judges said in the ruling .
fdp head guido westerwelle hailed the constitutional court ruling as " historic , " saying that it would keep the german army under parliamentary control and prevent it from being turned into a tool of the government .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : schroeder went ahead without parliamentary approval while the law suggests that the parliament has to approve all foreign armed deployments , previous rulings suggest that in cases of acute threat , the government may seek parliamentary approval after the fact .

1 , 2009 . in statements issued in brussels and frankfurt , the two european bodies said slovakia had met all of the necessary economic criteria that were required of it . " slovakia has achieved a high degree of sustainable economic convergence and is ready to adopt the euro on 1 january 2009 , " said eu commissioner for economic and monetary affairs joaquin almunia . at the same time , almunia urged slovakia to " pursue its efforts to maintain a low-inflation environment , be more ambitious with regard to budgetary consolidation and strengthen its competitiveness position .
" it must also now speed up its practical preparations to ensure that the changeover takes place smoothly , as it did in cyprus and malta in january 2008 , " the commissioner added . in its report , the ecb said slovakia had met the tough fiscal targets for adopting the euro , but also warned bratislava that it still faced " upside risks to inflation .

the ecb said this was the result of surging energy prices and of its tight labor market . at 2.2 percent of gross domestic product , slovakia 's budget deficit is comfortably within the strict 3-percent rule for euro member states .

" achieving an environment conducive to sustainable convergence in slovakia requires , inter alia , the implementation of a sustainable and credible fiscal consolidation path , " wrote the ecb . this included measures to address high structural unemployment , to ensure wage increases are linked to labor productivity as well as pressing on with the liberalization of its economy . the news was welcomed in bratislava .

1 , 2009 . in statements issued in brussels and frankfurt , the two european bodies said slovakia had met all of the necessary economic criteria that were required of it . " slovakia has achieved a high degree of sustainable economic convergence and is ready to adopt the euro on 1 january 2009 , " said eu commissioner for economic and monetary affairs joaquin almunia . at the same time , almunia urged slovakia to " pursue its efforts to maintain a low-inflation environment , be more ambitious with regard to budgetary consolidation and strengthen its competitiveness position .
" it must also now speed up its practical preparations to ensure that the changeover takes place smoothly , as it did in cyprus and malta in january 2008 , " the commissioner added . in its report , the ecb said slovakia had met the tough fiscal targets for adopting the euro , but also warned bratislava that it still faced " upside risks to inflation . "
the ecb said this was the result of surging energy prices and of its tight labor market . at 2.2 percent of gross domestic product , slovakia 's budget deficit is comfortably within the strict 3-percent rule for euro member states .
likewise , the country 's public debt is about half the 60 per cent of gdp that is required under the maastricht treaty for joining the euro .
slovakia 's 2.2-percent inflation rate is also well below the 3.2-percent reference rate for euro candidate states .
bratislava must ensure sustainability but in its report , the ecb also went on to call on slovakia to take steps to ensure the sustainability of its key fiscal parameters , especially inflation . " achieving an environment conducive to sustainable convergence in slovakia requires , inter alia , the implementation of a sustainable and credible fiscal consolidation path , " wrote the ecb . this included measures to address high structural unemployment , to ensure wage increases are linked to labor productivity as well as pressing on with the liberalization of its economy . the news was welcomed in bratislava . " we are satisfied with the result .
this is a very important decision on slovakia 's way to the euro , " the country 's central banker , ivan sramko , told news agency dpa . addressing the issues raised by the ecb report , sramko said the country would be taking its recommendations " very seriously . " once the decision is ratified by the european parliament and eu governments , slovakia will become europe 's second former communist nation to join the euro , after slovenia .
others have more to do in its report wednesday , the european commission said none of the other nine eu countries planning to join the euro had met " all of the convergence criteria . " the nine countries are : bulgaria , the czech republic , estonia , latvia , lithuania , hungary , poland , romania and sweden . in another widely-expected move , the eu executive also proposed closing the excessive deficit procedures that it had brought against italy , poland , portugal and slovakia . dw staff / dpa -lrb- ncy -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

called " sex burns , " the exhibition focuses on hirschfeld 's work and his persecution by the nazis . the tributes to hirschfeld are " a clear acknowledgment for gays that persecution has taken place and that reparation is necessary , " said the head of germany 's lesbian and gay association , alexander zinn , said at the dedication ceremony .

dw-world.de spoke with marco bünte , an expert on burma at the global institute of global and area studies in hamburg . after the cylone that has killed more than 22,000 people and left hundreds of thousands homeless , burma 's military rulers have appealed to the west for help .
what do you make of this unusual move ?
it shows that the military regime does not have the means to offer help and aid swiftly and on such a huge scale .
the state and the authorities are too weak to deliver aid after this huge humanitarian catastrophe .
some 24 million people live in the irrawady region , which was hit by the cyclone .
large areas still remain inaccessible .
that explains why the regime is appealing to foreign countries for help .
usually the burmese state is very proud that it makes its own decisions and does n't have to rely on outside help .
that was the case during the tsunami in 2004 when they refused foreign aid . do you think the move to ask for foreign aid will open the door to more international contact ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : cyclone nargis ripped through burma 's main city , yangon that 's a possibility .
but it 's difficult to say right now because many aid organizations are complaining about a lack of cooperation with the authorities in burma .
questions also remain about whether these foreign aid groups will stay in the country in the long-term or whether they will only provide emergency aid for immediate needs such as food and drinking water .
we need to be critical about how the military regime deals with international aid groups .
after all , the regime is n't allowing immediate access to all affected areas , but rather it continues to impose restrictions on the organizations .
why is that ?
is the military regime worried about ceding some of its control ?
yes , of course .
it 's the result of politics that the burmese regime has pursued for many years - the leaders remain extremely mistrustful of any foreign agencies , in particular those from the west .
they 're afraid these foreign groups could become politically active or bring in ideas that could lead to changes or unrest .
their policy has always been to remain open to aid but only under very stringent and restrictive conditions .
that 's why it 's very significant if the regime does actually open the door a bit further to let in more international aid groups .
despite international criticism , burma 's military junta seems determined to go ahead with a controversial referendum on the new constitution which would further cement the military 's power .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : burma 's military generals have a firm grip on power the burmese military has already announced that with the exception of 47 of the worst affected regions where the vote will be postponed , the planned referendum will go ahead .
in the past weeks , the regime has made several efforts to ensure that the referendum results in a positive outcome .
they have unleashed a propaganda campaign to urge people to accept the constitution .
soldiers have been deployed in towns and villages to secure the vote .
the military regime is doing everything it can to ensure that it gets a vote in favor of the new constitution and is thus not prepared to postpone it .
there have been some reports of rising anger among the population towards the government for failing to warn people about the cyclone and a lack of help in the crisis .
is there potential for a protest movement ?
there 's definitely potential for protests in the face of the fragile social situation in many regions and the glaring failure of the military government to provide basic help .
but it 's difficult to say whether the resentment and dissatisfaction with the government is strong enough to actually lead to social unrest or protests .
sometimes you need just a single matchstick to light a fire of protest and sometimes it takes longer .
in the past months , food prices and the cost of basic amenities has shot up and led to strong disaffection among the people .
last autumn , anger against rising prices as well as violence against monks spilled over into street protests .
this time , the same has n't happened and at the moment it 's difficult to say because we do n't know exactly what the situation is like .
it 's also possible that in the end people in burma will end up increasingly focusing on securing their food supplies and repairing their homes and limit themselves to the absolute necessities rather than turning on the government .
at the same time , the military regime remains inscrutable - we do n't know for sure whether there are disgruntled members in the military who are also unhappy with the situation in the country .
however , the crushing of mass protests last autumn and the stability and unity of the military regime shows it still has an iron grip on the country .
at the moment there are no signs of dissent or divisions within the ranks .
the eu and the us have offered burma humanitarian relief and aid .
is there any way the tragedy could bring about positive change to burma ?
it would be nice but for that the military regime would have to give up its resistance and open the door to all western organizations .
that 's exactly what the us is demanding by linking its offer of help to access .
however , i doubt whether the military is willing to give that kind of access to aid groups because it fears it will then lose some of its control on a regional and local level .
i do n't think the crisis will lead to a real opening up of the country .
at the same time , there is a possibility that the tense relationship between burma and the international community will be eased somewhat and that cooperation might work better .
it 's also possible that letting in foreign aid will also help burma gradually let go of the fears it harbors towards western agencies and may result in more freedom to travel .
but these are all small changes .
they do not include any far-reaching political change .
what can the west do to further help the people of burma ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the cyclone has ravaged the lives of thousands of burmese i 've always believed that the west has to rethink its sanctions on burma .
that 's because the sanctions also block aid from the world bank and other international organizations .
all the sanctions allow are small projects within the framework of humanitarian relief .
what 's needed is help for myanmar on a much wider scale that is n't tied to political change and to finance the rebuilding of the country without any strings attached . interview : sonia phalnikar send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

mistakes can be made .
but what happens when somebody ’ s name is wrongly added to such a list ? after the attacks on the united states on september 11 , 2001 , the fight against islamic terrorists started in earnest .
lists of suspects , like those championed by the us and the united nations , led the way in tracking down potential threats .
terror lists contain data on persons and organizations suspected of supporting , financing or even being terrorists .
but not all the information the lists contain can be trusted as accurate and sometimes the wrong information finds its way onto the list .
this is what happened to nabil sayadi .
sayadi lives in the quiet belgian town of putte , south of antwerp .
he describes the rural idyll with its apple blossoms and content chickens as his private island .
away from the pleasant surroundings of putte , sayadi faces the distrustful looks and probing questions of friends and colleagues .
this has been his life outside putte ever since the united nations put his and the name of his wife on its list of terrorist suspects .
for five years , the muslim couple have been suspected of being al qaeda sympathizers , helping to finance the organization 's jihad behind the facade of a charitable organization , secours mondial .
names remain on terror list despite court clearances for sayadi , the accusation is incredible .
his organization has been recognized as authentic after being probed by the belgian government before its charitable status was approved .
" we even had a certificate from the minister of finance and can show donation receipts , " sayadi said .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the belgian government allowed the un to take names despite all the controls which have been observed before and after the organization was set up , and despite its involvement at many levels of these processes , the belgian government allowed sayadi and his wife patricia vinck to be put on the un list .
to this day , they have yet to receive any explanation as to why .
nabil sayadi is still labeled a terrorist despite being proved innocent a number of times in separate court cases throughout the belgian legal system .
this is something georges-henri beauthier , the family 's belgian lawyer , can confirm .
" there was nothing one could accuse them of , " beauthier said .
" there was no proof . "
the lawyer also explained that one civil court even ruled that the names of sayadi and his wife should be removed from the list .
but this has still not happened which is why the family is now five years into a lawsuit against the belgian state .
family imprisoned in belgium by red tape it is not only the parents which suffer .
sayadi and his wife have four children .
all of them have had their rights curtailed as a result of the terror list with the family name on it .
they can not leave the country ; the police hold their passports and the bank accounts of the family have been closed .
nabil sayadi is a dental technician but he no longer goes to work .
his last employer fired him when the terrorist list became public knowledge .
now no-one will employ him .
today , the family survives on child benefit and the mother 's invalid pension .
in total , their budget per month is a mere 1500 euros -lsb- $ 2,338 -rsb- , almost half of which goes on rent .
" we pray that nothing happens to any of us which would costs a lot of money , " said patricia vinck .
" if there is an urgent doctor 's visit or a car accident or a school excursion which we must suddenly pay for , then we must run up debts . "
case to go to the european court of justice together with his lawyer , nabil sayadi is locked in a battle for the freedom of his family .
he has submitted a complaint to the united nations .
since the names of the belgians can only be wiped off the list with a unanimous decision from the security council , and united states has so far blocked this , sayadi hopes for the support of the european court of justice in luxembourg .
while any decision in favor of sayadi and his wife by the court would have no judicial effect over the united nations , it could have a symbolic effect .
at least this is what georges-henri beauthier hopes .
" the advocate general in luxembourg has already said that these lists infringe on human rights , " the lawyer said .
only when this assertion is confirmed by a judgment , can the terror lists be finally abolished .

experts say the fallout from the affair may actually have led to a shift towards cleaner business practices . the ancient proverb that “ a fish always stinks from the head down ” can be easily applied to the latest scandals that have been sweeping big , blue chip german companies in the last few years , denting the reputation of munich-based siemens ag in particular . ever since the global slush fund scandal that involved payoffs for huge foreign contracts broke in 2006 , bribery revelations at europe ’ s largest industrial conglomerate have reached an estimated 1.3 billion euros -lrb- about $ 2 billion -rrb- . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : former ceo klaus kleinfeld was forced to resign last year the scandal , which is the biggest ever in germany ’ s corporate history , has not only brought shame to siemens , but within the past year , the entire top management team has been purged .
even though ex-ceo klaus kleinfeld had presided over a period of record profits and was never personally implicated in the scandal , he was forced to resign after losing the board ’ s vote of confidence last year and replaced by peter löscher , an outsider . former supervisory board chairman heinrich von pierer , who had also been kleinfeld ’ s predecessor , had been so highly regarded among germany ’ s business elite that chancellor angela merkel had even tapped him to become technology advisor , an offer that was recently withdrawn . since siemens is also listed on the new york stock exchange , the sec , the us watchdog agency , has also been on the company ’ s heels to comply with anti-corruption regulations . " a fresh start " “ siemens is under tremendous pressure from the sec , but you can not stop the cleaning up process once you ’ ve started it .
just like you can not be half-pregnant , ” said caspar von hauenschild , a board member of transparency international germany , an anti-corruption agency in berlin . von hauenschild said that siemens has done everything possible to clean up its act , but can not afford any more major scandals . “ löscher is giving siemens a fresh start .
the corporate culture against bribes is changing .
what is amazing is that von pierer and kleinfeld didn ’ t regard bribes as a company or personal risk that cost them their jobs , ” he said , adding that the top managers had let the scandal spiral out of control by leaving it up to their underlings to sort out conflicts abroad . “ a chief executive is responsible for implementing codes of conduct - meaning zero tolerance for corruption , ” said von hauenschild . changing rules of the game since the late 1990s the rules of the game on corrupt business practices had started to change dramatically with government crackdowns on fraud and bribery . part of the problem was that bribes involving foreign contracts were not only lawful , but even tax deductible in germany as late as 1999 . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : siemens did what others do , except on a much bigger scale furthermore , cash payments to mediators or foreign officials in exchange for lucrative contracts that amounted to billions of dollars has been always been common business practice , especially in developing countries where corruption is rife , according to frank rothauge , a long time siemens analyst at the private cologne banking house sal .
oppenheim . “ one needs to understand the mind-set back in the 1990s , ” said rothauge . “ paying someone to get a foot in an emerging market with many competitors was regarded as a small price to pay in exchange for a huge contract that made a big contribution to company profits .
it was the nature of the beast to provide such incentives , ” he said . siemens did what most multinationals do , except on a much bigger scale , added rothauge . “ ideally , transparency in competing for orders based on quality , price and innovation is better for everyone , but the reality is different , ” he said , explaining that telecommunications companies such as nokia and ericsson that refuse to accept bribes are often at a competitive disadvantage since they lose out on major contracts in spite of a superior product . german firms not affected rothauge added that siemens ’ image has been hurt , but not too badly .
the scandal has no real impact on the reputation of other german companies either , he added . “ at the end of the day , most business people know that other companies work in the same way .
german companies are no worse off than the more honorable scandinavians , ” he added . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : new ceo peter loescher has a tough task of cleaning up the mess but just because everyone does it , doesn ’ t make bribery right , according to daniela bergdolt if dsw , which represents small investors of siemens ag . “ siemens had a fantastic reputation and it is the market leader in so many areas , such as medical technology .
there was no need to resort to bribery , ” she said . “ the ability to attract customers should be based on being good enough to be competitive , ” added bergdolt , who said that a complete management shake-up was not enough at siemens and that the corporate system of illicit bribes has to change from the top down . easier said than done changing such a corporate culture is easier said than done , according to marcus lutter , a law professor and expert on corporate governance at the university of bonn , who explained that when the rules to stamp out corruption suddenly changed in 1999 , many companies , not just siemens , had a hard time adjusting to a new , cleaner corporate environment . “ it is like telling a chain smoker ‘ starting tomorrow you are not allowed to smoke anymore . ’
it is tough to quit a bad habit .
some people are still going to look for some small corner in a garden to steal a puff , ” he said . lutter also pointed out that the common german corporate practice of chief executives moving upstairs to the supervisory board , as von pierer did , presented problems of its own at siemens .
“ this was clearly a conflict .
kleinfeld could not be fully independent in his decision making with a former ceo looking over his shoulder , ” he said . the conflict meant that both had to go , according to bergdolt , who agrees that siemens is finally on the right course now with a brand new management team . “ its image has even been somewhat restored now , but it has taken an awfully long time to get on the right course , ” she said . diana fong send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the german government rejected claims tuesday that fuel crops were causing a worldwide spike in food prices .
berlin plans to announce a plan for easing the world food crisis by july , agriculture minister seehofer said . germany can not reach its climate change goals unless it dedicates land to growing biofuels , germany 's agriculture minister horst seehofer said after talks in berlin on tuesday , may 6 .
seehofer defended biofuels against growing criticism that they are responsible for food prices increasing globally , which has caused rioting and hunger in developing countries .
" there would also be hunger without biofuel , " seehofer said , who promised that the government would announce this summer what it will do to help ease the global food crisis .
in many countries , the hunger crisis is caused by population increases and the increasing demand for food in developing and emerging countries , said seehofer .
ethanol under scrutiny only 2 percent of cropland worldwide was being used to produce ethanol , a popular biofuel often made from corn , seehofer said .
ethanol has come under heavy criticism recently and which forms an important part of germany 's biofuel targets .
many farmers are switching from growing corn and wheat for food to instead focus on producing biofuel crops .
environment minister sigmar gabriel also promised tuesday that germany will stick to its biofuel strategy , which calls for increasing reliance on plant fuels by 2020 .
gabriel acknowledged that the government 's goal of having 17 percent of energy come from biofuel by 2020 might be overly optimistic and said the german parliament will decide in the near future whether to hold to a 2009 goal of having biofuel make up 6.25 percent of overall fuel consumption .
call for relaxed meat restrictions in a time of increasing prices for all types of food , seehofer said the german government will seek to increase meat production by pushing through rule changes to allow ground-up animal remains can be fed to pigs and poultry .

sarkozy now believes blair 's involvement in the iraq war had damaged his standing among eu fellow members - a view long held my other countries , including germany .
according to the bbc , sources close to the president have indicated that sarkozy felt blair was not right for the role because britain has failed to adopt the euro and the schengen zone of passport-free travel .
france key to presidential selection the selection of the eu 's first permanent president has the political establishment buzzing with speculation .
the new post was created by the lisbon treaty , which assuming it is ratified by all 27 eu member states , will take effect on jan .
1 , 2009 .
the new permanent eu president is envisioned as a high-profile post which will be the face of europe abroad .
the president would prepare and chair the bloc 's summits of national leaders and preside over the european council of member governments .
the presidency job is currently rotated every six months between the bloc 's heads of state .
france will take over the eu presidency in july for the rest of 2008 and it will be influential in negotiations on the new power-sharing arrangements at the bloc 's institutions in brussels .
blair down , but not out while european socialists are in particular opposed to blair becoming eu president , he has not been totally excluded either , a source close to the french presidency told the news agency afp earlier this week .
" the english should n't be ostracized .
it would be a big mistake to think that just because great britain is euroskeptic they should n't get any posts , " the french source told afp .
besides blair , a handful of other european heavyweights are seen as frontrunners .
luxembourg 's prime minister jean-claude junker is often tipped as the next president along with former austrian premier wolfgang schuessel and danish prime minister ander fogh rasmussen .
insiders say that european commission president jose manuel barroso stood a good chance of securing a second five-year term as head of the eu 's executive arm . dw staff -lrb- th -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

these account for approximately 65 percent of all cases of hiv in germany . germany 's hiv infection rate has increased steadily since 2001 , a phenomenon that could be partially attributed to early diagnosis and a larger number of people being tested for hiv . a simultaneous increase in syphilis cases joerg hacker , president of the robert koch institute , also offered another reason for the increase . " one of the little-known reasons for this increase is the high number of syphilis infections in germany , " hacker said .

researchers at the robert koch institute say that those infected simultaneously with syphilis and hiv are more infectious . around 59,000 people in germany are infected with the virus that leads to aids .

1 , 2009 . in statements issued in brussels and frankfurt , the two european bodies said slovakia had met all of the necessary economic criteria that were required of it . " slovakia has achieved a high degree of sustainable economic convergence and is ready to adopt the euro on 1 january 2009 , " said eu commissioner for economic and monetary affairs joaquin almunia . at the same time , almunia urged slovakia to " pursue its efforts to maintain a low-inflation environment , be more ambitious with regard to budgetary consolidation and strengthen its competitiveness position .
" it must also now speed up its practical preparations to ensure that the changeover takes place smoothly , as it did in cyprus and malta in january 2008 , " the commissioner added . in its report , the ecb said slovakia had met the tough fiscal targets for adopting the euro , but also warned bratislava that it still faced " upside risks to inflation . "
the ecb said this was the result of surging energy prices and of its tight labor market . at 2.2 percent of gross domestic product , slovakia 's budget deficit is comfortably within the strict 3-percent rule for euro member states .
likewise , the country 's public debt is about half the 60 per cent of gdp that is required under the maastricht treaty for joining the euro .
slovakia 's 2.2-percent inflation rate is also well below the 3.2-percent reference rate for euro candidate states .
bratislava must ensure sustainability but in its report , the ecb also went on to call on slovakia to take steps to ensure the sustainability of its key fiscal parameters , especially inflation . " achieving an environment conducive to sustainable convergence in slovakia requires , inter alia , the implementation of a sustainable and credible fiscal consolidation path , " wrote the ecb . this included measures to address high structural unemployment , to ensure wage increases are linked to labor productivity as well as pressing on with the liberalization of its economy . the news was welcomed in bratislava . " we are satisfied with the result .
this is a very important decision on slovakia 's way to the euro , " the country 's central banker , ivan sramko , told news agency dpa . addressing the issues raised by the ecb report , sramko said the country would be taking its recommendations " very seriously . " once the decision is ratified by the european parliament and eu governments , slovakia will become europe 's second former communist nation to join the euro , after slovenia .
others have more to do in its report wednesday , the european commission said none of the other nine eu countries planning to join the euro had met " all of the convergence criteria . " the nine countries are : bulgaria , the czech republic , estonia , latvia , lithuania , hungary , poland , romania and sweden . in another widely-expected move , the eu executive also proposed closing the excessive deficit procedures that it had brought against italy , poland , portugal and slovakia . dw staff / dpa -lrb- ncy -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

parliament always has the final say in foreign troop deployments , the court said . the german government erred in getting involved in the lead-up to the iraq war without parliamentary approval , according to a wednesday , may 7 decision from germany 's highest court .
the german center-left government under then-chancellor gerhard schroeder should have gotten prior approval from the bundestag , germany 's lower house of parliament , before taking part in a surveillance mission to turkey in 2003 , the court ruled .
parliamentary disapproval bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the ruling strengthens parliamentary power germany 's parliament had refused to join in the us military invasion of iraq .
but schroeder 's government agreed to supply troops for the turkey flights .
this outraged members of germany 's free democratic party -lrb- fdp -rrb- , a free-market liberal party .
five years ago the fdp asked a court for an emergency injunction to stop the deployment .
the german constitution requires parliamentary approval for all foreign armed deployments , and turkey qualified , the fdp said .
germany had sent its airborne warning and control system -lrb- awacs -rrb- planes at the request of its nato ally , turkey .
germany provided crews to man nato planes that flew surveillance flights near turkey 's southern border which were meant to protect turkey against an iraqi attack during the us-led invasion .
schroeder 's government described the 2003 deployment as a " routine " nato operation .
a lower court agreed , lifting the fdp 's injunction .
flights were form of deployment bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : not a " routine " operation yet the constitutional court reversed that decision wednesday .
the court ruled that there was a real possibility german military personnel could have been drawn into a conflict .
the court equated the flights with " armed deployment " which needs parliamentary approval .
" it is important that the responsibility for the deployment of armed troops remains in the hands of the representative body of the people , " i.e. parliament , the judges said in the ruling .
fdp head guido westerwelle hailed the constitutional court ruling as " historic , " saying that it would keep the german army under parliamentary control and prevent it from being turned into a tool of the government .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : schroeder went ahead without parliamentary approval while the law suggests that the parliament has to approve all foreign armed deployments , previous rulings suggest that in cases of acute threat , the government may seek parliamentary approval after the fact .
the decision is unlikely to have any legal consequences for schroeder or other members of his government but will influence the military policy-making of future administrations .
the german military currently has parliamentary mandates for missions around the world including deployments in afghanistan , bosnia , kosovo and the horn of africa .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de energy -pipe- 07.05.2008 eu panel votes to require liberalization of energy companies großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the eu wants energy firms to separate generation businesses from transmission lines after months debating the " unbundling " of electricity providers , a panel of the european parliament voted in favor of requiring power companies to split their generation businesses from their transmission networks . for years , the european commission has spent years trying to increase competition in the electricity market and bring down prices .
as part of those efforts , the european commission in september proposed that integrated power and gas companies should spin off their retail distribution networks or allow them to be run by an outside operator .
tuesday 's vote confirmed that proposal , at least in the electricity market , and the bid now moves to the full parliament . consumers back in the driver 's seat bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the vote now moves to the eu 's full parliament british socialist lawmaker eluned morgan , who shepherded the bill through the parliament 's industry committee , heralded its victory . " i think that the vote for us meant that we put consumers back in the driving seat on energy policy , " she said . she likewise expressed confidence that the panel vote indicates how the full parliament vote will vote eventually . " i think that this vote will strengthen the hand of the majority of member states that for full ownership unbundling as the only option , " morgan said .
" i hope that it 's given confidence to the commission to pursue this very vigorously . " ' a dangerous road ' german lawmakers , however , were not as excited about the results . " breaking up the energy companies leads us down a dangerous road , " said hans jochen henke , the secretary general of the cdu 's economic affairs council .
" greater competition in the energy industry takes the security of urgently needed investments for granted .
it may likewise thoughtlessly risk our energy supply , and along with it , the accomplishment of climate-change goals . " henke further urged the european parliament to oppose the liberalization of the energy companies .
" a lasting energy policy must bring about more competition intensity while also providing security for investments , " he said , before referring to two alternative proposals set forth by germany several months ago . previous proposals bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : energy giant eon has already begun to divest the first alternative was rejected by members of the eu parliament 's industry committee because it was seen as watering down eu plans to boost competition .
germany then joined france in leading a group of eight nations to develop a so-called " third way . " that proposal , still heavily debated among the eu 's energy ministers , was seen by some as a compromise that would avoid the break-up of these countries ' vertically integrated utilities . the proposition came too late for some companies , however .
in february , german energy giant eon announced in february that it would sell its power grid - its distribution lines - to an operator that would have no interesting the supply or generation of electricity . the eu hailed that response , saying it hoped other power firms might follow suit , though none have yet to announce a break-up , perhaps in anticipation of the full parliament vote , scheduled to take place in mid-june . dw staff -lrb- cat -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de asia -pipe- 07.05.2008 despite disaster , a glimmer of hope for burma 's future großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : opening up to foreign aid could herald a change in burma as western groups urge burma 's military regime to remove red tape delaying a large international aid operation , dw-world.de spoke with an expert about whether the tragedy could result in positive change in burma . with large swathes of the irrawaddy delta under water , an estimated one million people are in dire need of shelter , water , medicine and food . international groups and governments around the world are pressuring burma 's military regime to allow unrestricted access to aid workers to get in emergency supplies .
dw-world.de spoke with marco bünte , an expert on burma at the global institute of global and area studies in hamburg . after the cylone that has killed more than 22,000 people and left hundreds of thousands homeless , burma 's military rulers have appealed to the west for help .
what do you make of this unusual move ?
it shows that the military regime does not have the means to offer help and aid swiftly and on such a huge scale .
the state and the authorities are too weak to deliver aid after this huge humanitarian catastrophe .
some 24 million people live in the irrawady region , which was hit by the cyclone .
large areas still remain inaccessible .
that explains why the regime is appealing to foreign countries for help .
usually the burmese state is very proud that it makes its own decisions and does n't have to rely on outside help .
that was the case during the tsunami in 2004 when they refused foreign aid . do you think the move to ask for foreign aid will open the door to more international contact ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : cyclone nargis ripped through burma 's main city , yangon that 's a possibility .
but it 's difficult to say right now because many aid organizations are complaining about a lack of cooperation with the authorities in burma .
questions also remain about whether these foreign aid groups will stay in the country in the long-term or whether they will only provide emergency aid for immediate needs such as food and drinking water .
we need to be critical about how the military regime deals with international aid groups .
after all , the regime is n't allowing immediate access to all affected areas , but rather it continues to impose restrictions on the organizations .
why is that ?
is the military regime worried about ceding some of its control ?
yes , of course .
it 's the result of politics that the burmese regime has pursued for many years - the leaders remain extremely mistrustful of any foreign agencies , in particular those from the west .
they 're afraid these foreign groups could become politically active or bring in ideas that could lead to changes or unrest .
their policy has always been to remain open to aid but only under very stringent and restrictive conditions .
that 's why it 's very significant if the regime does actually open the door a bit further to let in more international aid groups .
despite international criticism , burma 's military junta seems determined to go ahead with a controversial referendum on the new constitution which would further cement the military 's power .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : burma 's military generals have a firm grip on power the burmese military has already announced that with the exception of 47 of the worst affected regions where the vote will be postponed , the planned referendum will go ahead .
in the past weeks , the regime has made several efforts to ensure that the referendum results in a positive outcome .
they have unleashed a propaganda campaign to urge people to accept the constitution .
soldiers have been deployed in towns and villages to secure the vote .
the military regime is doing everything it can to ensure that it gets a vote in favor of the new constitution and is thus not prepared to postpone it .
there have been some reports of rising anger among the population towards the government for failing to warn people about the cyclone and a lack of help in the crisis .
is there potential for a protest movement ?
there 's definitely potential for protests in the face of the fragile social situation in many regions and the glaring failure of the military government to provide basic help .
but it 's difficult to say whether the resentment and dissatisfaction with the government is strong enough to actually lead to social unrest or protests .
sometimes you need just a single matchstick to light a fire of protest and sometimes it takes longer .
in the past months , food prices and the cost of basic amenities has shot up and led to strong disaffection among the people .
last autumn , anger against rising prices as well as violence against monks spilled over into street protests .
this time , the same has n't happened and at the moment it 's difficult to say because we do n't know exactly what the situation is like .
it 's also possible that in the end people in burma will end up increasingly focusing on securing their food supplies and repairing their homes and limit themselves to the absolute necessities rather than turning on the government .
at the same time , the military regime remains inscrutable - we do n't know for sure whether there are disgruntled members in the military who are also unhappy with the situation in the country .
however , the crushing of mass protests last autumn and the stability and unity of the military regime shows it still has an iron grip on the country .
at the moment there are no signs of dissent or divisions within the ranks .
the eu and the us have offered burma humanitarian relief and aid .
is there any way the tragedy could bring about positive change to burma ?
it would be nice but for that the military regime would have to give up its resistance and open the door to all western organizations .
that 's exactly what the us is demanding by linking its offer of help to access .
however , i doubt whether the military is willing to give that kind of access to aid groups because it fears it will then lose some of its control on a regional and local level .
i do n't think the crisis will lead to a real opening up of the country .
at the same time , there is a possibility that the tense relationship between burma and the international community will be eased somewhat and that cooperation might work better .
it 's also possible that letting in foreign aid will also help burma gradually let go of the fears it harbors towards western agencies and may result in more freedom to travel .
but these are all small changes .
they do not include any far-reaching political change .
what can the west do to further help the people of burma ?

that 's because the sanctions also block aid from the world bank and other international organizations .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de asia -pipe- 07.05.2008 despite disaster , a glimmer of hope for burma 's future großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : opening up to foreign aid could herald a change in burma as western groups urge burma 's military regime to remove red tape delaying a large international aid operation , dw-world.de spoke with an expert about whether the tragedy could result in positive change in burma . with large swathes of the irrawaddy delta under water , an estimated one million people are in dire need of shelter , water , medicine and food . international groups and governments around the world are pressuring burma 's military regime to allow unrestricted access to aid workers to get in emergency supplies .
dw-world.de spoke with marco bünte , an expert on burma at the global institute of global and area studies in hamburg . after the cylone that has killed more than 22,000 people and left hundreds of thousands homeless , burma 's military rulers have appealed to the west for help .
what do you make of this unusual move ?
it shows that the military regime does not have the means to offer help and aid swiftly and on such a huge scale .
the state and the authorities are too weak to deliver aid after this huge humanitarian catastrophe .
some 24 million people live in the irrawady region , which was hit by the cyclone .
large areas still remain inaccessible .
that explains why the regime is appealing to foreign countries for help .
usually the burmese state is very proud that it makes its own decisions and does n't have to rely on outside help .
that was the case during the tsunami in 2004 when they refused foreign aid . do you think the move to ask for foreign aid will open the door to more international contact ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : cyclone nargis ripped through burma 's main city , yangon that 's a possibility .
but it 's difficult to say right now because many aid organizations are complaining about a lack of cooperation with the authorities in burma .
questions also remain about whether these foreign aid groups will stay in the country in the long-term or whether they will only provide emergency aid for immediate needs such as food and drinking water .
we need to be critical about how the military regime deals with international aid groups .
after all , the regime is n't allowing immediate access to all affected areas , but rather it continues to impose restrictions on the organizations .
why is that ?
is the military regime worried about ceding some of its control ?
yes , of course .
it 's the result of politics that the burmese regime has pursued for many years - the leaders remain extremely mistrustful of any foreign agencies , in particular those from the west .
they 're afraid these foreign groups could become politically active or bring in ideas that could lead to changes or unrest .
their policy has always been to remain open to aid but only under very stringent and restrictive conditions .
that 's why it 's very significant if the regime does actually open the door a bit further to let in more international aid groups .
despite international criticism , burma 's military junta seems determined to go ahead with a controversial referendum on the new constitution which would further cement the military 's power .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : burma 's military generals have a firm grip on power the burmese military has already announced that with the exception of 47 of the worst affected regions where the vote will be postponed , the planned referendum will go ahead .
in the past weeks , the regime has made several efforts to ensure that the referendum results in a positive outcome .
they have unleashed a propaganda campaign to urge people to accept the constitution .
soldiers have been deployed in towns and villages to secure the vote .
the military regime is doing everything it can to ensure that it gets a vote in favor of the new constitution and is thus not prepared to postpone it .
there have been some reports of rising anger among the population towards the government for failing to warn people about the cyclone and a lack of help in the crisis .
is there potential for a protest movement ?
there 's definitely potential for protests in the face of the fragile social situation in many regions and the glaring failure of the military government to provide basic help .
but it 's difficult to say whether the resentment and dissatisfaction with the government is strong enough to actually lead to social unrest or protests .
sometimes you need just a single matchstick to light a fire of protest and sometimes it takes longer .
in the past months , food prices and the cost of basic amenities has shot up and led to strong disaffection among the people .
last autumn , anger against rising prices as well as violence against monks spilled over into street protests .

vladimir putin 's handpicked successor as president , dmitry medvedev , takes office on wednesday , may 7 .
his rise to power reads like a russian historical novel . after putin chose medvedev , deputy head of government , as his desired successor in december , medvedev 's approval rating raced from 24 to 70 percent .
at the age of 42 , he will be russia 's youngest head of state since the time of the tsars .
though he initially seemed insecure , he has looked confident and almost presidential in television appearances leading up to and after the election .
he has presented himself as a liberal variation of putin .
medvedev 's credo is stability and the continuation of putin 's course .
in many ways the close confident of putin is a lot like the departing president was eight years ago when he came to office .
neither is especially tall .
medvedev 's facial expression sometimes looks awkward when out of habit he pulls the corners of his mouth downward .

putin built the ladder for his ally 's rise .
he made him head of gazprom 's board of directors , and the energy giant is the basis of medvedev 's power .
among gas monopolists medvedev has a reputation for being painstaking and competent in handling his tasks .
he is one of the few politicians allied with putin who did not previously have a career in the secret service .
even before his election on march 3 , medvedev was featured in state television news reports almost exclusively in a positive light .
he was responsible for the so-called " national projects " in the areas of education , health , housing construction and agriculture .
he never spoke about ambitions for presidential office before he was anointed putin 's chosen successor .
last year , he presented himself as the liberal face of the new russia at the davos economic forum .
in his presidential campaign he stressed social themes and portrayed himself as friendly to business , while the anti-western statements coming out of russia remained squarely putin 's .
medvedev and putin have worked together for 17 years .
a former member of the st , petersburg city administration , he followed putin to moscow , where as vice chairman of the kremlin administration he organized putin 's first presidential campaign in 2000 .
critics accuse medvedev of being jointly responsible for the authoritarian developments in the country in recent years .

vladimir putin 's handpicked successor as president , dmitry medvedev , takes office on wednesday , may 7 .
his rise to power reads like a russian historical novel . after putin chose medvedev , deputy head of government , as his desired successor in december , medvedev 's approval rating raced from 24 to 70 percent .
at the age of 42 , he will be russia 's youngest head of state since the time of the tsars .
though he initially seemed insecure , he has looked confident and almost presidential in television appearances leading up to and after the election .
he has presented himself as a liberal variation of putin .
medvedev 's credo is stability and the continuation of putin 's course .
in many ways the close confident of putin is a lot like the departing president was eight years ago when he came to office .
neither is especially tall .
medvedev 's facial expression sometimes looks awkward when out of habit he pulls the corners of his mouth downward .
but at the same time , you can sense how alert and concentrated he is at work .
putin built the ladder for his ally 's rise .
he made him head of gazprom 's board of directors , and the energy giant is the basis of medvedev 's power .
among gas monopolists medvedev has a reputation for being painstaking and competent in handling his tasks .
he is one of the few politicians allied with putin who did not previously have a career in the secret service .
even before his election on march 3 , medvedev was featured in state television news reports almost exclusively in a positive light .
he was responsible for the so-called " national projects " in the areas of education , health , housing construction and agriculture .
he never spoke about ambitions for presidential office before he was anointed putin 's chosen successor .
last year , he presented himself as the liberal face of the new russia at the davos economic forum .
in his presidential campaign he stressed social themes and portrayed himself as friendly to business , while the anti-western statements coming out of russia remained squarely putin 's .
medvedev and putin have worked together for 17 years .
a former member of the st , petersburg city administration , he followed putin to moscow , where as vice chairman of the kremlin administration he organized putin 's first presidential campaign in 2000 .
critics accuse medvedev of being jointly responsible for the authoritarian developments in the country in recent years .
he rose to the position of head of the kremlin administration in 2003 .
media reports say inside the kremlin he is known as the vizier .
two years later putin made him deputy head of government and shortly afterward rumors surfaced that he had been chosen as putin 's successor .
medvedev comes from a st. petersburg family of university teachers in .
he and his wife , svetlana , have one son .
in interviews the otherwise dry politician admits to his enthusiasm for hard rock . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

mistakes can be made .
but what happens when somebody ’ s name is wrongly added to such a list ? after the attacks on the united states on september 11 , 2001 , the fight against islamic terrorists started in earnest .
lists of suspects , like those championed by the us and the united nations , led the way in tracking down potential threats .
terror lists contain data on persons and organizations suspected of supporting , financing or even being terrorists .
but not all the information the lists contain can be trusted as accurate and sometimes the wrong information finds its way onto the list .
this is what happened to nabil sayadi .
sayadi lives in the quiet belgian town of putte , south of antwerp .
he describes the rural idyll with its apple blossoms and content chickens as his private island .
away from the pleasant surroundings of putte , sayadi faces the distrustful looks and probing questions of friends and colleagues .
this has been his life outside putte ever since the united nations put his and the name of his wife on its list of terrorist suspects .
for five years , the muslim couple have been suspected of being al qaeda sympathizers , helping to finance the organization 's jihad behind the facade of a charitable organization , secours mondial .
names remain on terror list despite court clearances for sayadi , the accusation is incredible .
his organization has been recognized as authentic after being probed by the belgian government before its charitable status was approved .
" we even had a certificate from the minister of finance and can show donation receipts , " sayadi said .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the belgian government allowed the un to take names despite all the controls which have been observed before and after the organization was set up , and despite its involvement at many levels of these processes , the belgian government allowed sayadi and his wife patricia vinck to be put on the un list .
to this day , they have yet to receive any explanation as to why .
nabil sayadi is still labeled a terrorist despite being proved innocent a number of times in separate court cases throughout the belgian legal system .
this is something georges-henri beauthier , the family 's belgian lawyer , can confirm .
" there was nothing one could accuse them of , " beauthier said .
" there was no proof . "
the lawyer also explained that one civil court even ruled that the names of sayadi and his wife should be removed from the list .
but this has still not happened which is why the family is now five years into a lawsuit against the belgian state .
family imprisoned in belgium by red tape it is not only the parents which suffer .
sayadi and his wife have four children .
all of them have had their rights curtailed as a result of the terror list with the family name on it .
they can not leave the country ; the police hold their passports and the bank accounts of the family have been closed .
nabil sayadi is a dental technician but he no longer goes to work .
his last employer fired him when the terrorist list became public knowledge .
now no-one will employ him .
today , the family survives on child benefit and the mother 's invalid pension .
in total , their budget per month is a mere 1500 euros -lsb- $ 2,338 -rsb- , almost half of which goes on rent .
" we pray that nothing happens to any of us which would costs a lot of money , " said patricia vinck .
" if there is an urgent doctor 's visit or a car accident or a school excursion which we must suddenly pay for , then we must run up debts . "
case to go to the european court of justice together with his lawyer , nabil sayadi is locked in a battle for the freedom of his family .
he has submitted a complaint to the united nations .
since the names of the belgians can only be wiped off the list with a unanimous decision from the security council , and united states has so far blocked this , sayadi hopes for the support of the european court of justice in luxembourg .
while any decision in favor of sayadi and his wife by the court would have no judicial effect over the united nations , it could have a symbolic effect .
at least this is what georges-henri beauthier hopes .
" the advocate general in luxembourg has already said that these lists infringe on human rights , " the lawyer said .
only when this assertion is confirmed by a judgment , can the terror lists be finally abolished .
until then , the sayadis must wait to see if something , finally , changes and that they can lead a normal life again . ruth reichstein -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de corporate governance -pipe- 07.05.2008 german firms not affected by siemens scandal , experts say großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : most do it , but the corporate culture of bribery needs to change say experts rocked by the biggest bribery scandal in german corporate history , siemens is restoring its tarnished image .
experts say the fallout from the affair may actually have led to a shift towards cleaner business practices . the ancient proverb that “ a fish always stinks from the head down ” can be easily applied to the latest scandals that have been sweeping big , blue chip german companies in the last few years , denting the reputation of munich-based siemens ag in particular . ever since the global slush fund scandal that involved payoffs for huge foreign contracts broke in 2006 , bribery revelations at europe ’ s largest industrial conglomerate have reached an estimated 1.3 billion euros -lrb- about $ 2 billion -rrb- . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : former ceo klaus kleinfeld was forced to resign last year the scandal , which is the biggest ever in germany ’ s corporate history , has not only brought shame to siemens , but within the past year , the entire top management team has been purged .
even though ex-ceo klaus kleinfeld had presided over a period of record profits and was never personally implicated in the scandal , he was forced to resign after losing the board ’ s vote of confidence last year and replaced by peter löscher , an outsider . former supervisory board chairman heinrich von pierer , who had also been kleinfeld ’ s predecessor , had been so highly regarded among germany ’ s business elite that chancellor angela merkel had even tapped him to become technology advisor , an offer that was recently withdrawn . since siemens is also listed on the new york stock exchange , the sec , the us watchdog agency , has also been on the company ’ s heels to comply with anti-corruption regulations . " a fresh start " “ siemens is under tremendous pressure from the sec , but you can not stop the cleaning up process once you ’ ve started it .
just like you can not be half-pregnant , ” said caspar von hauenschild , a board member of transparency international germany , an anti-corruption agency in berlin . von hauenschild said that siemens has done everything possible to clean up its act , but can not afford any more major scandals . “ löscher is giving siemens a fresh start .
the corporate culture against bribes is changing .
what is amazing is that von pierer and kleinfeld didn ’ t regard bribes as a company or personal risk that cost them their jobs , ” he said , adding that the top managers had let the scandal spiral out of control by leaving it up to their underlings to sort out conflicts abroad . “ a chief executive is responsible for implementing codes of conduct - meaning zero tolerance for corruption , ” said von hauenschild . changing rules of the game since the late 1990s the rules of the game on corrupt business practices had started to change dramatically with government crackdowns on fraud and bribery . part of the problem was that bribes involving foreign contracts were not only lawful , but even tax deductible in germany as late as 1999 . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : siemens did what others do , except on a much bigger scale furthermore , cash payments to mediators or foreign officials in exchange for lucrative contracts that amounted to billions of dollars has been always been common business practice , especially in developing countries where corruption is rife , according to frank rothauge , a long time siemens analyst at the private cologne banking house sal .
oppenheim . “ one needs to understand the mind-set back in the 1990s , ” said rothauge . “ paying someone to get a foot in an emerging market with many competitors was regarded as a small price to pay in exchange for a huge contract that made a big contribution to company profits .
it was the nature of the beast to provide such incentives , ” he said . siemens did what most multinationals do , except on a much bigger scale , added rothauge . “ ideally , transparency in competing for orders based on quality , price and innovation is better for everyone , but the reality is different , ” he said , explaining that telecommunications companies such as nokia and ericsson that refuse to accept bribes are often at a competitive disadvantage since they lose out on major contracts in spite of a superior product . german firms not affected rothauge added that siemens ’ image has been hurt , but not too badly .
the scandal has no real impact on the reputation of other german companies either , he added . “ at the end of the day , most business people know that other companies work in the same way .
german companies are no worse off than the more honorable scandinavians , ” he added . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : new ceo peter loescher has a tough task of cleaning up the mess but just because everyone does it , doesn ’ t make bribery right , according to daniela bergdolt if dsw , which represents small investors of siemens ag . “ siemens had a fantastic reputation and it is the market leader in so many areas , such as medical technology .
there was no need to resort to bribery , ” she said . “ the ability to attract customers should be based on being good enough to be competitive , ” added bergdolt , who said that a complete management shake-up was not enough at siemens and that the corporate system of illicit bribes has to change from the top down . easier said than done changing such a corporate culture is easier said than done , according to marcus lutter , a law professor and expert on corporate governance at the university of bonn , who explained that when the rules to stamp out corruption suddenly changed in 1999 , many companies , not just siemens , had a hard time adjusting to a new , cleaner corporate environment . “ it is like telling a chain smoker ‘ starting tomorrow you are not allowed to smoke anymore . ’
it is tough to quit a bad habit .
some people are still going to look for some small corner in a garden to steal a puff , ” he said . lutter also pointed out that the common german corporate practice of chief executives moving upstairs to the supervisory board , as von pierer did , presented problems of its own at siemens .
“ this was clearly a conflict .
kleinfeld could not be fully independent in his decision making with a former ceo looking over his shoulder , ” he said . the conflict meant that both had to go , according to bergdolt , who agrees that siemens is finally on the right course now with a brand new management team . “ its image has even been somewhat restored now , but it has taken an awfully long time to get on the right course , ” she said . diana fong send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

there was no need to resort to bribery , ” she said . “ the ability to attract customers should be based on being good enough to be competitive , ” added bergdolt , who said that a complete management shake-up was not enough at siemens and that the corporate system of illicit bribes has to change from the top down . easier said than done changing such a corporate culture is easier said than done , according to marcus lutter , a law professor and expert on corporate governance at the university of bonn , who explained that when the rules to stamp out corruption suddenly changed in 1999 , many companies , not just siemens , had a hard time adjusting to a new , cleaner corporate environment . “ it is like telling a chain smoker ‘ starting tomorrow you are not allowed to smoke anymore . ’
it is tough to quit a bad habit .
some people are still going to look for some small corner in a garden to steal a puff , ” he said . lutter also pointed out that the common german corporate practice of chief executives moving upstairs to the supervisory board , as von pierer did , presented problems of its own at siemens .
“ this was clearly a conflict .
kleinfeld could not be fully independent in his decision making with a former ceo looking over his shoulder , ” he said . the conflict meant that both had to go , according to bergdolt , who agrees that siemens is finally on the right course now with a brand new management team . “ its image has even been somewhat restored now , but it has taken an awfully long time to get on the right course , ” she said . diana fong send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the german government rejected claims tuesday that fuel crops were causing a worldwide spike in food prices .
berlin plans to announce a plan for easing the world food crisis by july , agriculture minister seehofer said . germany can not reach its climate change goals unless it dedicates land to growing biofuels , germany 's agriculture minister horst seehofer said after talks in berlin on tuesday , may 6 .
seehofer defended biofuels against growing criticism that they are responsible for food prices increasing globally , which has caused rioting and hunger in developing countries .
" there would also be hunger without biofuel , " seehofer said , who promised that the government would announce this summer what it will do to help ease the global food crisis .
in many countries , the hunger crisis is caused by population increases and the increasing demand for food in developing and emerging countries , said seehofer .
ethanol under scrutiny only 2 percent of cropland worldwide was being used to produce ethanol , a popular biofuel often made from corn , seehofer said .
ethanol has come under heavy criticism recently and which forms an important part of germany 's biofuel targets .
many farmers are switching from growing corn and wheat for food to instead focus on producing biofuel crops .
environment minister sigmar gabriel also promised tuesday that germany will stick to its biofuel strategy , which calls for increasing reliance on plant fuels by 2020 .
gabriel acknowledged that the government 's goal of having 17 percent of energy come from biofuel by 2020 might be overly optimistic and said the german parliament will decide in the near future whether to hold to a 2009 goal of having biofuel make up 6.25 percent of overall fuel consumption .
call for relaxed meat restrictions in a time of increasing prices for all types of food , seehofer said the german government will seek to increase meat production by pushing through rule changes to allow ground-up animal remains can be fed to pigs and poultry .

" slovakia has achieved a high degree of sustainable economic convergence and is ready to adopt the euro on 1 january 2009 , " said eu commissioner for economic and monetary affairs joaquin almunia . at the same time , almunia urged slovakia to " pursue its efforts to maintain a low-inflation environment , be more ambitious with regard to budgetary consolidation and strengthen its competitiveness position .

" it is important that the responsibility for the deployment of armed troops remains in the hands of the representative body of the people , " i.e. parliament , the judges said in the ruling .

as part of those efforts , the european commission in september proposed that integrated power and gas companies should spin off their retail distribution networks or allow them to be run by an outside operator .
tuesday 's vote confirmed that proposal , at least in the electricity market , and the bid now moves to the full parliament . consumers back in the driver 's seat bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the vote now moves to the eu 's full parliament british socialist lawmaker eluned morgan , who shepherded the bill through the parliament 's industry committee , heralded its victory . " i think that the vote for us meant that we put consumers back in the driving seat on energy policy , " she said . she likewise expressed confidence that the panel vote indicates how the full parliament vote will vote eventually . " i think that this vote will strengthen the hand of the majority of member states that for full ownership unbundling as the only option , " morgan said .
" i hope that it 's given confidence to the commission to pursue this very vigorously . " ' a dangerous road ' german lawmakers , however , were not as excited about the results . " breaking up the energy companies leads us down a dangerous road , " said hans jochen henke , the secretary general of the cdu 's economic affairs council .
" greater competition in the energy industry takes the security of urgently needed investments for granted .
it may likewise thoughtlessly risk our energy supply , and along with it , the accomplishment of climate-change goals . " henke further urged the european parliament to oppose the liberalization of the energy companies .
" a lasting energy policy must bring about more competition intensity while also providing security for investments , " he said , before referring to two alternative proposals set forth by germany several months ago . previous proposals bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : energy giant eon has already begun to divest the first alternative was rejected by members of the eu parliament 's industry committee because it was seen as watering down eu plans to boost competition .
germany then joined france in leading a group of eight nations to develop a so-called " third way . " that proposal , still heavily debated among the eu 's energy ministers , was seen by some as a compromise that would avoid the break-up of these countries ' vertically integrated utilities . the proposition came too late for some companies , however .
in february , german energy giant eon announced in february that it would sell its power grid - its distribution lines - to an operator that would have no interesting the supply or generation of electricity . the eu hailed that response , saying it hoped other power firms might follow suit , though none have yet to announce a break-up , perhaps in anticipation of the full parliament vote , scheduled to take place in mid-june . dw staff -lrb- cat -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

sarkozy now believes blair 's involvement in the iraq war had damaged his standing among eu fellow members - a view long held my other countries , including germany .
according to the bbc , sources close to the president have indicated that sarkozy felt blair was not right for the role because britain has failed to adopt the euro and the schengen zone of passport-free travel .
france key to presidential selection the selection of the eu 's first permanent president has the political establishment buzzing with speculation .
the new post was created by the lisbon treaty , which assuming it is ratified by all 27 eu member states , will take effect on jan .
1 , 2009 .
the new permanent eu president is envisioned as a high-profile post which will be the face of europe abroad .
the president would prepare and chair the bloc 's summits of national leaders and preside over the european council of member governments .
the presidency job is currently rotated every six months between the bloc 's heads of state .
france will take over the eu presidency in july for the rest of 2008 and it will be influential in negotiations on the new power-sharing arrangements at the bloc 's institutions in brussels .
blair down , but not out while european socialists are in particular opposed to blair becoming eu president , he has not been totally excluded either , a source close to the french presidency told the news agency afp earlier this week .
" the english should n't be ostracized .
it would be a big mistake to think that just because great britain is euroskeptic they should n't get any posts , " the french source told afp .
besides blair , a handful of other european heavyweights are seen as frontrunners .
luxembourg 's prime minister jean-claude junker is often tipped as the next president along with former austrian premier wolfgang schuessel and danish prime minister ander fogh rasmussen .
insiders say that european commission president jose manuel barroso stood a good chance of securing a second five-year term as head of the eu 's executive arm . dw staff -lrb- th -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de asia -pipe- 07.05.2008 despite disaster , a glimmer of hope for burma 's future großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : opening up to foreign aid could herald a change in burma as western groups urge burma 's military regime to remove red tape delaying a large international aid operation , dw-world.de spoke with an expert about whether the tragedy could result in positive change in burma . with large swathes of the irrawaddy delta under water , an estimated one million people are in dire need of shelter , water , medicine and food . international groups and governments around the world are pressuring burma 's military regime to allow unrestricted access to aid workers to get in emergency supplies .
dw-world.de spoke with marco bünte , an expert on burma at the global institute of global and area studies in hamburg . after the cylone that has killed more than 22,000 people and left hundreds of thousands homeless , burma 's military rulers have appealed to the west for help .
what do you make of this unusual move ?
it shows that the military regime does not have the means to offer help and aid swiftly and on such a huge scale .
the state and the authorities are too weak to deliver aid after this huge humanitarian catastrophe .
some 24 million people live in the irrawady region , which was hit by the cyclone .
large areas still remain inaccessible .
that explains why the regime is appealing to foreign countries for help .
usually the burmese state is very proud that it makes its own decisions and does n't have to rely on outside help .
that was the case during the tsunami in 2004 when they refused foreign aid . do you think the move to ask for foreign aid will open the door to more international contact ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : cyclone nargis ripped through burma 's main city , yangon that 's a possibility .
but it 's difficult to say right now because many aid organizations are complaining about a lack of cooperation with the authorities in burma .
questions also remain about whether these foreign aid groups will stay in the country in the long-term or whether they will only provide emergency aid for immediate needs such as food and drinking water .
we need to be critical about how the military regime deals with international aid groups .
after all , the regime is n't allowing immediate access to all affected areas , but rather it continues to impose restrictions on the organizations .
why is that ?
is the military regime worried about ceding some of its control ?
yes , of course .
it 's the result of politics that the burmese regime has pursued for many years - the leaders remain extremely mistrustful of any foreign agencies , in particular those from the west .
they 're afraid these foreign groups could become politically active or bring in ideas that could lead to changes or unrest .
their policy has always been to remain open to aid but only under very stringent and restrictive conditions .
that 's why it 's very significant if the regime does actually open the door a bit further to let in more international aid groups .
despite international criticism , burma 's military junta seems determined to go ahead with a controversial referendum on the new constitution which would further cement the military 's power .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : burma 's military generals have a firm grip on power the burmese military has already announced that with the exception of 47 of the worst affected regions where the vote will be postponed , the planned referendum will go ahead .
in the past weeks , the regime has made several efforts to ensure that the referendum results in a positive outcome .
they have unleashed a propaganda campaign to urge people to accept the constitution .
soldiers have been deployed in towns and villages to secure the vote .
the military regime is doing everything it can to ensure that it gets a vote in favor of the new constitution and is thus not prepared to postpone it .
there have been some reports of rising anger among the population towards the government for failing to warn people about the cyclone and a lack of help in the crisis .
is there potential for a protest movement ?
there 's definitely potential for protests in the face of the fragile social situation in many regions and the glaring failure of the military government to provide basic help .
but it 's difficult to say whether the resentment and dissatisfaction with the government is strong enough to actually lead to social unrest or protests .
sometimes you need just a single matchstick to light a fire of protest and sometimes it takes longer .
in the past months , food prices and the cost of basic amenities has shot up and led to strong disaffection among the people .
last autumn , anger against rising prices as well as violence against monks spilled over into street protests .
this time , the same has n't happened and at the moment it 's difficult to say because we do n't know exactly what the situation is like .
it 's also possible that in the end people in burma will end up increasingly focusing on securing their food supplies and repairing their homes and limit themselves to the absolute necessities rather than turning on the government .
at the same time , the military regime remains inscrutable - we do n't know for sure whether there are disgruntled members in the military who are also unhappy with the situation in the country .
however , the crushing of mass protests last autumn and the stability and unity of the military regime shows it still has an iron grip on the country .
at the moment there are no signs of dissent or divisions within the ranks .
the eu and the us have offered burma humanitarian relief and aid .
is there any way the tragedy could bring about positive change to burma ?
it would be nice but for that the military regime would have to give up its resistance and open the door to all western organizations .
that 's exactly what the us is demanding by linking its offer of help to access .
however , i doubt whether the military is willing to give that kind of access to aid groups because it fears it will then lose some of its control on a regional and local level .
i do n't think the crisis will lead to a real opening up of the country .
at the same time , there is a possibility that the tense relationship between burma and the international community will be eased somewhat and that cooperation might work better .
it 's also possible that letting in foreign aid will also help burma gradually let go of the fears it harbors towards western agencies and may result in more freedom to travel .
but these are all small changes .
they do not include any far-reaching political change .
what can the west do to further help the people of burma ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the cyclone has ravaged the lives of thousands of burmese i 've always believed that the west has to rethink its sanctions on burma .
that 's because the sanctions also block aid from the world bank and other international organizations .
all the sanctions allow are small projects within the framework of humanitarian relief .
what 's needed is help for myanmar on a much wider scale that is n't tied to political change and to finance the rebuilding of the country without any strings attached . interview : sonia phalnikar send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

we need to be critical about how the military regime deals with international aid groups .
after all , the regime is n't allowing immediate access to all affected areas , but rather it continues to impose restrictions on the organizations .
why is that ?
is the military regime worried about ceding some of its control ?
yes , of course .
it 's the result of politics that the burmese regime has pursued for many years - the leaders remain extremely mistrustful of any foreign agencies , in particular those from the west .
they 're afraid these foreign groups could become politically active or bring in ideas that could lead to changes or unrest .
their policy has always been to remain open to aid but only under very stringent and restrictive conditions .
that 's why it 's very significant if the regime does actually open the door a bit further to let in more international aid groups .
despite international criticism , burma 's military junta seems determined to go ahead with a controversial referendum on the new constitution which would further cement the military 's power .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : burma 's military generals have a firm grip on power the burmese military has already announced that with the exception of 47 of the worst affected regions where the vote will be postponed , the planned referendum will go ahead .
in the past weeks , the regime has made several efforts to ensure that the referendum results in a positive outcome .
they have unleashed a propaganda campaign to urge people to accept the constitution .
soldiers have been deployed in towns and villages to secure the vote .
the military regime is doing everything it can to ensure that it gets a vote in favor of the new constitution and is thus not prepared to postpone it .
there have been some reports of rising anger among the population towards the government for failing to warn people about the cyclone and a lack of help in the crisis .
is there potential for a protest movement ?
there 's definitely potential for protests in the face of the fragile social situation in many regions and the glaring failure of the military government to provide basic help .
but it 's difficult to say whether the resentment and dissatisfaction with the government is strong enough to actually lead to social unrest or protests .
sometimes you need just a single matchstick to light a fire of protest and sometimes it takes longer .
in the past months , food prices and the cost of basic amenities has shot up and led to strong disaffection among the people .
last autumn , anger against rising prices as well as violence against monks spilled over into street protests .
this time , the same has n't happened and at the moment it 's difficult to say because we do n't know exactly what the situation is like .
it 's also possible that in the end people in burma will end up increasingly focusing on securing their food supplies and repairing their homes and limit themselves to the absolute necessities rather than turning on the government .
at the same time , the military regime remains inscrutable - we do n't know for sure whether there are disgruntled members in the military who are also unhappy with the situation in the country .
however , the crushing of mass protests last autumn and the stability and unity of the military regime shows it still has an iron grip on the country .
at the moment there are no signs of dissent or divisions within the ranks .
the eu and the us have offered burma humanitarian relief and aid .
is there any way the tragedy could bring about positive change to burma ?
it would be nice but for that the military regime would have to give up its resistance and open the door to all western organizations .
that 's exactly what the us is demanding by linking its offer of help to access .
however , i doubt whether the military is willing to give that kind of access to aid groups because it fears it will then lose some of its control on a regional and local level .
i do n't think the crisis will lead to a real opening up of the country .
at the same time , there is a possibility that the tense relationship between burma and the international community will be eased somewhat and that cooperation might work better .
it 's also possible that letting in foreign aid will also help burma gradually let go of the fears it harbors towards western agencies and may result in more freedom to travel .
but these are all small changes .
they do not include any far-reaching political change .
what can the west do to further help the people of burma ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the cyclone has ravaged the lives of thousands of burmese i 've always believed that the west has to rethink its sanctions on burma .
that 's because the sanctions also block aid from the world bank and other international organizations .

dw-world.de spoke with marco bünte , an expert on burma at the global institute of global and area studies in hamburg . after the cylone that has killed more than 22,000 people and left hundreds of thousands homeless , burma 's military rulers have appealed to the west for help .
what do you make of this unusual move ?
it shows that the military regime does not have the means to offer help and aid swiftly and on such a huge scale .
the state and the authorities are too weak to deliver aid after this huge humanitarian catastrophe .
some 24 million people live in the irrawady region , which was hit by the cyclone .
large areas still remain inaccessible .
that explains why the regime is appealing to foreign countries for help .
usually the burmese state is very proud that it makes its own decisions and does n't have to rely on outside help .
that was the case during the tsunami in 2004 when they refused foreign aid . do you think the move to ask for foreign aid will open the door to more international contact ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : cyclone nargis ripped through burma 's main city , yangon that 's a possibility .
but it 's difficult to say right now because many aid organizations are complaining about a lack of cooperation with the authorities in burma .

mistakes can be made .
but what happens when somebody ’ s name is wrongly added to such a list ? after the attacks on the united states on september 11 , 2001 , the fight against islamic terrorists started in earnest .
lists of suspects , like those championed by the us and the united nations , led the way in tracking down potential threats .
terror lists contain data on persons and organizations suspected of supporting , financing or even being terrorists .
but not all the information the lists contain can be trusted as accurate and sometimes the wrong information finds its way onto the list .
this is what happened to nabil sayadi .
sayadi lives in the quiet belgian town of putte , south of antwerp .
he describes the rural idyll with its apple blossoms and content chickens as his private island .
away from the pleasant surroundings of putte , sayadi faces the distrustful looks and probing questions of friends and colleagues .
this has been his life outside putte ever since the united nations put his and the name of his wife on its list of terrorist suspects .
for five years , the muslim couple have been suspected of being al qaeda sympathizers , helping to finance the organization 's jihad behind the facade of a charitable organization , secours mondial .
names remain on terror list despite court clearances for sayadi , the accusation is incredible .
his organization has been recognized as authentic after being probed by the belgian government before its charitable status was approved .
" we even had a certificate from the minister of finance and can show donation receipts , " sayadi said .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the belgian government allowed the un to take names despite all the controls which have been observed before and after the organization was set up , and despite its involvement at many levels of these processes , the belgian government allowed sayadi and his wife patricia vinck to be put on the un list .
to this day , they have yet to receive any explanation as to why .
nabil sayadi is still labeled a terrorist despite being proved innocent a number of times in separate court cases throughout the belgian legal system .
this is something georges-henri beauthier , the family 's belgian lawyer , can confirm .
" there was nothing one could accuse them of , " beauthier said .
" there was no proof . "
the lawyer also explained that one civil court even ruled that the names of sayadi and his wife should be removed from the list .
but this has still not happened which is why the family is now five years into a lawsuit against the belgian state .
family imprisoned in belgium by red tape it is not only the parents which suffer .
sayadi and his wife have four children .
all of them have had their rights curtailed as a result of the terror list with the family name on it .
they can not leave the country ; the police hold their passports and the bank accounts of the family have been closed .
nabil sayadi is a dental technician but he no longer goes to work .
his last employer fired him when the terrorist list became public knowledge .
now no-one will employ him .
today , the family survives on child benefit and the mother 's invalid pension .
in total , their budget per month is a mere 1500 euros -lsb- $ 2,338 -rsb- , almost half of which goes on rent .
" we pray that nothing happens to any of us which would costs a lot of money , " said patricia vinck .
" if there is an urgent doctor 's visit or a car accident or a school excursion which we must suddenly pay for , then we must run up debts . "
case to go to the european court of justice together with his lawyer , nabil sayadi is locked in a battle for the freedom of his family .
he has submitted a complaint to the united nations .
since the names of the belgians can only be wiped off the list with a unanimous decision from the security council , and united states has so far blocked this , sayadi hopes for the support of the european court of justice in luxembourg .
while any decision in favor of sayadi and his wife by the court would have no judicial effect over the united nations , it could have a symbolic effect .
at least this is what georges-henri beauthier hopes .
" the advocate general in luxembourg has already said that these lists infringe on human rights , " the lawyer said .

vladimir putin 's handpicked successor as president , dmitry medvedev , takes office on wednesday , may 7 .
his rise to power reads like a russian historical novel . after putin chose medvedev , deputy head of government , as his desired successor in december , medvedev 's approval rating raced from 24 to 70 percent .
at the age of 42 , he will be russia 's youngest head of state since the time of the tsars .
though he initially seemed insecure , he has looked confident and almost presidential in television appearances leading up to and after the election .
he has presented himself as a liberal variation of putin .
medvedev 's credo is stability and the continuation of putin 's course .
in many ways the close confident of putin is a lot like the departing president was eight years ago when he came to office .
neither is especially tall .
medvedev 's facial expression sometimes looks awkward when out of habit he pulls the corners of his mouth downward .
but at the same time , you can sense how alert and concentrated he is at work .
putin built the ladder for his ally 's rise .
he made him head of gazprom 's board of directors , and the energy giant is the basis of medvedev 's power .
among gas monopolists medvedev has a reputation for being painstaking and competent in handling his tasks .
he is one of the few politicians allied with putin who did not previously have a career in the secret service .
even before his election on march 3 , medvedev was featured in state television news reports almost exclusively in a positive light .
he was responsible for the so-called " national projects " in the areas of education , health , housing construction and agriculture .
he never spoke about ambitions for presidential office before he was anointed putin 's chosen successor .
last year , he presented himself as the liberal face of the new russia at the davos economic forum .
in his presidential campaign he stressed social themes and portrayed himself as friendly to business , while the anti-western statements coming out of russia remained squarely putin 's .
medvedev and putin have worked together for 17 years .
a former member of the st , petersburg city administration , he followed putin to moscow , where as vice chairman of the kremlin administration he organized putin 's first presidential campaign in 2000 .
critics accuse medvedev of being jointly responsible for the authoritarian developments in the country in recent years .
he rose to the position of head of the kremlin administration in 2003 .
media reports say inside the kremlin he is known as the vizier .
two years later putin made him deputy head of government and shortly afterward rumors surfaced that he had been chosen as putin 's successor .

vladimir putin 's handpicked successor as president , dmitry medvedev , takes office on wednesday , may 7 .
his rise to power reads like a russian historical novel . after putin chose medvedev , deputy head of government , as his desired successor in december , medvedev 's approval rating raced from 24 to 70 percent .
at the age of 42 , he will be russia 's youngest head of state since the time of the tsars .
though he initially seemed insecure , he has looked confident and almost presidential in television appearances leading up to and after the election .
he has presented himself as a liberal variation of putin .
medvedev 's credo is stability and the continuation of putin 's course .
in many ways the close confident of putin is a lot like the departing president was eight years ago when he came to office .
neither is especially tall .
medvedev 's facial expression sometimes looks awkward when out of habit he pulls the corners of his mouth downward .
but at the same time , you can sense how alert and concentrated he is at work .
putin built the ladder for his ally 's rise .
he made him head of gazprom 's board of directors , and the energy giant is the basis of medvedev 's power .
among gas monopolists medvedev has a reputation for being painstaking and competent in handling his tasks .
he is one of the few politicians allied with putin who did not previously have a career in the secret service .
even before his election on march 3 , medvedev was featured in state television news reports almost exclusively in a positive light .
he was responsible for the so-called " national projects " in the areas of education , health , housing construction and agriculture .
he never spoke about ambitions for presidential office before he was anointed putin 's chosen successor .
last year , he presented himself as the liberal face of the new russia at the davos economic forum .
in his presidential campaign he stressed social themes and portrayed himself as friendly to business , while the anti-western statements coming out of russia remained squarely putin 's .
medvedev and putin have worked together for 17 years .
a former member of the st , petersburg city administration , he followed putin to moscow , where as vice chairman of the kremlin administration he organized putin 's first presidential campaign in 2000 .
critics accuse medvedev of being jointly responsible for the authoritarian developments in the country in recent years .
he rose to the position of head of the kremlin administration in 2003 .
media reports say inside the kremlin he is known as the vizier .
two years later putin made him deputy head of government and shortly afterward rumors surfaced that he had been chosen as putin 's successor .

vladimir putin 's handpicked successor as president , dmitry medvedev , takes office on wednesday , may 7 .
his rise to power reads like a russian historical novel . after putin chose medvedev , deputy head of government , as his desired successor in december , medvedev 's approval rating raced from 24 to 70 percent .
at the age of 42 , he will be russia 's youngest head of state since the time of the tsars .
though he initially seemed insecure , he has looked confident and almost presidential in television appearances leading up to and after the election .
he has presented himself as a liberal variation of putin .
medvedev 's credo is stability and the continuation of putin 's course .
in many ways the close confident of putin is a lot like the departing president was eight years ago when he came to office .
neither is especially tall .
medvedev 's facial expression sometimes looks awkward when out of habit he pulls the corners of his mouth downward .
but at the same time , you can sense how alert and concentrated he is at work .
putin built the ladder for his ally 's rise .
he made him head of gazprom 's board of directors , and the energy giant is the basis of medvedev 's power .
among gas monopolists medvedev has a reputation for being painstaking and competent in handling his tasks .
he is one of the few politicians allied with putin who did not previously have a career in the secret service .
even before his election on march 3 , medvedev was featured in state television news reports almost exclusively in a positive light .
he was responsible for the so-called " national projects " in the areas of education , health , housing construction and agriculture .
he never spoke about ambitions for presidential office before he was anointed putin 's chosen successor .
last year , he presented himself as the liberal face of the new russia at the davos economic forum .
in his presidential campaign he stressed social themes and portrayed himself as friendly to business , while the anti-western statements coming out of russia remained squarely putin 's .
medvedev and putin have worked together for 17 years .
a former member of the st , petersburg city administration , he followed putin to moscow , where as vice chairman of the kremlin administration he organized putin 's first presidential campaign in 2000 .
critics accuse medvedev of being jointly responsible for the authoritarian developments in the country in recent years .
he rose to the position of head of the kremlin administration in 2003 .
media reports say inside the kremlin he is known as the vizier .

vladimir putin 's handpicked successor as president , dmitry medvedev , takes office on wednesday , may 7 .
his rise to power reads like a russian historical novel . after putin chose medvedev , deputy head of government , as his desired successor in december , medvedev 's approval rating raced from 24 to 70 percent .
at the age of 42 , he will be russia 's youngest head of state since the time of the tsars .
though he initially seemed insecure , he has looked confident and almost presidential in television appearances leading up to and after the election .
he has presented himself as a liberal variation of putin .
medvedev 's credo is stability and the continuation of putin 's course .
in many ways the close confident of putin is a lot like the departing president was eight years ago when he came to office .
neither is especially tall .
medvedev 's facial expression sometimes looks awkward when out of habit he pulls the corners of his mouth downward .
but at the same time , you can sense how alert and concentrated he is at work .
putin built the ladder for his ally 's rise .
he made him head of gazprom 's board of directors , and the energy giant is the basis of medvedev 's power .
among gas monopolists medvedev has a reputation for being painstaking and competent in handling his tasks .
he is one of the few politicians allied with putin who did not previously have a career in the secret service .
even before his election on march 3 , medvedev was featured in state television news reports almost exclusively in a positive light .
he was responsible for the so-called " national projects " in the areas of education , health , housing construction and agriculture .
he never spoke about ambitions for presidential office before he was anointed putin 's chosen successor .
last year , he presented himself as the liberal face of the new russia at the davos economic forum .
in his presidential campaign he stressed social themes and portrayed himself as friendly to business , while the anti-western statements coming out of russia remained squarely putin 's .
medvedev and putin have worked together for 17 years .
a former member of the st , petersburg city administration , he followed putin to moscow , where as vice chairman of the kremlin administration he organized putin 's first presidential campaign in 2000 .
critics accuse medvedev of being jointly responsible for the authoritarian developments in the country in recent years .
he rose to the position of head of the kremlin administration in 2003 .
media reports say inside the kremlin he is known as the vizier .
two years later putin made him deputy head of government and shortly afterward rumors surfaced that he had been chosen as putin 's successor .
medvedev comes from a st. petersburg family of university teachers in .
he and his wife , svetlana , have one son .
in interviews the otherwise dry politician admits to his enthusiasm for hard rock . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

called " sex burns , " the exhibition focuses on hirschfeld 's work and his persecution by the nazis . the tributes to hirschfeld are " a clear acknowledgment for gays that persecution has taken place and that reparation is necessary , " said the head of germany 's lesbian and gay association , alexander zinn , said at the dedication ceremony .

mistakes can be made .
but what happens when somebody ’ s name is wrongly added to such a list ? after the attacks on the united states on september 11 , 2001 , the fight against islamic terrorists started in earnest .
lists of suspects , like those championed by the us and the united nations , led the way in tracking down potential threats .
terror lists contain data on persons and organizations suspected of supporting , financing or even being terrorists .
but not all the information the lists contain can be trusted as accurate and sometimes the wrong information finds its way onto the list .
this is what happened to nabil sayadi .
sayadi lives in the quiet belgian town of putte , south of antwerp .
he describes the rural idyll with its apple blossoms and content chickens as his private island .
away from the pleasant surroundings of putte , sayadi faces the distrustful looks and probing questions of friends and colleagues .
this has been his life outside putte ever since the united nations put his and the name of his wife on its list of terrorist suspects .
for five years , the muslim couple have been suspected of being al qaeda sympathizers , helping to finance the organization 's jihad behind the facade of a charitable organization , secours mondial .
names remain on terror list despite court clearances for sayadi , the accusation is incredible .
his organization has been recognized as authentic after being probed by the belgian government before its charitable status was approved .
" we even had a certificate from the minister of finance and can show donation receipts , " sayadi said .

to this day , they have yet to receive any explanation as to why .
nabil sayadi is still labeled a terrorist despite being proved innocent a number of times in separate court cases throughout the belgian legal system .
this is something georges-henri beauthier , the family 's belgian lawyer , can confirm .
" there was nothing one could accuse them of , " beauthier said .
" there was no proof . "
the lawyer also explained that one civil court even ruled that the names of sayadi and his wife should be removed from the list .
but this has still not happened which is why the family is now five years into a lawsuit against the belgian state .
family imprisoned in belgium by red tape it is not only the parents which suffer .
sayadi and his wife have four children .
all of them have had their rights curtailed as a result of the terror list with the family name on it .
they can not leave the country ; the police hold their passports and the bank accounts of the family have been closed .
nabil sayadi is a dental technician but he no longer goes to work .

mistakes can be made .
but what happens when somebody ’ s name is wrongly added to such a list ? after the attacks on the united states on september 11 , 2001 , the fight against islamic terrorists started in earnest .
lists of suspects , like those championed by the us and the united nations , led the way in tracking down potential threats .
terror lists contain data on persons and organizations suspected of supporting , financing or even being terrorists .
but not all the information the lists contain can be trusted as accurate and sometimes the wrong information finds its way onto the list .
this is what happened to nabil sayadi .
sayadi lives in the quiet belgian town of putte , south of antwerp .
he describes the rural idyll with its apple blossoms and content chickens as his private island .
away from the pleasant surroundings of putte , sayadi faces the distrustful looks and probing questions of friends and colleagues .
this has been his life outside putte ever since the united nations put his and the name of his wife on its list of terrorist suspects .
for five years , the muslim couple have been suspected of being al qaeda sympathizers , helping to finance the organization 's jihad behind the facade of a charitable organization , secours mondial .
names remain on terror list despite court clearances for sayadi , the accusation is incredible .
his organization has been recognized as authentic after being probed by the belgian government before its charitable status was approved .
" we even had a certificate from the minister of finance and can show donation receipts , " sayadi said .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the belgian government allowed the un to take names despite all the controls which have been observed before and after the organization was set up , and despite its involvement at many levels of these processes , the belgian government allowed sayadi and his wife patricia vinck to be put on the un list .
to this day , they have yet to receive any explanation as to why .
nabil sayadi is still labeled a terrorist despite being proved innocent a number of times in separate court cases throughout the belgian legal system .
this is something georges-henri beauthier , the family 's belgian lawyer , can confirm .
" there was nothing one could accuse them of , " beauthier said .
" there was no proof . "
the lawyer also explained that one civil court even ruled that the names of sayadi and his wife should be removed from the list .
but this has still not happened which is why the family is now five years into a lawsuit against the belgian state .
family imprisoned in belgium by red tape it is not only the parents which suffer .
sayadi and his wife have four children .
all of them have had their rights curtailed as a result of the terror list with the family name on it .
they can not leave the country ; the police hold their passports and the bank accounts of the family have been closed .
nabil sayadi is a dental technician but he no longer goes to work .
his last employer fired him when the terrorist list became public knowledge .
now no-one will employ him .
today , the family survives on child benefit and the mother 's invalid pension .
in total , their budget per month is a mere 1500 euros -lsb- $ 2,338 -rsb- , almost half of which goes on rent .
" we pray that nothing happens to any of us which would costs a lot of money , " said patricia vinck .
" if there is an urgent doctor 's visit or a car accident or a school excursion which we must suddenly pay for , then we must run up debts . "
case to go to the european court of justice together with his lawyer , nabil sayadi is locked in a battle for the freedom of his family .
he has submitted a complaint to the united nations .
since the names of the belgians can only be wiped off the list with a unanimous decision from the security council , and united states has so far blocked this , sayadi hopes for the support of the european court of justice in luxembourg .
while any decision in favor of sayadi and his wife by the court would have no judicial effect over the united nations , it could have a symbolic effect .
at least this is what georges-henri beauthier hopes .
" the advocate general in luxembourg has already said that these lists infringe on human rights , " the lawyer said .
only when this assertion is confirmed by a judgment , can the terror lists be finally abolished .

there was no need to resort to bribery , ” she said . “ the ability to attract customers should be based on being good enough to be competitive , ” added bergdolt , who said that a complete management shake-up was not enough at siemens and that the corporate system of illicit bribes has to change from the top down . easier said than done changing such a corporate culture is easier said than done , according to marcus lutter , a law professor and expert on corporate governance at the university of bonn , who explained that when the rules to stamp out corruption suddenly changed in 1999 , many companies , not just siemens , had a hard time adjusting to a new , cleaner corporate environment . “ it is like telling a chain smoker ‘ starting tomorrow you are not allowed to smoke anymore . ’
it is tough to quit a bad habit .
some people are still going to look for some small corner in a garden to steal a puff , ” he said . lutter also pointed out that the common german corporate practice of chief executives moving upstairs to the supervisory board , as von pierer did , presented problems of its own at siemens .
“ this was clearly a conflict .
kleinfeld could not be fully independent in his decision making with a former ceo looking over his shoulder , ” he said . the conflict meant that both had to go , according to bergdolt , who agrees that siemens is finally on the right course now with a brand new management team . “ its image has even been somewhat restored now , but it has taken an awfully long time to get on the right course , ” she said . diana fong send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de asia -pipe- 07.05.2008 despite disaster , a glimmer of hope for burma 's future großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : opening up to foreign aid could herald a change in burma as western groups urge burma 's military regime to remove red tape delaying a large international aid operation , dw-world.de spoke with an expert about whether the tragedy could result in positive change in burma . with large swathes of the irrawaddy delta under water , an estimated one million people are in dire need of shelter , water , medicine and food . international groups and governments around the world are pressuring burma 's military regime to allow unrestricted access to aid workers to get in emergency supplies .
dw-world.de spoke with marco bünte , an expert on burma at the global institute of global and area studies in hamburg . after the cylone that has killed more than 22,000 people and left hundreds of thousands homeless , burma 's military rulers have appealed to the west for help .
what do you make of this unusual move ?
it shows that the military regime does not have the means to offer help and aid swiftly and on such a huge scale .
the state and the authorities are too weak to deliver aid after this huge humanitarian catastrophe .
some 24 million people live in the irrawady region , which was hit by the cyclone .
large areas still remain inaccessible .
that explains why the regime is appealing to foreign countries for help .
usually the burmese state is very proud that it makes its own decisions and does n't have to rely on outside help .
that was the case during the tsunami in 2004 when they refused foreign aid . do you think the move to ask for foreign aid will open the door to more international contact ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : cyclone nargis ripped through burma 's main city , yangon that 's a possibility .
but it 's difficult to say right now because many aid organizations are complaining about a lack of cooperation with the authorities in burma .
questions also remain about whether these foreign aid groups will stay in the country in the long-term or whether they will only provide emergency aid for immediate needs such as food and drinking water .
we need to be critical about how the military regime deals with international aid groups .
after all , the regime is n't allowing immediate access to all affected areas , but rather it continues to impose restrictions on the organizations .
why is that ?
is the military regime worried about ceding some of its control ?
yes , of course .
it 's the result of politics that the burmese regime has pursued for many years - the leaders remain extremely mistrustful of any foreign agencies , in particular those from the west .
they 're afraid these foreign groups could become politically active or bring in ideas that could lead to changes or unrest .
their policy has always been to remain open to aid but only under very stringent and restrictive conditions .
that 's why it 's very significant if the regime does actually open the door a bit further to let in more international aid groups .
despite international criticism , burma 's military junta seems determined to go ahead with a controversial referendum on the new constitution which would further cement the military 's power .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : burma 's military generals have a firm grip on power the burmese military has already announced that with the exception of 47 of the worst affected regions where the vote will be postponed , the planned referendum will go ahead .
in the past weeks , the regime has made several efforts to ensure that the referendum results in a positive outcome .
they have unleashed a propaganda campaign to urge people to accept the constitution .
soldiers have been deployed in towns and villages to secure the vote .
the military regime is doing everything it can to ensure that it gets a vote in favor of the new constitution and is thus not prepared to postpone it .
there have been some reports of rising anger among the population towards the government for failing to warn people about the cyclone and a lack of help in the crisis .
is there potential for a protest movement ?
there 's definitely potential for protests in the face of the fragile social situation in many regions and the glaring failure of the military government to provide basic help .
but it 's difficult to say whether the resentment and dissatisfaction with the government is strong enough to actually lead to social unrest or protests .
sometimes you need just a single matchstick to light a fire of protest and sometimes it takes longer .
in the past months , food prices and the cost of basic amenities has shot up and led to strong disaffection among the people .
last autumn , anger against rising prices as well as violence against monks spilled over into street protests .
this time , the same has n't happened and at the moment it 's difficult to say because we do n't know exactly what the situation is like .
it 's also possible that in the end people in burma will end up increasingly focusing on securing their food supplies and repairing their homes and limit themselves to the absolute necessities rather than turning on the government .
at the same time , the military regime remains inscrutable - we do n't know for sure whether there are disgruntled members in the military who are also unhappy with the situation in the country .
however , the crushing of mass protests last autumn and the stability and unity of the military regime shows it still has an iron grip on the country .
at the moment there are no signs of dissent or divisions within the ranks .
the eu and the us have offered burma humanitarian relief and aid .
is there any way the tragedy could bring about positive change to burma ?
it would be nice but for that the military regime would have to give up its resistance and open the door to all western organizations .
that 's exactly what the us is demanding by linking its offer of help to access .
however , i doubt whether the military is willing to give that kind of access to aid groups because it fears it will then lose some of its control on a regional and local level .
i do n't think the crisis will lead to a real opening up of the country .
at the same time , there is a possibility that the tense relationship between burma and the international community will be eased somewhat and that cooperation might work better .
it 's also possible that letting in foreign aid will also help burma gradually let go of the fears it harbors towards western agencies and may result in more freedom to travel .
but these are all small changes .
they do not include any far-reaching political change .
what can the west do to further help the people of burma ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the cyclone has ravaged the lives of thousands of burmese i 've always believed that the west has to rethink its sanctions on burma .
that 's because the sanctions also block aid from the world bank and other international organizations .
all the sanctions allow are small projects within the framework of humanitarian relief .

merkel calls on brazil to make biofuel production sustainable german minister calls for reversal of eu agricultural policy as biofuels fall from grace , a new generation grabs spotlight illegal logging gives eu massive eco-headache energy -pipe- 07.05.2008 germany defends biofuels , hedges bets on energy goals großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : fuel or food ?
the german government rejected claims tuesday that fuel crops were causing a worldwide spike in food prices .
berlin plans to announce a plan for easing the world food crisis by july , agriculture minister seehofer said . germany can not reach its climate change goals unless it dedicates land to growing biofuels , germany 's agriculture minister horst seehofer said after talks in berlin on tuesday , may 6 .
seehofer defended biofuels against growing criticism that they are responsible for food prices increasing globally , which has caused rioting and hunger in developing countries .
" there would also be hunger without biofuel , " seehofer said , who promised that the government would announce this summer what it will do to help ease the global food crisis .
in many countries , the hunger crisis is caused by population increases and the increasing demand for food in developing and emerging countries , said seehofer .
ethanol under scrutiny only 2 percent of cropland worldwide was being used to produce ethanol , a popular biofuel often made from corn , seehofer said .
ethanol has come under heavy criticism recently and which forms an important part of germany 's biofuel targets .
many farmers are switching from growing corn and wheat for food to instead focus on producing biofuel crops .
environment minister sigmar gabriel also promised tuesday that germany will stick to its biofuel strategy , which calls for increasing reliance on plant fuels by 2020 .
gabriel acknowledged that the government 's goal of having 17 percent of energy come from biofuel by 2020 might be overly optimistic and said the german parliament will decide in the near future whether to hold to a 2009 goal of having biofuel make up 6.25 percent of overall fuel consumption .
call for relaxed meat restrictions in a time of increasing prices for all types of food , seehofer said the german government will seek to increase meat production by pushing through rule changes to allow ground-up animal remains can be fed to pigs and poultry .

merkel calls on brazil to make biofuel production sustainable german minister calls for reversal of eu agricultural policy as biofuels fall from grace , a new generation grabs spotlight illegal logging gives eu massive eco-headache energy -pipe- 07.05.2008 germany defends biofuels , hedges bets on energy goals großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : fuel or food ?
the german government rejected claims tuesday that fuel crops were causing a worldwide spike in food prices .
berlin plans to announce a plan for easing the world food crisis by july , agriculture minister seehofer said . germany can not reach its climate change goals unless it dedicates land to growing biofuels , germany 's agriculture minister horst seehofer said after talks in berlin on tuesday , may 6 .
seehofer defended biofuels against growing criticism that they are responsible for food prices increasing globally , which has caused rioting and hunger in developing countries .
" there would also be hunger without biofuel , " seehofer said , who promised that the government would announce this summer what it will do to help ease the global food crisis .
in many countries , the hunger crisis is caused by population increases and the increasing demand for food in developing and emerging countries , said seehofer .
ethanol under scrutiny only 2 percent of cropland worldwide was being used to produce ethanol , a popular biofuel often made from corn , seehofer said .
ethanol has come under heavy criticism recently and which forms an important part of germany 's biofuel targets .
many farmers are switching from growing corn and wheat for food to instead focus on producing biofuel crops .
environment minister sigmar gabriel also promised tuesday that germany will stick to its biofuel strategy , which calls for increasing reliance on plant fuels by 2020 .
gabriel acknowledged that the government 's goal of having 17 percent of energy come from biofuel by 2020 might be overly optimistic and said the german parliament will decide in the near future whether to hold to a 2009 goal of having biofuel make up 6.25 percent of overall fuel consumption .
call for relaxed meat restrictions in a time of increasing prices for all types of food , seehofer said the german government will seek to increase meat production by pushing through rule changes to allow ground-up animal remains can be fed to pigs and poultry .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de asia -pipe- 07.05.2008 despite disaster , a glimmer of hope for burma 's future großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : opening up to foreign aid could herald a change in burma as western groups urge burma 's military regime to remove red tape delaying a large international aid operation , dw-world.de spoke with an expert about whether the tragedy could result in positive change in burma . with large swathes of the irrawaddy delta under water , an estimated one million people are in dire need of shelter , water , medicine and food . international groups and governments around the world are pressuring burma 's military regime to allow unrestricted access to aid workers to get in emergency supplies .
dw-world.de spoke with marco bünte , an expert on burma at the global institute of global and area studies in hamburg . after the cylone that has killed more than 22,000 people and left hundreds of thousands homeless , burma 's military rulers have appealed to the west for help .
what do you make of this unusual move ?
it shows that the military regime does not have the means to offer help and aid swiftly and on such a huge scale .
the state and the authorities are too weak to deliver aid after this huge humanitarian catastrophe .
some 24 million people live in the irrawady region , which was hit by the cyclone .
large areas still remain inaccessible .
that explains why the regime is appealing to foreign countries for help .
usually the burmese state is very proud that it makes its own decisions and does n't have to rely on outside help .
that was the case during the tsunami in 2004 when they refused foreign aid . do you think the move to ask for foreign aid will open the door to more international contact ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : cyclone nargis ripped through burma 's main city , yangon that 's a possibility .
but it 's difficult to say right now because many aid organizations are complaining about a lack of cooperation with the authorities in burma .
questions also remain about whether these foreign aid groups will stay in the country in the long-term or whether they will only provide emergency aid for immediate needs such as food and drinking water .
we need to be critical about how the military regime deals with international aid groups .
after all , the regime is n't allowing immediate access to all affected areas , but rather it continues to impose restrictions on the organizations .
why is that ?
is the military regime worried about ceding some of its control ?
yes , of course .
it 's the result of politics that the burmese regime has pursued for many years - the leaders remain extremely mistrustful of any foreign agencies , in particular those from the west .
they 're afraid these foreign groups could become politically active or bring in ideas that could lead to changes or unrest .
their policy has always been to remain open to aid but only under very stringent and restrictive conditions .
that 's why it 's very significant if the regime does actually open the door a bit further to let in more international aid groups .
despite international criticism , burma 's military junta seems determined to go ahead with a controversial referendum on the new constitution which would further cement the military 's power .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : burma 's military generals have a firm grip on power the burmese military has already announced that with the exception of 47 of the worst affected regions where the vote will be postponed , the planned referendum will go ahead .
in the past weeks , the regime has made several efforts to ensure that the referendum results in a positive outcome .
they have unleashed a propaganda campaign to urge people to accept the constitution .
soldiers have been deployed in towns and villages to secure the vote .
the military regime is doing everything it can to ensure that it gets a vote in favor of the new constitution and is thus not prepared to postpone it .
there have been some reports of rising anger among the population towards the government for failing to warn people about the cyclone and a lack of help in the crisis .
is there potential for a protest movement ?
there 's definitely potential for protests in the face of the fragile social situation in many regions and the glaring failure of the military government to provide basic help .
but it 's difficult to say whether the resentment and dissatisfaction with the government is strong enough to actually lead to social unrest or protests .
sometimes you need just a single matchstick to light a fire of protest and sometimes it takes longer .
in the past months , food prices and the cost of basic amenities has shot up and led to strong disaffection among the people .
last autumn , anger against rising prices as well as violence against monks spilled over into street protests .
this time , the same has n't happened and at the moment it 's difficult to say because we do n't know exactly what the situation is like .
it 's also possible that in the end people in burma will end up increasingly focusing on securing their food supplies and repairing their homes and limit themselves to the absolute necessities rather than turning on the government .
at the same time , the military regime remains inscrutable - we do n't know for sure whether there are disgruntled members in the military who are also unhappy with the situation in the country .
however , the crushing of mass protests last autumn and the stability and unity of the military regime shows it still has an iron grip on the country .
at the moment there are no signs of dissent or divisions within the ranks .
the eu and the us have offered burma humanitarian relief and aid .
is there any way the tragedy could bring about positive change to burma ?
it would be nice but for that the military regime would have to give up its resistance and open the door to all western organizations .
that 's exactly what the us is demanding by linking its offer of help to access .
however , i doubt whether the military is willing to give that kind of access to aid groups because it fears it will then lose some of its control on a regional and local level .
i do n't think the crisis will lead to a real opening up of the country .
at the same time , there is a possibility that the tense relationship between burma and the international community will be eased somewhat and that cooperation might work better .
it 's also possible that letting in foreign aid will also help burma gradually let go of the fears it harbors towards western agencies and may result in more freedom to travel .
but these are all small changes .
they do not include any far-reaching political change .
what can the west do to further help the people of burma ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the cyclone has ravaged the lives of thousands of burmese i 've always believed that the west has to rethink its sanctions on burma .
that 's because the sanctions also block aid from the world bank and other international organizations .
all the sanctions allow are small projects within the framework of humanitarian relief .
what 's needed is help for myanmar on a much wider scale that is n't tied to political change and to finance the rebuilding of the country without any strings attached . interview : sonia phalnikar send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de asia -pipe- 07.05.2008 despite disaster , a glimmer of hope for burma 's future großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : opening up to foreign aid could herald a change in burma as western groups urge burma 's military regime to remove red tape delaying a large international aid operation , dw-world.de spoke with an expert about whether the tragedy could result in positive change in burma . with large swathes of the irrawaddy delta under water , an estimated one million people are in dire need of shelter , water , medicine and food . international groups and governments around the world are pressuring burma 's military regime to allow unrestricted access to aid workers to get in emergency supplies .
dw-world.de spoke with marco bünte , an expert on burma at the global institute of global and area studies in hamburg . after the cylone that has killed more than 22,000 people and left hundreds of thousands homeless , burma 's military rulers have appealed to the west for help .
what do you make of this unusual move ?
it shows that the military regime does not have the means to offer help and aid swiftly and on such a huge scale .
the state and the authorities are too weak to deliver aid after this huge humanitarian catastrophe .
some 24 million people live in the irrawady region , which was hit by the cyclone .
large areas still remain inaccessible .
that explains why the regime is appealing to foreign countries for help .
usually the burmese state is very proud that it makes its own decisions and does n't have to rely on outside help .
that was the case during the tsunami in 2004 when they refused foreign aid . do you think the move to ask for foreign aid will open the door to more international contact ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : cyclone nargis ripped through burma 's main city , yangon that 's a possibility .
but it 's difficult to say right now because many aid organizations are complaining about a lack of cooperation with the authorities in burma .
questions also remain about whether these foreign aid groups will stay in the country in the long-term or whether they will only provide emergency aid for immediate needs such as food and drinking water .
we need to be critical about how the military regime deals with international aid groups .
after all , the regime is n't allowing immediate access to all affected areas , but rather it continues to impose restrictions on the organizations .
why is that ?
is the military regime worried about ceding some of its control ?
yes , of course .
it 's the result of politics that the burmese regime has pursued for many years - the leaders remain extremely mistrustful of any foreign agencies , in particular those from the west .
they 're afraid these foreign groups could become politically active or bring in ideas that could lead to changes or unrest .
their policy has always been to remain open to aid but only under very stringent and restrictive conditions .
that 's why it 's very significant if the regime does actually open the door a bit further to let in more international aid groups .
despite international criticism , burma 's military junta seems determined to go ahead with a controversial referendum on the new constitution which would further cement the military 's power .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : burma 's military generals have a firm grip on power the burmese military has already announced that with the exception of 47 of the worst affected regions where the vote will be postponed , the planned referendum will go ahead .
in the past weeks , the regime has made several efforts to ensure that the referendum results in a positive outcome .
they have unleashed a propaganda campaign to urge people to accept the constitution .
soldiers have been deployed in towns and villages to secure the vote .
the military regime is doing everything it can to ensure that it gets a vote in favor of the new constitution and is thus not prepared to postpone it .
there have been some reports of rising anger among the population towards the government for failing to warn people about the cyclone and a lack of help in the crisis .
is there potential for a protest movement ?
there 's definitely potential for protests in the face of the fragile social situation in many regions and the glaring failure of the military government to provide basic help .
but it 's difficult to say whether the resentment and dissatisfaction with the government is strong enough to actually lead to social unrest or protests .
sometimes you need just a single matchstick to light a fire of protest and sometimes it takes longer .
in the past months , food prices and the cost of basic amenities has shot up and led to strong disaffection among the people .
last autumn , anger against rising prices as well as violence against monks spilled over into street protests .
this time , the same has n't happened and at the moment it 's difficult to say because we do n't know exactly what the situation is like .
it 's also possible that in the end people in burma will end up increasingly focusing on securing their food supplies and repairing their homes and limit themselves to the absolute necessities rather than turning on the government .
at the same time , the military regime remains inscrutable - we do n't know for sure whether there are disgruntled members in the military who are also unhappy with the situation in the country .
however , the crushing of mass protests last autumn and the stability and unity of the military regime shows it still has an iron grip on the country .
at the moment there are no signs of dissent or divisions within the ranks .
the eu and the us have offered burma humanitarian relief and aid .
is there any way the tragedy could bring about positive change to burma ?
it would be nice but for that the military regime would have to give up its resistance and open the door to all western organizations .
that 's exactly what the us is demanding by linking its offer of help to access .
however , i doubt whether the military is willing to give that kind of access to aid groups because it fears it will then lose some of its control on a regional and local level .
i do n't think the crisis will lead to a real opening up of the country .
at the same time , there is a possibility that the tense relationship between burma and the international community will be eased somewhat and that cooperation might work better .
it 's also possible that letting in foreign aid will also help burma gradually let go of the fears it harbors towards western agencies and may result in more freedom to travel .
but these are all small changes .
they do not include any far-reaching political change .
what can the west do to further help the people of burma ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the cyclone has ravaged the lives of thousands of burmese i 've always believed that the west has to rethink its sanctions on burma .
that 's because the sanctions also block aid from the world bank and other international organizations .
all the sanctions allow are small projects within the framework of humanitarian relief .
what 's needed is help for myanmar on a much wider scale that is n't tied to political change and to finance the rebuilding of the country without any strings attached . interview : sonia phalnikar send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?
dw-world.de opinion : burma 's dictatorship in the hot seat the full extent of the disaster caused by cyclone nargis in burma remains unclear .

authorities raided 30 locations looking for evidence early on wednesday , may 7 , taking evidence with them , a statement from schaeuble said .
" rightwing extremism has many faces , among them young neo-nazis and similarly old nazis , " schaeuble said .
" they have in common their rejection of our free democratic principles . "
groups harbor racists collegium humanum -lrb- ch -rrb- and its subsidiary organization , bauernhilfe -lrb- aid to farmers -rrb- , were the two groups identified by the interior ministry .

parliament always has the final say in foreign troop deployments , the court said . the german government erred in getting involved in the lead-up to the iraq war without parliamentary approval , according to a wednesday , may 7 decision from germany 's highest court .
the german center-left government under then-chancellor gerhard schroeder should have gotten prior approval from the bundestag , germany 's lower house of parliament , before taking part in a surveillance mission to turkey in 2003 , the court ruled .
parliamentary disapproval bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the ruling strengthens parliamentary power germany 's parliament had refused to join in the us military invasion of iraq .
but schroeder 's government agreed to supply troops for the turkey flights .
this outraged members of germany 's free democratic party -lrb- fdp -rrb- , a free-market liberal party .
five years ago the fdp asked a court for an emergency injunction to stop the deployment .
the german constitution requires parliamentary approval for all foreign armed deployments , and turkey qualified , the fdp said .
germany had sent its airborne warning and control system -lrb- awacs -rrb- planes at the request of its nato ally , turkey .
germany provided crews to man nato planes that flew surveillance flights near turkey 's southern border which were meant to protect turkey against an iraqi attack during the us-led invasion .
schroeder 's government described the 2003 deployment as a " routine " nato operation .
a lower court agreed , lifting the fdp 's injunction .
flights were form of deployment bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : not a " routine " operation yet the constitutional court reversed that decision wednesday .
the court ruled that there was a real possibility german military personnel could have been drawn into a conflict .
the court equated the flights with " armed deployment " which needs parliamentary approval .
" it is important that the responsibility for the deployment of armed troops remains in the hands of the representative body of the people , " i.e. parliament , the judges said in the ruling .
fdp head guido westerwelle hailed the constitutional court ruling as " historic , " saying that it would keep the german army under parliamentary control and prevent it from being turned into a tool of the government .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : schroeder went ahead without parliamentary approval while the law suggests that the parliament has to approve all foreign armed deployments , previous rulings suggest that in cases of acute threat , the government may seek parliamentary approval after the fact .
the decision is unlikely to have any legal consequences for schroeder or other members of his government but will influence the military policy-making of future administrations .

parliament always has the final say in foreign troop deployments , the court said . the german government erred in getting involved in the lead-up to the iraq war without parliamentary approval , according to a wednesday , may 7 decision from germany 's highest court .
the german center-left government under then-chancellor gerhard schroeder should have gotten prior approval from the bundestag , germany 's lower house of parliament , before taking part in a surveillance mission to turkey in 2003 , the court ruled .
parliamentary disapproval bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the ruling strengthens parliamentary power germany 's parliament had refused to join in the us military invasion of iraq .
but schroeder 's government agreed to supply troops for the turkey flights .
this outraged members of germany 's free democratic party -lrb- fdp -rrb- , a free-market liberal party .
five years ago the fdp asked a court for an emergency injunction to stop the deployment .
the german constitution requires parliamentary approval for all foreign armed deployments , and turkey qualified , the fdp said .
germany had sent its airborne warning and control system -lrb- awacs -rrb- planes at the request of its nato ally , turkey .
germany provided crews to man nato planes that flew surveillance flights near turkey 's southern border which were meant to protect turkey against an iraqi attack during the us-led invasion .
schroeder 's government described the 2003 deployment as a " routine " nato operation .
a lower court agreed , lifting the fdp 's injunction .
flights were form of deployment bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : not a " routine " operation yet the constitutional court reversed that decision wednesday .
the court ruled that there was a real possibility german military personnel could have been drawn into a conflict .
the court equated the flights with " armed deployment " which needs parliamentary approval .
" it is important that the responsibility for the deployment of armed troops remains in the hands of the representative body of the people , " i.e. parliament , the judges said in the ruling .
fdp head guido westerwelle hailed the constitutional court ruling as " historic , " saying that it would keep the german army under parliamentary control and prevent it from being turned into a tool of the government .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : schroeder went ahead without parliamentary approval while the law suggests that the parliament has to approve all foreign armed deployments , previous rulings suggest that in cases of acute threat , the government may seek parliamentary approval after the fact .
the decision is unlikely to have any legal consequences for schroeder or other members of his government but will influence the military policy-making of future administrations .
the german military currently has parliamentary mandates for missions around the world including deployments in afghanistan , bosnia , kosovo and the horn of africa .

as part of those efforts , the european commission in september proposed that integrated power and gas companies should spin off their retail distribution networks or allow them to be run by an outside operator .
tuesday 's vote confirmed that proposal , at least in the electricity market , and the bid now moves to the full parliament . consumers back in the driver 's seat bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the vote now moves to the eu 's full parliament british socialist lawmaker eluned morgan , who shepherded the bill through the parliament 's industry committee , heralded its victory . " i think that the vote for us meant that we put consumers back in the driving seat on energy policy , " she said . she likewise expressed confidence that the panel vote indicates how the full parliament vote will vote eventually . " i think that this vote will strengthen the hand of the majority of member states that for full ownership unbundling as the only option , " morgan said .
" i hope that it 's given confidence to the commission to pursue this very vigorously . " ' a dangerous road ' german lawmakers , however , were not as excited about the results . " breaking up the energy companies leads us down a dangerous road , " said hans jochen henke , the secretary general of the cdu 's economic affairs council .

vladimir putin 's handpicked successor as president , dmitry medvedev , takes office on wednesday , may 7 .
his rise to power reads like a russian historical novel . after putin chose medvedev , deputy head of government , as his desired successor in december , medvedev 's approval rating raced from 24 to 70 percent .
at the age of 42 , he will be russia 's youngest head of state since the time of the tsars .
though he initially seemed insecure , he has looked confident and almost presidential in television appearances leading up to and after the election .
he has presented himself as a liberal variation of putin .
medvedev 's credo is stability and the continuation of putin 's course .
in many ways the close confident of putin is a lot like the departing president was eight years ago when he came to office .
neither is especially tall .
medvedev 's facial expression sometimes looks awkward when out of habit he pulls the corners of his mouth downward .
but at the same time , you can sense how alert and concentrated he is at work .
putin built the ladder for his ally 's rise .
he made him head of gazprom 's board of directors , and the energy giant is the basis of medvedev 's power .
among gas monopolists medvedev has a reputation for being painstaking and competent in handling his tasks .
he is one of the few politicians allied with putin who did not previously have a career in the secret service .
even before his election on march 3 , medvedev was featured in state television news reports almost exclusively in a positive light .
he was responsible for the so-called " national projects " in the areas of education , health , housing construction and agriculture .
he never spoke about ambitions for presidential office before he was anointed putin 's chosen successor .
last year , he presented himself as the liberal face of the new russia at the davos economic forum .
in his presidential campaign he stressed social themes and portrayed himself as friendly to business , while the anti-western statements coming out of russia remained squarely putin 's .
medvedev and putin have worked together for 17 years .
a former member of the st , petersburg city administration , he followed putin to moscow , where as vice chairman of the kremlin administration he organized putin 's first presidential campaign in 2000 .
critics accuse medvedev of being jointly responsible for the authoritarian developments in the country in recent years .
he rose to the position of head of the kremlin administration in 2003 .
media reports say inside the kremlin he is known as the vizier .
two years later putin made him deputy head of government and shortly afterward rumors surfaced that he had been chosen as putin 's successor .
medvedev comes from a st. petersburg family of university teachers in .
he and his wife , svetlana , have one son .
in interviews the otherwise dry politician admits to his enthusiasm for hard rock . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

vladimir putin 's handpicked successor as president , dmitry medvedev , takes office on wednesday , may 7 .
his rise to power reads like a russian historical novel . after putin chose medvedev , deputy head of government , as his desired successor in december , medvedev 's approval rating raced from 24 to 70 percent .
at the age of 42 , he will be russia 's youngest head of state since the time of the tsars .
though he initially seemed insecure , he has looked confident and almost presidential in television appearances leading up to and after the election .
he has presented himself as a liberal variation of putin .
medvedev 's credo is stability and the continuation of putin 's course .
in many ways the close confident of putin is a lot like the departing president was eight years ago when he came to office .
neither is especially tall .
medvedev 's facial expression sometimes looks awkward when out of habit he pulls the corners of his mouth downward .

vladimir putin 's handpicked successor as president , dmitry medvedev , takes office on wednesday , may 7 .
his rise to power reads like a russian historical novel . after putin chose medvedev , deputy head of government , as his desired successor in december , medvedev 's approval rating raced from 24 to 70 percent .
at the age of 42 , he will be russia 's youngest head of state since the time of the tsars .
though he initially seemed insecure , he has looked confident and almost presidential in television appearances leading up to and after the election .
he has presented himself as a liberal variation of putin .
medvedev 's credo is stability and the continuation of putin 's course .
in many ways the close confident of putin is a lot like the departing president was eight years ago when he came to office .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de asia -pipe- 07.05.2008 despite disaster , a glimmer of hope for burma 's future großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : opening up to foreign aid could herald a change in burma as western groups urge burma 's military regime to remove red tape delaying a large international aid operation , dw-world.de spoke with an expert about whether the tragedy could result in positive change in burma . with large swathes of the irrawaddy delta under water , an estimated one million people are in dire need of shelter , water , medicine and food . international groups and governments around the world are pressuring burma 's military regime to allow unrestricted access to aid workers to get in emergency supplies .
dw-world.de spoke with marco bünte , an expert on burma at the global institute of global and area studies in hamburg . after the cylone that has killed more than 22,000 people and left hundreds of thousands homeless , burma 's military rulers have appealed to the west for help .
what do you make of this unusual move ?
it shows that the military regime does not have the means to offer help and aid swiftly and on such a huge scale .
the state and the authorities are too weak to deliver aid after this huge humanitarian catastrophe .
some 24 million people live in the irrawady region , which was hit by the cyclone .
large areas still remain inaccessible .
that explains why the regime is appealing to foreign countries for help .
usually the burmese state is very proud that it makes its own decisions and does n't have to rely on outside help .
that was the case during the tsunami in 2004 when they refused foreign aid . do you think the move to ask for foreign aid will open the door to more international contact ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : cyclone nargis ripped through burma 's main city , yangon that 's a possibility .
but it 's difficult to say right now because many aid organizations are complaining about a lack of cooperation with the authorities in burma .
questions also remain about whether these foreign aid groups will stay in the country in the long-term or whether they will only provide emergency aid for immediate needs such as food and drinking water .
we need to be critical about how the military regime deals with international aid groups .
after all , the regime is n't allowing immediate access to all affected areas , but rather it continues to impose restrictions on the organizations .
why is that ?
is the military regime worried about ceding some of its control ?
yes , of course .
it 's the result of politics that the burmese regime has pursued for many years - the leaders remain extremely mistrustful of any foreign agencies , in particular those from the west .
they 're afraid these foreign groups could become politically active or bring in ideas that could lead to changes or unrest .
their policy has always been to remain open to aid but only under very stringent and restrictive conditions .
that 's why it 's very significant if the regime does actually open the door a bit further to let in more international aid groups .
despite international criticism , burma 's military junta seems determined to go ahead with a controversial referendum on the new constitution which would further cement the military 's power .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : burma 's military generals have a firm grip on power the burmese military has already announced that with the exception of 47 of the worst affected regions where the vote will be postponed , the planned referendum will go ahead .
in the past weeks , the regime has made several efforts to ensure that the referendum results in a positive outcome .
they have unleashed a propaganda campaign to urge people to accept the constitution .
soldiers have been deployed in towns and villages to secure the vote .
the military regime is doing everything it can to ensure that it gets a vote in favor of the new constitution and is thus not prepared to postpone it .
there have been some reports of rising anger among the population towards the government for failing to warn people about the cyclone and a lack of help in the crisis .
is there potential for a protest movement ?
there 's definitely potential for protests in the face of the fragile social situation in many regions and the glaring failure of the military government to provide basic help .
but it 's difficult to say whether the resentment and dissatisfaction with the government is strong enough to actually lead to social unrest or protests .
sometimes you need just a single matchstick to light a fire of protest and sometimes it takes longer .
in the past months , food prices and the cost of basic amenities has shot up and led to strong disaffection among the people .
last autumn , anger against rising prices as well as violence against monks spilled over into street protests .
this time , the same has n't happened and at the moment it 's difficult to say because we do n't know exactly what the situation is like .
it 's also possible that in the end people in burma will end up increasingly focusing on securing their food supplies and repairing their homes and limit themselves to the absolute necessities rather than turning on the government .
at the same time , the military regime remains inscrutable - we do n't know for sure whether there are disgruntled members in the military who are also unhappy with the situation in the country .
however , the crushing of mass protests last autumn and the stability and unity of the military regime shows it still has an iron grip on the country .
at the moment there are no signs of dissent or divisions within the ranks .
the eu and the us have offered burma humanitarian relief and aid .
is there any way the tragedy could bring about positive change to burma ?
it would be nice but for that the military regime would have to give up its resistance and open the door to all western organizations .
that 's exactly what the us is demanding by linking its offer of help to access .
however , i doubt whether the military is willing to give that kind of access to aid groups because it fears it will then lose some of its control on a regional and local level .
i do n't think the crisis will lead to a real opening up of the country .
at the same time , there is a possibility that the tense relationship between burma and the international community will be eased somewhat and that cooperation might work better .
it 's also possible that letting in foreign aid will also help burma gradually let go of the fears it harbors towards western agencies and may result in more freedom to travel .
but these are all small changes .
they do not include any far-reaching political change .
what can the west do to further help the people of burma ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the cyclone has ravaged the lives of thousands of burmese i 've always believed that the west has to rethink its sanctions on burma .
that 's because the sanctions also block aid from the world bank and other international organizations .
all the sanctions allow are small projects within the framework of humanitarian relief .
what 's needed is help for myanmar on a much wider scale that is n't tied to political change and to finance the rebuilding of the country without any strings attached . interview : sonia phalnikar send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" slovakia has achieved a high degree of sustainable economic convergence and is ready to adopt the euro on 1 january 2009 , " said eu commissioner for economic and monetary affairs joaquin almunia . at the same time , almunia urged slovakia to " pursue its efforts to maintain a low-inflation environment , be more ambitious with regard to budgetary consolidation and strengthen its competitiveness position .

" slovakia has achieved a high degree of sustainable economic convergence and is ready to adopt the euro on 1 january 2009 , " said eu commissioner for economic and monetary affairs joaquin almunia . at the same time , almunia urged slovakia to " pursue its efforts to maintain a low-inflation environment , be more ambitious with regard to budgetary consolidation and strengthen its competitiveness position .
" it must also now speed up its practical preparations to ensure that the changeover takes place smoothly , as it did in cyprus and malta in january 2008 , " the commissioner added . in its report , the ecb said slovakia had met the tough fiscal targets for adopting the euro , but also warned bratislava that it still faced " upside risks to inflation .

the ecb said this was the result of surging energy prices and of its tight labor market . at 2.2 percent of gross domestic product , slovakia 's budget deficit is comfortably within the strict 3-percent rule for euro member states .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de asia -pipe- 07.05.2008 despite disaster , a glimmer of hope for burma 's future großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : opening up to foreign aid could herald a change in burma as western groups urge burma 's military regime to remove red tape delaying a large international aid operation , dw-world.de spoke with an expert about whether the tragedy could result in positive change in burma . with large swathes of the irrawaddy delta under water , an estimated one million people are in dire need of shelter , water , medicine and food . international groups and governments around the world are pressuring burma 's military regime to allow unrestricted access to aid workers to get in emergency supplies .
dw-world.de spoke with marco bünte , an expert on burma at the global institute of global and area studies in hamburg . after the cylone that has killed more than 22,000 people and left hundreds of thousands homeless , burma 's military rulers have appealed to the west for help .
what do you make of this unusual move ?
it shows that the military regime does not have the means to offer help and aid swiftly and on such a huge scale .
the state and the authorities are too weak to deliver aid after this huge humanitarian catastrophe .
some 24 million people live in the irrawady region , which was hit by the cyclone .
large areas still remain inaccessible .
that explains why the regime is appealing to foreign countries for help .
usually the burmese state is very proud that it makes its own decisions and does n't have to rely on outside help .
that was the case during the tsunami in 2004 when they refused foreign aid . do you think the move to ask for foreign aid will open the door to more international contact ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : cyclone nargis ripped through burma 's main city , yangon that 's a possibility .
but it 's difficult to say right now because many aid organizations are complaining about a lack of cooperation with the authorities in burma .
questions also remain about whether these foreign aid groups will stay in the country in the long-term or whether they will only provide emergency aid for immediate needs such as food and drinking water .
we need to be critical about how the military regime deals with international aid groups .
after all , the regime is n't allowing immediate access to all affected areas , but rather it continues to impose restrictions on the organizations .
why is that ?
is the military regime worried about ceding some of its control ?
yes , of course .
it 's the result of politics that the burmese regime has pursued for many years - the leaders remain extremely mistrustful of any foreign agencies , in particular those from the west .
they 're afraid these foreign groups could become politically active or bring in ideas that could lead to changes or unrest .
their policy has always been to remain open to aid but only under very stringent and restrictive conditions .
that 's why it 's very significant if the regime does actually open the door a bit further to let in more international aid groups .
despite international criticism , burma 's military junta seems determined to go ahead with a controversial referendum on the new constitution which would further cement the military 's power .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : burma 's military generals have a firm grip on power the burmese military has already announced that with the exception of 47 of the worst affected regions where the vote will be postponed , the planned referendum will go ahead .
in the past weeks , the regime has made several efforts to ensure that the referendum results in a positive outcome .
they have unleashed a propaganda campaign to urge people to accept the constitution .
soldiers have been deployed in towns and villages to secure the vote .
the military regime is doing everything it can to ensure that it gets a vote in favor of the new constitution and is thus not prepared to postpone it .
there have been some reports of rising anger among the population towards the government for failing to warn people about the cyclone and a lack of help in the crisis .
is there potential for a protest movement ?
there 's definitely potential for protests in the face of the fragile social situation in many regions and the glaring failure of the military government to provide basic help .
but it 's difficult to say whether the resentment and dissatisfaction with the government is strong enough to actually lead to social unrest or protests .
sometimes you need just a single matchstick to light a fire of protest and sometimes it takes longer .
in the past months , food prices and the cost of basic amenities has shot up and led to strong disaffection among the people .
last autumn , anger against rising prices as well as violence against monks spilled over into street protests .
this time , the same has n't happened and at the moment it 's difficult to say because we do n't know exactly what the situation is like .
it 's also possible that in the end people in burma will end up increasingly focusing on securing their food supplies and repairing their homes and limit themselves to the absolute necessities rather than turning on the government .
at the same time , the military regime remains inscrutable - we do n't know for sure whether there are disgruntled members in the military who are also unhappy with the situation in the country .
however , the crushing of mass protests last autumn and the stability and unity of the military regime shows it still has an iron grip on the country .
at the moment there are no signs of dissent or divisions within the ranks .
the eu and the us have offered burma humanitarian relief and aid .
is there any way the tragedy could bring about positive change to burma ?
it would be nice but for that the military regime would have to give up its resistance and open the door to all western organizations .
that 's exactly what the us is demanding by linking its offer of help to access .
however , i doubt whether the military is willing to give that kind of access to aid groups because it fears it will then lose some of its control on a regional and local level .
i do n't think the crisis will lead to a real opening up of the country .
at the same time , there is a possibility that the tense relationship between burma and the international community will be eased somewhat and that cooperation might work better .
it 's also possible that letting in foreign aid will also help burma gradually let go of the fears it harbors towards western agencies and may result in more freedom to travel .
but these are all small changes .
they do not include any far-reaching political change .
what can the west do to further help the people of burma ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the cyclone has ravaged the lives of thousands of burmese i 've always believed that the west has to rethink its sanctions on burma .
that 's because the sanctions also block aid from the world bank and other international organizations .
all the sanctions allow are small projects within the framework of humanitarian relief .
what 's needed is help for myanmar on a much wider scale that is n't tied to political change and to finance the rebuilding of the country without any strings attached . interview : sonia phalnikar send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the military regime is doing everything it can to ensure that it gets a vote in favor of the new constitution and is thus not prepared to postpone it .
there have been some reports of rising anger among the population towards the government for failing to warn people about the cyclone and a lack of help in the crisis .
is there potential for a protest movement ?
there 's definitely potential for protests in the face of the fragile social situation in many regions and the glaring failure of the military government to provide basic help .
but it 's difficult to say whether the resentment and dissatisfaction with the government is strong enough to actually lead to social unrest or protests .
sometimes you need just a single matchstick to light a fire of protest and sometimes it takes longer .
in the past months , food prices and the cost of basic amenities has shot up and led to strong disaffection among the people .
last autumn , anger against rising prices as well as violence against monks spilled over into street protests .
this time , the same has n't happened and at the moment it 's difficult to say because we do n't know exactly what the situation is like .
it 's also possible that in the end people in burma will end up increasingly focusing on securing their food supplies and repairing their homes and limit themselves to the absolute necessities rather than turning on the government .
at the same time , the military regime remains inscrutable - we do n't know for sure whether there are disgruntled members in the military who are also unhappy with the situation in the country .
however , the crushing of mass protests last autumn and the stability and unity of the military regime shows it still has an iron grip on the country .
at the moment there are no signs of dissent or divisions within the ranks .
the eu and the us have offered burma humanitarian relief and aid .
is there any way the tragedy could bring about positive change to burma ?
it would be nice but for that the military regime would have to give up its resistance and open the door to all western organizations .
that 's exactly what the us is demanding by linking its offer of help to access .
however , i doubt whether the military is willing to give that kind of access to aid groups because it fears it will then lose some of its control on a regional and local level .
i do n't think the crisis will lead to a real opening up of the country .
at the same time , there is a possibility that the tense relationship between burma and the international community will be eased somewhat and that cooperation might work better .
it 's also possible that letting in foreign aid will also help burma gradually let go of the fears it harbors towards western agencies and may result in more freedom to travel .
but these are all small changes .
they do not include any far-reaching political change .
what can the west do to further help the people of burma ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the cyclone has ravaged the lives of thousands of burmese i 've always believed that the west has to rethink its sanctions on burma .
that 's because the sanctions also block aid from the world bank and other international organizations .
all the sanctions allow are small projects within the framework of humanitarian relief .
what 's needed is help for myanmar on a much wider scale that is n't tied to political change and to finance the rebuilding of the country without any strings attached . interview : sonia phalnikar send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?
dw-world.de opinion : burma 's dictatorship in the hot seat the full extent of the disaster caused by cyclone nargis in burma remains unclear .
but one thing is apparent : the regime is unwilling to delay its planned referendum on the constitution , says dw 's tobias grote-beverborg .

parliament always has the final say in foreign troop deployments , the court said . the german government erred in getting involved in the lead-up to the iraq war without parliamentary approval , according to a wednesday , may 7 decision from germany 's highest court .
the german center-left government under then-chancellor gerhard schroeder should have gotten prior approval from the bundestag , germany 's lower house of parliament , before taking part in a surveillance mission to turkey in 2003 , the court ruled .
parliamentary disapproval bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the ruling strengthens parliamentary power germany 's parliament had refused to join in the us military invasion of iraq .
but schroeder 's government agreed to supply troops for the turkey flights .
this outraged members of germany 's free democratic party -lrb- fdp -rrb- , a free-market liberal party .
five years ago the fdp asked a court for an emergency injunction to stop the deployment .
the german constitution requires parliamentary approval for all foreign armed deployments , and turkey qualified , the fdp said .
germany had sent its airborne warning and control system -lrb- awacs -rrb- planes at the request of its nato ally , turkey .
germany provided crews to man nato planes that flew surveillance flights near turkey 's southern border which were meant to protect turkey against an iraqi attack during the us-led invasion .

the court ruled that there was a real possibility german military personnel could have been drawn into a conflict .
the court equated the flights with " armed deployment " which needs parliamentary approval .
" it is important that the responsibility for the deployment of armed troops remains in the hands of the representative body of the people , " i.e. parliament , the judges said in the ruling .
fdp head guido westerwelle hailed the constitutional court ruling as " historic , " saying that it would keep the german army under parliamentary control and prevent it from being turned into a tool of the government .

parliament always has the final say in foreign troop deployments , the court said . the german government erred in getting involved in the lead-up to the iraq war without parliamentary approval , according to a wednesday , may 7 decision from germany 's highest court .
the german center-left government under then-chancellor gerhard schroeder should have gotten prior approval from the bundestag , germany 's lower house of parliament , before taking part in a surveillance mission to turkey in 2003 , the court ruled .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de in focus : biofuels : are they doing more harm than good ?
merkel calls on brazil to make biofuel production sustainable german minister calls for reversal of eu agricultural policy as biofuels fall from grace , a new generation grabs spotlight illegal logging gives eu massive eco-headache energy -pipe- 07.05.2008 germany defends biofuels , hedges bets on energy goals großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : fuel or food ?
the german government rejected claims tuesday that fuel crops were causing a worldwide spike in food prices .
berlin plans to announce a plan for easing the world food crisis by july , agriculture minister seehofer said . germany can not reach its climate change goals unless it dedicates land to growing biofuels , germany 's agriculture minister horst seehofer said after talks in berlin on tuesday , may 6 .
seehofer defended biofuels against growing criticism that they are responsible for food prices increasing globally , which has caused rioting and hunger in developing countries .
" there would also be hunger without biofuel , " seehofer said , who promised that the government would announce this summer what it will do to help ease the global food crisis .
in many countries , the hunger crisis is caused by population increases and the increasing demand for food in developing and emerging countries , said seehofer .
ethanol under scrutiny only 2 percent of cropland worldwide was being used to produce ethanol , a popular biofuel often made from corn , seehofer said .
ethanol has come under heavy criticism recently and which forms an important part of germany 's biofuel targets .
many farmers are switching from growing corn and wheat for food to instead focus on producing biofuel crops .
environment minister sigmar gabriel also promised tuesday that germany will stick to its biofuel strategy , which calls for increasing reliance on plant fuels by 2020 .
gabriel acknowledged that the government 's goal of having 17 percent of energy come from biofuel by 2020 might be overly optimistic and said the german parliament will decide in the near future whether to hold to a 2009 goal of having biofuel make up 6.25 percent of overall fuel consumption .
call for relaxed meat restrictions in a time of increasing prices for all types of food , seehofer said the german government will seek to increase meat production by pushing through rule changes to allow ground-up animal remains can be fed to pigs and poultry .
eight years ago the european union banned the use of ground-up animal carcasses as cheap feed after determining that cattle were catching bovine spongiform encephalopathy -lrb- bse -rrb- from eating brains of dead cows .

merkel calls on brazil to make biofuel production sustainable german minister calls for reversal of eu agricultural policy as biofuels fall from grace , a new generation grabs spotlight illegal logging gives eu massive eco-headache energy -pipe- 07.05.2008 germany defends biofuels , hedges bets on energy goals großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : fuel or food ?
the german government rejected claims tuesday that fuel crops were causing a worldwide spike in food prices .
berlin plans to announce a plan for easing the world food crisis by july , agriculture minister seehofer said . germany can not reach its climate change goals unless it dedicates land to growing biofuels , germany 's agriculture minister horst seehofer said after talks in berlin on tuesday , may 6 .
seehofer defended biofuels against growing criticism that they are responsible for food prices increasing globally , which has caused rioting and hunger in developing countries .
" there would also be hunger without biofuel , " seehofer said , who promised that the government would announce this summer what it will do to help ease the global food crisis .
in many countries , the hunger crisis is caused by population increases and the increasing demand for food in developing and emerging countries , said seehofer .
ethanol under scrutiny only 2 percent of cropland worldwide was being used to produce ethanol , a popular biofuel often made from corn , seehofer said .
ethanol has come under heavy criticism recently and which forms an important part of germany 's biofuel targets .
many farmers are switching from growing corn and wheat for food to instead focus on producing biofuel crops .
environment minister sigmar gabriel also promised tuesday that germany will stick to its biofuel strategy , which calls for increasing reliance on plant fuels by 2020 .
gabriel acknowledged that the government 's goal of having 17 percent of energy come from biofuel by 2020 might be overly optimistic and said the german parliament will decide in the near future whether to hold to a 2009 goal of having biofuel make up 6.25 percent of overall fuel consumption .
call for relaxed meat restrictions in a time of increasing prices for all types of food , seehofer said the german government will seek to increase meat production by pushing through rule changes to allow ground-up animal remains can be fed to pigs and poultry .
eight years ago the european union banned the use of ground-up animal carcasses as cheap feed after determining that cattle were catching bovine spongiform encephalopathy -lrb- bse -rrb- from eating brains of dead cows .
in april the eu relaxed rules on feeding fishmeal to calves and lambs . dw staff -lrb- th -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the german government rejected claims tuesday that fuel crops were causing a worldwide spike in food prices .
berlin plans to announce a plan for easing the world food crisis by july , agriculture minister seehofer said . germany can not reach its climate change goals unless it dedicates land to growing biofuels , germany 's agriculture minister horst seehofer said after talks in berlin on tuesday , may 6 .
seehofer defended biofuels against growing criticism that they are responsible for food prices increasing globally , which has caused rioting and hunger in developing countries .
" there would also be hunger without biofuel , " seehofer said , who promised that the government would announce this summer what it will do to help ease the global food crisis .
in many countries , the hunger crisis is caused by population increases and the increasing demand for food in developing and emerging countries , said seehofer .
ethanol under scrutiny only 2 percent of cropland worldwide was being used to produce ethanol , a popular biofuel often made from corn , seehofer said .
ethanol has come under heavy criticism recently and which forms an important part of germany 's biofuel targets .
many farmers are switching from growing corn and wheat for food to instead focus on producing biofuel crops .
environment minister sigmar gabriel also promised tuesday that germany will stick to its biofuel strategy , which calls for increasing reliance on plant fuels by 2020 .
gabriel acknowledged that the government 's goal of having 17 percent of energy come from biofuel by 2020 might be overly optimistic and said the german parliament will decide in the near future whether to hold to a 2009 goal of having biofuel make up 6.25 percent of overall fuel consumption .
call for relaxed meat restrictions in a time of increasing prices for all types of food , seehofer said the german government will seek to increase meat production by pushing through rule changes to allow ground-up animal remains can be fed to pigs and poultry .
eight years ago the european union banned the use of ground-up animal carcasses as cheap feed after determining that cattle were catching bovine spongiform encephalopathy -lrb- bse -rrb- from eating brains of dead cows .

experts say the fallout from the affair may actually have led to a shift towards cleaner business practices . the ancient proverb that “ a fish always stinks from the head down ” can be easily applied to the latest scandals that have been sweeping big , blue chip german companies in the last few years , denting the reputation of munich-based siemens ag in particular . ever since the global slush fund scandal that involved payoffs for huge foreign contracts broke in 2006 , bribery revelations at europe ’ s largest industrial conglomerate have reached an estimated 1.3 billion euros -lrb- about $ 2 billion -rrb- . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : former ceo klaus kleinfeld was forced to resign last year the scandal , which is the biggest ever in germany ’ s corporate history , has not only brought shame to siemens , but within the past year , the entire top management team has been purged .
even though ex-ceo klaus kleinfeld had presided over a period of record profits and was never personally implicated in the scandal , he was forced to resign after losing the board ’ s vote of confidence last year and replaced by peter löscher , an outsider . former supervisory board chairman heinrich von pierer , who had also been kleinfeld ’ s predecessor , had been so highly regarded among germany ’ s business elite that chancellor angela merkel had even tapped him to become technology advisor , an offer that was recently withdrawn . since siemens is also listed on the new york stock exchange , the sec , the us watchdog agency , has also been on the company ’ s heels to comply with anti-corruption regulations . " a fresh start " “ siemens is under tremendous pressure from the sec , but you can not stop the cleaning up process once you ’ ve started it .
just like you can not be half-pregnant , ” said caspar von hauenschild , a board member of transparency international germany , an anti-corruption agency in berlin . von hauenschild said that siemens has done everything possible to clean up its act , but can not afford any more major scandals . “ löscher is giving siemens a fresh start .
the corporate culture against bribes is changing .
what is amazing is that von pierer and kleinfeld didn ’ t regard bribes as a company or personal risk that cost them their jobs , ” he said , adding that the top managers had let the scandal spiral out of control by leaving it up to their underlings to sort out conflicts abroad . “ a chief executive is responsible for implementing codes of conduct - meaning zero tolerance for corruption , ” said von hauenschild . changing rules of the game since the late 1990s the rules of the game on corrupt business practices had started to change dramatically with government crackdowns on fraud and bribery . part of the problem was that bribes involving foreign contracts were not only lawful , but even tax deductible in germany as late as 1999 . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : siemens did what others do , except on a much bigger scale furthermore , cash payments to mediators or foreign officials in exchange for lucrative contracts that amounted to billions of dollars has been always been common business practice , especially in developing countries where corruption is rife , according to frank rothauge , a long time siemens analyst at the private cologne banking house sal .
oppenheim . “ one needs to understand the mind-set back in the 1990s , ” said rothauge . “ paying someone to get a foot in an emerging market with many competitors was regarded as a small price to pay in exchange for a huge contract that made a big contribution to company profits .
it was the nature of the beast to provide such incentives , ” he said . siemens did what most multinationals do , except on a much bigger scale , added rothauge . “ ideally , transparency in competing for orders based on quality , price and innovation is better for everyone , but the reality is different , ” he said , explaining that telecommunications companies such as nokia and ericsson that refuse to accept bribes are often at a competitive disadvantage since they lose out on major contracts in spite of a superior product . german firms not affected rothauge added that siemens ’ image has been hurt , but not too badly .
the scandal has no real impact on the reputation of other german companies either , he added . “ at the end of the day , most business people know that other companies work in the same way .
german companies are no worse off than the more honorable scandinavians , ” he added . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : new ceo peter loescher has a tough task of cleaning up the mess but just because everyone does it , doesn ’ t make bribery right , according to daniela bergdolt if dsw , which represents small investors of siemens ag . “ siemens had a fantastic reputation and it is the market leader in so many areas , such as medical technology .
there was no need to resort to bribery , ” she said . “ the ability to attract customers should be based on being good enough to be competitive , ” added bergdolt , who said that a complete management shake-up was not enough at siemens and that the corporate system of illicit bribes has to change from the top down . easier said than done changing such a corporate culture is easier said than done , according to marcus lutter , a law professor and expert on corporate governance at the university of bonn , who explained that when the rules to stamp out corruption suddenly changed in 1999 , many companies , not just siemens , had a hard time adjusting to a new , cleaner corporate environment . “ it is like telling a chain smoker ‘ starting tomorrow you are not allowed to smoke anymore . ’
it is tough to quit a bad habit .
some people are still going to look for some small corner in a garden to steal a puff , ” he said . lutter also pointed out that the common german corporate practice of chief executives moving upstairs to the supervisory board , as von pierer did , presented problems of its own at siemens .
“ this was clearly a conflict .
kleinfeld could not be fully independent in his decision making with a former ceo looking over his shoulder , ” he said . the conflict meant that both had to go , according to bergdolt , who agrees that siemens is finally on the right course now with a brand new management team . “ its image has even been somewhat restored now , but it has taken an awfully long time to get on the right course , ” she said . diana fong send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

mistakes can be made .
but what happens when somebody ’ s name is wrongly added to such a list ? after the attacks on the united states on september 11 , 2001 , the fight against islamic terrorists started in earnest .
lists of suspects , like those championed by the us and the united nations , led the way in tracking down potential threats .
terror lists contain data on persons and organizations suspected of supporting , financing or even being terrorists .
but not all the information the lists contain can be trusted as accurate and sometimes the wrong information finds its way onto the list .
this is what happened to nabil sayadi .
sayadi lives in the quiet belgian town of putte , south of antwerp .
he describes the rural idyll with its apple blossoms and content chickens as his private island .
away from the pleasant surroundings of putte , sayadi faces the distrustful looks and probing questions of friends and colleagues .
this has been his life outside putte ever since the united nations put his and the name of his wife on its list of terrorist suspects .
for five years , the muslim couple have been suspected of being al qaeda sympathizers , helping to finance the organization 's jihad behind the facade of a charitable organization , secours mondial .
names remain on terror list despite court clearances for sayadi , the accusation is incredible .
his organization has been recognized as authentic after being probed by the belgian government before its charitable status was approved .
" we even had a certificate from the minister of finance and can show donation receipts , " sayadi said .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the belgian government allowed the un to take names despite all the controls which have been observed before and after the organization was set up , and despite its involvement at many levels of these processes , the belgian government allowed sayadi and his wife patricia vinck to be put on the un list .
to this day , they have yet to receive any explanation as to why .
nabil sayadi is still labeled a terrorist despite being proved innocent a number of times in separate court cases throughout the belgian legal system .
this is something georges-henri beauthier , the family 's belgian lawyer , can confirm .
" there was nothing one could accuse them of , " beauthier said .
" there was no proof . "
the lawyer also explained that one civil court even ruled that the names of sayadi and his wife should be removed from the list .
but this has still not happened which is why the family is now five years into a lawsuit against the belgian state .
family imprisoned in belgium by red tape it is not only the parents which suffer .
sayadi and his wife have four children .
all of them have had their rights curtailed as a result of the terror list with the family name on it .
they can not leave the country ; the police hold their passports and the bank accounts of the family have been closed .
nabil sayadi is a dental technician but he no longer goes to work .
his last employer fired him when the terrorist list became public knowledge .
now no-one will employ him .
today , the family survives on child benefit and the mother 's invalid pension .
in total , their budget per month is a mere 1500 euros -lsb- $ 2,338 -rsb- , almost half of which goes on rent .
" we pray that nothing happens to any of us which would costs a lot of money , " said patricia vinck .
" if there is an urgent doctor 's visit or a car accident or a school excursion which we must suddenly pay for , then we must run up debts . "
case to go to the european court of justice together with his lawyer , nabil sayadi is locked in a battle for the freedom of his family .
he has submitted a complaint to the united nations .
since the names of the belgians can only be wiped off the list with a unanimous decision from the security council , and united states has so far blocked this , sayadi hopes for the support of the european court of justice in luxembourg .
while any decision in favor of sayadi and his wife by the court would have no judicial effect over the united nations , it could have a symbolic effect .
at least this is what georges-henri beauthier hopes .
" the advocate general in luxembourg has already said that these lists infringe on human rights , " the lawyer said .
only when this assertion is confirmed by a judgment , can the terror lists be finally abolished .
until then , the sayadis must wait to see if something , finally , changes and that they can lead a normal life again . ruth reichstein -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

mistakes can be made .
but what happens when somebody ’ s name is wrongly added to such a list ? after the attacks on the united states on september 11 , 2001 , the fight against islamic terrorists started in earnest .
lists of suspects , like those championed by the us and the united nations , led the way in tracking down potential threats .
terror lists contain data on persons and organizations suspected of supporting , financing or even being terrorists .
but not all the information the lists contain can be trusted as accurate and sometimes the wrong information finds its way onto the list .
this is what happened to nabil sayadi .
sayadi lives in the quiet belgian town of putte , south of antwerp .
he describes the rural idyll with its apple blossoms and content chickens as his private island .
away from the pleasant surroundings of putte , sayadi faces the distrustful looks and probing questions of friends and colleagues .
this has been his life outside putte ever since the united nations put his and the name of his wife on its list of terrorist suspects .
for five years , the muslim couple have been suspected of being al qaeda sympathizers , helping to finance the organization 's jihad behind the facade of a charitable organization , secours mondial .
names remain on terror list despite court clearances for sayadi , the accusation is incredible .
his organization has been recognized as authentic after being probed by the belgian government before its charitable status was approved .
" we even had a certificate from the minister of finance and can show donation receipts , " sayadi said .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the belgian government allowed the un to take names despite all the controls which have been observed before and after the organization was set up , and despite its involvement at many levels of these processes , the belgian government allowed sayadi and his wife patricia vinck to be put on the un list .
to this day , they have yet to receive any explanation as to why .
nabil sayadi is still labeled a terrorist despite being proved innocent a number of times in separate court cases throughout the belgian legal system .
this is something georges-henri beauthier , the family 's belgian lawyer , can confirm .
" there was nothing one could accuse them of , " beauthier said .
" there was no proof . "
the lawyer also explained that one civil court even ruled that the names of sayadi and his wife should be removed from the list .

mistakes can be made .
but what happens when somebody ’ s name is wrongly added to such a list ? after the attacks on the united states on september 11 , 2001 , the fight against islamic terrorists started in earnest .
lists of suspects , like those championed by the us and the united nations , led the way in tracking down potential threats .
terror lists contain data on persons and organizations suspected of supporting , financing or even being terrorists .
but not all the information the lists contain can be trusted as accurate and sometimes the wrong information finds its way onto the list .
this is what happened to nabil sayadi .
sayadi lives in the quiet belgian town of putte , south of antwerp .
he describes the rural idyll with its apple blossoms and content chickens as his private island .
away from the pleasant surroundings of putte , sayadi faces the distrustful looks and probing questions of friends and colleagues .
this has been his life outside putte ever since the united nations put his and the name of his wife on its list of terrorist suspects .
for five years , the muslim couple have been suspected of being al qaeda sympathizers , helping to finance the organization 's jihad behind the facade of a charitable organization , secours mondial .
names remain on terror list despite court clearances for sayadi , the accusation is incredible .
his organization has been recognized as authentic after being probed by the belgian government before its charitable status was approved .
" we even had a certificate from the minister of finance and can show donation receipts , " sayadi said .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the belgian government allowed the un to take names despite all the controls which have been observed before and after the organization was set up , and despite its involvement at many levels of these processes , the belgian government allowed sayadi and his wife patricia vinck to be put on the un list .
to this day , they have yet to receive any explanation as to why .
nabil sayadi is still labeled a terrorist despite being proved innocent a number of times in separate court cases throughout the belgian legal system .
this is something georges-henri beauthier , the family 's belgian lawyer , can confirm .
" there was nothing one could accuse them of , " beauthier said .
" there was no proof . "
the lawyer also explained that one civil court even ruled that the names of sayadi and his wife should be removed from the list .
but this has still not happened which is why the family is now five years into a lawsuit against the belgian state .
family imprisoned in belgium by red tape it is not only the parents which suffer .
sayadi and his wife have four children .
all of them have had their rights curtailed as a result of the terror list with the family name on it .
they can not leave the country ; the police hold their passports and the bank accounts of the family have been closed .
nabil sayadi is a dental technician but he no longer goes to work .
his last employer fired him when the terrorist list became public knowledge .
now no-one will employ him .
today , the family survives on child benefit and the mother 's invalid pension .
in total , their budget per month is a mere 1500 euros -lsb- $ 2,338 -rsb- , almost half of which goes on rent .
" we pray that nothing happens to any of us which would costs a lot of money , " said patricia vinck .
" if there is an urgent doctor 's visit or a car accident or a school excursion which we must suddenly pay for , then we must run up debts . "
case to go to the european court of justice together with his lawyer , nabil sayadi is locked in a battle for the freedom of his family .
he has submitted a complaint to the united nations .
since the names of the belgians can only be wiped off the list with a unanimous decision from the security council , and united states has so far blocked this , sayadi hopes for the support of the european court of justice in luxembourg .
while any decision in favor of sayadi and his wife by the court would have no judicial effect over the united nations , it could have a symbolic effect .
at least this is what georges-henri beauthier hopes .
" the advocate general in luxembourg has already said that these lists infringe on human rights , " the lawyer said .
only when this assertion is confirmed by a judgment , can the terror lists be finally abolished .
until then , the sayadis must wait to see if something , finally , changes and that they can lead a normal life again . ruth reichstein -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

but it may just be another expression of business as usual in a russia dominated by his mentor , outgoing president vladimir putin .
medvedev knows what rights are due to him as russian president .
the question is whether he will be able to emerge from putin 's shadow .
observers predict the two men will run the country as a sort of " dual power . "
however , medvedev position as the highest power in russia may only be formal .
but they are skeptical about whether the 42-year-old will truly be top dog once putin 's eight years as president come to an end . shortly after the young politician and kremlin chief was - with putin 's backing - handily elected in march , putin arranged to have himself designated prime minister . a new , weakened presidency may be the result .
as prime minister and head of united russia , which holds a two-thirds majority in russia 's parliament , putin will have the power to block presidential decrees and table constitutional amendments - in effect to control the presidency .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de asia -pipe- 07.05.2008 despite disaster , a glimmer of hope for burma 's future großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : opening up to foreign aid could herald a change in burma as western groups urge burma 's military regime to remove red tape delaying a large international aid operation , dw-world.de spoke with an expert about whether the tragedy could result in positive change in burma . with large swathes of the irrawaddy delta under water , an estimated one million people are in dire need of shelter , water , medicine and food . international groups and governments around the world are pressuring burma 's military regime to allow unrestricted access to aid workers to get in emergency supplies .
dw-world.de spoke with marco bünte , an expert on burma at the global institute of global and area studies in hamburg . after the cylone that has killed more than 22,000 people and left hundreds of thousands homeless , burma 's military rulers have appealed to the west for help .
what do you make of this unusual move ?
it shows that the military regime does not have the means to offer help and aid swiftly and on such a huge scale .
the state and the authorities are too weak to deliver aid after this huge humanitarian catastrophe .
some 24 million people live in the irrawady region , which was hit by the cyclone .
large areas still remain inaccessible .
that explains why the regime is appealing to foreign countries for help .
usually the burmese state is very proud that it makes its own decisions and does n't have to rely on outside help .
that was the case during the tsunami in 2004 when they refused foreign aid . do you think the move to ask for foreign aid will open the door to more international contact ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : cyclone nargis ripped through burma 's main city , yangon that 's a possibility .
but it 's difficult to say right now because many aid organizations are complaining about a lack of cooperation with the authorities in burma .
questions also remain about whether these foreign aid groups will stay in the country in the long-term or whether they will only provide emergency aid for immediate needs such as food and drinking water .
we need to be critical about how the military regime deals with international aid groups .
after all , the regime is n't allowing immediate access to all affected areas , but rather it continues to impose restrictions on the organizations .
why is that ?
is the military regime worried about ceding some of its control ?
yes , of course .
it 's the result of politics that the burmese regime has pursued for many years - the leaders remain extremely mistrustful of any foreign agencies , in particular those from the west .
they 're afraid these foreign groups could become politically active or bring in ideas that could lead to changes or unrest .
their policy has always been to remain open to aid but only under very stringent and restrictive conditions .
that 's why it 's very significant if the regime does actually open the door a bit further to let in more international aid groups .
despite international criticism , burma 's military junta seems determined to go ahead with a controversial referendum on the new constitution which would further cement the military 's power .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : burma 's military generals have a firm grip on power the burmese military has already announced that with the exception of 47 of the worst affected regions where the vote will be postponed , the planned referendum will go ahead .
in the past weeks , the regime has made several efforts to ensure that the referendum results in a positive outcome .
they have unleashed a propaganda campaign to urge people to accept the constitution .
soldiers have been deployed in towns and villages to secure the vote .
the military regime is doing everything it can to ensure that it gets a vote in favor of the new constitution and is thus not prepared to postpone it .
there have been some reports of rising anger among the population towards the government for failing to warn people about the cyclone and a lack of help in the crisis .
is there potential for a protest movement ?
there 's definitely potential for protests in the face of the fragile social situation in many regions and the glaring failure of the military government to provide basic help .
but it 's difficult to say whether the resentment and dissatisfaction with the government is strong enough to actually lead to social unrest or protests .
sometimes you need just a single matchstick to light a fire of protest and sometimes it takes longer .
in the past months , food prices and the cost of basic amenities has shot up and led to strong disaffection among the people .
last autumn , anger against rising prices as well as violence against monks spilled over into street protests .
this time , the same has n't happened and at the moment it 's difficult to say because we do n't know exactly what the situation is like .
it 's also possible that in the end people in burma will end up increasingly focusing on securing their food supplies and repairing their homes and limit themselves to the absolute necessities rather than turning on the government .
at the same time , the military regime remains inscrutable - we do n't know for sure whether there are disgruntled members in the military who are also unhappy with the situation in the country .
however , the crushing of mass protests last autumn and the stability and unity of the military regime shows it still has an iron grip on the country .
at the moment there are no signs of dissent or divisions within the ranks .
the eu and the us have offered burma humanitarian relief and aid .
is there any way the tragedy could bring about positive change to burma ?
it would be nice but for that the military regime would have to give up its resistance and open the door to all western organizations .
that 's exactly what the us is demanding by linking its offer of help to access .
however , i doubt whether the military is willing to give that kind of access to aid groups because it fears it will then lose some of its control on a regional and local level .
i do n't think the crisis will lead to a real opening up of the country .
at the same time , there is a possibility that the tense relationship between burma and the international community will be eased somewhat and that cooperation might work better .
it 's also possible that letting in foreign aid will also help burma gradually let go of the fears it harbors towards western agencies and may result in more freedom to travel .
but these are all small changes .
they do not include any far-reaching political change .
what can the west do to further help the people of burma ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the cyclone has ravaged the lives of thousands of burmese i 've always believed that the west has to rethink its sanctions on burma .
that 's because the sanctions also block aid from the world bank and other international organizations .
all the sanctions allow are small projects within the framework of humanitarian relief .

sarkozy now believes blair 's involvement in the iraq war had damaged his standing among eu fellow members - a view long held my other countries , including germany .
according to the bbc , sources close to the president have indicated that sarkozy felt blair was not right for the role because britain has failed to adopt the euro and the schengen zone of passport-free travel .
france key to presidential selection the selection of the eu 's first permanent president has the political establishment buzzing with speculation .
the new post was created by the lisbon treaty , which assuming it is ratified by all 27 eu member states , will take effect on jan .
1 , 2009 .
the new permanent eu president is envisioned as a high-profile post which will be the face of europe abroad .
the president would prepare and chair the bloc 's summits of national leaders and preside over the european council of member governments .
the presidency job is currently rotated every six months between the bloc 's heads of state .
france will take over the eu presidency in july for the rest of 2008 and it will be influential in negotiations on the new power-sharing arrangements at the bloc 's institutions in brussels .
blair down , but not out while european socialists are in particular opposed to blair becoming eu president , he has not been totally excluded either , a source close to the french presidency told the news agency afp earlier this week .
" the english should n't be ostracized .
it would be a big mistake to think that just because great britain is euroskeptic they should n't get any posts , " the french source told afp .
besides blair , a handful of other european heavyweights are seen as frontrunners .
luxembourg 's prime minister jean-claude junker is often tipped as the next president along with former austrian premier wolfgang schuessel and danish prime minister ander fogh rasmussen .

merkel calls on brazil to make biofuel production sustainable german minister calls for reversal of eu agricultural policy as biofuels fall from grace , a new generation grabs spotlight illegal logging gives eu massive eco-headache energy -pipe- 07.05.2008 germany defends biofuels , hedges bets on energy goals großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : fuel or food ?
the german government rejected claims tuesday that fuel crops were causing a worldwide spike in food prices .
berlin plans to announce a plan for easing the world food crisis by july , agriculture minister seehofer said . germany can not reach its climate change goals unless it dedicates land to growing biofuels , germany 's agriculture minister horst seehofer said after talks in berlin on tuesday , may 6 .
seehofer defended biofuels against growing criticism that they are responsible for food prices increasing globally , which has caused rioting and hunger in developing countries .
" there would also be hunger without biofuel , " seehofer said , who promised that the government would announce this summer what it will do to help ease the global food crisis .
in many countries , the hunger crisis is caused by population increases and the increasing demand for food in developing and emerging countries , said seehofer .
ethanol under scrutiny only 2 percent of cropland worldwide was being used to produce ethanol , a popular biofuel often made from corn , seehofer said .
ethanol has come under heavy criticism recently and which forms an important part of germany 's biofuel targets .
many farmers are switching from growing corn and wheat for food to instead focus on producing biofuel crops .
environment minister sigmar gabriel also promised tuesday that germany will stick to its biofuel strategy , which calls for increasing reliance on plant fuels by 2020 .
gabriel acknowledged that the government 's goal of having 17 percent of energy come from biofuel by 2020 might be overly optimistic and said the german parliament will decide in the near future whether to hold to a 2009 goal of having biofuel make up 6.25 percent of overall fuel consumption .
call for relaxed meat restrictions in a time of increasing prices for all types of food , seehofer said the german government will seek to increase meat production by pushing through rule changes to allow ground-up animal remains can be fed to pigs and poultry .
eight years ago the european union banned the use of ground-up animal carcasses as cheap feed after determining that cattle were catching bovine spongiform encephalopathy -lrb- bse -rrb- from eating brains of dead cows .

mistakes can be made .
but what happens when somebody ’ s name is wrongly added to such a list ? after the attacks on the united states on september 11 , 2001 , the fight against islamic terrorists started in earnest .
lists of suspects , like those championed by the us and the united nations , led the way in tracking down potential threats .
terror lists contain data on persons and organizations suspected of supporting , financing or even being terrorists .
but not all the information the lists contain can be trusted as accurate and sometimes the wrong information finds its way onto the list .
this is what happened to nabil sayadi .
sayadi lives in the quiet belgian town of putte , south of antwerp .
he describes the rural idyll with its apple blossoms and content chickens as his private island .
away from the pleasant surroundings of putte , sayadi faces the distrustful looks and probing questions of friends and colleagues .
this has been his life outside putte ever since the united nations put his and the name of his wife on its list of terrorist suspects .
for five years , the muslim couple have been suspected of being al qaeda sympathizers , helping to finance the organization 's jihad behind the facade of a charitable organization , secours mondial .
names remain on terror list despite court clearances for sayadi , the accusation is incredible .
his organization has been recognized as authentic after being probed by the belgian government before its charitable status was approved .
" we even had a certificate from the minister of finance and can show donation receipts , " sayadi said .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the belgian government allowed the un to take names despite all the controls which have been observed before and after the organization was set up , and despite its involvement at many levels of these processes , the belgian government allowed sayadi and his wife patricia vinck to be put on the un list .
to this day , they have yet to receive any explanation as to why .
nabil sayadi is still labeled a terrorist despite being proved innocent a number of times in separate court cases throughout the belgian legal system .
this is something georges-henri beauthier , the family 's belgian lawyer , can confirm .
" there was nothing one could accuse them of , " beauthier said .
" there was no proof . "
the lawyer also explained that one civil court even ruled that the names of sayadi and his wife should be removed from the list .
but this has still not happened which is why the family is now five years into a lawsuit against the belgian state .
family imprisoned in belgium by red tape it is not only the parents which suffer .
sayadi and his wife have four children .
all of them have had their rights curtailed as a result of the terror list with the family name on it .
they can not leave the country ; the police hold their passports and the bank accounts of the family have been closed .
nabil sayadi is a dental technician but he no longer goes to work .
his last employer fired him when the terrorist list became public knowledge .
now no-one will employ him .
today , the family survives on child benefit and the mother 's invalid pension .
in total , their budget per month is a mere 1500 euros -lsb- $ 2,338 -rsb- , almost half of which goes on rent .
" we pray that nothing happens to any of us which would costs a lot of money , " said patricia vinck .
" if there is an urgent doctor 's visit or a car accident or a school excursion which we must suddenly pay for , then we must run up debts . "
case to go to the european court of justice together with his lawyer , nabil sayadi is locked in a battle for the freedom of his family .
he has submitted a complaint to the united nations .
since the names of the belgians can only be wiped off the list with a unanimous decision from the security council , and united states has so far blocked this , sayadi hopes for the support of the european court of justice in luxembourg .
while any decision in favor of sayadi and his wife by the court would have no judicial effect over the united nations , it could have a symbolic effect .
at least this is what georges-henri beauthier hopes .
" the advocate general in luxembourg has already said that these lists infringe on human rights , " the lawyer said .
only when this assertion is confirmed by a judgment , can the terror lists be finally abolished .
until then , the sayadis must wait to see if something , finally , changes and that they can lead a normal life again . ruth reichstein -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the belgian government allowed the un to take names despite all the controls which have been observed before and after the organization was set up , and despite its involvement at many levels of these processes , the belgian government allowed sayadi and his wife patricia vinck to be put on the un list .
to this day , they have yet to receive any explanation as to why .
nabil sayadi is still labeled a terrorist despite being proved innocent a number of times in separate court cases throughout the belgian legal system .
this is something georges-henri beauthier , the family 's belgian lawyer , can confirm .
" there was nothing one could accuse them of , " beauthier said .
" there was no proof . "
the lawyer also explained that one civil court even ruled that the names of sayadi and his wife should be removed from the list .
but this has still not happened which is why the family is now five years into a lawsuit against the belgian state .
family imprisoned in belgium by red tape it is not only the parents which suffer .
sayadi and his wife have four children .
all of them have had their rights curtailed as a result of the terror list with the family name on it .
they can not leave the country ; the police hold their passports and the bank accounts of the family have been closed .
nabil sayadi is a dental technician but he no longer goes to work .
his last employer fired him when the terrorist list became public knowledge .
now no-one will employ him .
today , the family survives on child benefit and the mother 's invalid pension .
in total , their budget per month is a mere 1500 euros -lsb- $ 2,338 -rsb- , almost half of which goes on rent .
" we pray that nothing happens to any of us which would costs a lot of money , " said patricia vinck .
" if there is an urgent doctor 's visit or a car accident or a school excursion which we must suddenly pay for , then we must run up debts . "
case to go to the european court of justice together with his lawyer , nabil sayadi is locked in a battle for the freedom of his family .
he has submitted a complaint to the united nations .
since the names of the belgians can only be wiped off the list with a unanimous decision from the security council , and united states has so far blocked this , sayadi hopes for the support of the european court of justice in luxembourg .
while any decision in favor of sayadi and his wife by the court would have no judicial effect over the united nations , it could have a symbolic effect .
at least this is what georges-henri beauthier hopes .
" the advocate general in luxembourg has already said that these lists infringe on human rights , " the lawyer said .
only when this assertion is confirmed by a judgment , can the terror lists be finally abolished .
until then , the sayadis must wait to see if something , finally , changes and that they can lead a normal life again . ruth reichstein -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

these account for approximately 65 percent of all cases of hiv in germany . germany 's hiv infection rate has increased steadily since 2001 , a phenomenon that could be partially attributed to early diagnosis and a larger number of people being tested for hiv . a simultaneous increase in syphilis cases joerg hacker , president of the robert koch institute , also offered another reason for the increase . " one of the little-known reasons for this increase is the high number of syphilis infections in germany , " hacker said .
germany has seen a rise in syphilis cases each year since 2004 .
researchers at the robert koch institute say that those infected simultaneously with syphilis and hiv are more infectious . around 59,000 people in germany are infected with the virus that leads to aids .

mistakes can be made .
but what happens when somebody ’ s name is wrongly added to such a list ? after the attacks on the united states on september 11 , 2001 , the fight against islamic terrorists started in earnest .
lists of suspects , like those championed by the us and the united nations , led the way in tracking down potential threats .
terror lists contain data on persons and organizations suspected of supporting , financing or even being terrorists .
but not all the information the lists contain can be trusted as accurate and sometimes the wrong information finds its way onto the list .
this is what happened to nabil sayadi .
sayadi lives in the quiet belgian town of putte , south of antwerp .
he describes the rural idyll with its apple blossoms and content chickens as his private island .
away from the pleasant surroundings of putte , sayadi faces the distrustful looks and probing questions of friends and colleagues .
this has been his life outside putte ever since the united nations put his and the name of his wife on its list of terrorist suspects .
for five years , the muslim couple have been suspected of being al qaeda sympathizers , helping to finance the organization 's jihad behind the facade of a charitable organization , secours mondial .
names remain on terror list despite court clearances for sayadi , the accusation is incredible .
his organization has been recognized as authentic after being probed by the belgian government before its charitable status was approved .
" we even had a certificate from the minister of finance and can show donation receipts , " sayadi said .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the belgian government allowed the un to take names despite all the controls which have been observed before and after the organization was set up , and despite its involvement at many levels of these processes , the belgian government allowed sayadi and his wife patricia vinck to be put on the un list .
to this day , they have yet to receive any explanation as to why .
nabil sayadi is still labeled a terrorist despite being proved innocent a number of times in separate court cases throughout the belgian legal system .
this is something georges-henri beauthier , the family 's belgian lawyer , can confirm .
" there was nothing one could accuse them of , " beauthier said .
" there was no proof . "
the lawyer also explained that one civil court even ruled that the names of sayadi and his wife should be removed from the list .
but this has still not happened which is why the family is now five years into a lawsuit against the belgian state .
family imprisoned in belgium by red tape it is not only the parents which suffer .
sayadi and his wife have four children .
all of them have had their rights curtailed as a result of the terror list with the family name on it .
they can not leave the country ; the police hold their passports and the bank accounts of the family have been closed .
nabil sayadi is a dental technician but he no longer goes to work .
his last employer fired him when the terrorist list became public knowledge .
now no-one will employ him .
today , the family survives on child benefit and the mother 's invalid pension .
in total , their budget per month is a mere 1500 euros -lsb- $ 2,338 -rsb- , almost half of which goes on rent .
" we pray that nothing happens to any of us which would costs a lot of money , " said patricia vinck .
" if there is an urgent doctor 's visit or a car accident or a school excursion which we must suddenly pay for , then we must run up debts . "
case to go to the european court of justice together with his lawyer , nabil sayadi is locked in a battle for the freedom of his family .
he has submitted a complaint to the united nations .
since the names of the belgians can only be wiped off the list with a unanimous decision from the security council , and united states has so far blocked this , sayadi hopes for the support of the european court of justice in luxembourg .
while any decision in favor of sayadi and his wife by the court would have no judicial effect over the united nations , it could have a symbolic effect .
at least this is what georges-henri beauthier hopes .
" the advocate general in luxembourg has already said that these lists infringe on human rights , " the lawyer said .
only when this assertion is confirmed by a judgment , can the terror lists be finally abolished .
until then , the sayadis must wait to see if something , finally , changes and that they can lead a normal life again . ruth reichstein -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

experts say the fallout from the affair may actually have led to a shift towards cleaner business practices . the ancient proverb that “ a fish always stinks from the head down ” can be easily applied to the latest scandals that have been sweeping big , blue chip german companies in the last few years , denting the reputation of munich-based siemens ag in particular . ever since the global slush fund scandal that involved payoffs for huge foreign contracts broke in 2006 , bribery revelations at europe ’ s largest industrial conglomerate have reached an estimated 1.3 billion euros -lrb- about $ 2 billion -rrb- . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : former ceo klaus kleinfeld was forced to resign last year the scandal , which is the biggest ever in germany ’ s corporate history , has not only brought shame to siemens , but within the past year , the entire top management team has been purged .
even though ex-ceo klaus kleinfeld had presided over a period of record profits and was never personally implicated in the scandal , he was forced to resign after losing the board ’ s vote of confidence last year and replaced by peter löscher , an outsider . former supervisory board chairman heinrich von pierer , who had also been kleinfeld ’ s predecessor , had been so highly regarded among germany ’ s business elite that chancellor angela merkel had even tapped him to become technology advisor , an offer that was recently withdrawn . since siemens is also listed on the new york stock exchange , the sec , the us watchdog agency , has also been on the company ’ s heels to comply with anti-corruption regulations . " a fresh start " “ siemens is under tremendous pressure from the sec , but you can not stop the cleaning up process once you ’ ve started it .
just like you can not be half-pregnant , ” said caspar von hauenschild , a board member of transparency international germany , an anti-corruption agency in berlin . von hauenschild said that siemens has done everything possible to clean up its act , but can not afford any more major scandals . “ löscher is giving siemens a fresh start .
the corporate culture against bribes is changing .
what is amazing is that von pierer and kleinfeld didn ’ t regard bribes as a company or personal risk that cost them their jobs , ” he said , adding that the top managers had let the scandal spiral out of control by leaving it up to their underlings to sort out conflicts abroad . “ a chief executive is responsible for implementing codes of conduct - meaning zero tolerance for corruption , ” said von hauenschild . changing rules of the game since the late 1990s the rules of the game on corrupt business practices had started to change dramatically with government crackdowns on fraud and bribery . part of the problem was that bribes involving foreign contracts were not only lawful , but even tax deductible in germany as late as 1999 . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : siemens did what others do , except on a much bigger scale furthermore , cash payments to mediators or foreign officials in exchange for lucrative contracts that amounted to billions of dollars has been always been common business practice , especially in developing countries where corruption is rife , according to frank rothauge , a long time siemens analyst at the private cologne banking house sal .
oppenheim . “ one needs to understand the mind-set back in the 1990s , ” said rothauge . “ paying someone to get a foot in an emerging market with many competitors was regarded as a small price to pay in exchange for a huge contract that made a big contribution to company profits .
it was the nature of the beast to provide such incentives , ” he said . siemens did what most multinationals do , except on a much bigger scale , added rothauge . “ ideally , transparency in competing for orders based on quality , price and innovation is better for everyone , but the reality is different , ” he said , explaining that telecommunications companies such as nokia and ericsson that refuse to accept bribes are often at a competitive disadvantage since they lose out on major contracts in spite of a superior product . german firms not affected rothauge added that siemens ’ image has been hurt , but not too badly .
the scandal has no real impact on the reputation of other german companies either , he added . “ at the end of the day , most business people know that other companies work in the same way .
german companies are no worse off than the more honorable scandinavians , ” he added . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : new ceo peter loescher has a tough task of cleaning up the mess but just because everyone does it , doesn ’ t make bribery right , according to daniela bergdolt if dsw , which represents small investors of siemens ag . “ siemens had a fantastic reputation and it is the market leader in so many areas , such as medical technology .
there was no need to resort to bribery , ” she said . “ the ability to attract customers should be based on being good enough to be competitive , ” added bergdolt , who said that a complete management shake-up was not enough at siemens and that the corporate system of illicit bribes has to change from the top down . easier said than done changing such a corporate culture is easier said than done , according to marcus lutter , a law professor and expert on corporate governance at the university of bonn , who explained that when the rules to stamp out corruption suddenly changed in 1999 , many companies , not just siemens , had a hard time adjusting to a new , cleaner corporate environment . “ it is like telling a chain smoker ‘ starting tomorrow you are not allowed to smoke anymore . ’
it is tough to quit a bad habit .
some people are still going to look for some small corner in a garden to steal a puff , ” he said . lutter also pointed out that the common german corporate practice of chief executives moving upstairs to the supervisory board , as von pierer did , presented problems of its own at siemens .
“ this was clearly a conflict .
kleinfeld could not be fully independent in his decision making with a former ceo looking over his shoulder , ” he said . the conflict meant that both had to go , according to bergdolt , who agrees that siemens is finally on the right course now with a brand new management team . “ its image has even been somewhat restored now , but it has taken an awfully long time to get on the right course , ” she said . diana fong send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

merkel calls on brazil to make biofuel production sustainable german minister calls for reversal of eu agricultural policy as biofuels fall from grace , a new generation grabs spotlight illegal logging gives eu massive eco-headache energy -pipe- 07.05.2008 germany defends biofuels , hedges bets on energy goals großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : fuel or food ?
the german government rejected claims tuesday that fuel crops were causing a worldwide spike in food prices .
berlin plans to announce a plan for easing the world food crisis by july , agriculture minister seehofer said . germany can not reach its climate change goals unless it dedicates land to growing biofuels , germany 's agriculture minister horst seehofer said after talks in berlin on tuesday , may 6 .
seehofer defended biofuels against growing criticism that they are responsible for food prices increasing globally , which has caused rioting and hunger in developing countries .
" there would also be hunger without biofuel , " seehofer said , who promised that the government would announce this summer what it will do to help ease the global food crisis .
in many countries , the hunger crisis is caused by population increases and the increasing demand for food in developing and emerging countries , said seehofer .
ethanol under scrutiny only 2 percent of cropland worldwide was being used to produce ethanol , a popular biofuel often made from corn , seehofer said .
ethanol has come under heavy criticism recently and which forms an important part of germany 's biofuel targets .
many farmers are switching from growing corn and wheat for food to instead focus on producing biofuel crops .
environment minister sigmar gabriel also promised tuesday that germany will stick to its biofuel strategy , which calls for increasing reliance on plant fuels by 2020 .
gabriel acknowledged that the government 's goal of having 17 percent of energy come from biofuel by 2020 might be overly optimistic and said the german parliament will decide in the near future whether to hold to a 2009 goal of having biofuel make up 6.25 percent of overall fuel consumption .
call for relaxed meat restrictions in a time of increasing prices for all types of food , seehofer said the german government will seek to increase meat production by pushing through rule changes to allow ground-up animal remains can be fed to pigs and poultry .
eight years ago the european union banned the use of ground-up animal carcasses as cheap feed after determining that cattle were catching bovine spongiform encephalopathy -lrb- bse -rrb- from eating brains of dead cows .

merkel calls on brazil to make biofuel production sustainable german minister calls for reversal of eu agricultural policy as biofuels fall from grace , a new generation grabs spotlight illegal logging gives eu massive eco-headache energy -pipe- 07.05.2008 germany defends biofuels , hedges bets on energy goals großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : fuel or food ?
the german government rejected claims tuesday that fuel crops were causing a worldwide spike in food prices .
berlin plans to announce a plan for easing the world food crisis by july , agriculture minister seehofer said . germany can not reach its climate change goals unless it dedicates land to growing biofuels , germany 's agriculture minister horst seehofer said after talks in berlin on tuesday , may 6 .
seehofer defended biofuels against growing criticism that they are responsible for food prices increasing globally , which has caused rioting and hunger in developing countries .
" there would also be hunger without biofuel , " seehofer said , who promised that the government would announce this summer what it will do to help ease the global food crisis .
in many countries , the hunger crisis is caused by population increases and the increasing demand for food in developing and emerging countries , said seehofer .
ethanol under scrutiny only 2 percent of cropland worldwide was being used to produce ethanol , a popular biofuel often made from corn , seehofer said .
ethanol has come under heavy criticism recently and which forms an important part of germany 's biofuel targets .
many farmers are switching from growing corn and wheat for food to instead focus on producing biofuel crops .
environment minister sigmar gabriel also promised tuesday that germany will stick to its biofuel strategy , which calls for increasing reliance on plant fuels by 2020 .
gabriel acknowledged that the government 's goal of having 17 percent of energy come from biofuel by 2020 might be overly optimistic and said the german parliament will decide in the near future whether to hold to a 2009 goal of having biofuel make up 6.25 percent of overall fuel consumption .

these account for approximately 65 percent of all cases of hiv in germany . germany 's hiv infection rate has increased steadily since 2001 , a phenomenon that could be partially attributed to early diagnosis and a larger number of people being tested for hiv . a simultaneous increase in syphilis cases joerg hacker , president of the robert koch institute , also offered another reason for the increase . " one of the little-known reasons for this increase is the high number of syphilis infections in germany , " hacker said .
germany has seen a rise in syphilis cases each year since 2004 .
researchers at the robert koch institute say that those infected simultaneously with syphilis and hiv are more infectious . around 59,000 people in germany are infected with the virus that leads to aids .

parliament always has the final say in foreign troop deployments , the court said . the german government erred in getting involved in the lead-up to the iraq war without parliamentary approval , according to a wednesday , may 7 decision from germany 's highest court .
the german center-left government under then-chancellor gerhard schroeder should have gotten prior approval from the bundestag , germany 's lower house of parliament , before taking part in a surveillance mission to turkey in 2003 , the court ruled .
parliamentary disapproval bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the ruling strengthens parliamentary power germany 's parliament had refused to join in the us military invasion of iraq .
but schroeder 's government agreed to supply troops for the turkey flights .
this outraged members of germany 's free democratic party -lrb- fdp -rrb- , a free-market liberal party .
five years ago the fdp asked a court for an emergency injunction to stop the deployment .
the german constitution requires parliamentary approval for all foreign armed deployments , and turkey qualified , the fdp said .
germany had sent its airborne warning and control system -lrb- awacs -rrb- planes at the request of its nato ally , turkey .
germany provided crews to man nato planes that flew surveillance flights near turkey 's southern border which were meant to protect turkey against an iraqi attack during the us-led invasion .
schroeder 's government described the 2003 deployment as a " routine " nato operation .
a lower court agreed , lifting the fdp 's injunction .
flights were form of deployment bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : not a " routine " operation yet the constitutional court reversed that decision wednesday .
the court ruled that there was a real possibility german military personnel could have been drawn into a conflict .
the court equated the flights with " armed deployment " which needs parliamentary approval .
" it is important that the responsibility for the deployment of armed troops remains in the hands of the representative body of the people , " i.e. parliament , the judges said in the ruling .
fdp head guido westerwelle hailed the constitutional court ruling as " historic , " saying that it would keep the german army under parliamentary control and prevent it from being turned into a tool of the government .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : schroeder went ahead without parliamentary approval while the law suggests that the parliament has to approve all foreign armed deployments , previous rulings suggest that in cases of acute threat , the government may seek parliamentary approval after the fact .
the decision is unlikely to have any legal consequences for schroeder or other members of his government but will influence the military policy-making of future administrations .
the german military currently has parliamentary mandates for missions around the world including deployments in afghanistan , bosnia , kosovo and the horn of africa .

experts say the fallout from the affair may actually have led to a shift towards cleaner business practices . the ancient proverb that “ a fish always stinks from the head down ” can be easily applied to the latest scandals that have been sweeping big , blue chip german companies in the last few years , denting the reputation of munich-based siemens ag in particular . ever since the global slush fund scandal that involved payoffs for huge foreign contracts broke in 2006 , bribery revelations at europe ’ s largest industrial conglomerate have reached an estimated 1.3 billion euros -lrb- about $ 2 billion -rrb- . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : former ceo klaus kleinfeld was forced to resign last year the scandal , which is the biggest ever in germany ’ s corporate history , has not only brought shame to siemens , but within the past year , the entire top management team has been purged .
even though ex-ceo klaus kleinfeld had presided over a period of record profits and was never personally implicated in the scandal , he was forced to resign after losing the board ’ s vote of confidence last year and replaced by peter löscher , an outsider . former supervisory board chairman heinrich von pierer , who had also been kleinfeld ’ s predecessor , had been so highly regarded among germany ’ s business elite that chancellor angela merkel had even tapped him to become technology advisor , an offer that was recently withdrawn . since siemens is also listed on the new york stock exchange , the sec , the us watchdog agency , has also been on the company ’ s heels to comply with anti-corruption regulations . " a fresh start " “ siemens is under tremendous pressure from the sec , but you can not stop the cleaning up process once you ’ ve started it .
just like you can not be half-pregnant , ” said caspar von hauenschild , a board member of transparency international germany , an anti-corruption agency in berlin . von hauenschild said that siemens has done everything possible to clean up its act , but can not afford any more major scandals . “ löscher is giving siemens a fresh start .
the corporate culture against bribes is changing .
what is amazing is that von pierer and kleinfeld didn ’ t regard bribes as a company or personal risk that cost them their jobs , ” he said , adding that the top managers had let the scandal spiral out of control by leaving it up to their underlings to sort out conflicts abroad . “ a chief executive is responsible for implementing codes of conduct - meaning zero tolerance for corruption , ” said von hauenschild . changing rules of the game since the late 1990s the rules of the game on corrupt business practices had started to change dramatically with government crackdowns on fraud and bribery . part of the problem was that bribes involving foreign contracts were not only lawful , but even tax deductible in germany as late as 1999 . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : siemens did what others do , except on a much bigger scale furthermore , cash payments to mediators or foreign officials in exchange for lucrative contracts that amounted to billions of dollars has been always been common business practice , especially in developing countries where corruption is rife , according to frank rothauge , a long time siemens analyst at the private cologne banking house sal .
oppenheim . “ one needs to understand the mind-set back in the 1990s , ” said rothauge . “ paying someone to get a foot in an emerging market with many competitors was regarded as a small price to pay in exchange for a huge contract that made a big contribution to company profits .
it was the nature of the beast to provide such incentives , ” he said . siemens did what most multinationals do , except on a much bigger scale , added rothauge . “ ideally , transparency in competing for orders based on quality , price and innovation is better for everyone , but the reality is different , ” he said , explaining that telecommunications companies such as nokia and ericsson that refuse to accept bribes are often at a competitive disadvantage since they lose out on major contracts in spite of a superior product . german firms not affected rothauge added that siemens ’ image has been hurt , but not too badly .
the scandal has no real impact on the reputation of other german companies either , he added . “ at the end of the day , most business people know that other companies work in the same way .
german companies are no worse off than the more honorable scandinavians , ” he added . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : new ceo peter loescher has a tough task of cleaning up the mess but just because everyone does it , doesn ’ t make bribery right , according to daniela bergdolt if dsw , which represents small investors of siemens ag . “ siemens had a fantastic reputation and it is the market leader in so many areas , such as medical technology .
there was no need to resort to bribery , ” she said . “ the ability to attract customers should be based on being good enough to be competitive , ” added bergdolt , who said that a complete management shake-up was not enough at siemens and that the corporate system of illicit bribes has to change from the top down . easier said than done changing such a corporate culture is easier said than done , according to marcus lutter , a law professor and expert on corporate governance at the university of bonn , who explained that when the rules to stamp out corruption suddenly changed in 1999 , many companies , not just siemens , had a hard time adjusting to a new , cleaner corporate environment . “ it is like telling a chain smoker ‘ starting tomorrow you are not allowed to smoke anymore . ’
it is tough to quit a bad habit .
some people are still going to look for some small corner in a garden to steal a puff , ” he said . lutter also pointed out that the common german corporate practice of chief executives moving upstairs to the supervisory board , as von pierer did , presented problems of its own at siemens .
“ this was clearly a conflict .
kleinfeld could not be fully independent in his decision making with a former ceo looking over his shoulder , ” he said . the conflict meant that both had to go , according to bergdolt , who agrees that siemens is finally on the right course now with a brand new management team . “ its image has even been somewhat restored now , but it has taken an awfully long time to get on the right course , ” she said . diana fong send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

as part of those efforts , the european commission in september proposed that integrated power and gas companies should spin off their retail distribution networks or allow them to be run by an outside operator .
tuesday 's vote confirmed that proposal , at least in the electricity market , and the bid now moves to the full parliament . consumers back in the driver 's seat bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the vote now moves to the eu 's full parliament british socialist lawmaker eluned morgan , who shepherded the bill through the parliament 's industry committee , heralded its victory . " i think that the vote for us meant that we put consumers back in the driving seat on energy policy , " she said . she likewise expressed confidence that the panel vote indicates how the full parliament vote will vote eventually . " i think that this vote will strengthen the hand of the majority of member states that for full ownership unbundling as the only option , " morgan said .
" i hope that it 's given confidence to the commission to pursue this very vigorously . " ' a dangerous road ' german lawmakers , however , were not as excited about the results . " breaking up the energy companies leads us down a dangerous road , " said hans jochen henke , the secretary general of the cdu 's economic affairs council .
" greater competition in the energy industry takes the security of urgently needed investments for granted .
it may likewise thoughtlessly risk our energy supply , and along with it , the accomplishment of climate-change goals . " henke further urged the european parliament to oppose the liberalization of the energy companies .
" a lasting energy policy must bring about more competition intensity while also providing security for investments , " he said , before referring to two alternative proposals set forth by germany several months ago . previous proposals bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : energy giant eon has already begun to divest the first alternative was rejected by members of the eu parliament 's industry committee because it was seen as watering down eu plans to boost competition .
germany then joined france in leading a group of eight nations to develop a so-called " third way . " that proposal , still heavily debated among the eu 's energy ministers , was seen by some as a compromise that would avoid the break-up of these countries ' vertically integrated utilities . the proposition came too late for some companies , however .
in february , german energy giant eon announced in february that it would sell its power grid - its distribution lines - to an operator that would have no interesting the supply or generation of electricity . the eu hailed that response , saying it hoped other power firms might follow suit , though none have yet to announce a break-up , perhaps in anticipation of the full parliament vote , scheduled to take place in mid-june . dw staff -lrb- cat -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

parliament always has the final say in foreign troop deployments , the court said . the german government erred in getting involved in the lead-up to the iraq war without parliamentary approval , according to a wednesday , may 7 decision from germany 's highest court .
the german center-left government under then-chancellor gerhard schroeder should have gotten prior approval from the bundestag , germany 's lower house of parliament , before taking part in a surveillance mission to turkey in 2003 , the court ruled .
parliamentary disapproval bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the ruling strengthens parliamentary power germany 's parliament had refused to join in the us military invasion of iraq .
but schroeder 's government agreed to supply troops for the turkey flights .
this outraged members of germany 's free democratic party -lrb- fdp -rrb- , a free-market liberal party .
five years ago the fdp asked a court for an emergency injunction to stop the deployment .
the german constitution requires parliamentary approval for all foreign armed deployments , and turkey qualified , the fdp said .
germany had sent its airborne warning and control system -lrb- awacs -rrb- planes at the request of its nato ally , turkey .
germany provided crews to man nato planes that flew surveillance flights near turkey 's southern border which were meant to protect turkey against an iraqi attack during the us-led invasion .
schroeder 's government described the 2003 deployment as a " routine " nato operation .
a lower court agreed , lifting the fdp 's injunction .
flights were form of deployment bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : not a " routine " operation yet the constitutional court reversed that decision wednesday .
the court ruled that there was a real possibility german military personnel could have been drawn into a conflict .
the court equated the flights with " armed deployment " which needs parliamentary approval .
" it is important that the responsibility for the deployment of armed troops remains in the hands of the representative body of the people , " i.e. parliament , the judges said in the ruling .
fdp head guido westerwelle hailed the constitutional court ruling as " historic , " saying that it would keep the german army under parliamentary control and prevent it from being turned into a tool of the government .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : schroeder went ahead without parliamentary approval while the law suggests that the parliament has to approve all foreign armed deployments , previous rulings suggest that in cases of acute threat , the government may seek parliamentary approval after the fact .
the decision is unlikely to have any legal consequences for schroeder or other members of his government but will influence the military policy-making of future administrations .
the german military currently has parliamentary mandates for missions around the world including deployments in afghanistan , bosnia , kosovo and the horn of africa .

dw-world : merkel calls on brazil to make biofuel production sustainable dw-world : german minister calls for reversal of eu agricultural policy dw-world : as biofuels fall from grace , a new generation grabs spotlight dw-world : illegal logging gives eu massive eco-headache energy -pipe- 07.05.2008 germany defends biofuels , hedges bets on energy goals großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : fuel or food ?
the german government rejected claims tuesday that fuel crops were causing a worldwide spike in food prices .
berlin plans to announce a plan for easing the world food crisis by july , agriculture minister seehofer said . germany can not reach its climate change goals unless it dedicates land to growing biofuels , germany 's agriculture minister horst seehofer said after talks in berlin on tuesday , may 6 .
seehofer defended biofuels against growing criticism that they are responsible for food prices increasing globally , which has caused rioting and hunger in developing countries .
" there would also be hunger without biofuel , " seehofer said , who promised that the government would announce this summer what it will do to help ease the global food crisis .
in many countries , the hunger crisis is caused by population increases and the increasing demand for food in developing and emerging countries , said seehofer .
ethanol under scrutiny only 2 percent of cropland worldwide was being used to produce ethanol , a popular biofuel often made from corn , seehofer said .
ethanol has come under heavy criticism recently and which forms an important part of germany 's biofuel targets .
many farmers are switching from growing corn and wheat for food to instead focus on producing biofuel crops .
environment minister sigmar gabriel also promised tuesday that germany will stick to its biofuel strategy , which calls for increasing reliance on plant fuels by 2020 .
gabriel acknowledged that the government 's goal of having 17 percent of energy come from biofuel by 2020 might be overly optimistic and said the german parliament will decide in the near future whether to hold to a 2009 goal of having biofuel make up 6.25 percent of overall fuel consumption .
call for relaxed meat restrictions in a time of increasing prices for all types of food , seehofer said the german government will seek to increase meat production by pushing through rule changes to allow ground-up animal remains can be fed to pigs and poultry .
eight years ago the european union banned the use of ground-up animal carcasses as cheap feed after determining that cattle were catching bovine spongiform encephalopathy -lrb- bse -rrb- from eating brains of dead cows .

a panel of experts has been set up to advise the assembly government which has pledged to halve child poverty in wales by 2010 .
the first meeting about the matter is to be held later .
one expert has said uk-wide figures would be less effective in targeting problems facing welsh children .
the uk and assembly governments say they want to eradicate child poverty by 2020 .
the charity save the children estimates up to 13 % of welsh children - 90,000 - can be classed as in " severe poverty " because they live in households too poor to provide them with " occasions " such as school trips and holidays .
in february 2007 , the uk came bottom of a league table for child well-being created by unicef , the united nations children 's organisation . "
there 's no point using uk figures to target the problems which welsh children may have " prof gordon the report looked at 40 indicators from the years 2000-2003 including poverty , family relationships , and health .
" the trouble with the uk figure is that it represents the uk as a whole .
some things may be better in wales , some things may be worse in wales , " said prof david gordon who is on the panel .
" there 's no point using uk figures to target the problems which welsh children may have .
" it 's not cost effective and , trying to improve problems based on uk measures , you may end up solving problems that do n't exist for welsh children . "
he said he hoped a wales measure of child poverty could be in place from september this year and either meet or surpass the unicef standard .
he said : " it should n't be that expensive .

the lawyer , mark vincent kaplan , said spears had made progress in getting her personal life back together .
federline has had full custody of their children since january , when spears entered a psychiatric hospital .
the pop star 's personal life spiralled out of control after her break-up from federline in 2006 .
a constant tail of paparazzi caught her increasingly erratic behaviour .
the 26-year-old shaved her head , beat a car with an umbrella , entered rehab and was twice taken by ambulance to hospital psychiatric units .
she lost custody of two-and-a-half-year-old sean preston and jayden james , 20 months , in october and lost visiting rights in january .
mr federline agreed to occasional supervised visits in february .
ms spears 's father has temporarily taken over control of the pop star 's assets and estate .
" we are so pleased at britney 's progress and we are very appreciative of the court 's recognition of this progress , " her parents said in a statement on tuesday .
she is due back in court in july for another progress report .
dozens of photographers and reporters watched ms spears arrive as a front-seat passenger in a white land rover .
in recent months ms spears has kept a fairly low profile , but she did make an appearance last month on us sitcom how i met your mother .

the study contrasts this subcutaneous fat with visceral fat , which is wrapped around the organs , and raises the risk of ill health .
it is thought subcutaneous fat may produce hormones known as adipokines which boost the metabolism .
the harvard medical school study appears in the journal cell metabolism . "
the surprising thing was that it was n't where the fat was located , it was the kind of fat that was the most important variable . "
professor ronald khan harvard medical school the researchers , who worked on mice , transplanted fat from one part of the animals ' body to the other .
when subcutaneous fat was moved to the abdominal area , there was a decrease in body weight , fat mass , and blood sugar levels .
the animals also became more responsive to the hormone insulin , which controls the way the body uses sugar .
a lack of response to insulin is often the first stage on the path to type 2 diabetes .
in contrast , moving abdominal visceral fat to other parts of the body had no effect .
lead researcher professor ronald khan said : " the surprising thing was that it was n't where the fat was located , it was the kind of fat that was the most important variable .
" even more surprising , it was n't that abdominal fat was exerting negative effects , but that subcutaneous fat was producing a good effect . "
previous research has suggested that obese people with high levels of both abdominal and subcutaneous fat are more insulin-sensitive than those with only high levels of abdominal fat .
professor khan said it was possible that subcutaneous fat offset the effects of visceral fat .
dr david haslam , of the national obesity forum , said the finding cast new doubt on the merits of body mass index -lrb- bmi -rrb- as a way to assess whether somebody was unhealthily overweight , as it did not differentiate between different types of fat .
he said it was still important that people tried to control their weight , as healthy lifestyle choices like a balanced diet and taking exercise would overwhelmingly impact on visceral , and not subcutaneous fat levels .
women have a tendency to lay down more subcutaneous fat , particularly on their legs and buttocks than men .
dr ian campbell , medical director of the charity weight concern , said : " if there is something about subcutaneous fat which is protective , and actually decreases insulin resistance , this could help open up a whole new debate on the precise role fat has on our metabolism . "

professor ronald khan harvard medical school the researchers , who worked on mice , transplanted fat from one part of the animals ' body to the other .
when subcutaneous fat was moved to the abdominal area , there was a decrease in body weight , fat mass , and blood sugar levels .
the animals also became more responsive to the hormone insulin , which controls the way the body uses sugar .
a lack of response to insulin is often the first stage on the path to type 2 diabetes .
in contrast , moving abdominal visceral fat to other parts of the body had no effect .
lead researcher professor ronald khan said : " the surprising thing was that it was n't where the fat was located , it was the kind of fat that was the most important variable .
" even more surprising , it was n't that abdominal fat was exerting negative effects , but that subcutaneous fat was producing a good effect . "
previous research has suggested that obese people with high levels of both abdominal and subcutaneous fat are more insulin-sensitive than those with only high levels of abdominal fat .
professor khan said it was possible that subcutaneous fat offset the effects of visceral fat .
dr david haslam , of the national obesity forum , said the finding cast new doubt on the merits of body mass index -lrb- bmi -rrb- as a way to assess whether somebody was unhealthily overweight , as it did not differentiate between different types of fat .
he said it was still important that people tried to control their weight , as healthy lifestyle choices like a balanced diet and taking exercise would overwhelmingly impact on visceral , and not subcutaneous fat levels .
women have a tendency to lay down more subcutaneous fat , particularly on their legs and buttocks than men .
dr ian campbell , medical director of the charity weight concern , said : " if there is something about subcutaneous fat which is protective , and actually decreases insulin resistance , this could help open up a whole new debate on the precise role fat has on our metabolism . "

advertisement walham electricity switching station had a close escape from last summer 's floods .
david shukman reports hundreds of uk power substations and water treatment plants are potentially at risk from flooding , a confidential government study suggests .
bbc news has seen the conclusions of research commissioned after the devastating floods of 2007 .
yorkshire and humberside , the midlands and gloucestershire were among the worst affected areas after heavy rain .
and a separate study suggests that the uk is entering a " flood-rich " period where more flooding is likely .
the government report calls on companies , regulators and ministers to act .
the confidential report warns that " there are likely to be hundreds of sites at the highest levels of criticality " and says that " the risks posed by natural hazards are already rising and are predicted to rise further " .
it concludes that it would " be imprudent to rest on the basis that events on the lines of those which happened last summer were so infrequent as to reply on a reactive response alone " .
flood barrier early estimates of the cost of strengthening the flood resistance of key sites run into the region of £ 1bn .
the catalyst for this investigation was the near-loss of a major power switching station at walham , near gloucester , in july last year .
it provides electricity for 500,000 homes and businesses in gloucestershire and acts as a key relay for supplies to south wales .
only with emergency work supported by the military was the floodwater kept inches away from overwhelming the plant .
i think many of us were surprised by the degree to which critical infrastructure was affected sir michael pitt send us your comments at one stage during a meeting of cobra , the government 's emergency planning committee , ministers ordered officials to prepare plans for a mass evacuation .
the site is now defended by a massive flood barrier .
the flooding of a treatment works , at mythe , also in gloucestershire , at the same time led to 350,000 people losing water supplies for up to three weeks .
the summer floods saw about 13 people killed and 44,600 homes and 7,100 businesses flooded , with the damage caused costing £ 3bn .
what has alarmed officials is the potential impact on the normal functioning of society - and the speed with which last summer 's rainstorms led to flash flooding .
this internal government study come as sir michael pitt puts the finishing touches to his official review of last summer 's floods .
his inquiry - due to publish its final report next month - has already found that more than 1,000 electricity and water works were affected , along with 12 sections of railway line and eight stretches of motorway .
' wake-up call ' sir michael told the bbc : " there is no doubt that the network was vulnerable , that the loss of walham would have been a major issue and many hundreds of thousands of people would have had their power affected .
" i think many of us were surprised by the degree to which critical infrastructure was affected .
" tens of thousands of people were out of their homes , thousands of businesses were directly affected , but i honestly believe that we could have been a great deal worse . "
spokesmen for the industry associations representing the electricity network and water companies said the summer floods had served as a wake-up call .
but they added that urgent research into the risks was under way - and in many cases further flood defence work had been carried out .

advertisement walham electricity switching station had a close escape from last summer 's floods .
david shukman reports hundreds of uk power substations and water treatment plants are potentially at risk from flooding , a confidential government study suggests .
bbc news has seen the conclusions of research commissioned after the devastating floods of 2007 .
yorkshire and humberside , the midlands and gloucestershire were among the worst affected areas after heavy rain .
and a separate study suggests that the uk is entering a " flood-rich " period where more flooding is likely .
the government report calls on companies , regulators and ministers to act .
the confidential report warns that " there are likely to be hundreds of sites at the highest levels of criticality " and says that " the risks posed by natural hazards are already rising and are predicted to rise further " .
it concludes that it would " be imprudent to rest on the basis that events on the lines of those which happened last summer were so infrequent as to reply on a reactive response alone " .
flood barrier early estimates of the cost of strengthening the flood resistance of key sites run into the region of £ 1bn .
the catalyst for this investigation was the near-loss of a major power switching station at walham , near gloucester , in july last year .
it provides electricity for 500,000 homes and businesses in gloucestershire and acts as a key relay for supplies to south wales .
only with emergency work supported by the military was the floodwater kept inches away from overwhelming the plant .
i think many of us were surprised by the degree to which critical infrastructure was affected sir michael pitt send us your comments at one stage during a meeting of cobra , the government 's emergency planning committee , ministers ordered officials to prepare plans for a mass evacuation .
the site is now defended by a massive flood barrier .
the flooding of a treatment works , at mythe , also in gloucestershire , at the same time led to 350,000 people losing water supplies for up to three weeks .
the summer floods saw about 13 people killed and 44,600 homes and 7,100 businesses flooded , with the damage caused costing £ 3bn .
what has alarmed officials is the potential impact on the normal functioning of society - and the speed with which last summer 's rainstorms led to flash flooding .
this internal government study come as sir michael pitt puts the finishing touches to his official review of last summer 's floods .
his inquiry - due to publish its final report next month - has already found that more than 1,000 electricity and water works were affected , along with 12 sections of railway line and eight stretches of motorway .
' wake-up call ' sir michael told the bbc : " there is no doubt that the network was vulnerable , that the loss of walham would have been a major issue and many hundreds of thousands of people would have had their power affected .
" i think many of us were surprised by the degree to which critical infrastructure was affected .
" tens of thousands of people were out of their homes , thousands of businesses were directly affected , but i honestly believe that we could have been a great deal worse . "
spokesmen for the industry associations representing the electricity network and water companies said the summer floods had served as a wake-up call .
but they added that urgent research into the risks was under way - and in many cases further flood defence work had been carried out .

his inquiry - due to publish its final report next month - has already found that more than 1,000 electricity and water works were affected , along with 12 sections of railway line and eight stretches of motorway .
' wake-up call ' sir michael told the bbc : " there is no doubt that the network was vulnerable , that the loss of walham would have been a major issue and many hundreds of thousands of people would have had their power affected .
" i think many of us were surprised by the degree to which critical infrastructure was affected .
" tens of thousands of people were out of their homes , thousands of businesses were directly affected , but i honestly believe that we could have been a great deal worse . "
spokesmen for the industry associations representing the electricity network and water companies said the summer floods had served as a wake-up call .
but they added that urgent research into the risks was under way - and in many cases further flood defence work had been carried out .

advertisement walham electricity switching station had a close escape from last summer 's floods .
david shukman reports hundreds of uk power substations and water treatment plants are potentially at risk from flooding , a confidential government study suggests .
bbc news has seen the conclusions of research commissioned after the devastating floods of 2007 .
yorkshire and humberside , the midlands and gloucestershire were among the worst affected areas after heavy rain .
and a separate study suggests that the uk is entering a " flood-rich " period where more flooding is likely .
the government report calls on companies , regulators and ministers to act .
the confidential report warns that " there are likely to be hundreds of sites at the highest levels of criticality " and says that " the risks posed by natural hazards are already rising and are predicted to rise further " .
it concludes that it would " be imprudent to rest on the basis that events on the lines of those which happened last summer were so infrequent as to reply on a reactive response alone " .
flood barrier early estimates of the cost of strengthening the flood resistance of key sites run into the region of £ 1bn .
the catalyst for this investigation was the near-loss of a major power switching station at walham , near gloucester , in july last year .
it provides electricity for 500,000 homes and businesses in gloucestershire and acts as a key relay for supplies to south wales .
only with emergency work supported by the military was the floodwater kept inches away from overwhelming the plant .
i think many of us were surprised by the degree to which critical infrastructure was affected sir michael pitt send us your comments at one stage during a meeting of cobra , the government 's emergency planning committee , ministers ordered officials to prepare plans for a mass evacuation .
the site is now defended by a massive flood barrier .
the flooding of a treatment works , at mythe , also in gloucestershire , at the same time led to 350,000 people losing water supplies for up to three weeks .
the summer floods saw about 13 people killed and 44,600 homes and 7,100 businesses flooded , with the damage caused costing £ 3bn .
what has alarmed officials is the potential impact on the normal functioning of society - and the speed with which last summer 's rainstorms led to flash flooding .

alípio ribeiro , the national director of the judicial police , reportedly told a local radio station he was " tired " of being in the media spotlight .
he had made a number of public comments about madeleine 's disappearance , despite judicial secrecy laws .
in february , he said police had been " hasty " in naming her parents suspects .
mr ribeiro will be replaced by josé maria almeida rodrigues , a senior detective currently based in the town of coimbra .
officer fired as head of the polícia judiciária - portugal 's equivalent of the cid - mr ribeiro insisted information about the hunt for madeleine should not be made public .
he also fired the police officer who earlier headed the investigation , goncalo amaral , for comments he made to the media .
but mr ribeiro himself mentioned the case several times in interviews , including discussing the role forensic evidence from kate and gerry mccann 's hire car could play in uncovering what happened to their daughter .
