now , the largest remaining stretch of it is to be touched up to preserve art works against weather damage and vandalism .
but how long can it stay spic and span ? berlin 's muehlenstrasse - a four-lane thoroughfare largely devoid of buildings and full of speeding traffic - is n't the sort of street that would usually attract a lot of tourists .
but some half a million visitors come every year to look at the east side gallery , a 1,316-meter stretch of reconstituted berlin wall .
the " gallery , " which was originally set up in 1990 after the fall of east german communism , features works by 118 artists from 21 countries - many of them chipped by the elements and obscured by graffiti .
as of october , however , those artists have been invited to come to berlin to restore their works and spruce up one of the german capital 's most unlikely tourist attractions .

ironically , the east-facing gallery represents what the wall looked like from the west , since residents of communist east germany were forbidden from even touching , let alone decorating it .
equally ironically , one of the problems for the gallery is people picking at it to hack out souvenirs - disregarding signs posted to inform visitors that they were standing before a piece of history .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the ugly bits of graffiti will be removed - but will vandals respect the monument ?
" we tried that , but someone stole the signs - they work well as souvenirs , too , " alavi told berlin 's tagesspiegel newspaper .
this is n't the first gallery renovation .
in 2000 , a german paint company sponsored the restoration of some 40 meters of original art works , but this is the first time the gallery as a whole has been scheduled for a touch-up .

that 's precisely the way the mccain campaign began its own anti-obama advertisement entitled " celebrity , " following it up with brief images of britney spears and hilton herself .
the somewhat muddled message was that , by having the audacity to speak to 200,000 people in a major world city in a country closely allied with the us , the democratic candidate was descending to the level of a tabloid celebrity .

her video matches mccain 's image for image , showing pictures of tv retirees the golden girls , fawning cnn interviewer larry king and colonel sanders , the white-bearded mascot of the kentucky fried chicken food chain .
a portentous off-screen voice intones " he 's the oldest celebrity in the world , " then asks : " but is he ready to lead ? "
the point , an entirely valid one , is that as the world 's most famous politician an american president is by definition a celebrity .
indeed , the ability to manage fame is part of the job .
hilton 's subsequent assurance that she is " like totally ready to lead , " while thumbing through a travel magazine in search of the best place to improve her tan , is also on the money .

hilton , whose previous most popular performance in an internet video came in a badly lit home-porn movie , seems to understand this , as her obvious preference for the " guy who wants change " over the " white-haired dude " indicates .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de in focus : the race for the white house mccain would be good for trans-atlantic trade , says expert top democrat promises obama , mccain would ' listen to europe ' world opinion sways us voters , ambassador says german expert praises mccain 's tightrope walk with palin opinion -pipe- 06.08.2008 opinion : hilton hit the mark with anti-mccain spoof großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : celebrity heiresses are n't usually worth listening to .
but dw 's jefferson chase says paris hilton 's parodic defense of barack obama 's berlin speech effectively skewered the xenophobia of john mccain 's attack ads . it 's no accident that hilton 's tongue-in-cheek video , which dominated the internet on wednesday , august 6 , starts with a crowd shot from barack obama 's july speech in front of berlin 's victory column .
that 's precisely the way the mccain campaign began its own anti-obama advertisement entitled " celebrity , " following it up with brief images of britney spears and hilton herself .
the somewhat muddled message was that , by having the audacity to speak to 200,000 people in a major world city in a country closely allied with the us , the democratic candidate was descending to the level of a tabloid celebrity .
any time anyone in europe takes an interest in a us election , so the implicit logic , something must be deeply fishy and anti-american .
what a change from the go-it-alone stance of the bush administration , which led to such cost-efficient and confidence-building global solutions as the iraq war .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hilton did n't have any problems with this white-haired dude ...
and what an example of consistency from the republican party , whose modern-day hero , ronald reagan , began his political career as a foreign-policy expert … um , wait … a celebrity .
but the " wrinkly white-haired guy " - as hilton , channeling the gut feelings of millions of americans under the age of 50 , called the presumptive republican nominee - did n't count on his celebrity adversary fighting back .
her video matches mccain 's image for image , showing pictures of tv retirees the golden girls , fawning cnn interviewer larry king and colonel sanders , the white-bearded mascot of the kentucky fried chicken food chain .
a portentous off-screen voice intones " he 's the oldest celebrity in the world , " then asks : " but is he ready to lead ? "
the point , an entirely valid one , is that as the world 's most famous politician an american president is by definition a celebrity .
indeed , the ability to manage fame is part of the job .
hilton 's subsequent assurance that she is " like totally ready to lead , " while thumbing through a travel magazine in search of the best place to improve her tan , is also on the money .
after all , what can any rational person hope to learn about a candidate 's inner readiness to lead a country like the us from a medium as surface-oriented as tv ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ... this one , however , rubbed her the wrong way all one can reasonably glean from television ads are a few indications of the candidates ' positions - and of the depths to which their campaigns are willing to sink to win the election .
in mccain 's case , the latter include playing on a primitive suspicion and ignorance of europe that post-bush america would do well to discard .
hilton , whose previous most popular performance in an internet video came in a badly lit home-porn movie , seems to understand this , as her obvious preference for the " guy who wants change " over the " white-haired dude " indicates .
by wearing her heart on her sleeve , instead of having sex for the camera , the celebrity heiress has finally made something worth watching .
and made the self-proclaimed serious , experienced candidate john mccain look pretty foolish . jefferson chase send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

now they are increasingly opting to invest their millions in germany . in recent years , russian firms , both large and small , are increasingly trying to break into the german market , and and those who have gained a foothold have made quite a success of it . russian companies have bought stakes in high-profile german companies such the giant travel operator and europe 's leading travel group tui , fashion chain escada , the air berlin airline and shipyards in the baltic ports of wismar and rostock . russian billionaire suleyman kerimov , a key stakeholder in russian energy giant gazprom , has been reported to be considering boosting his stake in germany 's biggest bank , deutsche bank . flush with cash , russian investors are eyeing nearly every crucial sector of the german economy from cosmetics , fashion and tourism to construction , real estate , energy , media and shipbuilding . potential investors have been sending scouts to sniff out the german market and analyze where the money could be put to best use . according to the head of the russian chamber of trade and commerce in berlin , sergey nikitin , russian companies investing in germany are primarily interested in opening up new markets in the west and burnishing their image by adding the " made in germany " label to their product range . " russian companies are extremely interested in modernizing their machinery and equipment , ” nikitin said .
" and it 's only natural that many of them are trying to do this with the help of a strong , reliable and experienced partner .
this is why they turn to germany to make use of the country ’ s technical expertise and with it expand their product range . " past prejudice makes germans wary bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : new president medvedev has bolstered investors not long ago , it was n't unusual to find a large number of german businesses extremely wary of the multi-billion ruble investments from russia .
on many occasions it was unclear where the money came from and what investors planned to do with it exactly . that 's likely to change over the next couple of years , however with russia ’ s expected entry into the world trade organization . investment has also been made easier by the new russian president ’ s promise to work towards liberalizing the domestic economy and fighting corruption . during his recent visit to germany , dmitry medvedev called on the german business community to treat russian companies and investors as equal partners .
he said there was no reason to keep restrictions for russian investors in place . german companies are likewise speaking of a new openness and transparency when it comes to mutually beneficial deals .
" of course there are still some prejudices in place , " said nikitin .
" but once it gets down to nitty-gritty and german and russian businessmen deal with the details of their contracts , misconceptions and prejudices are usually removed very fast . “ it ’ s a new situation for the german business community to deal with russian partners on this scale , " he added . scales tipping in russia 's favor ? the scale , however , still appears to be tipped in germany ’ s favor .
more than 4,000 german companies including heavyweights such as siemens , bosch and basf currently do business in the russian federation while only about 1,300 russia firms are active in germany . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : russian railways is said to be helping deutsche bahn to privatize that could soon change .
in 2000 , russian companies invested some $ 20 billion -lrb- 30 billion euros -rrb- abroad .
this year , it will most likely reach the $ 200 billion threshold .
germany will also certainly stay in the sights of russian investors . it 's expected , for instance , that russian railways will be actively involved in the privatization of its german counterpart , deutsche bahn .
more investments are also likely in the biotechnology sector where russian companies hold many patents which they haven ’ t yet been marketed elsewhere . hardy graupner -lrb- cat -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

6 . germany 's chef de mission in beijing , michael vesper , told the dpa news agency that nowitzki was chosen because he represents the olympic idea like no other athlete . " it has been a dream of dirk nowitzki for years to be at the olympics , " he added .
" this dream has now become reality . " competing at the olympics wo n't be the only first for the 30-year-old born in the bavarian city of wuerzburg .
he is also the first basketball player to carry the german flag at an olympics , succeeding show jumper ludger beerbaum -lrb- 2004 -rrb- , kayak canoe racer birgit fischer -lrb- 2000 -rrb- and fencer arnd schmitt -lrb- 1996 -rrb- . nowitzki said competing at an olympic games is something that has motivated him since a very young age . " on friday -lsb- at the opening ceremony -rsb- , i will experience something astonishing , " nowitzki said at a press conference on wednesday .
" i never thought i would be chosen to carry the flag but maybe it 's happened because a lot of athletes identify with me . " the opposition bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : gymnast fabian hambuchen was the committee 's first choice but he declined the offer birgit fischer , an eight-time olympic gold medalist who retired after the athens games four years ago , was critical when it was first suggested nowitzki , one of the biggest earners in the nba , might carry the flag as , in her eyes , he did not represent one of germany 's traditional olympic sports . gymnast fabian hambuchen , the world high-bar champion , had been the german olympic committee 's first choice to be their flag-bearer but he declined the offer because his event takes place on saturday . german basketball returns to the olympics dallas mavericks forward nowitzki played a key role in ensuring germany clinched the final qualifying place on offer in the 12-team line-up for these games by scoring 32 points in a 96-82 victory over puerto rico in july .
that win saw germany into their first olympic basketball tournament since 1992 . the team was also aided by los angeles clippers center chris kaman who , courtesy of his great-grandparents , became a naturalized german citizen at the start of july .
despite not speaking a world of german at the time , kaman played his part against puerto rico by scoring 10 points with 12 rebounds . the dallas mavericks star last year became the first player from europe to win the nba 's prestigious most valuable player award .
he led germany to second place at the 2005 european championships and to third place at the 2002 worlds . dw staff -lrb- mrm -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de art -pipe- 06.08.2008 famous stretch of berlin wall to be restored großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : this picture of two old men kissing is one of the gallery 's famous images for 28 years , berliners dreamed of tearing down the wall .
now , the largest remaining stretch of it is to be touched up to preserve art works against weather damage and vandalism .
but how long can it stay spic and span ? berlin 's muehlenstrasse - a four-lane thoroughfare largely devoid of buildings and full of speeding traffic - is n't the sort of street that would usually attract a lot of tourists .
but some half a million visitors come every year to look at the east side gallery , a 1,316-meter stretch of reconstituted berlin wall .
the " gallery , " which was originally set up in 1990 after the fall of east german communism , features works by 118 artists from 21 countries - many of them chipped by the elements and obscured by graffiti .
as of october , however , those artists have been invited to come to berlin to restore their works and spruce up one of the german capital 's most unlikely tourist attractions .
around half of the two million euros -lrb- $ 3.1 million -rrb- needed for the renovations come from the eu , the german government and the city .
the rest is covered by lottery funds .
iranian organizer , german history bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : among the works to be restored is alavi 's own the project is the brainchild of an artists ' initiative headed by iranian kani alavi , who has lived in berlin since 1980 and whose work is also immortalized on the harsh concrete remnants of communism .
ironically , the east-facing gallery represents what the wall looked like from the west , since residents of communist east germany were forbidden from even touching , let alone decorating it .
equally ironically , one of the problems for the gallery is people picking at it to hack out souvenirs - disregarding signs posted to inform visitors that they were standing before a piece of history .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the ugly bits of graffiti will be removed - but will vandals respect the monument ?
" we tried that , but someone stole the signs - they work well as souvenirs , too , " alavi told berlin 's tagesspiegel newspaper .
this is n't the first gallery renovation .
in 2000 , a german paint company sponsored the restoration of some 40 meters of original art works , but this is the first time the gallery as a whole has been scheduled for a touch-up .
if all goes to plan , work will be finished by november 9 , 2009 - in time to celebrate the twentieth anniversary of the opening of the berlin wall . dw staff -lrb- jc -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" we warn companies of the extremely sensitive nature " of economic ties with iran , thomas steg told a government news conference , adding that berlin also expected firms to employ their " moral sense " if they invest there .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel has said in the past moral considerations and not just export bans should play a role in deals with iran " the government is expecting some sensitivity from businesses , " he added .
steg said the company 's plans to export three liquefied natural gas plants to iran were approved earlier this year because the deal did not violate international sanctions against tehran over its nuclear program or fall under german regulations requiring a government review .
berlin thus did not have to give its authorization , he added .
strong trade links between germany , iran the west accuses iran of enriching uranium to covertly develop nuclear weapons .
iran , the world 's fourth largest oil producer , denies the charge and says it is developing a civilian nuclear program to help meet its energy needs .
germany is one of six nations leading diplomatic efforts to push iran to abandon its nuclear work .
germany has scaled back business ties with iran , and german banks have largely ceased doing business with the islamic republic over its nuclear program .
germany is one of iran 's biggest trade partners .
its exports to iran totalled 3.6 billion euros last year .
israel worried by gas deal the israeli government last week expressed concern over the 100-million-euro -lrb- $ 155 million -rrb- deal between germany 's steiner group and tehran to build three liquefied natural gas plants in iran .
" the ministry will talk to the highest officials within the german government to obtain clarification and express its concern over the fact that the german office of export controls gave its green light to the contract , " israeli foreign ministry spokesman arye mekel told the afp news agency .
israel , the region 's sole if undeclared nuclear armed power , considers iran its greatest threat .
" the fact that germany , a member of the european group eu3 , which includes france , britain and germany , is adopting a position that harms international efforts to considerably toughen sanctions against iran over its continued nuclear program , is worrying , " the ministry said in a statement . dw staff -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

6 , overturned a decision at the end of july by fifa , soccer 's world governing authority , requiring teams to release under-23 players to join their national sides in beijing .
the three most prominent players affected were lionel messi of barcelona , werder bremen playmaker diego and schalke defender rafinha . the cas ruling was based on the fact that the olympics are not part of soccer 's official international calendar . but the court also issued a statement calling upon " the good will and good sense of fifa and the clubs to find a reasonable solution with regard to players who wish to represent their country at the olympic games . " all three clubs say they wo n't force the players to come back to europe .
" at this late stage it makes no sense to order diego to come back to bremen , " bremen ceo klaus allofs said in a statement .
bad feelings all around bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : things have been tense at bremen since diego 's unexpected departure but allofs added that the decision was contingent upon the brazilian football association taking out appropriate insurance in case the players were injured . the olympic soccer competition coincides with the start of the german bundesliga season and the qualifying round for the champions league , in which both schalke and barcelona face crucial matches . messi joined the argentinean side in beijing after the july fifa ruling .
diego and rafinha , more controversially , simply went awol from their respective clubs ' pre-season preparations to hook up with the brazilian national team . that did n't make their employers very happy . " we do n't feel like the big winners , " schalke commercial manager andreas mueller said in a statement .

"
confident of support on the right wing of the traditional party of the german centre-left , clement is resolutely refusing to back down and is fighting the ruling .
on the surface , the battle is about strong personalities and the inevitable conflict between the right to express opinions freely and the need for party discipline .
but in reality , a classic " richtungsstreit " - an ideological struggle over the party 's political direction - has erupted .
the timing is awkward .
the spd is hoping to make a large dent in the majority enjoyed by the conservative christian social union -lrb- csu -rrb- in the bavarian state election on september 28 .
before the clement affair broke out into the open , opinion polls suggested the csu was likely to lose the absolute majority it has enjoyed in the large southern state since 1962 , with the spd the major benefactor .
clement ignites in-party quarrel bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : wolfgang clement 's comments have drawn the ire of several party officials clement outraged the party with his comments before another state election , in hesse , when he came close to warning against a vote for spd leader andrea ypsilanti on the grounds of her opposition to both nuclear and coal-fired power generation .
" consider carefully and vote carefully on who should be entrusted with responsibility for the state , " he wrote just a week before the jan .
27 poll .
many in the spd blame clement for the inconclusive outcome which left a caretaker government headed by the christian democratic union -lrb- cdu -rrb- in control in hesse .
party members were quick to point out that he had left politics at the end of 2005 for a career in industry - sitting on the board of the major electricity company rwe power .
spd leaders at federal level are desperately trying to calm the situation .
" our aim is to build bridges in this conflict , " party general secretary hubertus heil said , while spd federal chairman kurt beck called for clement 's life-long service to the party to be recognized .
party figures against clement but the conflicting parties were more interested in digging trenches than building bridges .
axel schaefer , a member of parliament for bochum , the ruhr town where clement is registered with the spd , urged the outspoken 68-year-old to go .
" one constantly hears ' me , me , me ' from clement , when we would like to hear ' we ' for a change , " schaefer told local daily westdeutsche allgemeine zeitung .
spd north rhine-westphalia deputy chairman jochen ott labelled clement " arrogant " and urged him to accept that he could not continue to undermine the party , " otherwise he should go of his own accord . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : franz maget says party unity should prevail over all else and spd bavarian chairman franz maget , with his eye fixed on next month 's election , said that , while clement was an " upstanding social democrat , he is also boneheaded . "
maget called for the former economics and labor minister to accept a formal rebuke from the party and to agree to maintain party discipline .
clement made clear that nothing was further from his mind .
" what they are demanding is a muzzle , even in the event that spd leaders somewhere join forces with the left party , and i wo n't be part of it , " he told national public broadcaster zdf .
clement once again had ypsilanti in his sights .
the hesse spd leader this week put out feelers to the socialist left in the state in the hope of forming a minority coalition with the greens based on the tacit support of the left .
spd presented with problem from the left bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " here 's the left " the logo reads - the strong growth of the far-left party has spd leaders scratching their heads how to confront the apparently inexorable rise of the new party with its roots in formerly communist east germany lies at the heart of the struggle .
the spd , whose roots go back to the mid 19th century labor movement , has plumbed all-time lows in opinion polls this year .
the left has eaten steadily into its traditional support base , even in western states - like north rhine-westphalia and hesse - where the spd had previously felt secure .
a poll published wednesday said national support had fallen to a new all-time low of 20 percent after the north rhine-westphalia ruling .
the relationship with the left is at the core of the spd 's problems as the party enters the last year of an unwieldy " grand coalition " at federal level headed by cdu chancellor angela merkel .
currently , the spd shuns the left in western states and at federal level , although it has entered into a coalition with the party in the city-state of berlin .
beck has not helped matters by appearing to switch course two or three times over whether to accept the backing of the left in hesse .
clement stands firm against deal with the left clement has now charted a clear course rejecting any kind of deal with the socialists , and he has the backing of many within his party , as another spd veteran , former hamburg mayor klaus von dohnanyi , has made clear .

"
confident of support on the right wing of the traditional party of the german centre-left , clement is resolutely refusing to back down and is fighting the ruling .
on the surface , the battle is about strong personalities and the inevitable conflict between the right to express opinions freely and the need for party discipline .
but in reality , a classic " richtungsstreit " - an ideological struggle over the party 's political direction - has erupted .
the timing is awkward .
the spd is hoping to make a large dent in the majority enjoyed by the conservative christian social union -lrb- csu -rrb- in the bavarian state election on september 28 .
before the clement affair broke out into the open , opinion polls suggested the csu was likely to lose the absolute majority it has enjoyed in the large southern state since 1962 , with the spd the major benefactor .
clement ignites in-party quarrel bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : wolfgang clement 's comments have drawn the ire of several party officials clement outraged the party with his comments before another state election , in hesse , when he came close to warning against a vote for spd leader andrea ypsilanti on the grounds of her opposition to both nuclear and coal-fired power generation .
" consider carefully and vote carefully on who should be entrusted with responsibility for the state , " he wrote just a week before the jan .
27 poll .
many in the spd blame clement for the inconclusive outcome which left a caretaker government headed by the christian democratic union -lrb- cdu -rrb- in control in hesse .
party members were quick to point out that he had left politics at the end of 2005 for a career in industry - sitting on the board of the major electricity company rwe power .
spd leaders at federal level are desperately trying to calm the situation .
" our aim is to build bridges in this conflict , " party general secretary hubertus heil said , while spd federal chairman kurt beck called for clement 's life-long service to the party to be recognized .
party figures against clement but the conflicting parties were more interested in digging trenches than building bridges .
axel schaefer , a member of parliament for bochum , the ruhr town where clement is registered with the spd , urged the outspoken 68-year-old to go .
" one constantly hears ' me , me , me ' from clement , when we would like to hear ' we ' for a change , " schaefer told local daily westdeutsche allgemeine zeitung .
spd north rhine-westphalia deputy chairman jochen ott labelled clement " arrogant " and urged him to accept that he could not continue to undermine the party , " otherwise he should go of his own accord . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : franz maget says party unity should prevail over all else and spd bavarian chairman franz maget , with his eye fixed on next month 's election , said that , while clement was an " upstanding social democrat , he is also boneheaded . "
maget called for the former economics and labor minister to accept a formal rebuke from the party and to agree to maintain party discipline .
clement made clear that nothing was further from his mind .
" what they are demanding is a muzzle , even in the event that spd leaders somewhere join forces with the left party , and i wo n't be part of it , " he told national public broadcaster zdf .
clement once again had ypsilanti in his sights .
the hesse spd leader this week put out feelers to the socialist left in the state in the hope of forming a minority coalition with the greens based on the tacit support of the left .
spd presented with problem from the left bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " here 's the left " the logo reads - the strong growth of the far-left party has spd leaders scratching their heads how to confront the apparently inexorable rise of the new party with its roots in formerly communist east germany lies at the heart of the struggle .
the spd , whose roots go back to the mid 19th century labor movement , has plumbed all-time lows in opinion polls this year .
the left has eaten steadily into its traditional support base , even in western states - like north rhine-westphalia and hesse - where the spd had previously felt secure .
a poll published wednesday said national support had fallen to a new all-time low of 20 percent after the north rhine-westphalia ruling .
the relationship with the left is at the core of the spd 's problems as the party enters the last year of an unwieldy " grand coalition " at federal level headed by cdu chancellor angela merkel .
currently , the spd shuns the left in western states and at federal level , although it has entered into a coalition with the party in the city-state of berlin .
beck has not helped matters by appearing to switch course two or three times over whether to accept the backing of the left in hesse .
clement stands firm against deal with the left clement has now charted a clear course rejecting any kind of deal with the socialists , and he has the backing of many within his party , as another spd veteran , former hamburg mayor klaus von dohnanyi , has made clear .
" it would be a big mistake to expel clement .
he 's not alone within the spd in taking this position , " the party heavyweight said . dpa news agency -lrb- dm -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

now , the largest remaining stretch of it is to be touched up to preserve art works against weather damage and vandalism .
but how long can it stay spic and span ? berlin 's muehlenstrasse - a four-lane thoroughfare largely devoid of buildings and full of speeding traffic - is n't the sort of street that would usually attract a lot of tourists .
but some half a million visitors come every year to look at the east side gallery , a 1,316-meter stretch of reconstituted berlin wall .
the " gallery , " which was originally set up in 1990 after the fall of east german communism , features works by 118 artists from 21 countries - many of them chipped by the elements and obscured by graffiti .
as of october , however , those artists have been invited to come to berlin to restore their works and spruce up one of the german capital 's most unlikely tourist attractions .
around half of the two million euros -lrb- $ 3.1 million -rrb- needed for the renovations come from the eu , the german government and the city .
the rest is covered by lottery funds .
iranian organizer , german history bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : among the works to be restored is alavi 's own the project is the brainchild of an artists ' initiative headed by iranian kani alavi , who has lived in berlin since 1980 and whose work is also immortalized on the harsh concrete remnants of communism .
ironically , the east-facing gallery represents what the wall looked like from the west , since residents of communist east germany were forbidden from even touching , let alone decorating it .
equally ironically , one of the problems for the gallery is people picking at it to hack out souvenirs - disregarding signs posted to inform visitors that they were standing before a piece of history .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the ugly bits of graffiti will be removed - but will vandals respect the monument ?
" we tried that , but someone stole the signs - they work well as souvenirs , too , " alavi told berlin 's tagesspiegel newspaper .
this is n't the first gallery renovation .
in 2000 , a german paint company sponsored the restoration of some 40 meters of original art works , but this is the first time the gallery as a whole has been scheduled for a touch-up .
if all goes to plan , work will be finished by november 9 , 2009 - in time to celebrate the twentieth anniversary of the opening of the berlin wall . dw staff -lrb- jc -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" russian companies are extremely interested in modernizing their machinery and equipment , ” nikitin said .
" and it 's only natural that many of them are trying to do this with the help of a strong , reliable and experienced partner .
this is why they turn to germany to make use of the country ’ s technical expertise and with it expand their product range .

on many occasions it was unclear where the money came from and what investors planned to do with it exactly . that 's likely to change over the next couple of years , however with russia ’ s expected entry into the world trade organization . investment has also been made easier by the new russian president ’ s promise to work towards liberalizing the domestic economy and fighting corruption . during his recent visit to germany , dmitry medvedev called on the german business community to treat russian companies and investors as equal partners .
he said there was no reason to keep restrictions for russian investors in place . german companies are likewise speaking of a new openness and transparency when it comes to mutually beneficial deals .
" of course there are still some prejudices in place , " said nikitin .
" but once it gets down to nitty-gritty and german and russian businessmen deal with the details of their contracts , misconceptions and prejudices are usually removed very fast . “ it ’ s a new situation for the german business community to deal with russian partners on this scale , " he added . scales tipping in russia 's favor ? the scale , however , still appears to be tipped in germany ’ s favor .

6 . germany 's chef de mission in beijing , michael vesper , told the dpa news agency that nowitzki was chosen because he represents the olympic idea like no other athlete . " it has been a dream of dirk nowitzki for years to be at the olympics , " he added .
" this dream has now become reality . " competing at the olympics wo n't be the only first for the 30-year-old born in the bavarian city of wuerzburg .
he is also the first basketball player to carry the german flag at an olympics , succeeding show jumper ludger beerbaum -lrb- 2004 -rrb- , kayak canoe racer birgit fischer -lrb- 2000 -rrb- and fencer arnd schmitt -lrb- 1996 -rrb- . nowitzki said competing at an olympic games is something that has motivated him since a very young age . " on friday -lsb- at the opening ceremony -rsb- , i will experience something astonishing , " nowitzki said at a press conference on wednesday .
" i never thought i would be chosen to carry the flag but maybe it 's happened because a lot of athletes identify with me . " the opposition bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : gymnast fabian hambuchen was the committee 's first choice but he declined the offer birgit fischer , an eight-time olympic gold medalist who retired after the athens games four years ago , was critical when it was first suggested nowitzki , one of the biggest earners in the nba , might carry the flag as , in her eyes , he did not represent one of germany 's traditional olympic sports . gymnast fabian hambuchen , the world high-bar champion , had been the german olympic committee 's first choice to be their flag-bearer but he declined the offer because his event takes place on saturday . german basketball returns to the olympics dallas mavericks forward nowitzki played a key role in ensuring germany clinched the final qualifying place on offer in the 12-team line-up for these games by scoring 32 points in a 96-82 victory over puerto rico in july .
that win saw germany into their first olympic basketball tournament since 1992 . the team was also aided by los angeles clippers center chris kaman who , courtesy of his great-grandparents , became a naturalized german citizen at the start of july .

6 , after scaling 120-foot -lrb- 36.6-meter -rrb- light posts near the center of the olympic park and displaying banners calling for a tibet free from chinese rule . the two american and two britons displayed tibetan flags and banners declaring " one world , one dream : free tibet " and " tibet will be free , " the group students for a free tibet said in an email , reuters news agency reported .
one of the banners also said " free tibet " in chinese . according to police , the group gathered at the beichen bridge near the central stadium , known as the bird 's nest , which will host to friday 's opening ceremony .
chinese officials have enforced a strict ban on any public support for the tibetan independence movement . beijing games spokesman sun weide told reporters that china has rules on " assemblies " and expects foreigners to respect them . protests stopped quickly bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : police quickly removed the protestors ' banner from public view within 10 minutes of the banners ' unfurling , firemen arrived in several fire trucks with extended ladders and removed the banners from the light posts , abc news reported . the two men , members of the group students for a free tibet , then reportedly climbed down peacefully and police checked their identification . one of the protesters , who identified himself to abc news as ian thom , 24 , from edinburgh , scotland , said he entered china with a group from britain on a valid tourist visa . " i 'll probably get detained by the police and then ejected out of the country , but i believe it 's not anywhere near the risk or the fear that tibetans are living with under the occupation of the chinese government , " he was quoted as saying by xinhua , china 's state-controlled news agency . zhang heping , director of the opening and closing ceremonies department of the beijing games ' organizing committee , labeled the protest an infringement upon the olympic charter and spirit of the games . however , the stymieing of freedom of speech and reversal of china 's pledge to allow free expression when it originally bid on the games may prove to be a point of embarrassment for the government . visa revoked bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : security has been ramped up with soldiers on guard against protests and disturbances the arrests coincided with the unexplained revocation of a travel visa to china for winter olympic gold medalist joey cheek . the american speed skater was a founder of team darfur , a group of athletes , including 72 current olympians , whose aim is to draw attention to china 's support of sudan and the human rights abuses and humanitarian crisis in sudan 's darfur region .
china is a major buyer of oil pumped in sudan . " i am saddened not to be able to attend the games , " he said as reported by news agency dpa .
" the olympic games represent something powerful : that people can come together from around the world and do things that no one thought were possible . " however , the denial of my visa is a part of a systemic effort by the chinese government to coerce and threaten athletes who are speaking out on behalf of the innocent people of darfur , " cheek added he told the washington post that team darfur 's co-founder , former university water polo player brad greiner , had also had his visa revoked tuesday . dw staff -lrb- dm -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

6 , after scaling 120-foot -lrb- 36.6-meter -rrb- light posts near the center of the olympic park and displaying banners calling for a tibet free from chinese rule . the two american and two britons displayed tibetan flags and banners declaring " one world , one dream : free tibet " and " tibet will be free , " the group students for a free tibet said in an email , reuters news agency reported .
one of the banners also said " free tibet " in chinese . according to police , the group gathered at the beichen bridge near the central stadium , known as the bird 's nest , which will host to friday 's opening ceremony .
chinese officials have enforced a strict ban on any public support for the tibetan independence movement . beijing games spokesman sun weide told reporters that china has rules on " assemblies " and expects foreigners to respect them . protests stopped quickly bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : police quickly removed the protestors ' banner from public view within 10 minutes of the banners ' unfurling , firemen arrived in several fire trucks with extended ladders and removed the banners from the light posts , abc news reported . the two men , members of the group students for a free tibet , then reportedly climbed down peacefully and police checked their identification . one of the protesters , who identified himself to abc news as ian thom , 24 , from edinburgh , scotland , said he entered china with a group from britain on a valid tourist visa . " i 'll probably get detained by the police and then ejected out of the country , but i believe it 's not anywhere near the risk or the fear that tibetans are living with under the occupation of the chinese government , " he was quoted as saying by xinhua , china 's state-controlled news agency . zhang heping , director of the opening and closing ceremonies department of the beijing games ' organizing committee , labeled the protest an infringement upon the olympic charter and spirit of the games . however , the stymieing of freedom of speech and reversal of china 's pledge to allow free expression when it originally bid on the games may prove to be a point of embarrassment for the government . visa revoked bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : security has been ramped up with soldiers on guard against protests and disturbances the arrests coincided with the unexplained revocation of a travel visa to china for winter olympic gold medalist joey cheek . the american speed skater was a founder of team darfur , a group of athletes , including 72 current olympians , whose aim is to draw attention to china 's support of sudan and the human rights abuses and humanitarian crisis in sudan 's darfur region .
china is a major buyer of oil pumped in sudan . " i am saddened not to be able to attend the games , " he said as reported by news agency dpa .
" the olympic games represent something powerful : that people can come together from around the world and do things that no one thought were possible . " however , the denial of my visa is a part of a systemic effort by the chinese government to coerce and threaten athletes who are speaking out on behalf of the innocent people of darfur , " cheek added he told the washington post that team darfur 's co-founder , former university water polo player brad greiner , had also had his visa revoked tuesday . dw staff -lrb- dm -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de politics -pipe- 06.08.2008 germany 's social democrats split over party 's future course großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the spd 's future is clouded by an ideological row between its members a bruising internal squabble has created deep rifts in germany 's social democratic party -lrb- spd -rrb- after the expulsion of a centrist member and the rising challenge posed by a far-left party . the spd 's north rhine-westphalia branch voted last week to expel wolfgang clement , a heavyweight centrist figure and former state premier and prominent minister at federal level , for " breaching party solidarity . "
confident of support on the right wing of the traditional party of the german centre-left , clement is resolutely refusing to back down and is fighting the ruling .
on the surface , the battle is about strong personalities and the inevitable conflict between the right to express opinions freely and the need for party discipline .
but in reality , a classic " richtungsstreit " - an ideological struggle over the party 's political direction - has erupted .
the timing is awkward .
the spd is hoping to make a large dent in the majority enjoyed by the conservative christian social union -lrb- csu -rrb- in the bavarian state election on september 28 .
before the clement affair broke out into the open , opinion polls suggested the csu was likely to lose the absolute majority it has enjoyed in the large southern state since 1962 , with the spd the major benefactor .
clement ignites in-party quarrel bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : wolfgang clement 's comments have drawn the ire of several party officials clement outraged the party with his comments before another state election , in hesse , when he came close to warning against a vote for spd leader andrea ypsilanti on the grounds of her opposition to both nuclear and coal-fired power generation .
" consider carefully and vote carefully on who should be entrusted with responsibility for the state , " he wrote just a week before the jan .
27 poll .
many in the spd blame clement for the inconclusive outcome which left a caretaker government headed by the christian democratic union -lrb- cdu -rrb- in control in hesse .
party members were quick to point out that he had left politics at the end of 2005 for a career in industry - sitting on the board of the major electricity company rwe power .
spd leaders at federal level are desperately trying to calm the situation .
" our aim is to build bridges in this conflict , " party general secretary hubertus heil said , while spd federal chairman kurt beck called for clement 's life-long service to the party to be recognized .
party figures against clement but the conflicting parties were more interested in digging trenches than building bridges .
axel schaefer , a member of parliament for bochum , the ruhr town where clement is registered with the spd , urged the outspoken 68-year-old to go .

" we warn companies of the extremely sensitive nature " of economic ties with iran , thomas steg told a government news conference , adding that berlin also expected firms to employ their " moral sense " if they invest there .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel has said in the past moral considerations and not just export bans should play a role in deals with iran " the government is expecting some sensitivity from businesses , " he added .
steg said the company 's plans to export three liquefied natural gas plants to iran were approved earlier this year because the deal did not violate international sanctions against tehran over its nuclear program or fall under german regulations requiring a government review .
berlin thus did not have to give its authorization , he added .
strong trade links between germany , iran the west accuses iran of enriching uranium to covertly develop nuclear weapons .
iran , the world 's fourth largest oil producer , denies the charge and says it is developing a civilian nuclear program to help meet its energy needs .
germany is one of six nations leading diplomatic efforts to push iran to abandon its nuclear work .
germany has scaled back business ties with iran , and german banks have largely ceased doing business with the islamic republic over its nuclear program .
germany is one of iran 's biggest trade partners .
its exports to iran totalled 3.6 billion euros last year .
israel worried by gas deal the israeli government last week expressed concern over the 100-million-euro -lrb- $ 155 million -rrb- deal between germany 's steiner group and tehran to build three liquefied natural gas plants in iran .
" the ministry will talk to the highest officials within the german government to obtain clarification and express its concern over the fact that the german office of export controls gave its green light to the contract , " israeli foreign ministry spokesman arye mekel told the afp news agency .
israel , the region 's sole if undeclared nuclear armed power , considers iran its greatest threat .
" the fact that germany , a member of the european group eu3 , which includes france , britain and germany , is adopting a position that harms international efforts to considerably toughen sanctions against iran over its continued nuclear program , is worrying , " the ministry said in a statement . dw staff -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" the bomber was torn to pieces and three german soldiers were wounded , " the police chief said . a spokesman for the taliban zabiullah mujahid claimed responsibility for the attack .
he claimed that 12 foreign soldiers were killed and three of their military jeeps were destroyed in the bombing . sharp surge in violence around 3,500 german soldiers are stationed in afghanistan as part of more than 50,000 nato forces . german soldiers are based in the northern provinces which are relatively peaceful compared to southern and eastern regions , where a taliban-led insurgency is on the rise . taliban militants , who lost power in a us military invasion in late 2001 , have recently heavily relied on the use of suicide and roadside attacks , both tactics widely believed to have been copied from iraqi insurgents . afghanistan has witnessed a sharp surge in taliban attacks as the weather has become warmer in the border regions of the country neighboring pakistan where afghan and western military officials claim that the militants are given safe havens . more us soldiers were killed in action in the country during the months of may and june , compared to the us military death toll in iraq . dpa news agency -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

hilton 's subsequent assurance that she is " like totally ready to lead , " while thumbing through a travel magazine in search of the best place to improve her tan , is also on the money .

but dw 's jefferson chase says paris hilton 's parodic defense of barack obama 's berlin speech effectively skewered the xenophobia of john mccain 's attack ads . it 's no accident that hilton 's tongue-in-cheek video , which dominated the internet on wednesday , august 6 , starts with a crowd shot from barack obama 's july speech in front of berlin 's victory column .
that 's precisely the way the mccain campaign began its own anti-obama advertisement entitled " celebrity , " following it up with brief images of britney spears and hilton herself .
the somewhat muddled message was that , by having the audacity to speak to 200,000 people in a major world city in a country closely allied with the us , the democratic candidate was descending to the level of a tabloid celebrity .
any time anyone in europe takes an interest in a us election , so the implicit logic , something must be deeply fishy and anti-american .

but the " wrinkly white-haired guy " - as hilton , channeling the gut feelings of millions of americans under the age of 50 , called the presumptive republican nominee - did n't count on his celebrity adversary fighting back .
her video matches mccain 's image for image , showing pictures of tv retirees the golden girls , fawning cnn interviewer larry king and colonel sanders , the white-bearded mascot of the kentucky fried chicken food chain .
a portentous off-screen voice intones " he 's the oldest celebrity in the world , " then asks : " but is he ready to lead ? "
the point , an entirely valid one , is that as the world 's most famous politician an american president is by definition a celebrity .
indeed , the ability to manage fame is part of the job .
hilton 's subsequent assurance that she is " like totally ready to lead , " while thumbing through a travel magazine in search of the best place to improve her tan , is also on the money .
after all , what can any rational person hope to learn about a candidate 's inner readiness to lead a country like the us from a medium as surface-oriented as tv ?

hilton , whose previous most popular performance in an internet video came in a badly lit home-porn movie , seems to understand this , as her obvious preference for the " guy who wants change " over the " white-haired dude " indicates .

he claimed that 12 foreign soldiers were killed and three of their military jeeps were destroyed in the bombing . sharp surge in violence around 3,500 german soldiers are stationed in afghanistan as part of more than 50,000 nato forces . german soldiers are based in the northern provinces which are relatively peaceful compared to southern and eastern regions , where a taliban-led insurgency is on the rise . taliban militants , who lost power in a us military invasion in late 2001 , have recently heavily relied on the use of suicide and roadside attacks , both tactics widely believed to have been copied from iraqi insurgents . afghanistan has witnessed a sharp surge in taliban attacks as the weather has become warmer in the border regions of the country neighboring pakistan where afghan and western military officials claim that the militants are given safe havens . more us soldiers were killed in action in the country during the months of may and june , compared to the us military death toll in iraq . dpa news agency -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

6 , overturned a decision at the end of july by fifa , soccer 's world governing authority , requiring teams to release under-23 players to join their national sides in beijing .
the three most prominent players affected were lionel messi of barcelona , werder bremen playmaker diego and schalke defender rafinha . the cas ruling was based on the fact that the olympics are not part of soccer 's official international calendar . but the court also issued a statement calling upon " the good will and good sense of fifa and the clubs to find a reasonable solution with regard to players who wish to represent their country at the olympic games . " all three clubs say they wo n't force the players to come back to europe .
" at this late stage it makes no sense to order diego to come back to bremen , " bremen ceo klaus allofs said in a statement .
bad feelings all around bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : things have been tense at bremen since diego 's unexpected departure but allofs added that the decision was contingent upon the brazilian football association taking out appropriate insurance in case the players were injured . the olympic soccer competition coincides with the start of the german bundesliga season and the qualifying round for the champions league , in which both schalke and barcelona face crucial matches . messi joined the argentinean side in beijing after the july fifa ruling .
diego and rafinha , more controversially , simply went awol from their respective clubs ' pre-season preparations to hook up with the brazilian national team . that did n't make their employers very happy . " we do n't feel like the big winners , " schalke commercial manager andreas mueller said in a statement . " due to delays , we were put in a situation of having to decide whether to recall our player five minutes before the start of the olympic soccer tournament , " mueller said . association to blame bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : schalke will have to do without rafinha , left , in the champions league qualifiers and club officials left no doubt as to which body they held most culpable for the confusion surrounding the clubs ' rights and responsibilities . " fifa has failed in its attempt to nullify existing legal paragraphs and make new rules , " allofs said .
" it was our duty to defend ourselves against these arbitrary decisions . " league representatives concurred . " fifa irresponsibly failed to recognize the legal situation in time , " said holger hieronymus , head of the german football league , dfl . the clubs have settled the olympic conflict of interest by sacrificing theirs .

" a single mistake of his led to karadzic 's arrest , " rasim ljajic , the serbian minister in charge of cooperation with the hague-based icty , said in an interview with vecernje novosti daily . isolated internationally over its role in the wars in the former yugoslavia during the 1990s , the united states and european union have called on serbia to arrest all war-crimes suspects . suspect hunt linked to eu membership bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : it is hoped karadzic 's arrest can shed light on the location of two other wanted war criminals to continue toward membership of the european union after karadzic 's arrest , belgrade must still arrest the bosnian-serb wartime military chief ratko mladic , who is accused of the slaughter of 8,000 muslims at srebrenica in 1995 . the only other remaining fugitive is lesser-known croatian serb leader goran hadzic . ljajic said he could not tell when the next arrest would occur . although much of karadzic 's time in hiding remains shrouded in uncertainty , the few details revealed about the former political leader during this period , such as his career as an alternative healer , appear bizarre . ljajic said karadzic 's " not very massive " support network was being investigated for possible links with mladic . " it 's early to judge whether some of ...
karadzic 's people are also in mladic 's network , " ljajic said .
" we learned a lot , but are still reconstructing karadzic 's movements . " appeal for surrender ljajic once more repeated the call to mladic and hadzic to turn themselves in . " it would be best for them , their families and the country , " he said . ljajic 's appeal was echoed by serbian defense minister dragan sutanovac , who in a separate interview said , " the whole of serbia is a hostage of mladic and hadzic .

" we warn companies of the extremely sensitive nature " of economic ties with iran , thomas steg told a government news conference , adding that berlin also expected firms to employ their " moral sense " if they invest there .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel has said in the past moral considerations and not just export bans should play a role in deals with iran " the government is expecting some sensitivity from businesses , " he added .
steg said the company 's plans to export three liquefied natural gas plants to iran were approved earlier this year because the deal did not violate international sanctions against tehran over its nuclear program or fall under german regulations requiring a government review .
berlin thus did not have to give its authorization , he added .
strong trade links between germany , iran the west accuses iran of enriching uranium to covertly develop nuclear weapons .
iran , the world 's fourth largest oil producer , denies the charge and says it is developing a civilian nuclear program to help meet its energy needs .
germany is one of six nations leading diplomatic efforts to push iran to abandon its nuclear work .
germany has scaled back business ties with iran , and german banks have largely ceased doing business with the islamic republic over its nuclear program .
germany is one of iran 's biggest trade partners .
its exports to iran totalled 3.6 billion euros last year .
israel worried by gas deal the israeli government last week expressed concern over the 100-million-euro -lrb- $ 155 million -rrb- deal between germany 's steiner group and tehran to build three liquefied natural gas plants in iran .
" the ministry will talk to the highest officials within the german government to obtain clarification and express its concern over the fact that the german office of export controls gave its green light to the contract , " israeli foreign ministry spokesman arye mekel told the afp news agency .
israel , the region 's sole if undeclared nuclear armed power , considers iran its greatest threat .
" the fact that germany , a member of the european group eu3 , which includes france , britain and germany , is adopting a position that harms international efforts to considerably toughen sanctions against iran over its continued nuclear program , is worrying , " the ministry said in a statement . dw staff -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?
dw-world.de israel criticizes german-iranian power deal israel has expressed its disappointment at germany 's decision to permit a firm to build three gas plants in iran , saying it contravened the spirit of the un sanctions aimed at halting tehran 's nuclear program .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de politics -pipe- 06.08.2008 germany 's social democrats split over party 's future course großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the spd 's future is clouded by an ideological row between its members a bruising internal squabble has created deep rifts in germany 's social democratic party -lrb- spd -rrb- after the expulsion of a centrist member and the rising challenge posed by a far-left party . the spd 's north rhine-westphalia branch voted last week to expel wolfgang clement , a heavyweight centrist figure and former state premier and prominent minister at federal level , for " breaching party solidarity . "
confident of support on the right wing of the traditional party of the german centre-left , clement is resolutely refusing to back down and is fighting the ruling .
on the surface , the battle is about strong personalities and the inevitable conflict between the right to express opinions freely and the need for party discipline .
but in reality , a classic " richtungsstreit " - an ideological struggle over the party 's political direction - has erupted .
the timing is awkward .
the spd is hoping to make a large dent in the majority enjoyed by the conservative christian social union -lrb- csu -rrb- in the bavarian state election on september 28 .

"
confident of support on the right wing of the traditional party of the german centre-left , clement is resolutely refusing to back down and is fighting the ruling .
on the surface , the battle is about strong personalities and the inevitable conflict between the right to express opinions freely and the need for party discipline .
but in reality , a classic " richtungsstreit " - an ideological struggle over the party 's political direction - has erupted .
the timing is awkward .
the spd is hoping to make a large dent in the majority enjoyed by the conservative christian social union -lrb- csu -rrb- in the bavarian state election on september 28 .
before the clement affair broke out into the open , opinion polls suggested the csu was likely to lose the absolute majority it has enjoyed in the large southern state since 1962 , with the spd the major benefactor .
clement ignites in-party quarrel bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : wolfgang clement 's comments have drawn the ire of several party officials clement outraged the party with his comments before another state election , in hesse , when he came close to warning against a vote for spd leader andrea ypsilanti on the grounds of her opposition to both nuclear and coal-fired power generation .
" consider carefully and vote carefully on who should be entrusted with responsibility for the state , " he wrote just a week before the jan .
27 poll .
many in the spd blame clement for the inconclusive outcome which left a caretaker government headed by the christian democratic union -lrb- cdu -rrb- in control in hesse .
party members were quick to point out that he had left politics at the end of 2005 for a career in industry - sitting on the board of the major electricity company rwe power .
spd leaders at federal level are desperately trying to calm the situation .
" our aim is to build bridges in this conflict , " party general secretary hubertus heil said , while spd federal chairman kurt beck called for clement 's life-long service to the party to be recognized .
party figures against clement but the conflicting parties were more interested in digging trenches than building bridges .
axel schaefer , a member of parliament for bochum , the ruhr town where clement is registered with the spd , urged the outspoken 68-year-old to go .
" one constantly hears ' me , me , me ' from clement , when we would like to hear ' we ' for a change , " schaefer told local daily westdeutsche allgemeine zeitung .
spd north rhine-westphalia deputy chairman jochen ott labelled clement " arrogant " and urged him to accept that he could not continue to undermine the party , " otherwise he should go of his own accord . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : franz maget says party unity should prevail over all else and spd bavarian chairman franz maget , with his eye fixed on next month 's election , said that , while clement was an " upstanding social democrat , he is also boneheaded . "
maget called for the former economics and labor minister to accept a formal rebuke from the party and to agree to maintain party discipline .
clement made clear that nothing was further from his mind .
" what they are demanding is a muzzle , even in the event that spd leaders somewhere join forces with the left party , and i wo n't be part of it , " he told national public broadcaster zdf .
clement once again had ypsilanti in his sights .
the hesse spd leader this week put out feelers to the socialist left in the state in the hope of forming a minority coalition with the greens based on the tacit support of the left .
spd presented with problem from the left bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " here 's the left " the logo reads - the strong growth of the far-left party has spd leaders scratching their heads how to confront the apparently inexorable rise of the new party with its roots in formerly communist east germany lies at the heart of the struggle .
the spd , whose roots go back to the mid 19th century labor movement , has plumbed all-time lows in opinion polls this year .
the left has eaten steadily into its traditional support base , even in western states - like north rhine-westphalia and hesse - where the spd had previously felt secure .
a poll published wednesday said national support had fallen to a new all-time low of 20 percent after the north rhine-westphalia ruling .
the relationship with the left is at the core of the spd 's problems as the party enters the last year of an unwieldy " grand coalition " at federal level headed by cdu chancellor angela merkel .
currently , the spd shuns the left in western states and at federal level , although it has entered into a coalition with the party in the city-state of berlin .
beck has not helped matters by appearing to switch course two or three times over whether to accept the backing of the left in hesse .
clement stands firm against deal with the left clement has now charted a clear course rejecting any kind of deal with the socialists , and he has the backing of many within his party , as another spd veteran , former hamburg mayor klaus von dohnanyi , has made clear .

" we warn companies of the extremely sensitive nature " of economic ties with iran , thomas steg told a government news conference , adding that berlin also expected firms to employ their " moral sense " if they invest there .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel has said in the past moral considerations and not just export bans should play a role in deals with iran " the government is expecting some sensitivity from businesses , " he added .
steg said the company 's plans to export three liquefied natural gas plants to iran were approved earlier this year because the deal did not violate international sanctions against tehran over its nuclear program or fall under german regulations requiring a government review .
berlin thus did not have to give its authorization , he added .
strong trade links between germany , iran the west accuses iran of enriching uranium to covertly develop nuclear weapons .
iran , the world 's fourth largest oil producer , denies the charge and says it is developing a civilian nuclear program to help meet its energy needs .
germany is one of six nations leading diplomatic efforts to push iran to abandon its nuclear work .
germany has scaled back business ties with iran , and german banks have largely ceased doing business with the islamic republic over its nuclear program .
germany is one of iran 's biggest trade partners .
its exports to iran totalled 3.6 billion euros last year .
israel worried by gas deal the israeli government last week expressed concern over the 100-million-euro -lrb- $ 155 million -rrb- deal between germany 's steiner group and tehran to build three liquefied natural gas plants in iran .
" the ministry will talk to the highest officials within the german government to obtain clarification and express its concern over the fact that the german office of export controls gave its green light to the contract , " israeli foreign ministry spokesman arye mekel told the afp news agency .
israel , the region 's sole if undeclared nuclear armed power , considers iran its greatest threat .
" the fact that germany , a member of the european group eu3 , which includes france , britain and germany , is adopting a position that harms international efforts to considerably toughen sanctions against iran over its continued nuclear program , is worrying , " the ministry said in a statement . dw staff -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?
dw-world.de israel criticizes german-iranian power deal israel has expressed its disappointment at germany 's decision to permit a firm to build three gas plants in iran , saying it contravened the spirit of the un sanctions aimed at halting tehran 's nuclear program .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de in focus : the race for the white house mccain would be good for trans-atlantic trade , says expert top democrat promises obama , mccain would ' listen to europe ' world opinion sways us voters , ambassador says german expert praises mccain 's tightrope walk with palin opinion -pipe- 06.08.2008 opinion : hilton hit the mark with anti-mccain spoof großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : celebrity heiresses are n't usually worth listening to .
but dw 's jefferson chase says paris hilton 's parodic defense of barack obama 's berlin speech effectively skewered the xenophobia of john mccain 's attack ads . it 's no accident that hilton 's tongue-in-cheek video , which dominated the internet on wednesday , august 6 , starts with a crowd shot from barack obama 's july speech in front of berlin 's victory column .
that 's precisely the way the mccain campaign began its own anti-obama advertisement entitled " celebrity , " following it up with brief images of britney spears and hilton herself .
the somewhat muddled message was that , by having the audacity to speak to 200,000 people in a major world city in a country closely allied with the us , the democratic candidate was descending to the level of a tabloid celebrity .
any time anyone in europe takes an interest in a us election , so the implicit logic , something must be deeply fishy and anti-american .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de in focus : the race for the white house mccain would be good for trans-atlantic trade , says expert top democrat promises obama , mccain would ' listen to europe ' world opinion sways us voters , ambassador says german expert praises mccain 's tightrope walk with palin opinion -pipe- 06.08.2008 opinion : hilton hit the mark with anti-mccain spoof großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : celebrity heiresses are n't usually worth listening to .
but dw 's jefferson chase says paris hilton 's parodic defense of barack obama 's berlin speech effectively skewered the xenophobia of john mccain 's attack ads . it 's no accident that hilton 's tongue-in-cheek video , which dominated the internet on wednesday , august 6 , starts with a crowd shot from barack obama 's july speech in front of berlin 's victory column .
that 's precisely the way the mccain campaign began its own anti-obama advertisement entitled " celebrity , " following it up with brief images of britney spears and hilton herself .
the somewhat muddled message was that , by having the audacity to speak to 200,000 people in a major world city in a country closely allied with the us , the democratic candidate was descending to the level of a tabloid celebrity .
any time anyone in europe takes an interest in a us election , so the implicit logic , something must be deeply fishy and anti-american .
what a change from the go-it-alone stance of the bush administration , which led to such cost-efficient and confidence-building global solutions as the iraq war .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hilton did n't have any problems with this white-haired dude ...
and what an example of consistency from the republican party , whose modern-day hero , ronald reagan , began his political career as a foreign-policy expert … um , wait … a celebrity .
but the " wrinkly white-haired guy " - as hilton , channeling the gut feelings of millions of americans under the age of 50 , called the presumptive republican nominee - did n't count on his celebrity adversary fighting back .
her video matches mccain 's image for image , showing pictures of tv retirees the golden girls , fawning cnn interviewer larry king and colonel sanders , the white-bearded mascot of the kentucky fried chicken food chain .
a portentous off-screen voice intones " he 's the oldest celebrity in the world , " then asks : " but is he ready to lead ? "
the point , an entirely valid one , is that as the world 's most famous politician an american president is by definition a celebrity .
indeed , the ability to manage fame is part of the job .
hilton 's subsequent assurance that she is " like totally ready to lead , " while thumbing through a travel magazine in search of the best place to improve her tan , is also on the money .
after all , what can any rational person hope to learn about a candidate 's inner readiness to lead a country like the us from a medium as surface-oriented as tv ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ... this one , however , rubbed her the wrong way all one can reasonably glean from television ads are a few indications of the candidates ' positions - and of the depths to which their campaigns are willing to sink to win the election .
in mccain 's case , the latter include playing on a primitive suspicion and ignorance of europe that post-bush america would do well to discard .
hilton , whose previous most popular performance in an internet video came in a badly lit home-porn movie , seems to understand this , as her obvious preference for the " guy who wants change " over the " white-haired dude " indicates .
by wearing her heart on her sleeve , instead of having sex for the camera , the celebrity heiress has finally made something worth watching .
and made the self-proclaimed serious , experienced candidate john mccain look pretty foolish . jefferson chase send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?
dw-world.de republican video mocks obama 's visit to berlin set to a pulsing techno beat , a new web parody links democratic presidential candidate barack obama to david hasselhoff and che guevara .

the spd is hoping to make a large dent in the majority enjoyed by the conservative christian social union -lrb- csu -rrb- in the bavarian state election on september 28 .
before the clement affair broke out into the open , opinion polls suggested the csu was likely to lose the absolute majority it has enjoyed in the large southern state since 1962 , with the spd the major benefactor .

axel schaefer , a member of parliament for bochum , the ruhr town where clement is registered with the spd , urged the outspoken 68-year-old to go .
" one constantly hears ' me , me , me ' from clement , when we would like to hear ' we ' for a change , " schaefer told local daily westdeutsche allgemeine zeitung .

a poll published wednesday said national support had fallen to a new all-time low of 20 percent after the north rhine-westphalia ruling .
the relationship with the left is at the core of the spd 's problems as the party enters the last year of an unwieldy " grand coalition " at federal level headed by cdu chancellor angela merkel .
currently , the spd shuns the left in western states and at federal level , although it has entered into a coalition with the party in the city-state of berlin .

"
confident of support on the right wing of the traditional party of the german centre-left , clement is resolutely refusing to back down and is fighting the ruling .
on the surface , the battle is about strong personalities and the inevitable conflict between the right to express opinions freely and the need for party discipline .
but in reality , a classic " richtungsstreit " - an ideological struggle over the party 's political direction - has erupted .
the timing is awkward .
the spd is hoping to make a large dent in the majority enjoyed by the conservative christian social union -lrb- csu -rrb- in the bavarian state election on september 28 .
before the clement affair broke out into the open , opinion polls suggested the csu was likely to lose the absolute majority it has enjoyed in the large southern state since 1962 , with the spd the major benefactor .
clement ignites in-party quarrel bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : wolfgang clement 's comments have drawn the ire of several party officials clement outraged the party with his comments before another state election , in hesse , when he came close to warning against a vote for spd leader andrea ypsilanti on the grounds of her opposition to both nuclear and coal-fired power generation .
" consider carefully and vote carefully on who should be entrusted with responsibility for the state , " he wrote just a week before the jan .
27 poll .
many in the spd blame clement for the inconclusive outcome which left a caretaker government headed by the christian democratic union -lrb- cdu -rrb- in control in hesse .
party members were quick to point out that he had left politics at the end of 2005 for a career in industry - sitting on the board of the major electricity company rwe power .
spd leaders at federal level are desperately trying to calm the situation .
" our aim is to build bridges in this conflict , " party general secretary hubertus heil said , while spd federal chairman kurt beck called for clement 's life-long service to the party to be recognized .
party figures against clement but the conflicting parties were more interested in digging trenches than building bridges .
axel schaefer , a member of parliament for bochum , the ruhr town where clement is registered with the spd , urged the outspoken 68-year-old to go .
" one constantly hears ' me , me , me ' from clement , when we would like to hear ' we ' for a change , " schaefer told local daily westdeutsche allgemeine zeitung .
spd north rhine-westphalia deputy chairman jochen ott labelled clement " arrogant " and urged him to accept that he could not continue to undermine the party , " otherwise he should go of his own accord . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : franz maget says party unity should prevail over all else and spd bavarian chairman franz maget , with his eye fixed on next month 's election , said that , while clement was an " upstanding social democrat , he is also boneheaded . "
maget called for the former economics and labor minister to accept a formal rebuke from the party and to agree to maintain party discipline .
clement made clear that nothing was further from his mind .
" what they are demanding is a muzzle , even in the event that spd leaders somewhere join forces with the left party , and i wo n't be part of it , " he told national public broadcaster zdf .
clement once again had ypsilanti in his sights .
the hesse spd leader this week put out feelers to the socialist left in the state in the hope of forming a minority coalition with the greens based on the tacit support of the left .
spd presented with problem from the left bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " here 's the left " the logo reads - the strong growth of the far-left party has spd leaders scratching their heads how to confront the apparently inexorable rise of the new party with its roots in formerly communist east germany lies at the heart of the struggle .
the spd , whose roots go back to the mid 19th century labor movement , has plumbed all-time lows in opinion polls this year .
the left has eaten steadily into its traditional support base , even in western states - like north rhine-westphalia and hesse - where the spd had previously felt secure .
a poll published wednesday said national support had fallen to a new all-time low of 20 percent after the north rhine-westphalia ruling .
the relationship with the left is at the core of the spd 's problems as the party enters the last year of an unwieldy " grand coalition " at federal level headed by cdu chancellor angela merkel .
currently , the spd shuns the left in western states and at federal level , although it has entered into a coalition with the party in the city-state of berlin .
beck has not helped matters by appearing to switch course two or three times over whether to accept the backing of the left in hesse .
clement stands firm against deal with the left clement has now charted a clear course rejecting any kind of deal with the socialists , and he has the backing of many within his party , as another spd veteran , former hamburg mayor klaus von dohnanyi , has made clear .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de in focus : the race for the white house mccain would be good for trans-atlantic trade , says expert top democrat promises obama , mccain would ' listen to europe ' world opinion sways us voters , ambassador says german expert praises mccain 's tightrope walk with palin opinion -pipe- 06.08.2008 opinion : hilton hit the mark with anti-mccain spoof großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : celebrity heiresses are n't usually worth listening to .
but dw 's jefferson chase says paris hilton 's parodic defense of barack obama 's berlin speech effectively skewered the xenophobia of john mccain 's attack ads . it 's no accident that hilton 's tongue-in-cheek video , which dominated the internet on wednesday , august 6 , starts with a crowd shot from barack obama 's july speech in front of berlin 's victory column .
that 's precisely the way the mccain campaign began its own anti-obama advertisement entitled " celebrity , " following it up with brief images of britney spears and hilton herself .
the somewhat muddled message was that , by having the audacity to speak to 200,000 people in a major world city in a country closely allied with the us , the democratic candidate was descending to the level of a tabloid celebrity .
any time anyone in europe takes an interest in a us election , so the implicit logic , something must be deeply fishy and anti-american .
what a change from the go-it-alone stance of the bush administration , which led to such cost-efficient and confidence-building global solutions as the iraq war .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hilton did n't have any problems with this white-haired dude ...

but dw 's jefferson chase says paris hilton 's parodic defense of barack obama 's berlin speech effectively skewered the xenophobia of john mccain 's attack ads . it 's no accident that hilton 's tongue-in-cheek video , which dominated the internet on wednesday , august 6 , starts with a crowd shot from barack obama 's july speech in front of berlin 's victory column .
that 's precisely the way the mccain campaign began its own anti-obama advertisement entitled " celebrity , " following it up with brief images of britney spears and hilton herself .
the somewhat muddled message was that , by having the audacity to speak to 200,000 people in a major world city in a country closely allied with the us , the democratic candidate was descending to the level of a tabloid celebrity .
any time anyone in europe takes an interest in a us election , so the implicit logic , something must be deeply fishy and anti-american .
what a change from the go-it-alone stance of the bush administration , which led to such cost-efficient and confidence-building global solutions as the iraq war .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hilton did n't have any problems with this white-haired dude ...
and what an example of consistency from the republican party , whose modern-day hero , ronald reagan , began his political career as a foreign-policy expert … um , wait … a celebrity .
but the " wrinkly white-haired guy " - as hilton , channeling the gut feelings of millions of americans under the age of 50 , called the presumptive republican nominee - did n't count on his celebrity adversary fighting back .
her video matches mccain 's image for image , showing pictures of tv retirees the golden girls , fawning cnn interviewer larry king and colonel sanders , the white-bearded mascot of the kentucky fried chicken food chain .
a portentous off-screen voice intones " he 's the oldest celebrity in the world , " then asks : " but is he ready to lead ? "
the point , an entirely valid one , is that as the world 's most famous politician an american president is by definition a celebrity .
indeed , the ability to manage fame is part of the job .
hilton 's subsequent assurance that she is " like totally ready to lead , " while thumbing through a travel magazine in search of the best place to improve her tan , is also on the money .
after all , what can any rational person hope to learn about a candidate 's inner readiness to lead a country like the us from a medium as surface-oriented as tv ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ... this one , however , rubbed her the wrong way all one can reasonably glean from television ads are a few indications of the candidates ' positions - and of the depths to which their campaigns are willing to sink to win the election .
in mccain 's case , the latter include playing on a primitive suspicion and ignorance of europe that post-bush america would do well to discard .
hilton , whose previous most popular performance in an internet video came in a badly lit home-porn movie , seems to understand this , as her obvious preference for the " guy who wants change " over the " white-haired dude " indicates .
by wearing her heart on her sleeve , instead of having sex for the camera , the celebrity heiress has finally made something worth watching .

" we warn companies of the extremely sensitive nature " of economic ties with iran , thomas steg told a government news conference , adding that berlin also expected firms to employ their " moral sense " if they invest there .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel has said in the past moral considerations and not just export bans should play a role in deals with iran " the government is expecting some sensitivity from businesses , " he added .
steg said the company 's plans to export three liquefied natural gas plants to iran were approved earlier this year because the deal did not violate international sanctions against tehran over its nuclear program or fall under german regulations requiring a government review .
berlin thus did not have to give its authorization , he added .
strong trade links between germany , iran the west accuses iran of enriching uranium to covertly develop nuclear weapons .
iran , the world 's fourth largest oil producer , denies the charge and says it is developing a civilian nuclear program to help meet its energy needs .
germany is one of six nations leading diplomatic efforts to push iran to abandon its nuclear work .
germany has scaled back business ties with iran , and german banks have largely ceased doing business with the islamic republic over its nuclear program .
germany is one of iran 's biggest trade partners .
its exports to iran totalled 3.6 billion euros last year .
israel worried by gas deal the israeli government last week expressed concern over the 100-million-euro -lrb- $ 155 million -rrb- deal between germany 's steiner group and tehran to build three liquefied natural gas plants in iran .
" the ministry will talk to the highest officials within the german government to obtain clarification and express its concern over the fact that the german office of export controls gave its green light to the contract , " israeli foreign ministry spokesman arye mekel told the afp news agency .
israel , the region 's sole if undeclared nuclear armed power , considers iran its greatest threat .
" the fact that germany , a member of the european group eu3 , which includes france , britain and germany , is adopting a position that harms international efforts to considerably toughen sanctions against iran over its continued nuclear program , is worrying , " the ministry said in a statement . dw staff -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" we warn companies of the extremely sensitive nature " of economic ties with iran , thomas steg told a government news conference , adding that berlin also expected firms to employ their " moral sense " if they invest there .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel has said in the past moral considerations and not just export bans should play a role in deals with iran " the government is expecting some sensitivity from businesses , " he added .
steg said the company 's plans to export three liquefied natural gas plants to iran were approved earlier this year because the deal did not violate international sanctions against tehran over its nuclear program or fall under german regulations requiring a government review .
berlin thus did not have to give its authorization , he added .
strong trade links between germany , iran the west accuses iran of enriching uranium to covertly develop nuclear weapons .
iran , the world 's fourth largest oil producer , denies the charge and says it is developing a civilian nuclear program to help meet its energy needs .
germany is one of six nations leading diplomatic efforts to push iran to abandon its nuclear work .
germany has scaled back business ties with iran , and german banks have largely ceased doing business with the islamic republic over its nuclear program .
germany is one of iran 's biggest trade partners .
its exports to iran totalled 3.6 billion euros last year .
israel worried by gas deal the israeli government last week expressed concern over the 100-million-euro -lrb- $ 155 million -rrb- deal between germany 's steiner group and tehran to build three liquefied natural gas plants in iran .
" the ministry will talk to the highest officials within the german government to obtain clarification and express its concern over the fact that the german office of export controls gave its green light to the contract , " israeli foreign ministry spokesman arye mekel told the afp news agency .
israel , the region 's sole if undeclared nuclear armed power , considers iran its greatest threat .

" we warn companies of the extremely sensitive nature " of economic ties with iran , thomas steg told a government news conference , adding that berlin also expected firms to employ their " moral sense " if they invest there .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel has said in the past moral considerations and not just export bans should play a role in deals with iran " the government is expecting some sensitivity from businesses , " he added .
steg said the company 's plans to export three liquefied natural gas plants to iran were approved earlier this year because the deal did not violate international sanctions against tehran over its nuclear program or fall under german regulations requiring a government review .
berlin thus did not have to give its authorization , he added .
strong trade links between germany , iran the west accuses iran of enriching uranium to covertly develop nuclear weapons .
iran , the world 's fourth largest oil producer , denies the charge and says it is developing a civilian nuclear program to help meet its energy needs .
germany is one of six nations leading diplomatic efforts to push iran to abandon its nuclear work .
germany has scaled back business ties with iran , and german banks have largely ceased doing business with the islamic republic over its nuclear program .
germany is one of iran 's biggest trade partners .
its exports to iran totalled 3.6 billion euros last year .
israel worried by gas deal the israeli government last week expressed concern over the 100-million-euro -lrb- $ 155 million -rrb- deal between germany 's steiner group and tehran to build three liquefied natural gas plants in iran .
" the ministry will talk to the highest officials within the german government to obtain clarification and express its concern over the fact that the german office of export controls gave its green light to the contract , " israeli foreign ministry spokesman arye mekel told the afp news agency .
israel , the region 's sole if undeclared nuclear armed power , considers iran its greatest threat .
" the fact that germany , a member of the european group eu3 , which includes france , britain and germany , is adopting a position that harms international efforts to considerably toughen sanctions against iran over its continued nuclear program , is worrying , " the ministry said in a statement . dw staff -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the three most prominent players affected were lionel messi of barcelona , werder bremen playmaker diego and schalke defender rafinha . the cas ruling was based on the fact that the olympics are not part of soccer 's official international calendar . but the court also issued a statement calling upon " the good will and good sense of fifa and the clubs to find a reasonable solution with regard to players who wish to represent their country at the olympic games .

" fifa has failed in its attempt to nullify existing legal paragraphs and make new rules , " allofs said .
" it was our duty to defend ourselves against these arbitrary decisions . " league representatives concurred . " fifa irresponsibly failed to recognize the legal situation in time , " said holger hieronymus , head of the german football league , dfl . the clubs have settled the olympic conflict of interest by sacrificing theirs .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de art -pipe- 06.08.2008 famous stretch of berlin wall to be restored großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : this picture of two old men kissing is one of the gallery 's famous images for 28 years , berliners dreamed of tearing down the wall .
now , the largest remaining stretch of it is to be touched up to preserve art works against weather damage and vandalism .
but how long can it stay spic and span ? berlin 's muehlenstrasse - a four-lane thoroughfare largely devoid of buildings and full of speeding traffic - is n't the sort of street that would usually attract a lot of tourists .
but some half a million visitors come every year to look at the east side gallery , a 1,316-meter stretch of reconstituted berlin wall .
the " gallery , " which was originally set up in 1990 after the fall of east german communism , features works by 118 artists from 21 countries - many of them chipped by the elements and obscured by graffiti .
as of october , however , those artists have been invited to come to berlin to restore their works and spruce up one of the german capital 's most unlikely tourist attractions .
around half of the two million euros -lrb- $ 3.1 million -rrb- needed for the renovations come from the eu , the german government and the city .
the rest is covered by lottery funds .
iranian organizer , german history bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : among the works to be restored is alavi 's own the project is the brainchild of an artists ' initiative headed by iranian kani alavi , who has lived in berlin since 1980 and whose work is also immortalized on the harsh concrete remnants of communism .
ironically , the east-facing gallery represents what the wall looked like from the west , since residents of communist east germany were forbidden from even touching , let alone decorating it .
equally ironically , one of the problems for the gallery is people picking at it to hack out souvenirs - disregarding signs posted to inform visitors that they were standing before a piece of history .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the ugly bits of graffiti will be removed - but will vandals respect the monument ?
" we tried that , but someone stole the signs - they work well as souvenirs , too , " alavi told berlin 's tagesspiegel newspaper .
this is n't the first gallery renovation .
in 2000 , a german paint company sponsored the restoration of some 40 meters of original art works , but this is the first time the gallery as a whole has been scheduled for a touch-up .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de politics -pipe- 06.08.2008 germany 's social democrats split over party 's future course großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the spd 's future is clouded by an ideological row between its members a bruising internal squabble has created deep rifts in germany 's social democratic party -lrb- spd -rrb- after the expulsion of a centrist member and the rising challenge posed by a far-left party . the spd 's north rhine-westphalia branch voted last week to expel wolfgang clement , a heavyweight centrist figure and former state premier and prominent minister at federal level , for " breaching party solidarity . "
confident of support on the right wing of the traditional party of the german centre-left , clement is resolutely refusing to back down and is fighting the ruling .
on the surface , the battle is about strong personalities and the inevitable conflict between the right to express opinions freely and the need for party discipline .
but in reality , a classic " richtungsstreit " - an ideological struggle over the party 's political direction - has erupted .
the timing is awkward .
the spd is hoping to make a large dent in the majority enjoyed by the conservative christian social union -lrb- csu -rrb- in the bavarian state election on september 28 .
before the clement affair broke out into the open , opinion polls suggested the csu was likely to lose the absolute majority it has enjoyed in the large southern state since 1962 , with the spd the major benefactor .
clement ignites in-party quarrel bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : wolfgang clement 's comments have drawn the ire of several party officials clement outraged the party with his comments before another state election , in hesse , when he came close to warning against a vote for spd leader andrea ypsilanti on the grounds of her opposition to both nuclear and coal-fired power generation .
" consider carefully and vote carefully on who should be entrusted with responsibility for the state , " he wrote just a week before the jan .
27 poll .
many in the spd blame clement for the inconclusive outcome which left a caretaker government headed by the christian democratic union -lrb- cdu -rrb- in control in hesse .
party members were quick to point out that he had left politics at the end of 2005 for a career in industry - sitting on the board of the major electricity company rwe power .
spd leaders at federal level are desperately trying to calm the situation .
" our aim is to build bridges in this conflict , " party general secretary hubertus heil said , while spd federal chairman kurt beck called for clement 's life-long service to the party to be recognized .
party figures against clement but the conflicting parties were more interested in digging trenches than building bridges .
axel schaefer , a member of parliament for bochum , the ruhr town where clement is registered with the spd , urged the outspoken 68-year-old to go .
" one constantly hears ' me , me , me ' from clement , when we would like to hear ' we ' for a change , " schaefer told local daily westdeutsche allgemeine zeitung .
spd north rhine-westphalia deputy chairman jochen ott labelled clement " arrogant " and urged him to accept that he could not continue to undermine the party , " otherwise he should go of his own accord . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : franz maget says party unity should prevail over all else and spd bavarian chairman franz maget , with his eye fixed on next month 's election , said that , while clement was an " upstanding social democrat , he is also boneheaded . "
maget called for the former economics and labor minister to accept a formal rebuke from the party and to agree to maintain party discipline .
clement made clear that nothing was further from his mind .
" what they are demanding is a muzzle , even in the event that spd leaders somewhere join forces with the left party , and i wo n't be part of it , " he told national public broadcaster zdf .
clement once again had ypsilanti in his sights .
the hesse spd leader this week put out feelers to the socialist left in the state in the hope of forming a minority coalition with the greens based on the tacit support of the left .
spd presented with problem from the left bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " here 's the left " the logo reads - the strong growth of the far-left party has spd leaders scratching their heads how to confront the apparently inexorable rise of the new party with its roots in formerly communist east germany lies at the heart of the struggle .
the spd , whose roots go back to the mid 19th century labor movement , has plumbed all-time lows in opinion polls this year .
the left has eaten steadily into its traditional support base , even in western states - like north rhine-westphalia and hesse - where the spd had previously felt secure .
a poll published wednesday said national support had fallen to a new all-time low of 20 percent after the north rhine-westphalia ruling .

that 's precisely the way the mccain campaign began its own anti-obama advertisement entitled " celebrity , " following it up with brief images of britney spears and hilton herself .

a portentous off-screen voice intones " he 's the oldest celebrity in the world , " then asks : " but is he ready to lead ? "
the point , an entirely valid one , is that as the world 's most famous politician an american president is by definition a celebrity .
indeed , the ability to manage fame is part of the job .
hilton 's subsequent assurance that she is " like totally ready to lead , " while thumbing through a travel magazine in search of the best place to improve her tan , is also on the money .

that 's precisely the way the mccain campaign began its own anti-obama advertisement entitled " celebrity , " following it up with brief images of britney spears and hilton herself .

hilton 's subsequent assurance that she is " like totally ready to lead , " while thumbing through a travel magazine in search of the best place to improve her tan , is also on the money .

6 . germany 's chef de mission in beijing , michael vesper , told the dpa news agency that nowitzki was chosen because he represents the olympic idea like no other athlete . " it has been a dream of dirk nowitzki for years to be at the olympics , " he added .
" this dream has now become reality . " competing at the olympics wo n't be the only first for the 30-year-old born in the bavarian city of wuerzburg .
he is also the first basketball player to carry the german flag at an olympics , succeeding show jumper ludger beerbaum -lrb- 2004 -rrb- , kayak canoe racer birgit fischer -lrb- 2000 -rrb- and fencer arnd schmitt -lrb- 1996 -rrb- . nowitzki said competing at an olympic games is something that has motivated him since a very young age . " on friday -lsb- at the opening ceremony -rsb- , i will experience something astonishing , " nowitzki said at a press conference on wednesday .
" i never thought i would be chosen to carry the flag but maybe it 's happened because a lot of athletes identify with me . " the opposition bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : gymnast fabian hambuchen was the committee 's first choice but he declined the offer birgit fischer , an eight-time olympic gold medalist who retired after the athens games four years ago , was critical when it was first suggested nowitzki , one of the biggest earners in the nba , might carry the flag as , in her eyes , he did not represent one of germany 's traditional olympic sports . gymnast fabian hambuchen , the world high-bar champion , had been the german olympic committee 's first choice to be their flag-bearer but he declined the offer because his event takes place on saturday . german basketball returns to the olympics dallas mavericks forward nowitzki played a key role in ensuring germany clinched the final qualifying place on offer in the 12-team line-up for these games by scoring 32 points in a 96-82 victory over puerto rico in july .
that win saw germany into their first olympic basketball tournament since 1992 . the team was also aided by los angeles clippers center chris kaman who , courtesy of his great-grandparents , became a naturalized german citizen at the start of july .
despite not speaking a world of german at the time , kaman played his part against puerto rico by scoring 10 points with 12 rebounds . the dallas mavericks star last year became the first player from europe to win the nba 's prestigious most valuable player award .

6 , after scaling 120-foot -lrb- 36.6-meter -rrb- light posts near the center of the olympic park and displaying banners calling for a tibet free from chinese rule . the two american and two britons displayed tibetan flags and banners declaring " one world , one dream : free tibet " and " tibet will be free , " the group students for a free tibet said in an email , reuters news agency reported .
one of the banners also said " free tibet " in chinese . according to police , the group gathered at the beichen bridge near the central stadium , known as the bird 's nest , which will host to friday 's opening ceremony .
chinese officials have enforced a strict ban on any public support for the tibetan independence movement . beijing games spokesman sun weide told reporters that china has rules on " assemblies " and expects foreigners to respect them . protests stopped quickly bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : police quickly removed the protestors ' banner from public view within 10 minutes of the banners ' unfurling , firemen arrived in several fire trucks with extended ladders and removed the banners from the light posts , abc news reported . the two men , members of the group students for a free tibet , then reportedly climbed down peacefully and police checked their identification . one of the protesters , who identified himself to abc news as ian thom , 24 , from edinburgh , scotland , said he entered china with a group from britain on a valid tourist visa . " i 'll probably get detained by the police and then ejected out of the country , but i believe it 's not anywhere near the risk or the fear that tibetans are living with under the occupation of the chinese government , " he was quoted as saying by xinhua , china 's state-controlled news agency . zhang heping , director of the opening and closing ceremonies department of the beijing games ' organizing committee , labeled the protest an infringement upon the olympic charter and spirit of the games . however , the stymieing of freedom of speech and reversal of china 's pledge to allow free expression when it originally bid on the games may prove to be a point of embarrassment for the government . visa revoked bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : security has been ramped up with soldiers on guard against protests and disturbances the arrests coincided with the unexplained revocation of a travel visa to china for winter olympic gold medalist joey cheek . the american speed skater was a founder of team darfur , a group of athletes , including 72 current olympians , whose aim is to draw attention to china 's support of sudan and the human rights abuses and humanitarian crisis in sudan 's darfur region .
china is a major buyer of oil pumped in sudan . " i am saddened not to be able to attend the games , " he said as reported by news agency dpa .
" the olympic games represent something powerful : that people can come together from around the world and do things that no one thought were possible . " however , the denial of my visa is a part of a systemic effort by the chinese government to coerce and threaten athletes who are speaking out on behalf of the innocent people of darfur , " cheek added he told the washington post that team darfur 's co-founder , former university water polo player brad greiner , had also had his visa revoked tuesday . dw staff -lrb- dm -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" we warn companies of the extremely sensitive nature " of economic ties with iran , thomas steg told a government news conference , adding that berlin also expected firms to employ their " moral sense " if they invest there .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel has said in the past moral considerations and not just export bans should play a role in deals with iran " the government is expecting some sensitivity from businesses , " he added .
steg said the company 's plans to export three liquefied natural gas plants to iran were approved earlier this year because the deal did not violate international sanctions against tehran over its nuclear program or fall under german regulations requiring a government review .
berlin thus did not have to give its authorization , he added .
strong trade links between germany , iran the west accuses iran of enriching uranium to covertly develop nuclear weapons .
iran , the world 's fourth largest oil producer , denies the charge and says it is developing a civilian nuclear program to help meet its energy needs .
germany is one of six nations leading diplomatic efforts to push iran to abandon its nuclear work .
germany has scaled back business ties with iran , and german banks have largely ceased doing business with the islamic republic over its nuclear program .
germany is one of iran 's biggest trade partners .
its exports to iran totalled 3.6 billion euros last year .
israel worried by gas deal the israeli government last week expressed concern over the 100-million-euro -lrb- $ 155 million -rrb- deal between germany 's steiner group and tehran to build three liquefied natural gas plants in iran .
" the ministry will talk to the highest officials within the german government to obtain clarification and express its concern over the fact that the german office of export controls gave its green light to the contract , " israeli foreign ministry spokesman arye mekel told the afp news agency .
israel , the region 's sole if undeclared nuclear armed power , considers iran its greatest threat .
" the fact that germany , a member of the european group eu3 , which includes france , britain and germany , is adopting a position that harms international efforts to considerably toughen sanctions against iran over its continued nuclear program , is worrying , " the ministry said in a statement . dw staff -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

"
confident of support on the right wing of the traditional party of the german centre-left , clement is resolutely refusing to back down and is fighting the ruling .
on the surface , the battle is about strong personalities and the inevitable conflict between the right to express opinions freely and the need for party discipline .
but in reality , a classic " richtungsstreit " - an ideological struggle over the party 's political direction - has erupted .
the timing is awkward .
the spd is hoping to make a large dent in the majority enjoyed by the conservative christian social union -lrb- csu -rrb- in the bavarian state election on september 28 .
before the clement affair broke out into the open , opinion polls suggested the csu was likely to lose the absolute majority it has enjoyed in the large southern state since 1962 , with the spd the major benefactor .
clement ignites in-party quarrel bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : wolfgang clement 's comments have drawn the ire of several party officials clement outraged the party with his comments before another state election , in hesse , when he came close to warning against a vote for spd leader andrea ypsilanti on the grounds of her opposition to both nuclear and coal-fired power generation .
" consider carefully and vote carefully on who should be entrusted with responsibility for the state , " he wrote just a week before the jan .
27 poll .
many in the spd blame clement for the inconclusive outcome which left a caretaker government headed by the christian democratic union -lrb- cdu -rrb- in control in hesse .
party members were quick to point out that he had left politics at the end of 2005 for a career in industry - sitting on the board of the major electricity company rwe power .
spd leaders at federal level are desperately trying to calm the situation .
" our aim is to build bridges in this conflict , " party general secretary hubertus heil said , while spd federal chairman kurt beck called for clement 's life-long service to the party to be recognized .
party figures against clement but the conflicting parties were more interested in digging trenches than building bridges .
axel schaefer , a member of parliament for bochum , the ruhr town where clement is registered with the spd , urged the outspoken 68-year-old to go .
" one constantly hears ' me , me , me ' from clement , when we would like to hear ' we ' for a change , " schaefer told local daily westdeutsche allgemeine zeitung .
spd north rhine-westphalia deputy chairman jochen ott labelled clement " arrogant " and urged him to accept that he could not continue to undermine the party , " otherwise he should go of his own accord . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : franz maget says party unity should prevail over all else and spd bavarian chairman franz maget , with his eye fixed on next month 's election , said that , while clement was an " upstanding social democrat , he is also boneheaded . "
maget called for the former economics and labor minister to accept a formal rebuke from the party and to agree to maintain party discipline .
clement made clear that nothing was further from his mind .
" what they are demanding is a muzzle , even in the event that spd leaders somewhere join forces with the left party , and i wo n't be part of it , " he told national public broadcaster zdf .
clement once again had ypsilanti in his sights .
the hesse spd leader this week put out feelers to the socialist left in the state in the hope of forming a minority coalition with the greens based on the tacit support of the left .
spd presented with problem from the left bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " here 's the left " the logo reads - the strong growth of the far-left party has spd leaders scratching their heads how to confront the apparently inexorable rise of the new party with its roots in formerly communist east germany lies at the heart of the struggle .
the spd , whose roots go back to the mid 19th century labor movement , has plumbed all-time lows in opinion polls this year .
the left has eaten steadily into its traditional support base , even in western states - like north rhine-westphalia and hesse - where the spd had previously felt secure .
a poll published wednesday said national support had fallen to a new all-time low of 20 percent after the north rhine-westphalia ruling .
the relationship with the left is at the core of the spd 's problems as the party enters the last year of an unwieldy " grand coalition " at federal level headed by cdu chancellor angela merkel .
currently , the spd shuns the left in western states and at federal level , although it has entered into a coalition with the party in the city-state of berlin .
beck has not helped matters by appearing to switch course two or three times over whether to accept the backing of the left in hesse .
clement stands firm against deal with the left clement has now charted a clear course rejecting any kind of deal with the socialists , and he has the backing of many within his party , as another spd veteran , former hamburg mayor klaus von dohnanyi , has made clear .
" it would be a big mistake to expel clement .
he 's not alone within the spd in taking this position , " the party heavyweight said . dpa news agency -lrb- dm -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

6 . germany 's chef de mission in beijing , michael vesper , told the dpa news agency that nowitzki was chosen because he represents the olympic idea like no other athlete . " it has been a dream of dirk nowitzki for years to be at the olympics , " he added .
" this dream has now become reality . " competing at the olympics wo n't be the only first for the 30-year-old born in the bavarian city of wuerzburg .
he is also the first basketball player to carry the german flag at an olympics , succeeding show jumper ludger beerbaum -lrb- 2004 -rrb- , kayak canoe racer birgit fischer -lrb- 2000 -rrb- and fencer arnd schmitt -lrb- 1996 -rrb- . nowitzki said competing at an olympic games is something that has motivated him since a very young age . " on friday -lsb- at the opening ceremony -rsb- , i will experience something astonishing , " nowitzki said at a press conference on wednesday .

that win saw germany into their first olympic basketball tournament since 1992 . the team was also aided by los angeles clippers center chris kaman who , courtesy of his great-grandparents , became a naturalized german citizen at the start of july .
despite not speaking a world of german at the time , kaman played his part against puerto rico by scoring 10 points with 12 rebounds . the dallas mavericks star last year became the first player from europe to win the nba 's prestigious most valuable player award .

now , the largest remaining stretch of it is to be touched up to preserve art works against weather damage and vandalism .
but how long can it stay spic and span ? berlin 's muehlenstrasse - a four-lane thoroughfare largely devoid of buildings and full of speeding traffic - is n't the sort of street that would usually attract a lot of tourists .
but some half a million visitors come every year to look at the east side gallery , a 1,316-meter stretch of reconstituted berlin wall .
the " gallery , " which was originally set up in 1990 after the fall of east german communism , features works by 118 artists from 21 countries - many of them chipped by the elements and obscured by graffiti .
as of october , however , those artists have been invited to come to berlin to restore their works and spruce up one of the german capital 's most unlikely tourist attractions .
around half of the two million euros -lrb- $ 3.1 million -rrb- needed for the renovations come from the eu , the german government and the city .
the rest is covered by lottery funds .
iranian organizer , german history bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : among the works to be restored is alavi 's own the project is the brainchild of an artists ' initiative headed by iranian kani alavi , who has lived in berlin since 1980 and whose work is also immortalized on the harsh concrete remnants of communism .
ironically , the east-facing gallery represents what the wall looked like from the west , since residents of communist east germany were forbidden from even touching , let alone decorating it .
equally ironically , one of the problems for the gallery is people picking at it to hack out souvenirs - disregarding signs posted to inform visitors that they were standing before a piece of history .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the ugly bits of graffiti will be removed - but will vandals respect the monument ?
" we tried that , but someone stole the signs - they work well as souvenirs , too , " alavi told berlin 's tagesspiegel newspaper .
this is n't the first gallery renovation .
in 2000 , a german paint company sponsored the restoration of some 40 meters of original art works , but this is the first time the gallery as a whole has been scheduled for a touch-up .
if all goes to plan , work will be finished by november 9 , 2009 - in time to celebrate the twentieth anniversary of the opening of the berlin wall . dw staff -lrb- jc -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" we warn companies of the extremely sensitive nature " of economic ties with iran , thomas steg told a government news conference , adding that berlin also expected firms to employ their " moral sense " if they invest there .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel has said in the past moral considerations and not just export bans should play a role in deals with iran " the government is expecting some sensitivity from businesses , " he added .
steg said the company 's plans to export three liquefied natural gas plants to iran were approved earlier this year because the deal did not violate international sanctions against tehran over its nuclear program or fall under german regulations requiring a government review .
berlin thus did not have to give its authorization , he added .
strong trade links between germany , iran the west accuses iran of enriching uranium to covertly develop nuclear weapons .
iran , the world 's fourth largest oil producer , denies the charge and says it is developing a civilian nuclear program to help meet its energy needs .
germany is one of six nations leading diplomatic efforts to push iran to abandon its nuclear work .
germany has scaled back business ties with iran , and german banks have largely ceased doing business with the islamic republic over its nuclear program .
germany is one of iran 's biggest trade partners .
its exports to iran totalled 3.6 billion euros last year .
israel worried by gas deal the israeli government last week expressed concern over the 100-million-euro -lrb- $ 155 million -rrb- deal between germany 's steiner group and tehran to build three liquefied natural gas plants in iran .
" the ministry will talk to the highest officials within the german government to obtain clarification and express its concern over the fact that the german office of export controls gave its green light to the contract , " israeli foreign ministry spokesman arye mekel told the afp news agency .
israel , the region 's sole if undeclared nuclear armed power , considers iran its greatest threat .

"
confident of support on the right wing of the traditional party of the german centre-left , clement is resolutely refusing to back down and is fighting the ruling .
on the surface , the battle is about strong personalities and the inevitable conflict between the right to express opinions freely and the need for party discipline .
but in reality , a classic " richtungsstreit " - an ideological struggle over the party 's political direction - has erupted .
the timing is awkward .
the spd is hoping to make a large dent in the majority enjoyed by the conservative christian social union -lrb- csu -rrb- in the bavarian state election on september 28 .
before the clement affair broke out into the open , opinion polls suggested the csu was likely to lose the absolute majority it has enjoyed in the large southern state since 1962 , with the spd the major benefactor .
clement ignites in-party quarrel bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : wolfgang clement 's comments have drawn the ire of several party officials clement outraged the party with his comments before another state election , in hesse , when he came close to warning against a vote for spd leader andrea ypsilanti on the grounds of her opposition to both nuclear and coal-fired power generation .
" consider carefully and vote carefully on who should be entrusted with responsibility for the state , " he wrote just a week before the jan .
27 poll .
many in the spd blame clement for the inconclusive outcome which left a caretaker government headed by the christian democratic union -lrb- cdu -rrb- in control in hesse .
party members were quick to point out that he had left politics at the end of 2005 for a career in industry - sitting on the board of the major electricity company rwe power .
spd leaders at federal level are desperately trying to calm the situation .
" our aim is to build bridges in this conflict , " party general secretary hubertus heil said , while spd federal chairman kurt beck called for clement 's life-long service to the party to be recognized .
party figures against clement but the conflicting parties were more interested in digging trenches than building bridges .
axel schaefer , a member of parliament for bochum , the ruhr town where clement is registered with the spd , urged the outspoken 68-year-old to go .
" one constantly hears ' me , me , me ' from clement , when we would like to hear ' we ' for a change , " schaefer told local daily westdeutsche allgemeine zeitung .
spd north rhine-westphalia deputy chairman jochen ott labelled clement " arrogant " and urged him to accept that he could not continue to undermine the party , " otherwise he should go of his own accord . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : franz maget says party unity should prevail over all else and spd bavarian chairman franz maget , with his eye fixed on next month 's election , said that , while clement was an " upstanding social democrat , he is also boneheaded . "
maget called for the former economics and labor minister to accept a formal rebuke from the party and to agree to maintain party discipline .
clement made clear that nothing was further from his mind .
" what they are demanding is a muzzle , even in the event that spd leaders somewhere join forces with the left party , and i wo n't be part of it , " he told national public broadcaster zdf .
clement once again had ypsilanti in his sights .
the hesse spd leader this week put out feelers to the socialist left in the state in the hope of forming a minority coalition with the greens based on the tacit support of the left .
spd presented with problem from the left bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " here 's the left " the logo reads - the strong growth of the far-left party has spd leaders scratching their heads how to confront the apparently inexorable rise of the new party with its roots in formerly communist east germany lies at the heart of the struggle .
the spd , whose roots go back to the mid 19th century labor movement , has plumbed all-time lows in opinion polls this year .
the left has eaten steadily into its traditional support base , even in western states - like north rhine-westphalia and hesse - where the spd had previously felt secure .
a poll published wednesday said national support had fallen to a new all-time low of 20 percent after the north rhine-westphalia ruling .
the relationship with the left is at the core of the spd 's problems as the party enters the last year of an unwieldy " grand coalition " at federal level headed by cdu chancellor angela merkel .
currently , the spd shuns the left in western states and at federal level , although it has entered into a coalition with the party in the city-state of berlin .
beck has not helped matters by appearing to switch course two or three times over whether to accept the backing of the left in hesse .
clement stands firm against deal with the left clement has now charted a clear course rejecting any kind of deal with the socialists , and he has the backing of many within his party , as another spd veteran , former hamburg mayor klaus von dohnanyi , has made clear .
" it would be a big mistake to expel clement .
he 's not alone within the spd in taking this position , " the party heavyweight said . dpa news agency -lrb- dm -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

now they are increasingly opting to invest their millions in germany . in recent years , russian firms , both large and small , are increasingly trying to break into the german market , and and those who have gained a foothold have made quite a success of it . russian companies have bought stakes in high-profile german companies such the giant travel operator and europe 's leading travel group tui , fashion chain escada , the air berlin airline and shipyards in the baltic ports of wismar and rostock . russian billionaire suleyman kerimov , a key stakeholder in russian energy giant gazprom , has been reported to be considering boosting his stake in germany 's biggest bank , deutsche bank . flush with cash , russian investors are eyeing nearly every crucial sector of the german economy from cosmetics , fashion and tourism to construction , real estate , energy , media and shipbuilding . potential investors have been sending scouts to sniff out the german market and analyze where the money could be put to best use . according to the head of the russian chamber of trade and commerce in berlin , sergey nikitin , russian companies investing in germany are primarily interested in opening up new markets in the west and burnishing their image by adding the " made in germany " label to their product range . " russian companies are extremely interested in modernizing their machinery and equipment , ” nikitin said .
" and it 's only natural that many of them are trying to do this with the help of a strong , reliable and experienced partner .
this is why they turn to germany to make use of the country ’ s technical expertise and with it expand their product range . " past prejudice makes germans wary bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : new president medvedev has bolstered investors not long ago , it was n't unusual to find a large number of german businesses extremely wary of the multi-billion ruble investments from russia .
on many occasions it was unclear where the money came from and what investors planned to do with it exactly . that 's likely to change over the next couple of years , however with russia ’ s expected entry into the world trade organization . investment has also been made easier by the new russian president ’ s promise to work towards liberalizing the domestic economy and fighting corruption . during his recent visit to germany , dmitry medvedev called on the german business community to treat russian companies and investors as equal partners .

6 , after scaling 120-foot -lrb- 36.6-meter -rrb- light posts near the center of the olympic park and displaying banners calling for a tibet free from chinese rule . the two american and two britons displayed tibetan flags and banners declaring " one world , one dream : free tibet " and " tibet will be free , " the group students for a free tibet said in an email , reuters news agency reported .
one of the banners also said " free tibet " in chinese . according to police , the group gathered at the beichen bridge near the central stadium , known as the bird 's nest , which will host to friday 's opening ceremony .
chinese officials have enforced a strict ban on any public support for the tibetan independence movement . beijing games spokesman sun weide told reporters that china has rules on " assemblies " and expects foreigners to respect them . protests stopped quickly bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : police quickly removed the protestors ' banner from public view within 10 minutes of the banners ' unfurling , firemen arrived in several fire trucks with extended ladders and removed the banners from the light posts , abc news reported . the two men , members of the group students for a free tibet , then reportedly climbed down peacefully and police checked their identification . one of the protesters , who identified himself to abc news as ian thom , 24 , from edinburgh , scotland , said he entered china with a group from britain on a valid tourist visa . " i 'll probably get detained by the police and then ejected out of the country , but i believe it 's not anywhere near the risk or the fear that tibetans are living with under the occupation of the chinese government , " he was quoted as saying by xinhua , china 's state-controlled news agency . zhang heping , director of the opening and closing ceremonies department of the beijing games ' organizing committee , labeled the protest an infringement upon the olympic charter and spirit of the games . however , the stymieing of freedom of speech and reversal of china 's pledge to allow free expression when it originally bid on the games may prove to be a point of embarrassment for the government . visa revoked bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : security has been ramped up with soldiers on guard against protests and disturbances the arrests coincided with the unexplained revocation of a travel visa to china for winter olympic gold medalist joey cheek . the american speed skater was a founder of team darfur , a group of athletes , including 72 current olympians , whose aim is to draw attention to china 's support of sudan and the human rights abuses and humanitarian crisis in sudan 's darfur region .
china is a major buyer of oil pumped in sudan . " i am saddened not to be able to attend the games , " he said as reported by news agency dpa .
" the olympic games represent something powerful : that people can come together from around the world and do things that no one thought were possible . " however , the denial of my visa is a part of a systemic effort by the chinese government to coerce and threaten athletes who are speaking out on behalf of the innocent people of darfur , " cheek added he told the washington post that team darfur 's co-founder , former university water polo player brad greiner , had also had his visa revoked tuesday . dw staff -lrb- dm -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" the olympic games represent something powerful : that people can come together from around the world and do things that no one thought were possible .

now they are increasingly opting to invest their millions in germany . in recent years , russian firms , both large and small , are increasingly trying to break into the german market , and and those who have gained a foothold have made quite a success of it . russian companies have bought stakes in high-profile german companies such the giant travel operator and europe 's leading travel group tui , fashion chain escada , the air berlin airline and shipyards in the baltic ports of wismar and rostock . russian billionaire suleyman kerimov , a key stakeholder in russian energy giant gazprom , has been reported to be considering boosting his stake in germany 's biggest bank , deutsche bank . flush with cash , russian investors are eyeing nearly every crucial sector of the german economy from cosmetics , fashion and tourism to construction , real estate , energy , media and shipbuilding . potential investors have been sending scouts to sniff out the german market and analyze where the money could be put to best use . according to the head of the russian chamber of trade and commerce in berlin , sergey nikitin , russian companies investing in germany are primarily interested in opening up new markets in the west and burnishing their image by adding the " made in germany " label to their product range . " russian companies are extremely interested in modernizing their machinery and equipment , ” nikitin said .
" and it 's only natural that many of them are trying to do this with the help of a strong , reliable and experienced partner .
this is why they turn to germany to make use of the country ’ s technical expertise and with it expand their product range . " past prejudice makes germans wary bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : new president medvedev has bolstered investors not long ago , it was n't unusual to find a large number of german businesses extremely wary of the multi-billion ruble investments from russia .
on many occasions it was unclear where the money came from and what investors planned to do with it exactly . that 's likely to change over the next couple of years , however with russia ’ s expected entry into the world trade organization . investment has also been made easier by the new russian president ’ s promise to work towards liberalizing the domestic economy and fighting corruption . during his recent visit to germany , dmitry medvedev called on the german business community to treat russian companies and investors as equal partners .
he said there was no reason to keep restrictions for russian investors in place . german companies are likewise speaking of a new openness and transparency when it comes to mutually beneficial deals .
" of course there are still some prejudices in place , " said nikitin .
" but once it gets down to nitty-gritty and german and russian businessmen deal with the details of their contracts , misconceptions and prejudices are usually removed very fast . “ it ’ s a new situation for the german business community to deal with russian partners on this scale , " he added . scales tipping in russia 's favor ? the scale , however , still appears to be tipped in germany ’ s favor .
more than 4,000 german companies including heavyweights such as siemens , bosch and basf currently do business in the russian federation while only about 1,300 russia firms are active in germany . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : russian railways is said to be helping deutsche bahn to privatize that could soon change .
in 2000 , russian companies invested some $ 20 billion -lrb- 30 billion euros -rrb- abroad .
this year , it will most likely reach the $ 200 billion threshold .
germany will also certainly stay in the sights of russian investors . it 's expected , for instance , that russian railways will be actively involved in the privatization of its german counterpart , deutsche bahn .
more investments are also likely in the biotechnology sector where russian companies hold many patents which they haven ’ t yet been marketed elsewhere . hardy graupner -lrb- cat -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

6 . germany 's chef de mission in beijing , michael vesper , told the dpa news agency that nowitzki was chosen because he represents the olympic idea like no other athlete . " it has been a dream of dirk nowitzki for years to be at the olympics , " he added .
" this dream has now become reality . " competing at the olympics wo n't be the only first for the 30-year-old born in the bavarian city of wuerzburg .
he is also the first basketball player to carry the german flag at an olympics , succeeding show jumper ludger beerbaum -lrb- 2004 -rrb- , kayak canoe racer birgit fischer -lrb- 2000 -rrb- and fencer arnd schmitt -lrb- 1996 -rrb- . nowitzki said competing at an olympic games is something that has motivated him since a very young age . " on friday -lsb- at the opening ceremony -rsb- , i will experience something astonishing , " nowitzki said at a press conference on wednesday .
" i never thought i would be chosen to carry the flag but maybe it 's happened because a lot of athletes identify with me . " the opposition bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : gymnast fabian hambuchen was the committee 's first choice but he declined the offer birgit fischer , an eight-time olympic gold medalist who retired after the athens games four years ago , was critical when it was first suggested nowitzki , one of the biggest earners in the nba , might carry the flag as , in her eyes , he did not represent one of germany 's traditional olympic sports . gymnast fabian hambuchen , the world high-bar champion , had been the german olympic committee 's first choice to be their flag-bearer but he declined the offer because his event takes place on saturday . german basketball returns to the olympics dallas mavericks forward nowitzki played a key role in ensuring germany clinched the final qualifying place on offer in the 12-team line-up for these games by scoring 32 points in a 96-82 victory over puerto rico in july .
that win saw germany into their first olympic basketball tournament since 1992 . the team was also aided by los angeles clippers center chris kaman who , courtesy of his great-grandparents , became a naturalized german citizen at the start of july .
despite not speaking a world of german at the time , kaman played his part against puerto rico by scoring 10 points with 12 rebounds . the dallas mavericks star last year became the first player from europe to win the nba 's prestigious most valuable player award .
he led germany to second place at the 2005 european championships and to third place at the 2002 worlds . dw staff -lrb- mrm -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

now they are increasingly opting to invest their millions in germany . in recent years , russian firms , both large and small , are increasingly trying to break into the german market , and and those who have gained a foothold have made quite a success of it . russian companies have bought stakes in high-profile german companies such the giant travel operator and europe 's leading travel group tui , fashion chain escada , the air berlin airline and shipyards in the baltic ports of wismar and rostock . russian billionaire suleyman kerimov , a key stakeholder in russian energy giant gazprom , has been reported to be considering boosting his stake in germany 's biggest bank , deutsche bank . flush with cash , russian investors are eyeing nearly every crucial sector of the german economy from cosmetics , fashion and tourism to construction , real estate , energy , media and shipbuilding . potential investors have been sending scouts to sniff out the german market and analyze where the money could be put to best use . according to the head of the russian chamber of trade and commerce in berlin , sergey nikitin , russian companies investing in germany are primarily interested in opening up new markets in the west and burnishing their image by adding the " made in germany " label to their product range . " russian companies are extremely interested in modernizing their machinery and equipment , ” nikitin said .
" and it 's only natural that many of them are trying to do this with the help of a strong , reliable and experienced partner .
this is why they turn to germany to make use of the country ’ s technical expertise and with it expand their product range . " past prejudice makes germans wary bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : new president medvedev has bolstered investors not long ago , it was n't unusual to find a large number of german businesses extremely wary of the multi-billion ruble investments from russia .
on many occasions it was unclear where the money came from and what investors planned to do with it exactly . that 's likely to change over the next couple of years , however with russia ’ s expected entry into the world trade organization . investment has also been made easier by the new russian president ’ s promise to work towards liberalizing the domestic economy and fighting corruption . during his recent visit to germany , dmitry medvedev called on the german business community to treat russian companies and investors as equal partners .
he said there was no reason to keep restrictions for russian investors in place . german companies are likewise speaking of a new openness and transparency when it comes to mutually beneficial deals .
" of course there are still some prejudices in place , " said nikitin .
" but once it gets down to nitty-gritty and german and russian businessmen deal with the details of their contracts , misconceptions and prejudices are usually removed very fast . “ it ’ s a new situation for the german business community to deal with russian partners on this scale , " he added . scales tipping in russia 's favor ? the scale , however , still appears to be tipped in germany ’ s favor .
more than 4,000 german companies including heavyweights such as siemens , bosch and basf currently do business in the russian federation while only about 1,300 russia firms are active in germany . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : russian railways is said to be helping deutsche bahn to privatize that could soon change .

this year , it will most likely reach the $ 200 billion threshold .
germany will also certainly stay in the sights of russian investors . it 's expected , for instance , that russian railways will be actively involved in the privatization of its german counterpart , deutsche bahn .

" this dream has now become reality . " competing at the olympics wo n't be the only first for the 30-year-old born in the bavarian city of wuerzburg .

that win saw germany into their first olympic basketball tournament since 1992 . the team was also aided by los angeles clippers center chris kaman who , courtesy of his great-grandparents , became a naturalized german citizen at the start of july .
despite not speaking a world of german at the time , kaman played his part against puerto rico by scoring 10 points with 12 rebounds . the dallas mavericks star last year became the first player from europe to win the nba 's prestigious most valuable player award .

6 , after scaling 120-foot -lrb- 36.6-meter -rrb- light posts near the center of the olympic park and displaying banners calling for a tibet free from chinese rule . the two american and two britons displayed tibetan flags and banners declaring " one world , one dream : free tibet " and " tibet will be free , " the group students for a free tibet said in an email , reuters news agency reported .
one of the banners also said " free tibet " in chinese . according to police , the group gathered at the beichen bridge near the central stadium , known as the bird 's nest , which will host to friday 's opening ceremony .
chinese officials have enforced a strict ban on any public support for the tibetan independence movement . beijing games spokesman sun weide told reporters that china has rules on " assemblies " and expects foreigners to respect them . protests stopped quickly bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : police quickly removed the protestors ' banner from public view within 10 minutes of the banners ' unfurling , firemen arrived in several fire trucks with extended ladders and removed the banners from the light posts , abc news reported . the two men , members of the group students for a free tibet , then reportedly climbed down peacefully and police checked their identification . one of the protesters , who identified himself to abc news as ian thom , 24 , from edinburgh , scotland , said he entered china with a group from britain on a valid tourist visa . " i 'll probably get detained by the police and then ejected out of the country , but i believe it 's not anywhere near the risk or the fear that tibetans are living with under the occupation of the chinese government , " he was quoted as saying by xinhua , china 's state-controlled news agency . zhang heping , director of the opening and closing ceremonies department of the beijing games ' organizing committee , labeled the protest an infringement upon the olympic charter and spirit of the games . however , the stymieing of freedom of speech and reversal of china 's pledge to allow free expression when it originally bid on the games may prove to be a point of embarrassment for the government . visa revoked bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : security has been ramped up with soldiers on guard against protests and disturbances the arrests coincided with the unexplained revocation of a travel visa to china for winter olympic gold medalist joey cheek . the american speed skater was a founder of team darfur , a group of athletes , including 72 current olympians , whose aim is to draw attention to china 's support of sudan and the human rights abuses and humanitarian crisis in sudan 's darfur region .
china is a major buyer of oil pumped in sudan . " i am saddened not to be able to attend the games , " he said as reported by news agency dpa .
" the olympic games represent something powerful : that people can come together from around the world and do things that no one thought were possible . " however , the denial of my visa is a part of a systemic effort by the chinese government to coerce and threaten athletes who are speaking out on behalf of the innocent people of darfur , " cheek added he told the washington post that team darfur 's co-founder , former university water polo player brad greiner , had also had his visa revoked tuesday . dw staff -lrb- dm -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

now , the largest remaining stretch of it is to be touched up to preserve art works against weather damage and vandalism .
but how long can it stay spic and span ? berlin 's muehlenstrasse - a four-lane thoroughfare largely devoid of buildings and full of speeding traffic - is n't the sort of street that would usually attract a lot of tourists .
but some half a million visitors come every year to look at the east side gallery , a 1,316-meter stretch of reconstituted berlin wall .
the " gallery , " which was originally set up in 1990 after the fall of east german communism , features works by 118 artists from 21 countries - many of them chipped by the elements and obscured by graffiti .
as of october , however , those artists have been invited to come to berlin to restore their works and spruce up one of the german capital 's most unlikely tourist attractions .
around half of the two million euros -lrb- $ 3.1 million -rrb- needed for the renovations come from the eu , the german government and the city .
the rest is covered by lottery funds .
iranian organizer , german history bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : among the works to be restored is alavi 's own the project is the brainchild of an artists ' initiative headed by iranian kani alavi , who has lived in berlin since 1980 and whose work is also immortalized on the harsh concrete remnants of communism .
ironically , the east-facing gallery represents what the wall looked like from the west , since residents of communist east germany were forbidden from even touching , let alone decorating it .
equally ironically , one of the problems for the gallery is people picking at it to hack out souvenirs - disregarding signs posted to inform visitors that they were standing before a piece of history .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the ugly bits of graffiti will be removed - but will vandals respect the monument ?
" we tried that , but someone stole the signs - they work well as souvenirs , too , " alavi told berlin 's tagesspiegel newspaper .
this is n't the first gallery renovation .
in 2000 , a german paint company sponsored the restoration of some 40 meters of original art works , but this is the first time the gallery as a whole has been scheduled for a touch-up .
if all goes to plan , work will be finished by november 9 , 2009 - in time to celebrate the twentieth anniversary of the opening of the berlin wall . dw staff -lrb- jc -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

deputy first minister ieuan wyn jones said the money was to support the dotcym campaign for a welsh version of the .com or co.uk endings .
he said it would " open up new marketing opportunities and help promote the wales brand . "
but a cardiff business school report said there was little evidence to show .cym would promote welsh culture .
in its report in june 2007 , it also said : " there is little evidence to suggest that a .cym domain will have substantial short-term economic benefit for wales . "
and cbi wales said although .cym could be a useful tool for some the trend was towards using international web names .
support for the bid is part of the one wales agreement between labour and plaid cymru .
the assembly government 's funding , announced at the national eisteddfod in cardiff , will go towards putting together a bid to icann , the international body which manages domain names .
in june it announced an extension of the system which will allow new domain names to be registered alongside the existing .com .co.uk and .org endings .
mr jones said : " this announcement reflects a more strategic approach to put wales on the world map and enhance welsh culture and identity on the worldwide web . "
dotcym was set up to campaign for a welsh domain name and claims the support of businesses , local authorities and public bodies .
campaign chief executive siôn jobbins said : " the internet is the e-engine for economic growth and wales needs top level access to deliver the innovation that we need . "
" the internet is about to change radically and wales must be fully on board the new internet with a top level domain identity .cym , on a par with other economically-growing communities . "
but the insurance company admiral , the only welsh group listed on the ftse 100 index , said it was worried a .cym ending could cause confusion to its customers .
justin beddows , a spokesman for the company said : " most of our customers come from london , the south east and scotland but for tourist companies it 's a great idea . "
david rosser , the director of the business organisation cbi wales welcomed the extra choice a new name would give businesses .
" i think it offers another option for businesses to consider which is never a bad thing , " he said .
" for companies for which welshness is a key part of their proposition to their customers it maybe a useful marketing tool . "
but he added : " the trend is probably towards globalisation and the removal of local domain names .
there are more companies opting for .com rather than .co.uk. "

" but it is fitting that ray who was perhaps one of the proudest welshmen , or certainly the one who displayed his love for his country the most has been named as the nation 's favourite welsh person . "
grav , whose life was honoured at a special national eisteddfod tribute , won 21 % of the vote , followed by katherine jenkins with 15 % .
world supermiddleweight champion calazaghe , who was named bbc sports personality of the year 2007 , took 13 % of the poll .
the other idols on the shortlist came from the worlds of entertainment , sport and history .
singers tom jones and bryn terfel , and bbc presenter gethin jones were joined by footballer ryan giggs and rugby player james hook .
but medieval welsh prince owain glyndwr did not make the shortlist .
the other finalists were st david and the 10th century welsh king and law-maker hywel dda .
voting took place through the assembly 's website and in the senedd itself .
visitors to the llangollen international eisteddfod and the royal welsh show were also able to cast their ballot .
schoolchildren visiting the assembly on educational visits used the activity to learn about voting and the democratic process as part of their learning programmes .
the competition was launched in january and the shortlist was announced on st david 's day .

the 120 northern ireland estate agents surveyed sold a total of 1,044 houses in the second quarter of this year .
however , although sales are down in comparison with the same time last year , they have increased from 896 in the first quarter of 2008 .
the survey found that the average house price in ni now stands at £ 226,934 .
its authors , professor alastair adair , professor stanley mcgreal and louise brown , said the overall picture " when balanced out " suggested that there has only been a 4 % reduction in prices .
transactions " however , the main impact on the market is in the volume of transactions which have been more than halved over the year , " they added .
" while a correction in the market is taking place , it is important to stress that price levels have not collapsed and the marking down of prices appears to be incremental rather than a one-off correction . "
bank of ireland economist alan bridle said the survey showed that price changes varied widely across different parts of northern ireland and across different types of properties .
" people should be cautious about making over-simplistic judgments , " he said .
" for instance , there are different factors affecting both the resale and the new-build markets .
" with a very quiet resale market , i believe there is a high probability of the average price dropping closer to the £ 200,000 level before the end of year , with a period of adjustment stretching into 2009 .
" anyone looking for the green shoots of recovery should keep an eye on transaction levels which are likely to turn before prices do , but it might be a while . "
the housing executive 's head of research , joe frey said northern ireland 's housing market was facing a challenging time .
" the current situation provides government with an opportunity to accelerate the building of social and affordable homes , " he said .

the 120 northern ireland estate agents surveyed sold a total of 1,044 houses in the second quarter of this year .
however , although sales are down in comparison with the same time last year , they have increased from 896 in the first quarter of 2008 .
the survey found that the average house price in ni now stands at £ 226,934 .
its authors , professor alastair adair , professor stanley mcgreal and louise brown , said the overall picture " when balanced out " suggested that there has only been a 4 % reduction in prices .
transactions " however , the main impact on the market is in the volume of transactions which have been more than halved over the year , " they added .
" while a correction in the market is taking place , it is important to stress that price levels have not collapsed and the marking down of prices appears to be incremental rather than a one-off correction . "
bank of ireland economist alan bridle said the survey showed that price changes varied widely across different parts of northern ireland and across different types of properties .
" people should be cautious about making over-simplistic judgments , " he said .
" for instance , there are different factors affecting both the resale and the new-build markets .
" with a very quiet resale market , i believe there is a high probability of the average price dropping closer to the £ 200,000 level before the end of year , with a period of adjustment stretching into 2009 .
" anyone looking for the green shoots of recovery should keep an eye on transaction levels which are likely to turn before prices do , but it might be a while . "
the housing executive 's head of research , joe frey said northern ireland 's housing market was facing a challenging time .
" the current situation provides government with an opportunity to accelerate the building of social and affordable homes , " he said .

the questioning came after mrs mccann was declared an arguido , or suspect , in september 2007 .
mrs mccann used her right to remain silent and only answered one question .
her arguido status was lifted on 21 july this year .
she and her husband have always denied any involvement in their daughter 's disappearance .
the police inquiry into madeleine 's disappearance was wound up last month due to a lack of evidence .
7 september questions to kate mccann 1 on 3 may 2007 at around 2200 , when you entered the apartment what did you see and do , where did you look , and what did you touch ? 2 did you look inside the wardrobe in the bedroom ?
she said she would n't answer .
3 -lrb- shown two photographs of the wardrobe -rrb- can you describe its contents ? 4 why had the curtain behind the sofa in front of the side window -lrb- a photograph of which was shown to her -rrb- , been disturbed ?
had someone passed behind this sofa ? 5 how much time did you spend searching in the apartment after realising that your daughter madeleine had disappeared ? 6 why did you say from the start that madeleine had been abducted ? 7 assuming that madeleine had been abducted , why did you leave the twins alone at home to go to the tapas to raise the alarm , not least because the supposed abductor could still be in the apartment ? 8 why did you not ask the twins at that moment what had happened to their sister , or why did you not ask them later ? 9 when you raised the alarm in the tapas what specific words were used ? 10 what happened after raising the alarm at the tapas ? 11 did you have a mobile phone with you at that moment ? 12 why did you go to warn your friends instead of shouting from the balcony ? 13 who contacted the authorities ? 14 who took part in the searches ? 15 did someone outside the group learn , in the moments that followed , of madeleine 's disappearance ? 16 did any neighbour offer you help after the alarm was raised about the disappearance ? 17 what did the expression " we let her down " mean ? 18 did jane tell you that she had seen a man carrying a child that night ? 19 how were the authorities contacted and which police force was alerted ? 20 during the searches after police arrived , in which places were madeleine searched for , and in what way ? 21 why did the twins not wake up during the search or when they went upstairs ? 22 whom did you telephone after the discovery ? 23 did you call sky news ? 24 did you know of any danger of calling the media alerting them of the abduction , since this could influence the abductor ? 25 did you request the presence of a priest ? 26 in what way was the face of madeleine , in photographs or by other means , released ? 27 is it true that during the search you remained seated on madeleine 's bed in your room without moving ? 28 what was your behaviour like during that night ? 29 did you manage to sleep ? 30 before the trip to portugal did you make a comment about a bad feeling or premonition about it ? 31 what was madeleine 's behaviour like ? 32 did madeleine suffer from any infirmity or take medication ? 33 what was madeleine 's relationship like with her brother and sister , friends and fellow pupils ? 34 regarding your professional life , in how many hospitals and in which ones did you work ? 35 what was your speciality as a doctor ? 36 do you work shifts in emergency wards or other departments ? 37 do you work in the daytime ? 38 why did you stop working at a certain point ? 39 is it true or not that the twins have difficulty falling asleep , that they are restless and that this upsets you ? 40 is it true or not that at certain times you felt desperate at your children 's attitude and that this upsets you a lot ? 41 is it true or not that in england you went so far as thinking about handing over madeleine to a relative to look after ? 42 at home -lrb- in england -rrb- did you give medication to your children and what kind of medication ? 43 -lrb- various films had been shown to her of the inspection by forensic dogs , where one can see their signalling indications of the scent of a human corpse and traces of human blood as well as the comments by the expert overseeing the exercise . -rrb-
having seen the film and after the scent of a corpse was signalled in her bedroom near the wardrobe , and behind the sofa by the window in the sitting room , kate mccann said she could not explain anything more than she already had .
44 she was asked about the sniffer dog that signalled human blood behind the above-mentioned sofa .
she said she could not explain anything more than she already had .
45 she was asked about the scent of corpse which was signalled in the vehicle she hired about a month after the disappearance , with number plate 59-da-27 .
she said she could not explain anything more than she already had .
46 when the presence of human blood was signalled in the boot of the same vehicle kate mccann said she could not explain anything more than she already had .
47 confronted with the result of the sample of madeleine 's dna , whose analysis was carried out by a british laboratory , found behind the sofa and in the boot of the vehicle , as previously described , kate mccann said she could not explain anything more than she already had .
48 did you have any responsibility or involvement in the disappearance of your daughter madeleine ? 49 are you aware that the fact of your not answering the questions put to you jeopardise the investigation that was aimed at finding out what happened to your daughter , she answered : " yes , if the investigation thinks that . " 50 do you have anything to add ?

the questioning came after mrs mccann was declared an arguido , or suspect , in september 2007 .
mrs mccann used her right to remain silent and only answered one question .
her arguido status was lifted on 21 july this year .
she and her husband have always denied any involvement in their daughter 's disappearance .
the police inquiry into madeleine 's disappearance was wound up last month due to a lack of evidence .
7 september questions to kate mccann 1 on 3 may 2007 at around 2200 , when you entered the apartment what did you see and do , where did you look , and what did you touch ? 2 did you look inside the wardrobe in the bedroom ?

had someone passed behind this sofa ? 5 how much time did you spend searching in the apartment after realising that your daughter madeleine had disappeared ? 6 why did you say from the start that madeleine had been abducted ? 7 assuming that madeleine had been abducted , why did you leave the twins alone at home to go to the tapas to raise the alarm , not least because the supposed abductor could still be in the apartment ? 8 why did you not ask the twins at that moment what had happened to their sister , or why did you not ask them later ? 9 when you raised the alarm in the tapas what specific words were used ? 10 what happened after raising the alarm at the tapas ? 11 did you have a mobile phone with you at that moment ? 12 why did you go to warn your friends instead of shouting from the balcony ? 13 who contacted the authorities ? 14 who took part in the searches ? 15 did someone outside the group learn , in the moments that followed , of madeleine 's disappearance ? 16 did any neighbour offer you help after the alarm was raised about the disappearance ? 17 what did the expression " we let her down " mean ? 18 did jane tell you that she had seen a man carrying a child that night ? 19 how were the authorities contacted and which police force was alerted ? 20 during the searches after police arrived , in which places were madeleine searched for , and in what way ? 21 why did the twins not wake up during the search or when they went upstairs ? 22 whom did you telephone after the discovery ? 23 did you call sky news ? 24 did you know of any danger of calling the media alerting them of the abduction , since this could influence the abductor ? 25 did you request the presence of a priest ? 26 in what way was the face of madeleine , in photographs or by other means , released ? 27 is it true that during the search you remained seated on madeleine 's bed in your room without moving ? 28 what was your behaviour like during that night ? 29 did you manage to sleep ? 30 before the trip to portugal did you make a comment about a bad feeling or premonition about it ? 31 what was madeleine 's behaviour like ? 32 did madeleine suffer from any infirmity or take medication ? 33 what was madeleine 's relationship like with her brother and sister , friends and fellow pupils ? 34 regarding your professional life , in how many hospitals and in which ones did you work ? 35 what was your speciality as a doctor ? 36 do you work shifts in emergency wards or other departments ? 37 do you work in the daytime ? 38 why did you stop working at a certain point ? 39 is it true or not that the twins have difficulty falling asleep , that they are restless and that this upsets you ? 40 is it true or not that at certain times you felt desperate at your children 's attitude and that this upsets you a lot ? 41 is it true or not that in england you went so far as thinking about handing over madeleine to a relative to look after ? 42 at home -lrb- in england -rrb- did you give medication to your children and what kind of medication ? 43 -lrb- various films had been shown to her of the inspection by forensic dogs , where one can see their signalling indications of the scent of a human corpse and traces of human blood as well as the comments by the expert overseeing the exercise . -rrb-
having seen the film and after the scent of a corpse was signalled in her bedroom near the wardrobe , and behind the sofa by the window in the sitting room , kate mccann said she could not explain anything more than she already had .
44 she was asked about the sniffer dog that signalled human blood behind the above-mentioned sofa .
she said she could not explain anything more than she already had .
45 she was asked about the scent of corpse which was signalled in the vehicle she hired about a month after the disappearance , with number plate 59-da-27 .
she said she could not explain anything more than she already had .
46 when the presence of human blood was signalled in the boot of the same vehicle kate mccann said she could not explain anything more than she already had .
47 confronted with the result of the sample of madeleine 's dna , whose analysis was carried out by a british laboratory , found behind the sofa and in the boot of the vehicle , as previously described , kate mccann said she could not explain anything more than she already had .
48 did you have any responsibility or involvement in the disappearance of your daughter madeleine ? 49 are you aware that the fact of your not answering the questions put to you jeopardise the investigation that was aimed at finding out what happened to your daughter , she answered : " yes , if the investigation thinks that . " 50 do you have anything to add ?
she said : " no . " 51 her lawyer was asked to comment .
he said he had nothing to state or request .
