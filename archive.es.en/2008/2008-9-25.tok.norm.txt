"
conducted by omer welber , the istanbul philharmonic and the ra 'anana symphonette accompanied israeli virtuoso shlomo mintz , yair dalal and turkey 's cihat askin as they played sixteen violins that had outlasted the holocaust .
the concert was part of this year 's celebrations marking israel 's 60th anniversary .
proceeds from the event went to meir panim layeled , an organization that focuses on the welfare , education and health needs of children across israel .
16 violins , 16 stories bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : amnon weinstein some of the violins were responsible for saving jewish lives , and some helped fight the germans .
" each violin has its own story , " israeli violin maker amnon weinstein told reuters .
now 69 , he and his son have spent more than a decade restoring the violins collected from across europe .
weinstein said he received the instruments in various states of disrepair , many of them decorated with stars of david carved into the woodwork , a testimony to their former jewish owners .
" by restoring their violins , their legacy is born again , " said weinstein , who lost most of his family in the holocaust .
most of them were found in attics and cellars , where they had spent the last few decades gathering dust .

his name was motele , and he had joined the resistance in a village near the border with ukraine and managed to infiltrate a nazi building there .
" the german officers heard him play in the streets one day and later brought him to perform every night in their compound in town , " said sefi hanegbi , whose father played alongside motele in a partisan camp in a forest during world war two .
after each performance , motele would hide his violin in the building and walk out with an empty case .
he would return with the violin case full of explosives , stuffing them into cracks in the walls , and eventually setting them off , hanegbi said .
motele was later killed in a german ambush , and hanegbi 's family brought his violin to israel where it sat in a closet for decades - forgotten until amnon weinstein gave it a second lease of life . dw staff -lrb- jp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

he stressed that german banks can cope with losses . " wall street and the world will never again be the way they were before the crisis , " said steinbrueck in a speech to the german parliament , the bundestag , on thursday , sept .

write-downs and write-offs of bad credit spawned by " a blind drive for double-digit profits " have so far totaled $ 550 billion and no end to the crisis is in sight , he added .
the world financial system will consequently become more " multi-polar , " he predicted .
steinbrueck told the bundestag that the group of seven -lrb- g7 -rrb- finance ministers would be meeting in washington next month to discuss how to tighten regulation of capital markets .
the german federal government , meanwhile , would continue efforts to trim spending , but would also make some moves to stimulate the economy .

washington has been reluctant to increase minimum equity rules and has too many competing regulators over us investment banks .
" this system , which in many ways is inadequately regulated , is now collapsing , " he said , adding that germany 's banking system remained " relatively robust , " with german regulators confident they can absorb losses .
" new rules of the road " for the financial markets were needed , he said .

the agencies were created by western nations as an early warning system .
strengthening cooperation bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the german landesbanken need to pull together steinbrueck also renewed his call for fusion across germany 's state bank sector .
the country 's big commercial lenders , the so-called " landesbanken , " have been hard hit by the financial crisis . the next move needs to be made by the individual states , as co-owners of the leading state banks , said the social democrat minister : " they need to overcome regional political pride and embrace pan-regional co-operation . "
this , he said , would strengthen the german banking system and boost its sustainability .
" financial support from the government in mopping up problems in this sector should not be expected , " he added . given that past attempts to fuse the " landesbanken " have failed , steinbrueck proposed a redefinition of their business models in order to avoid excessive risk and to increase returns .

he stressed that german banks can cope with losses . " wall street and the world will never again be the way they were before the crisis , " said steinbrueck in a speech to the german parliament , the bundestag , on thursday , sept .

write-downs and write-offs of bad credit spawned by " a blind drive for double-digit profits " have so far totaled $ 550 billion and no end to the crisis is in sight , he added .
the world financial system will consequently become more " multi-polar , " he predicted .
steinbrueck told the bundestag that the group of seven -lrb- g7 -rrb- finance ministers would be meeting in washington next month to discuss how to tighten regulation of capital markets .
the german federal government , meanwhile , would continue efforts to trim spending , but would also make some moves to stimulate the economy .
he reiterated germany 's refusal to set up its own bank bail-out scheme , saying the crisis was principally a us problem .
irresponsible moves bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : steinbrueck did n't pull his punches during the bundestag speech reiterating berlin 's push for tighter regulation , steinbrueck accused the us of blunders .
" the cause of the crisis was the irresponsible exaggeration of the principle of a free , unrestrained market , " he told the bundestag .
washington has been reluctant to increase minimum equity rules and has too many competing regulators over us investment banks .
" this system , which in many ways is inadequately regulated , is now collapsing , " he said , adding that germany 's banking system remained " relatively robust , " with german regulators confident they can absorb losses .
" new rules of the road " for the financial markets were needed , he said .
plans to be debated when the finance ministers of the g7 meet will include tightening cooperation between the international monetary fund -lrb- imf -rrb- and the financial stability forum -lrb- fsf -rrb- .
the agencies were created by western nations as an early warning system .
strengthening cooperation bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the german landesbanken need to pull together steinbrueck also renewed his call for fusion across germany 's state bank sector .
the country 's big commercial lenders , the so-called " landesbanken , " have been hard hit by the financial crisis . the next move needs to be made by the individual states , as co-owners of the leading state banks , said the social democrat minister : " they need to overcome regional political pride and embrace pan-regional co-operation . "
this , he said , would strengthen the german banking system and boost its sustainability .
" financial support from the government in mopping up problems in this sector should not be expected , " he added . given that past attempts to fuse the " landesbanken " have failed , steinbrueck proposed a redefinition of their business models in order to avoid excessive risk and to increase returns .

" financial support from the government in mopping up problems in this sector should not be expected , " he added . given that past attempts to fuse the " landesbanken " have failed , steinbrueck proposed a redefinition of their business models in order to avoid excessive risk and to increase returns .

poland 's fritzl bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : donald tusk prime minister donald tusk raised the controversial topic after a 45-year-old man was charged with having raped and held his 21-year-old daughter captive for six years .
the suspect , dubbed poland 's josef fritzl in a reference to the austrian man accused of incarcerating his daughter and fathering seven children with her , faces up to 15 years behind bars if found guilty .
the woman in poland gave birth to two children , in 2005 and 2007 , allegedly from her father .
she maintains that he pressured her to give them up for adoption .
the case triggered a nationwide debate on how criminal sex offenders should be punished , with the liberal prime minister taking a draconian stance .
" i want to gather all the laws in operation across europe to introduce in poland the most rigorous law possible regarding criminals who rape children , " tusk said .
" i do not believe that we can call these individuals - these creatures - human beings , " he added .
" so in this case , we do n't need to discuss human rights . "

but there is little they can do . in mid-september , the government issued a statement confirming that " work by ministers of health and justice on a draft law on obligatory chemical castration for pedophiles was nearing completion . "
according to polish media reports , the ministry plans to make the treatment compulsory for repeat offenders .
the pills would reduce or eliminate sex drive by suppressing the production of testosterone .
" our idea does n't yet have the form of a law , " ministry spokesman jakub golab told the daily polska .
" we 're currently consulting with sexologists ...
we want to bring it into effect as soon as possible . "
in as little as one year , convicted pedophiles would also be fitted with electronic collars if they have a court order against going near their victims , polska reported .
if the collars are found effective , the ministry of justice will decide if they should be given to all pedophiles .
poland 's fritzl bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : donald tusk prime minister donald tusk raised the controversial topic after a 45-year-old man was charged with having raped and held his 21-year-old daughter captive for six years .
the suspect , dubbed poland 's josef fritzl in a reference to the austrian man accused of incarcerating his daughter and fathering seven children with her , faces up to 15 years behind bars if found guilty .
the woman in poland gave birth to two children , in 2005 and 2007 , allegedly from her father .
she maintains that he pressured her to give them up for adoption .
the case triggered a nationwide debate on how criminal sex offenders should be punished , with the liberal prime minister taking a draconian stance .
" i want to gather all the laws in operation across europe to introduce in poland the most rigorous law possible regarding criminals who rape children , " tusk said .
" i do not believe that we can call these individuals - these creatures - human beings , " he added .
" so in this case , we do n't need to discuss human rights . "

human rights activists and legal experts have criticized the polish plans , saying that forcing a patient to undergo chemical castration was inadmissible according to both polish and international law .
but klaus haensch , a social democrat member of the european parliament , told spiegel online that brussels is powerless to intervene .
" it does not have the competence , because criminal law is decided at a national level , " he said .
" but i do not feel that enforced chemical castration is an appropriate punishment that can be reconciled with modern criminal law . "
christian democrat mep elmar brok agreed , telling spiegel online that it was not " a fitting solution . "
the plan also has detractors in poland .

germans tend to be debt-averse and are required to put down more equity in financing a home purchase . german politicians have criticized the us for failing to implement stringent controls on financial markets with many pointing out that the sub-prime mortgage crisis that felled wall street ’ s venerable financial institutions week could not happen in germany .
they may have a point . for one , experts say , the type of high risk lending practices that were exposed when the bubble burst in the us housing market a few years ago is more heavily regulated in germany . “ the sub-prime market is virtually non-existent , ” said elaine kempson , director of the personal finance research centre at the university of bristol . home ownership rates in germany are also among the lowest in europe - under 50 percent compared to around 70 percent in the us and the uk , said kempson , whose institute has done comparative studies in europe on personal credit risk and indebtedness . “ germans are much more conservative than americans and other europeans in terms of how much debt they are willing to take on , ” she said . larger down payments banks in germany also tend to have more stringent criteria in determining the creditworthiness of borrowers than their european or american counterparts . “ there is no such thing as zero financing on a home , ” said thomas beyerle , head of research at the degi , a frankfurt-based property investment company .
in germany , homeowners are required to make a down payment of at least 20 percent of the purchase price of a house to obtain a mortgage in the first place . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : foreclosures and defaulting on mortgage payments are far less common in germany michaela roth , spokesman of the german federation of savings and loan banks -lrb- dsgv -rrb- said it is not unusual to put down as much as 40 percent equity and finance the rest . “ germans generally are only prepared to be moderately indebted , ” she said .
even big ticket purchases such as a washing machine are paid for with hard cash or bank debit cards , with only five percent of consumers even bothering to use a credit card . mind-set averse to debt some say german financial prudence has its roots in the world wars , a period marked by acute economic hardship and suffering . “ the puritanical ethic of the war generation is still very much ingrained in germany today , ” said fabian christandl , a researcher at the institute for economic and social psychology at the university of cologne . germans work hard , put their cash in a savings account , earn a bit of interest and only take on debt for big investments , said christandl . “ a house is one of the very few purchases for which it ’ s viewed as acceptable to go into debt , ” he said . and homeowners who possess enough capital to invest in residential property beyond their own four walls are not interested in flipping over properties for quick profits either , said beyerle .
real estate investments are viewed either as a source of steady rental income or a way to reduce one ’ s tax burden . bubble burst only once beyerle explained that after german reunification in the 1990s , the government provided tax incentives for investors to buy up and develop real estate in the former east german states , but when the scheme ended ten years ago , the housing market collapsed from properties that wound up being overvalued . “ this was the only time that the bubble burst in germany , ” said beyerle . since property values in the rest of germany have remained fairly steady , even in prime locations near major urban centers such as munich , frankfurt , stuttgart , hamburg or cologne , speculation fever never caught on in germany , he added . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : even in prime urban areas , prices have not skyrocketed “ the us housing market was based on the premise that home values had no where to go but up and would keep rising very rapidly .
then when it got bad , the whole pack of cards crumbled , ” said kempson .
she cited a world bank report which indicated that as much as 20 percent of all mortgages in the us are in the sub-prime category . loans without income verification in us in the uk , five percent of the mortgage market is sub-prime , but those with impaired credit histories might be marginal bank risks , such as students or those who have a perspective of future employment that would enable them to pay back their bank loans . not so in the us , where unlicensed mortgage brokers targeted low income groups who never would have been able to borrow from more conventional banks , said kempson . “ these brokers were aggressively selling “ discounted ” packages to those surviving on social security , ” she said .
kempson added that as much as 40 percent of the loans were made without any income verification , which is much less likely to happen in europe . following a short period of loans made at fixed low rates , borrowers with “ sub-prime bargains ” found their mortgages being reset at double-digit rates .
then when soaring us housing prices started to plunge , borrowers were saddled with sub-prime mortgages that exceeded the value of their homes and couldn ’ t refinance their way out of debt , said kempson . a nation of renters bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : younger home buyers with no capital shop for best rates achim duebel , a mortgage sector expert based in berlin , said the problem with sub-prime mortgages doesn ’ t exist in germany since it is largely a nation of renters . “ every sub-prime borrower here is a renter ” , he said . but duebel added that younger germans are looking at more innovative ways to invest in property . “ the mortgage market is not as dull and boring as it looks in germany , ” he said , explaining that most germans still take out traditional mortgages at their local bank , but there is a growing number of marginal , but not sub-prime borrowers - those with no capital , but strong cash flow , such as the self-employed or freelancers , who can find mortgage brokers offering packages that require little or even no financing . “ there is cutthroat competition out there , a younger generation that wants to shop for the best rates , the best deals , so this is giving the entire mortgage market a push , ” said duebel . diana fong send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

germans tend to be debt-averse and are required to put down more equity in financing a home purchase . german politicians have criticized the us for failing to implement stringent controls on financial markets with many pointing out that the sub-prime mortgage crisis that felled wall street ’ s venerable financial institutions week could not happen in germany .
they may have a point . for one , experts say , the type of high risk lending practices that were exposed when the bubble burst in the us housing market a few years ago is more heavily regulated in germany . “ the sub-prime market is virtually non-existent , ” said elaine kempson , director of the personal finance research centre at the university of bristol . home ownership rates in germany are also among the lowest in europe - under 50 percent compared to around 70 percent in the us and the uk , said kempson , whose institute has done comparative studies in europe on personal credit risk and indebtedness . “ germans are much more conservative than americans and other europeans in terms of how much debt they are willing to take on , ” she said . larger down payments banks in germany also tend to have more stringent criteria in determining the creditworthiness of borrowers than their european or american counterparts . “ there is no such thing as zero financing on a home , ” said thomas beyerle , head of research at the degi , a frankfurt-based property investment company .
in germany , homeowners are required to make a down payment of at least 20 percent of the purchase price of a house to obtain a mortgage in the first place . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : foreclosures and defaulting on mortgage payments are far less common in germany michaela roth , spokesman of the german federation of savings and loan banks -lrb- dsgv -rrb- said it is not unusual to put down as much as 40 percent equity and finance the rest . “ germans generally are only prepared to be moderately indebted , ” she said .
even big ticket purchases such as a washing machine are paid for with hard cash or bank debit cards , with only five percent of consumers even bothering to use a credit card . mind-set averse to debt some say german financial prudence has its roots in the world wars , a period marked by acute economic hardship and suffering . “ the puritanical ethic of the war generation is still very much ingrained in germany today , ” said fabian christandl , a researcher at the institute for economic and social psychology at the university of cologne . germans work hard , put their cash in a savings account , earn a bit of interest and only take on debt for big investments , said christandl . “ a house is one of the very few purchases for which it ’ s viewed as acceptable to go into debt , ” he said . and homeowners who possess enough capital to invest in residential property beyond their own four walls are not interested in flipping over properties for quick profits either , said beyerle .
real estate investments are viewed either as a source of steady rental income or a way to reduce one ’ s tax burden . bubble burst only once beyerle explained that after german reunification in the 1990s , the government provided tax incentives for investors to buy up and develop real estate in the former east german states , but when the scheme ended ten years ago , the housing market collapsed from properties that wound up being overvalued . “ this was the only time that the bubble burst in germany , ” said beyerle . since property values in the rest of germany have remained fairly steady , even in prime locations near major urban centers such as munich , frankfurt , stuttgart , hamburg or cologne , speculation fever never caught on in germany , he added . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : even in prime urban areas , prices have not skyrocketed “ the us housing market was based on the premise that home values had no where to go but up and would keep rising very rapidly .
then when it got bad , the whole pack of cards crumbled , ” said kempson .
she cited a world bank report which indicated that as much as 20 percent of all mortgages in the us are in the sub-prime category . loans without income verification in us in the uk , five percent of the mortgage market is sub-prime , but those with impaired credit histories might be marginal bank risks , such as students or those who have a perspective of future employment that would enable them to pay back their bank loans . not so in the us , where unlicensed mortgage brokers targeted low income groups who never would have been able to borrow from more conventional banks , said kempson . “ these brokers were aggressively selling “ discounted ” packages to those surviving on social security , ” she said .
kempson added that as much as 40 percent of the loans were made without any income verification , which is much less likely to happen in europe . following a short period of loans made at fixed low rates , borrowers with “ sub-prime bargains ” found their mortgages being reset at double-digit rates .
then when soaring us housing prices started to plunge , borrowers were saddled with sub-prime mortgages that exceeded the value of their homes and couldn ’ t refinance their way out of debt , said kempson . a nation of renters bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : younger home buyers with no capital shop for best rates achim duebel , a mortgage sector expert based in berlin , said the problem with sub-prime mortgages doesn ’ t exist in germany since it is largely a nation of renters . “ every sub-prime borrower here is a renter ” , he said . but duebel added that younger germans are looking at more innovative ways to invest in property . “ the mortgage market is not as dull and boring as it looks in germany , ” he said , explaining that most germans still take out traditional mortgages at their local bank , but there is a growing number of marginal , but not sub-prime borrowers - those with no capital , but strong cash flow , such as the self-employed or freelancers , who can find mortgage brokers offering packages that require little or even no financing . “ there is cutthroat competition out there , a younger generation that wants to shop for the best rates , the best deals , so this is giving the entire mortgage market a push , ” said duebel . diana fong send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

real estate investments are viewed either as a source of steady rental income or a way to reduce one ’ s tax burden . bubble burst only once beyerle explained that after german reunification in the 1990s , the government provided tax incentives for investors to buy up and develop real estate in the former east german states , but when the scheme ended ten years ago , the housing market collapsed from properties that wound up being overvalued . “ this was the only time that the bubble burst in germany , ” said beyerle . since property values in the rest of germany have remained fairly steady , even in prime locations near major urban centers such as munich , frankfurt , stuttgart , hamburg or cologne , speculation fever never caught on in germany , he added . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : even in prime urban areas , prices have not skyrocketed “ the us housing market was based on the premise that home values had no where to go but up and would keep rising very rapidly .
then when it got bad , the whole pack of cards crumbled , ” said kempson .
she cited a world bank report which indicated that as much as 20 percent of all mortgages in the us are in the sub-prime category . loans without income verification in us in the uk , five percent of the mortgage market is sub-prime , but those with impaired credit histories might be marginal bank risks , such as students or those who have a perspective of future employment that would enable them to pay back their bank loans . not so in the us , where unlicensed mortgage brokers targeted low income groups who never would have been able to borrow from more conventional banks , said kempson . “ these brokers were aggressively selling “ discounted ” packages to those surviving on social security , ” she said .
kempson added that as much as 40 percent of the loans were made without any income verification , which is much less likely to happen in europe . following a short period of loans made at fixed low rates , borrowers with “ sub-prime bargains ” found their mortgages being reset at double-digit rates .
then when soaring us housing prices started to plunge , borrowers were saddled with sub-prime mortgages that exceeded the value of their homes and couldn ’ t refinance their way out of debt , said kempson . a nation of renters bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : younger home buyers with no capital shop for best rates achim duebel , a mortgage sector expert based in berlin , said the problem with sub-prime mortgages doesn ’ t exist in germany since it is largely a nation of renters . “ every sub-prime borrower here is a renter ” , he said . but duebel added that younger germans are looking at more innovative ways to invest in property . “ the mortgage market is not as dull and boring as it looks in germany , ” he said , explaining that most germans still take out traditional mortgages at their local bank , but there is a growing number of marginal , but not sub-prime borrowers - those with no capital , but strong cash flow , such as the self-employed or freelancers , who can find mortgage brokers offering packages that require little or even no financing . “ there is cutthroat competition out there , a younger generation that wants to shop for the best rates , the best deals , so this is giving the entire mortgage market a push , ” said duebel . diana fong send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

germans tend to be debt-averse and are required to put down more equity in financing a home purchase . german politicians have criticized the us for failing to implement stringent controls on financial markets with many pointing out that the sub-prime mortgage crisis that felled wall street ’ s venerable financial institutions week could not happen in germany .
they may have a point . for one , experts say , the type of high risk lending practices that were exposed when the bubble burst in the us housing market a few years ago is more heavily regulated in germany . “ the sub-prime market is virtually non-existent , ” said elaine kempson , director of the personal finance research centre at the university of bristol . home ownership rates in germany are also among the lowest in europe - under 50 percent compared to around 70 percent in the us and the uk , said kempson , whose institute has done comparative studies in europe on personal credit risk and indebtedness . “ germans are much more conservative than americans and other europeans in terms of how much debt they are willing to take on , ” she said . larger down payments banks in germany also tend to have more stringent criteria in determining the creditworthiness of borrowers than their european or american counterparts . “ there is no such thing as zero financing on a home , ” said thomas beyerle , head of research at the degi , a frankfurt-based property investment company .
in germany , homeowners are required to make a down payment of at least 20 percent of the purchase price of a house to obtain a mortgage in the first place . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : foreclosures and defaulting on mortgage payments are far less common in germany michaela roth , spokesman of the german federation of savings and loan banks -lrb- dsgv -rrb- said it is not unusual to put down as much as 40 percent equity and finance the rest . “ germans generally are only prepared to be moderately indebted , ” she said .

"
conducted by omer welber , the istanbul philharmonic and the ra 'anana symphonette accompanied israeli virtuoso shlomo mintz , yair dalal and turkey 's cihat askin as they played sixteen violins that had outlasted the holocaust .
the concert was part of this year 's celebrations marking israel 's 60th anniversary .
proceeds from the event went to meir panim layeled , an organization that focuses on the welfare , education and health needs of children across israel .
16 violins , 16 stories bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : amnon weinstein some of the violins were responsible for saving jewish lives , and some helped fight the germans .
" each violin has its own story , " israeli violin maker amnon weinstein told reuters .
now 69 , he and his son have spent more than a decade restoring the violins collected from across europe .
weinstein said he received the instruments in various states of disrepair , many of them decorated with stars of david carved into the woodwork , a testimony to their former jewish owners .
" by restoring their violins , their legacy is born again , " said weinstein , who lost most of his family in the holocaust .
most of them were found in attics and cellars , where they had spent the last few decades gathering dust .
he said the majority originally came from ghettos and concentration camps , where nazis used to assemble orchestras . in some cases , weinstein was able to track their history and talk to the families they once belonged to .
the story of motele bildunterschrift : the event took place outside the walls of jerusalem 's old city according to the event 's website , one of the instruments originally belonged to a 12-year-old jewish boy who played it for nazi ss officers in belarus in 1944 .
his name was motele , and he had joined the resistance in a village near the border with ukraine and managed to infiltrate a nazi building there .
" the german officers heard him play in the streets one day and later brought him to perform every night in their compound in town , " said sefi hanegbi , whose father played alongside motele in a partisan camp in a forest during world war two .
after each performance , motele would hide his violin in the building and walk out with an empty case .
he would return with the violin case full of explosives , stuffing them into cracks in the walls , and eventually setting them off , hanegbi said .
motele was later killed in a german ambush , and hanegbi 's family brought his violin to israel where it sat in a closet for decades - forgotten until amnon weinstein gave it a second lease of life . dw staff -lrb- jp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

conducted by omer welber , the istanbul philharmonic and the ra 'anana symphonette accompanied israeli virtuoso shlomo mintz , yair dalal and turkey 's cihat askin as they played sixteen violins that had outlasted the holocaust .
the concert was part of this year 's celebrations marking israel 's 60th anniversary .
proceeds from the event went to meir panim layeled , an organization that focuses on the welfare , education and health needs of children across israel .
16 violins , 16 stories bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : amnon weinstein some of the violins were responsible for saving jewish lives , and some helped fight the germans .
" each violin has its own story , " israeli violin maker amnon weinstein told reuters .
now 69 , he and his son have spent more than a decade restoring the violins collected from across europe .
weinstein said he received the instruments in various states of disrepair , many of them decorated with stars of david carved into the woodwork , a testimony to their former jewish owners .
" by restoring their violins , their legacy is born again , " said weinstein , who lost most of his family in the holocaust .
most of them were found in attics and cellars , where they had spent the last few decades gathering dust .
he said the majority originally came from ghettos and concentration camps , where nazis used to assemble orchestras . in some cases , weinstein was able to track their history and talk to the families they once belonged to .
the story of motele bildunterschrift : the event took place outside the walls of jerusalem 's old city according to the event 's website , one of the instruments originally belonged to a 12-year-old jewish boy who played it for nazi ss officers in belarus in 1944 .
his name was motele , and he had joined the resistance in a village near the border with ukraine and managed to infiltrate a nazi building there .
" the german officers heard him play in the streets one day and later brought him to perform every night in their compound in town , " said sefi hanegbi , whose father played alongside motele in a partisan camp in a forest during world war two .
after each performance , motele would hide his violin in the building and walk out with an empty case .
he would return with the violin case full of explosives , stuffing them into cracks in the walls , and eventually setting them off , hanegbi said .
motele was later killed in a german ambush , and hanegbi 's family brought his violin to israel where it sat in a closet for decades - forgotten until amnon weinstein gave it a second lease of life . dw staff -lrb- jp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

but there is little they can do . in mid-september , the government issued a statement confirming that " work by ministers of health and justice on a draft law on obligatory chemical castration for pedophiles was nearing completion . "
according to polish media reports , the ministry plans to make the treatment compulsory for repeat offenders .
the pills would reduce or eliminate sex drive by suppressing the production of testosterone .
" our idea does n't yet have the form of a law , " ministry spokesman jakub golab told the daily polska .
" we 're currently consulting with sexologists ...
we want to bring it into effect as soon as possible . "
in as little as one year , convicted pedophiles would also be fitted with electronic collars if they have a court order against going near their victims , polska reported .
if the collars are found effective , the ministry of justice will decide if they should be given to all pedophiles .
poland 's fritzl bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : donald tusk prime minister donald tusk raised the controversial topic after a 45-year-old man was charged with having raped and held his 21-year-old daughter captive for six years .
the suspect , dubbed poland 's josef fritzl in a reference to the austrian man accused of incarcerating his daughter and fathering seven children with her , faces up to 15 years behind bars if found guilty .
the woman in poland gave birth to two children , in 2005 and 2007 , allegedly from her father .
she maintains that he pressured her to give them up for adoption .
the case triggered a nationwide debate on how criminal sex offenders should be punished , with the liberal prime minister taking a draconian stance .
" i want to gather all the laws in operation across europe to introduce in poland the most rigorous law possible regarding criminals who rape children , " tusk said .
" i do not believe that we can call these individuals - these creatures - human beings , " he added .
" so in this case , we do n't need to discuss human rights . "
eu outrage bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the pills reduce libido chemical castration for repeat sex offenders is already offered in several us states , as well as european countries including sweden , germany and denmark .
however , it is a voluntary process .
human rights activists and legal experts have criticized the polish plans , saying that forcing a patient to undergo chemical castration was inadmissible according to both polish and international law .
but klaus haensch , a social democrat member of the european parliament , told spiegel online that brussels is powerless to intervene .
" it does not have the competence , because criminal law is decided at a national level , " he said .
" but i do not feel that enforced chemical castration is an appropriate punishment that can be reconciled with modern criminal law . "
christian democrat mep elmar brok agreed , telling spiegel online that it was not " a fitting solution . "
the plan also has detractors in poland .

chancellor merkel 's call for greater transparency and regulation is not what the problem demands with regard to the failings of the financial markets .
the problem is rooted in the insistence by eu governments with regard to fractional reserve banking .
this enables vast amounts of credit to be made available and the ecb to back up any shortfall in bank reserves by placing the burden on tax payers and property owners .
to do what is necessary will necessitate the abandoning of the so-called social-market economy .
this is unlikely , so we can all expect further crises in the future . - charles smyth , great britain during these turbulent economic times , i 'm concerned that my investments are in jeopardy .

germans tend to be debt-averse and are required to put down more equity in financing a home purchase . german politicians have criticized the us for failing to implement stringent controls on financial markets with many pointing out that the sub-prime mortgage crisis that felled wall street ’ s venerable financial institutions week could not happen in germany .
they may have a point . for one , experts say , the type of high risk lending practices that were exposed when the bubble burst in the us housing market a few years ago is more heavily regulated in germany . “ the sub-prime market is virtually non-existent , ” said elaine kempson , director of the personal finance research centre at the university of bristol . home ownership rates in germany are also among the lowest in europe - under 50 percent compared to around 70 percent in the us and the uk , said kempson , whose institute has done comparative studies in europe on personal credit risk and indebtedness . “ germans are much more conservative than americans and other europeans in terms of how much debt they are willing to take on , ” she said . larger down payments banks in germany also tend to have more stringent criteria in determining the creditworthiness of borrowers than their european or american counterparts . “ there is no such thing as zero financing on a home , ” said thomas beyerle , head of research at the degi , a frankfurt-based property investment company .
in germany , homeowners are required to make a down payment of at least 20 percent of the purchase price of a house to obtain a mortgage in the first place . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : foreclosures and defaulting on mortgage payments are far less common in germany michaela roth , spokesman of the german federation of savings and loan banks -lrb- dsgv -rrb- said it is not unusual to put down as much as 40 percent equity and finance the rest . “ germans generally are only prepared to be moderately indebted , ” she said .
even big ticket purchases such as a washing machine are paid for with hard cash or bank debit cards , with only five percent of consumers even bothering to use a credit card . mind-set averse to debt some say german financial prudence has its roots in the world wars , a period marked by acute economic hardship and suffering . “ the puritanical ethic of the war generation is still very much ingrained in germany today , ” said fabian christandl , a researcher at the institute for economic and social psychology at the university of cologne . germans work hard , put their cash in a savings account , earn a bit of interest and only take on debt for big investments , said christandl . “ a house is one of the very few purchases for which it ’ s viewed as acceptable to go into debt , ” he said . and homeowners who possess enough capital to invest in residential property beyond their own four walls are not interested in flipping over properties for quick profits either , said beyerle .
real estate investments are viewed either as a source of steady rental income or a way to reduce one ’ s tax burden . bubble burst only once beyerle explained that after german reunification in the 1990s , the government provided tax incentives for investors to buy up and develop real estate in the former east german states , but when the scheme ended ten years ago , the housing market collapsed from properties that wound up being overvalued . “ this was the only time that the bubble burst in germany , ” said beyerle . since property values in the rest of germany have remained fairly steady , even in prime locations near major urban centers such as munich , frankfurt , stuttgart , hamburg or cologne , speculation fever never caught on in germany , he added . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : even in prime urban areas , prices have not skyrocketed “ the us housing market was based on the premise that home values had no where to go but up and would keep rising very rapidly .
then when it got bad , the whole pack of cards crumbled , ” said kempson .
she cited a world bank report which indicated that as much as 20 percent of all mortgages in the us are in the sub-prime category . loans without income verification in us in the uk , five percent of the mortgage market is sub-prime , but those with impaired credit histories might be marginal bank risks , such as students or those who have a perspective of future employment that would enable them to pay back their bank loans . not so in the us , where unlicensed mortgage brokers targeted low income groups who never would have been able to borrow from more conventional banks , said kempson . “ these brokers were aggressively selling “ discounted ” packages to those surviving on social security , ” she said .
kempson added that as much as 40 percent of the loans were made without any income verification , which is much less likely to happen in europe . following a short period of loans made at fixed low rates , borrowers with “ sub-prime bargains ” found their mortgages being reset at double-digit rates .
then when soaring us housing prices started to plunge , borrowers were saddled with sub-prime mortgages that exceeded the value of their homes and couldn ’ t refinance their way out of debt , said kempson . a nation of renters bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : younger home buyers with no capital shop for best rates achim duebel , a mortgage sector expert based in berlin , said the problem with sub-prime mortgages doesn ’ t exist in germany since it is largely a nation of renters . “ every sub-prime borrower here is a renter ” , he said . but duebel added that younger germans are looking at more innovative ways to invest in property . “ the mortgage market is not as dull and boring as it looks in germany , ” he said , explaining that most germans still take out traditional mortgages at their local bank , but there is a growing number of marginal , but not sub-prime borrowers - those with no capital , but strong cash flow , such as the self-employed or freelancers , who can find mortgage brokers offering packages that require little or even no financing . “ there is cutthroat competition out there , a younger generation that wants to shop for the best rates , the best deals , so this is giving the entire mortgage market a push , ” said duebel . diana fong send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

steinbrueck told the bundestag that the group of seven -lrb- g7 -rrb- finance ministers would be meeting in washington next month to discuss how to tighten regulation of capital markets .
the german federal government , meanwhile , would continue efforts to trim spending , but would also make some moves to stimulate the economy .

washington has been reluctant to increase minimum equity rules and has too many competing regulators over us investment banks .

"
this , he said , would strengthen the german banking system and boost its sustainability .
" financial support from the government in mopping up problems in this sector should not be expected , " he added . given that past attempts to fuse the " landesbanken " have failed , steinbrueck proposed a redefinition of their business models in order to avoid excessive risk and to increase returns .

germans tend to be debt-averse and are required to put down more equity in financing a home purchase . german politicians have criticized the us for failing to implement stringent controls on financial markets with many pointing out that the sub-prime mortgage crisis that felled wall street ’ s venerable financial institutions week could not happen in germany .
they may have a point . for one , experts say , the type of high risk lending practices that were exposed when the bubble burst in the us housing market a few years ago is more heavily regulated in germany . “ the sub-prime market is virtually non-existent , ” said elaine kempson , director of the personal finance research centre at the university of bristol . home ownership rates in germany are also among the lowest in europe - under 50 percent compared to around 70 percent in the us and the uk , said kempson , whose institute has done comparative studies in europe on personal credit risk and indebtedness . “ germans are much more conservative than americans and other europeans in terms of how much debt they are willing to take on , ” she said . larger down payments banks in germany also tend to have more stringent criteria in determining the creditworthiness of borrowers than their european or american counterparts . “ there is no such thing as zero financing on a home , ” said thomas beyerle , head of research at the degi , a frankfurt-based property investment company .
in germany , homeowners are required to make a down payment of at least 20 percent of the purchase price of a house to obtain a mortgage in the first place . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : foreclosures and defaulting on mortgage payments are far less common in germany michaela roth , spokesman of the german federation of savings and loan banks -lrb- dsgv -rrb- said it is not unusual to put down as much as 40 percent equity and finance the rest . “ germans generally are only prepared to be moderately indebted , ” she said .
even big ticket purchases such as a washing machine are paid for with hard cash or bank debit cards , with only five percent of consumers even bothering to use a credit card . mind-set averse to debt some say german financial prudence has its roots in the world wars , a period marked by acute economic hardship and suffering . “ the puritanical ethic of the war generation is still very much ingrained in germany today , ” said fabian christandl , a researcher at the institute for economic and social psychology at the university of cologne . germans work hard , put their cash in a savings account , earn a bit of interest and only take on debt for big investments , said christandl . “ a house is one of the very few purchases for which it ’ s viewed as acceptable to go into debt , ” he said . and homeowners who possess enough capital to invest in residential property beyond their own four walls are not interested in flipping over properties for quick profits either , said beyerle .
real estate investments are viewed either as a source of steady rental income or a way to reduce one ’ s tax burden . bubble burst only once beyerle explained that after german reunification in the 1990s , the government provided tax incentives for investors to buy up and develop real estate in the former east german states , but when the scheme ended ten years ago , the housing market collapsed from properties that wound up being overvalued . “ this was the only time that the bubble burst in germany , ” said beyerle . since property values in the rest of germany have remained fairly steady , even in prime locations near major urban centers such as munich , frankfurt , stuttgart , hamburg or cologne , speculation fever never caught on in germany , he added . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : even in prime urban areas , prices have not skyrocketed “ the us housing market was based on the premise that home values had no where to go but up and would keep rising very rapidly .
then when it got bad , the whole pack of cards crumbled , ” said kempson .
she cited a world bank report which indicated that as much as 20 percent of all mortgages in the us are in the sub-prime category . loans without income verification in us in the uk , five percent of the mortgage market is sub-prime , but those with impaired credit histories might be marginal bank risks , such as students or those who have a perspective of future employment that would enable them to pay back their bank loans . not so in the us , where unlicensed mortgage brokers targeted low income groups who never would have been able to borrow from more conventional banks , said kempson . “ these brokers were aggressively selling “ discounted ” packages to those surviving on social security , ” she said .
kempson added that as much as 40 percent of the loans were made without any income verification , which is much less likely to happen in europe . following a short period of loans made at fixed low rates , borrowers with “ sub-prime bargains ” found their mortgages being reset at double-digit rates .
then when soaring us housing prices started to plunge , borrowers were saddled with sub-prime mortgages that exceeded the value of their homes and couldn ’ t refinance their way out of debt , said kempson . a nation of renters bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : younger home buyers with no capital shop for best rates achim duebel , a mortgage sector expert based in berlin , said the problem with sub-prime mortgages doesn ’ t exist in germany since it is largely a nation of renters . “ every sub-prime borrower here is a renter ” , he said . but duebel added that younger germans are looking at more innovative ways to invest in property . “ the mortgage market is not as dull and boring as it looks in germany , ” he said , explaining that most germans still take out traditional mortgages at their local bank , but there is a growing number of marginal , but not sub-prime borrowers - those with no capital , but strong cash flow , such as the self-employed or freelancers , who can find mortgage brokers offering packages that require little or even no financing . “ there is cutthroat competition out there , a younger generation that wants to shop for the best rates , the best deals , so this is giving the entire mortgage market a push , ” said duebel . diana fong send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

she maintains that he pressured her to give them up for adoption .
the case triggered a nationwide debate on how criminal sex offenders should be punished , with the liberal prime minister taking a draconian stance .
" i want to gather all the laws in operation across europe to introduce in poland the most rigorous law possible regarding criminals who rape children , " tusk said .
" i do not believe that we can call these individuals - these creatures - human beings , " he added .
" so in this case , we do n't need to discuss human rights . "
eu outrage bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the pills reduce libido chemical castration for repeat sex offenders is already offered in several us states , as well as european countries including sweden , germany and denmark .
however , it is a voluntary process .
human rights activists and legal experts have criticized the polish plans , saying that forcing a patient to undergo chemical castration was inadmissible according to both polish and international law .
but klaus haensch , a social democrat member of the european parliament , told spiegel online that brussels is powerless to intervene .
" it does not have the competence , because criminal law is decided at a national level , " he said .
" but i do not feel that enforced chemical castration is an appropriate punishment that can be reconciled with modern criminal law . "
christian democrat mep elmar brok agreed , telling spiegel online that it was not " a fitting solution . "
the plan also has detractors in poland .
" what the prime minister said was a scandal , " ryszard kalisz , a deputy for the opposition democratic left alliance , said in an interview with radio tok .
" his comment that ' there are people in poland who are n't human beings ' violates the constitution entirely . " dw staff -lrb- jp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de banking -pipe- 25.09.2008 debt-averse germans unlikely to attract sub-prime trouble großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : it 's acceptable to go into debt to buy a house sub-prime mortgages are virtually unknown in germany since home ownership rates are relatively low .
germans tend to be debt-averse and are required to put down more equity in financing a home purchase . german politicians have criticized the us for failing to implement stringent controls on financial markets with many pointing out that the sub-prime mortgage crisis that felled wall street ’ s venerable financial institutions week could not happen in germany .
they may have a point . for one , experts say , the type of high risk lending practices that were exposed when the bubble burst in the us housing market a few years ago is more heavily regulated in germany . “ the sub-prime market is virtually non-existent , ” said elaine kempson , director of the personal finance research centre at the university of bristol . home ownership rates in germany are also among the lowest in europe - under 50 percent compared to around 70 percent in the us and the uk , said kempson , whose institute has done comparative studies in europe on personal credit risk and indebtedness . “ germans are much more conservative than americans and other europeans in terms of how much debt they are willing to take on , ” she said . larger down payments banks in germany also tend to have more stringent criteria in determining the creditworthiness of borrowers than their european or american counterparts . “ there is no such thing as zero financing on a home , ” said thomas beyerle , head of research at the degi , a frankfurt-based property investment company .
in germany , homeowners are required to make a down payment of at least 20 percent of the purchase price of a house to obtain a mortgage in the first place . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : foreclosures and defaulting on mortgage payments are far less common in germany michaela roth , spokesman of the german federation of savings and loan banks -lrb- dsgv -rrb- said it is not unusual to put down as much as 40 percent equity and finance the rest . “ germans generally are only prepared to be moderately indebted , ” she said .
even big ticket purchases such as a washing machine are paid for with hard cash or bank debit cards , with only five percent of consumers even bothering to use a credit card . mind-set averse to debt some say german financial prudence has its roots in the world wars , a period marked by acute economic hardship and suffering . “ the puritanical ethic of the war generation is still very much ingrained in germany today , ” said fabian christandl , a researcher at the institute for economic and social psychology at the university of cologne . germans work hard , put their cash in a savings account , earn a bit of interest and only take on debt for big investments , said christandl . “ a house is one of the very few purchases for which it ’ s viewed as acceptable to go into debt , ” he said . and homeowners who possess enough capital to invest in residential property beyond their own four walls are not interested in flipping over properties for quick profits either , said beyerle .
real estate investments are viewed either as a source of steady rental income or a way to reduce one ’ s tax burden . bubble burst only once beyerle explained that after german reunification in the 1990s , the government provided tax incentives for investors to buy up and develop real estate in the former east german states , but when the scheme ended ten years ago , the housing market collapsed from properties that wound up being overvalued . “ this was the only time that the bubble burst in germany , ” said beyerle . since property values in the rest of germany have remained fairly steady , even in prime locations near major urban centers such as munich , frankfurt , stuttgart , hamburg or cologne , speculation fever never caught on in germany , he added . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : even in prime urban areas , prices have not skyrocketed “ the us housing market was based on the premise that home values had no where to go but up and would keep rising very rapidly .
then when it got bad , the whole pack of cards crumbled , ” said kempson .
she cited a world bank report which indicated that as much as 20 percent of all mortgages in the us are in the sub-prime category . loans without income verification in us in the uk , five percent of the mortgage market is sub-prime , but those with impaired credit histories might be marginal bank risks , such as students or those who have a perspective of future employment that would enable them to pay back their bank loans . not so in the us , where unlicensed mortgage brokers targeted low income groups who never would have been able to borrow from more conventional banks , said kempson . “ these brokers were aggressively selling “ discounted ” packages to those surviving on social security , ” she said .
kempson added that as much as 40 percent of the loans were made without any income verification , which is much less likely to happen in europe . following a short period of loans made at fixed low rates , borrowers with “ sub-prime bargains ” found their mortgages being reset at double-digit rates .
then when soaring us housing prices started to plunge , borrowers were saddled with sub-prime mortgages that exceeded the value of their homes and couldn ’ t refinance their way out of debt , said kempson . a nation of renters bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : younger home buyers with no capital shop for best rates achim duebel , a mortgage sector expert based in berlin , said the problem with sub-prime mortgages doesn ’ t exist in germany since it is largely a nation of renters . “ every sub-prime borrower here is a renter ” , he said . but duebel added that younger germans are looking at more innovative ways to invest in property . “ the mortgage market is not as dull and boring as it looks in germany , ” he said , explaining that most germans still take out traditional mortgages at their local bank , but there is a growing number of marginal , but not sub-prime borrowers - those with no capital , but strong cash flow , such as the self-employed or freelancers , who can find mortgage brokers offering packages that require little or even no financing . “ there is cutthroat competition out there , a younger generation that wants to shop for the best rates , the best deals , so this is giving the entire mortgage market a push , ” said duebel . diana fong send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

but a blue card scheme for skilled migrants is still on hold . the immigration and asylum pact , which is due to be formally adopted by eu leaders at their october 15-16 summit , seeks to improve the management of legal immigration , tighten controls on illegal immigrants and construct a common asylum policy .
" the aim of the pact is to avoid the two obvious potential pitfalls : the creation of a european fortress , and the total opening up to illegal immigration , " said french interior minister brice hortefeux , who was chairing the interior ministers ' meeting .
but critics argue that the final , watered-down version agreed by ministers in brussels on thursday is ineffective and gives too great a voice to national governments .
for instance , the pact calls on eu countries to attract more highly skilled workers from outside the bloc .
but it leaves governments with the power to decide who and how many of them should be admitted in their own countries .
the czech republic is also currently holding up a deal on a new european " blue card " workers visa program .
eu officials say a single and simplified eu-wide working visa is needed to attract doctors , nurses , engineers and scientsists .
but interior minister ivan langer said the czechs would not agree to the plan until internal eu restrictions are lifted on the movement of workers from new member states .
germany , belgium , austria and denmark have not fully opened up their labor markets to workers from those eastern european countries who joined the bloc over the last few years .
hortefeux said he was nonetheless confident that the eu could overcome this obstacle by the end of the year .
the scheme will not , however , allow recipients to move around as freely as first envisaged .
tougher controls bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the eu is divided over how to respond to the iraqi refugee crisis the pact also calls on member states to tighten controls on illegal immigrants and improve the effectiveness of controls on the bloc 's external borders , for instance by sharing the fingerprints of incoming foreigners in a common database .
another proposal involves national authorities enacting expulsion orders made by another member state .
however , the eu 's border control agency , frontex , remains grossly underfunded , while there is little evidence that the mutual recognition of expulsion decisions is being implemented , according to a recent study by the centre for european policy studies , a brussels-based think tank .
meanwhile , plans for a common asylum policy are progressing slowly and are now not expected to come into force before 2012 .
highlighting the difficulties existing in this area , some member states have resisted calls by germany and sweden to share out some 10,000 highly vulnerable iraqi refugees among member states .
on thursday , ministers limited themselves to giving the green-light to a fact-finding mission to syria and jordan , where many displaced iraqis have fled after the toppling of former dictator saddam hussein .
the mission , which is to take place at the beginning of november , aims to identify those most in need of being granted asylum in europe . dw staff -lrb- mrm / jg -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de immigration -pipe- 25.09.2008 eu agrees new guidelines on immigration großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the new eu blue card is meant to work like the american green card the european union 's interior ministers agreed thursday on common principles guiding the way member states manage the influx of non-eu nationals .
but a blue card scheme for skilled migrants is still on hold . the immigration and asylum pact , which is due to be formally adopted by eu leaders at their october 15-16 summit , seeks to improve the management of legal immigration , tighten controls on illegal immigrants and construct a common asylum policy .
" the aim of the pact is to avoid the two obvious potential pitfalls : the creation of a european fortress , and the total opening up to illegal immigration , " said french interior minister brice hortefeux , who was chairing the interior ministers ' meeting .
but critics argue that the final , watered-down version agreed by ministers in brussels on thursday is ineffective and gives too great a voice to national governments .
for instance , the pact calls on eu countries to attract more highly skilled workers from outside the bloc .
but it leaves governments with the power to decide who and how many of them should be admitted in their own countries .
the czech republic is also currently holding up a deal on a new european " blue card " workers visa program .
eu officials say a single and simplified eu-wide working visa is needed to attract doctors , nurses , engineers and scientsists .
but interior minister ivan langer said the czechs would not agree to the plan until internal eu restrictions are lifted on the movement of workers from new member states .
germany , belgium , austria and denmark have not fully opened up their labor markets to workers from those eastern european countries who joined the bloc over the last few years .
hortefeux said he was nonetheless confident that the eu could overcome this obstacle by the end of the year .
the scheme will not , however , allow recipients to move around as freely as first envisaged .
tougher controls bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the eu is divided over how to respond to the iraqi refugee crisis the pact also calls on member states to tighten controls on illegal immigrants and improve the effectiveness of controls on the bloc 's external borders , for instance by sharing the fingerprints of incoming foreigners in a common database .
another proposal involves national authorities enacting expulsion orders made by another member state .
however , the eu 's border control agency , frontex , remains grossly underfunded , while there is little evidence that the mutual recognition of expulsion decisions is being implemented , according to a recent study by the centre for european policy studies , a brussels-based think tank .
meanwhile , plans for a common asylum policy are progressing slowly and are now not expected to come into force before 2012 .

"
conducted by omer welber , the istanbul philharmonic and the ra 'anana symphonette accompanied israeli virtuoso shlomo mintz , yair dalal and turkey 's cihat askin as they played sixteen violins that had outlasted the holocaust .
the concert was part of this year 's celebrations marking israel 's 60th anniversary .
proceeds from the event went to meir panim layeled , an organization that focuses on the welfare , education and health needs of children across israel .
16 violins , 16 stories bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : amnon weinstein some of the violins were responsible for saving jewish lives , and some helped fight the germans .
" each violin has its own story , " israeli violin maker amnon weinstein told reuters .
now 69 , he and his son have spent more than a decade restoring the violins collected from across europe .
weinstein said he received the instruments in various states of disrepair , many of them decorated with stars of david carved into the woodwork , a testimony to their former jewish owners .
" by restoring their violins , their legacy is born again , " said weinstein , who lost most of his family in the holocaust .
most of them were found in attics and cellars , where they had spent the last few decades gathering dust .
he said the majority originally came from ghettos and concentration camps , where nazis used to assemble orchestras . in some cases , weinstein was able to track their history and talk to the families they once belonged to .
the story of motele bildunterschrift : the event took place outside the walls of jerusalem 's old city according to the event 's website , one of the instruments originally belonged to a 12-year-old jewish boy who played it for nazi ss officers in belarus in 1944 .
his name was motele , and he had joined the resistance in a village near the border with ukraine and managed to infiltrate a nazi building there .
" the german officers heard him play in the streets one day and later brought him to perform every night in their compound in town , " said sefi hanegbi , whose father played alongside motele in a partisan camp in a forest during world war two .
after each performance , motele would hide his violin in the building and walk out with an empty case .
he would return with the violin case full of explosives , stuffing them into cracks in the walls , and eventually setting them off , hanegbi said .
motele was later killed in a german ambush , and hanegbi 's family brought his violin to israel where it sat in a closet for decades - forgotten until amnon weinstein gave it a second lease of life . dw staff -lrb- jp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de immigration -pipe- 25.09.2008 eu agrees new guidelines on immigration großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the new eu blue card is meant to work like the american green card the european union 's interior ministers agreed thursday on common principles guiding the way member states manage the influx of non-eu nationals .
but a blue card scheme for skilled migrants is still on hold . the immigration and asylum pact , which is due to be formally adopted by eu leaders at their october 15-16 summit , seeks to improve the management of legal immigration , tighten controls on illegal immigrants and construct a common asylum policy .
" the aim of the pact is to avoid the two obvious potential pitfalls : the creation of a european fortress , and the total opening up to illegal immigration , " said french interior minister brice hortefeux , who was chairing the interior ministers ' meeting .
but critics argue that the final , watered-down version agreed by ministers in brussels on thursday is ineffective and gives too great a voice to national governments .
for instance , the pact calls on eu countries to attract more highly skilled workers from outside the bloc .
but it leaves governments with the power to decide who and how many of them should be admitted in their own countries .
the czech republic is also currently holding up a deal on a new european " blue card " workers visa program .
eu officials say a single and simplified eu-wide working visa is needed to attract doctors , nurses , engineers and scientsists .
but interior minister ivan langer said the czechs would not agree to the plan until internal eu restrictions are lifted on the movement of workers from new member states .
germany , belgium , austria and denmark have not fully opened up their labor markets to workers from those eastern european countries who joined the bloc over the last few years .
hortefeux said he was nonetheless confident that the eu could overcome this obstacle by the end of the year .
the scheme will not , however , allow recipients to move around as freely as first envisaged .
tougher controls bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the eu is divided over how to respond to the iraqi refugee crisis the pact also calls on member states to tighten controls on illegal immigrants and improve the effectiveness of controls on the bloc 's external borders , for instance by sharing the fingerprints of incoming foreigners in a common database .
another proposal involves national authorities enacting expulsion orders made by another member state .
however , the eu 's border control agency , frontex , remains grossly underfunded , while there is little evidence that the mutual recognition of expulsion decisions is being implemented , according to a recent study by the centre for european policy studies , a brussels-based think tank .
meanwhile , plans for a common asylum policy are progressing slowly and are now not expected to come into force before 2012 .
highlighting the difficulties existing in this area , some member states have resisted calls by germany and sweden to share out some 10,000 highly vulnerable iraqi refugees among member states .
on thursday , ministers limited themselves to giving the green-light to a fact-finding mission to syria and jordan , where many displaced iraqis have fled after the toppling of former dictator saddam hussein .
the mission , which is to take place at the beginning of november , aims to identify those most in need of being granted asylum in europe . dw staff -lrb- mrm / jg -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

"
conducted by omer welber , the istanbul philharmonic and the ra 'anana symphonette accompanied israeli virtuoso shlomo mintz , yair dalal and turkey 's cihat askin as they played sixteen violins that had outlasted the holocaust .
the concert was part of this year 's celebrations marking israel 's 60th anniversary .
proceeds from the event went to meir panim layeled , an organization that focuses on the welfare , education and health needs of children across israel .
16 violins , 16 stories bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : amnon weinstein some of the violins were responsible for saving jewish lives , and some helped fight the germans .
" each violin has its own story , " israeli violin maker amnon weinstein told reuters .
now 69 , he and his son have spent more than a decade restoring the violins collected from across europe .
weinstein said he received the instruments in various states of disrepair , many of them decorated with stars of david carved into the woodwork , a testimony to their former jewish owners .
" by restoring their violins , their legacy is born again , " said weinstein , who lost most of his family in the holocaust .
most of them were found in attics and cellars , where they had spent the last few decades gathering dust .
he said the majority originally came from ghettos and concentration camps , where nazis used to assemble orchestras . in some cases , weinstein was able to track their history and talk to the families they once belonged to .
the story of motele bildunterschrift : the event took place outside the walls of jerusalem 's old city according to the event 's website , one of the instruments originally belonged to a 12-year-old jewish boy who played it for nazi ss officers in belarus in 1944 .
his name was motele , and he had joined the resistance in a village near the border with ukraine and managed to infiltrate a nazi building there .
" the german officers heard him play in the streets one day and later brought him to perform every night in their compound in town , " said sefi hanegbi , whose father played alongside motele in a partisan camp in a forest during world war two .
after each performance , motele would hide his violin in the building and walk out with an empty case .
he would return with the violin case full of explosives , stuffing them into cracks in the walls , and eventually setting them off , hanegbi said .
motele was later killed in a german ambush , and hanegbi 's family brought his violin to israel where it sat in a closet for decades - forgotten until amnon weinstein gave it a second lease of life . dw staff -lrb- jp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

german broadcaster zdf had reported that western intelligence services now have indications that breininger , a convert to islam , had returned to europe , and possibly germany , and was trying to procure explosives .
but a spokesman said there was no concrete evidence breininger was plotting an actual attack .
police said , however , that breininger , who is from the state of saarland in western germany , had recorded an internet video in august in which he spoke of carrying out a suicide attack and supported jihad or holy war .
the federal crime office -lrb- bka -rrb- showed photos of the two men on its web page listing the most wanted suspects in the country .
both men are suspected of links to the islamic jihad union -lrb- iju -rrb- , which is affiliated with al qaeda and investigators say was behind a major bomb plot in germany that they thwarted last september .
its targets included frankfurt airport and the us base of ramstein . dw staff -lrb- jg -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

chancellor merkel 's call for greater transparency and regulation is not what the problem demands with regard to the failings of the financial markets .
the problem is rooted in the insistence by eu governments with regard to fractional reserve banking .
this enables vast amounts of credit to be made available and the ecb to back up any shortfall in bank reserves by placing the burden on tax payers and property owners .
to do what is necessary will necessitate the abandoning of the so-called social-market economy .

elser was arrested , tortured and murdered at dachau by the nazis six years later .
the bust of elser was put up at private expense on a riverside near the interior ministry in berlin on wednesday , sept .
24 .
a plaque in his memory was put up several years ago in his hometown , koenigsbronn , in south-western germany .
elser , a wood joiner of strongly anti-nazi views , planted the bomb alone in a bid to stop the war .
the german resistance memorial movement said the bombing and a bomb set by colonel claus von stauffenberg in 1944 , which slightly wounded hitler , were the only assassination attempts that ever put hitler in danger .
a foundation established by a businessman , ernst freiberger , paid for the bust .

german broadcaster zdf had reported that western intelligence services now have indications that breininger , a convert to islam , had returned to europe , and possibly germany , and was trying to procure explosives .
but a spokesman said there was no concrete evidence breininger was plotting an actual attack .
police said , however , that breininger , who is from the state of saarland in western germany , had recorded an internet video in august in which he spoke of carrying out a suicide attack and supported jihad or holy war .
the federal crime office -lrb- bka -rrb- showed photos of the two men on its web page listing the most wanted suspects in the country .
both men are suspected of links to the islamic jihad union -lrb- iju -rrb- , which is affiliated with al qaeda and investigators say was behind a major bomb plot in germany that they thwarted last september .
its targets included frankfurt airport and the us base of ramstein . dw staff -lrb- jg -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

german broadcaster zdf had reported that western intelligence services now have indications that breininger , a convert to islam , had returned to europe , and possibly germany , and was trying to procure explosives .
but a spokesman said there was no concrete evidence breininger was plotting an actual attack .
police said , however , that breininger , who is from the state of saarland in western germany , had recorded an internet video in august in which he spoke of carrying out a suicide attack and supported jihad or holy war .
the federal crime office -lrb- bka -rrb- showed photos of the two men on its web page listing the most wanted suspects in the country .
both men are suspected of links to the islamic jihad union -lrb- iju -rrb- , which is affiliated with al qaeda and investigators say was behind a major bomb plot in germany that they thwarted last september .

chancellor merkel 's call for greater transparency and regulation is not what the problem demands with regard to the failings of the financial markets .
the problem is rooted in the insistence by eu governments with regard to fractional reserve banking .
this enables vast amounts of credit to be made available and the ecb to back up any shortfall in bank reserves by placing the burden on tax payers and property owners .
to do what is necessary will necessitate the abandoning of the so-called social-market economy .
this is unlikely , so we can all expect further crises in the future . - charles smyth , great britain during these turbulent economic times , i 'm concerned that my investments are in jeopardy .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de immigration -pipe- 25.09.2008 eu agrees new guidelines on immigration großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the new eu blue card is meant to work like the american green card the european union 's interior ministers agreed thursday on common principles guiding the way member states manage the influx of non-eu nationals .
but a blue card scheme for skilled migrants is still on hold . the immigration and asylum pact , which is due to be formally adopted by eu leaders at their october 15-16 summit , seeks to improve the management of legal immigration , tighten controls on illegal immigrants and construct a common asylum policy .
" the aim of the pact is to avoid the two obvious potential pitfalls : the creation of a european fortress , and the total opening up to illegal immigration , " said french interior minister brice hortefeux , who was chairing the interior ministers ' meeting .
but critics argue that the final , watered-down version agreed by ministers in brussels on thursday is ineffective and gives too great a voice to national governments .
for instance , the pact calls on eu countries to attract more highly skilled workers from outside the bloc .
but it leaves governments with the power to decide who and how many of them should be admitted in their own countries .
the czech republic is also currently holding up a deal on a new european " blue card " workers visa program .
eu officials say a single and simplified eu-wide working visa is needed to attract doctors , nurses , engineers and scientsists .
but interior minister ivan langer said the czechs would not agree to the plan until internal eu restrictions are lifted on the movement of workers from new member states .
germany , belgium , austria and denmark have not fully opened up their labor markets to workers from those eastern european countries who joined the bloc over the last few years .
hortefeux said he was nonetheless confident that the eu could overcome this obstacle by the end of the year .
the scheme will not , however , allow recipients to move around as freely as first envisaged .
tougher controls bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the eu is divided over how to respond to the iraqi refugee crisis the pact also calls on member states to tighten controls on illegal immigrants and improve the effectiveness of controls on the bloc 's external borders , for instance by sharing the fingerprints of incoming foreigners in a common database .
another proposal involves national authorities enacting expulsion orders made by another member state .
however , the eu 's border control agency , frontex , remains grossly underfunded , while there is little evidence that the mutual recognition of expulsion decisions is being implemented , according to a recent study by the centre for european policy studies , a brussels-based think tank .
meanwhile , plans for a common asylum policy are progressing slowly and are now not expected to come into force before 2012 .
highlighting the difficulties existing in this area , some member states have resisted calls by germany and sweden to share out some 10,000 highly vulnerable iraqi refugees among member states .
on thursday , ministers limited themselves to giving the green-light to a fact-finding mission to syria and jordan , where many displaced iraqis have fled after the toppling of former dictator saddam hussein .
the mission , which is to take place at the beginning of november , aims to identify those most in need of being granted asylum in europe . dw staff -lrb- mrm / jg -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de business -pipe- 25.09.2008 german finance minister blames us for financial crisis großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : wall street will never be the same again , said steinbrueck german finance minister peer steinbrueck deemed the us banking crisis an " earthquake " that will cost the us its role as a superpower of the world financial system .
he stressed that german banks can cope with losses . " wall street and the world will never again be the way they were before the crisis , " said steinbrueck in a speech to the german parliament , the bundestag , on thursday , sept .
25 .
write-downs and write-offs of bad credit spawned by " a blind drive for double-digit profits " have so far totaled $ 550 billion and no end to the crisis is in sight , he added .
the world financial system will consequently become more " multi-polar , " he predicted .
steinbrueck told the bundestag that the group of seven -lrb- g7 -rrb- finance ministers would be meeting in washington next month to discuss how to tighten regulation of capital markets .
the german federal government , meanwhile , would continue efforts to trim spending , but would also make some moves to stimulate the economy .
he reiterated germany 's refusal to set up its own bank bail-out scheme , saying the crisis was principally a us problem .
irresponsible moves bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : steinbrueck did n't pull his punches during the bundestag speech reiterating berlin 's push for tighter regulation , steinbrueck accused the us of blunders .
" the cause of the crisis was the irresponsible exaggeration of the principle of a free , unrestrained market , " he told the bundestag .
washington has been reluctant to increase minimum equity rules and has too many competing regulators over us investment banks .
" this system , which in many ways is inadequately regulated , is now collapsing , " he said , adding that germany 's banking system remained " relatively robust , " with german regulators confident they can absorb losses .
" new rules of the road " for the financial markets were needed , he said .
plans to be debated when the finance ministers of the g7 meet will include tightening cooperation between the international monetary fund -lrb- imf -rrb- and the financial stability forum -lrb- fsf -rrb- .
the agencies were created by western nations as an early warning system .
strengthening cooperation bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the german landesbanken need to pull together steinbrueck also renewed his call for fusion across germany 's state bank sector .
the country 's big commercial lenders , the so-called " landesbanken , " have been hard hit by the financial crisis . the next move needs to be made by the individual states , as co-owners of the leading state banks , said the social democrat minister : " they need to overcome regional political pride and embrace pan-regional co-operation . "
this , he said , would strengthen the german banking system and boost its sustainability .
" financial support from the government in mopping up problems in this sector should not be expected , " he added . given that past attempts to fuse the " landesbanken " have failed , steinbrueck proposed a redefinition of their business models in order to avoid excessive risk and to increase returns .
the financial crisis has , however , shown that both savings banks and cooperative banking institutions are stable and reliable , said steinbrueck . dw staff -lrb- jp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

he stressed that german banks can cope with losses . " wall street and the world will never again be the way they were before the crisis , " said steinbrueck in a speech to the german parliament , the bundestag , on thursday , sept .

write-downs and write-offs of bad credit spawned by " a blind drive for double-digit profits " have so far totaled $ 550 billion and no end to the crisis is in sight , he added .
the world financial system will consequently become more " multi-polar , " he predicted .
steinbrueck told the bundestag that the group of seven -lrb- g7 -rrb- finance ministers would be meeting in washington next month to discuss how to tighten regulation of capital markets .
the german federal government , meanwhile , would continue efforts to trim spending , but would also make some moves to stimulate the economy .
he reiterated germany 's refusal to set up its own bank bail-out scheme , saying the crisis was principally a us problem .
irresponsible moves bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : steinbrueck did n't pull his punches during the bundestag speech reiterating berlin 's push for tighter regulation , steinbrueck accused the us of blunders .
" the cause of the crisis was the irresponsible exaggeration of the principle of a free , unrestrained market , " he told the bundestag .
washington has been reluctant to increase minimum equity rules and has too many competing regulators over us investment banks .
" this system , which in many ways is inadequately regulated , is now collapsing , " he said , adding that germany 's banking system remained " relatively robust , " with german regulators confident they can absorb losses .
" new rules of the road " for the financial markets were needed , he said .
plans to be debated when the finance ministers of the g7 meet will include tightening cooperation between the international monetary fund -lrb- imf -rrb- and the financial stability forum -lrb- fsf -rrb- .

the country 's big commercial lenders , the so-called " landesbanken , " have been hard hit by the financial crisis . the next move needs to be made by the individual states , as co-owners of the leading state banks , said the social democrat minister : " they need to overcome regional political pride and embrace pan-regional co-operation . "
this , he said , would strengthen the german banking system and boost its sustainability .
" financial support from the government in mopping up problems in this sector should not be expected , " he added . given that past attempts to fuse the " landesbanken " have failed , steinbrueck proposed a redefinition of their business models in order to avoid excessive risk and to increase returns .

the woman in poland gave birth to two children , in 2005 and 2007 , allegedly from her father .
she maintains that he pressured her to give them up for adoption .
the case triggered a nationwide debate on how criminal sex offenders should be punished , with the liberal prime minister taking a draconian stance .
" i want to gather all the laws in operation across europe to introduce in poland the most rigorous law possible regarding criminals who rape children , " tusk said .
" i do not believe that we can call these individuals - these creatures - human beings , " he added .
" so in this case , we do n't need to discuss human rights . "
eu outrage bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the pills reduce libido chemical castration for repeat sex offenders is already offered in several us states , as well as european countries including sweden , germany and denmark .
however , it is a voluntary process .
human rights activists and legal experts have criticized the polish plans , saying that forcing a patient to undergo chemical castration was inadmissible according to both polish and international law .
but klaus haensch , a social democrat member of the european parliament , told spiegel online that brussels is powerless to intervene .
" it does not have the competence , because criminal law is decided at a national level , " he said .
" but i do not feel that enforced chemical castration is an appropriate punishment that can be reconciled with modern criminal law . "
christian democrat mep elmar brok agreed , telling spiegel online that it was not " a fitting solution . "
the plan also has detractors in poland .

even co-host poland has expressed doubts about its feasibility . europe 's governing football body uefa is facing a dilemma .
nobody is questioning that the euro 2012 preparations in the ukraine and poland are in trouble , but the million dollar question is : what to do about it ? for the first time in the history of the organization , the right to host the showpiece of european football could be taken away or germany could be used to find some sort of compromise .
there are also those who are , even in the face of ever-growing evidence to the contrary , saying that everything will be fine . the uefa executive committee , which started its meeting in the five-star grand hotel in bordeaux earlier on thursday , is not only trying to save its own reputation , probably more importantly , it is trying to find a solution . another option shortly before the start of the two-day meeting the 13-member committee was presented with another possible alternative by the president of the polish football federation .
michal listkiewicz suggested on the website of a german newspaper that it might make sense to host the euro finals in ukraine and poland four years later and give the 2012 finals to another country . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : platini now says the award can be removed listkiewicz seems far from convinced his country will be ready in four years time .
the biggest problem : poor infrastructure and terrible traffic , he said . " if the european championships took place in 2016 , we would no problems about being ready then , " listkiewicz told die zeit online , the internet platform of the weekly newspaper . " but realistically we are looking at having no good roads in time for 2012 . " said listkiewicz .
" from gdansk -lrb- in poland -rrb- to donetsk -lrb- in the ukraine -rrb- is more than 1,500 kilometers -lrb- 930 miles -rrb- .
this is not like in austria and switzerland where everything lies close together . " moreover , he cast doubt on whether poland 's partners in ukraine will be up to the job . " if things do n't go well now , and uefa has another suggestion , then that would be in order , " he said . awaiting a progress report the german member of the executive committee , gerhard mayer-vorfelder said that he could not speculate what decision they would reach .
" it is completely open .
i do not want to say which way it will go . " already it seems certain that the unexpected decision taken 17 months ago by the uefa executive in cardiff to give the 2012 euro finals to ukraine and poland was - at best - premature .
inadequate stadiums , problems with the transport system and not enough hotel beds has given rise to serious concerns and pushed uefa into a corner . mayer-vorfelder admits that the decision in april 2007 was not only positive .
" it was a unique situation .
we wanted to include east europe and there was only one other country bidding , italy .
they had their own problems and could not really be rewarded . " a long-awaited progress report on the ability of poland and ukraine to host the finals in four years ' time is expected to criticize the two nations , but stop short of recommending that uefa withdraw their right to host the tournament .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : uefa will decide how many teams can compete in 2012 in the event that the report is completely negative , spain seems to have the best chance of replacing ukraine and poland , while a possible germany-poland scenario , with games in berlin and leipzig , seems little more than a rumor . it could well be that the executive decides in bordeaux to wait a bit longer - after all , in 2011 there will be uefa presidential elections and the french president of the organization , michel platini , will need east european votes to be re-elected . dpa news agency -lrb- mrm -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

even co-host poland has expressed doubts about its feasibility . europe 's governing football body uefa is facing a dilemma .
nobody is questioning that the euro 2012 preparations in the ukraine and poland are in trouble , but the million dollar question is : what to do about it ? for the first time in the history of the organization , the right to host the showpiece of european football could be taken away or germany could be used to find some sort of compromise .
there are also those who are , even in the face of ever-growing evidence to the contrary , saying that everything will be fine . the uefa executive committee , which started its meeting in the five-star grand hotel in bordeaux earlier on thursday , is not only trying to save its own reputation , probably more importantly , it is trying to find a solution . another option shortly before the start of the two-day meeting the 13-member committee was presented with another possible alternative by the president of the polish football federation .

"
conducted by omer welber , the istanbul philharmonic and the ra 'anana symphonette accompanied israeli virtuoso shlomo mintz , yair dalal and turkey 's cihat askin as they played sixteen violins that had outlasted the holocaust .
the concert was part of this year 's celebrations marking israel 's 60th anniversary .

" each violin has its own story , " israeli violin maker amnon weinstein told reuters .
now 69 , he and his son have spent more than a decade restoring the violins collected from across europe .
weinstein said he received the instruments in various states of disrepair , many of them decorated with stars of david carved into the woodwork , a testimony to their former jewish owners .
" by restoring their violins , their legacy is born again , " said weinstein , who lost most of his family in the holocaust .
most of them were found in attics and cellars , where they had spent the last few decades gathering dust .
he said the majority originally came from ghettos and concentration camps , where nazis used to assemble orchestras . in some cases , weinstein was able to track their history and talk to the families they once belonged to .
the story of motele bildunterschrift : the event took place outside the walls of jerusalem 's old city according to the event 's website , one of the instruments originally belonged to a 12-year-old jewish boy who played it for nazi ss officers in belarus in 1944 .
his name was motele , and he had joined the resistance in a village near the border with ukraine and managed to infiltrate a nazi building there .
" the german officers heard him play in the streets one day and later brought him to perform every night in their compound in town , " said sefi hanegbi , whose father played alongside motele in a partisan camp in a forest during world war two .
after each performance , motele would hide his violin in the building and walk out with an empty case .
he would return with the violin case full of explosives , stuffing them into cracks in the walls , and eventually setting them off , hanegbi said .
motele was later killed in a german ambush , and hanegbi 's family brought his violin to israel where it sat in a closet for decades - forgotten until amnon weinstein gave it a second lease of life . dw staff -lrb- jp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

germans tend to be debt-averse and are required to put down more equity in financing a home purchase . german politicians have criticized the us for failing to implement stringent controls on financial markets with many pointing out that the sub-prime mortgage crisis that felled wall street ’ s venerable financial institutions week could not happen in germany .
they may have a point . for one , experts say , the type of high risk lending practices that were exposed when the bubble burst in the us housing market a few years ago is more heavily regulated in germany . “ the sub-prime market is virtually non-existent , ” said elaine kempson , director of the personal finance research centre at the university of bristol . home ownership rates in germany are also among the lowest in europe - under 50 percent compared to around 70 percent in the us and the uk , said kempson , whose institute has done comparative studies in europe on personal credit risk and indebtedness . “ germans are much more conservative than americans and other europeans in terms of how much debt they are willing to take on , ” she said . larger down payments banks in germany also tend to have more stringent criteria in determining the creditworthiness of borrowers than their european or american counterparts . “ there is no such thing as zero financing on a home , ” said thomas beyerle , head of research at the degi , a frankfurt-based property investment company .
in germany , homeowners are required to make a down payment of at least 20 percent of the purchase price of a house to obtain a mortgage in the first place . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : foreclosures and defaulting on mortgage payments are far less common in germany michaela roth , spokesman of the german federation of savings and loan banks -lrb- dsgv -rrb- said it is not unusual to put down as much as 40 percent equity and finance the rest . “ germans generally are only prepared to be moderately indebted , ” she said .
even big ticket purchases such as a washing machine are paid for with hard cash or bank debit cards , with only five percent of consumers even bothering to use a credit card . mind-set averse to debt some say german financial prudence has its roots in the world wars , a period marked by acute economic hardship and suffering . “ the puritanical ethic of the war generation is still very much ingrained in germany today , ” said fabian christandl , a researcher at the institute for economic and social psychology at the university of cologne . germans work hard , put their cash in a savings account , earn a bit of interest and only take on debt for big investments , said christandl . “ a house is one of the very few purchases for which it ’ s viewed as acceptable to go into debt , ” he said . and homeowners who possess enough capital to invest in residential property beyond their own four walls are not interested in flipping over properties for quick profits either , said beyerle .
real estate investments are viewed either as a source of steady rental income or a way to reduce one ’ s tax burden . bubble burst only once beyerle explained that after german reunification in the 1990s , the government provided tax incentives for investors to buy up and develop real estate in the former east german states , but when the scheme ended ten years ago , the housing market collapsed from properties that wound up being overvalued . “ this was the only time that the bubble burst in germany , ” said beyerle . since property values in the rest of germany have remained fairly steady , even in prime locations near major urban centers such as munich , frankfurt , stuttgart , hamburg or cologne , speculation fever never caught on in germany , he added . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : even in prime urban areas , prices have not skyrocketed “ the us housing market was based on the premise that home values had no where to go but up and would keep rising very rapidly .
then when it got bad , the whole pack of cards crumbled , ” said kempson .
she cited a world bank report which indicated that as much as 20 percent of all mortgages in the us are in the sub-prime category . loans without income verification in us in the uk , five percent of the mortgage market is sub-prime , but those with impaired credit histories might be marginal bank risks , such as students or those who have a perspective of future employment that would enable them to pay back their bank loans . not so in the us , where unlicensed mortgage brokers targeted low income groups who never would have been able to borrow from more conventional banks , said kempson . “ these brokers were aggressively selling “ discounted ” packages to those surviving on social security , ” she said .
kempson added that as much as 40 percent of the loans were made without any income verification , which is much less likely to happen in europe . following a short period of loans made at fixed low rates , borrowers with “ sub-prime bargains ” found their mortgages being reset at double-digit rates .
then when soaring us housing prices started to plunge , borrowers were saddled with sub-prime mortgages that exceeded the value of their homes and couldn ’ t refinance their way out of debt , said kempson . a nation of renters bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : younger home buyers with no capital shop for best rates achim duebel , a mortgage sector expert based in berlin , said the problem with sub-prime mortgages doesn ’ t exist in germany since it is largely a nation of renters . “ every sub-prime borrower here is a renter ” , he said . but duebel added that younger germans are looking at more innovative ways to invest in property . “ the mortgage market is not as dull and boring as it looks in germany , ” he said , explaining that most germans still take out traditional mortgages at their local bank , but there is a growing number of marginal , but not sub-prime borrowers - those with no capital , but strong cash flow , such as the self-employed or freelancers , who can find mortgage brokers offering packages that require little or even no financing . “ there is cutthroat competition out there , a younger generation that wants to shop for the best rates , the best deals , so this is giving the entire mortgage market a push , ” said duebel . diana fong send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

but there is little they can do . in mid-september , the government issued a statement confirming that " work by ministers of health and justice on a draft law on obligatory chemical castration for pedophiles was nearing completion . "
according to polish media reports , the ministry plans to make the treatment compulsory for repeat offenders .
the pills would reduce or eliminate sex drive by suppressing the production of testosterone .
" our idea does n't yet have the form of a law , " ministry spokesman jakub golab told the daily polska .
" we 're currently consulting with sexologists ...
we want to bring it into effect as soon as possible . "

poland 's fritzl bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : donald tusk prime minister donald tusk raised the controversial topic after a 45-year-old man was charged with having raped and held his 21-year-old daughter captive for six years .
the suspect , dubbed poland 's josef fritzl in a reference to the austrian man accused of incarcerating his daughter and fathering seven children with her , faces up to 15 years behind bars if found guilty .
the woman in poland gave birth to two children , in 2005 and 2007 , allegedly from her father .
she maintains that he pressured her to give them up for adoption .
the case triggered a nationwide debate on how criminal sex offenders should be punished , with the liberal prime minister taking a draconian stance .
" i want to gather all the laws in operation across europe to introduce in poland the most rigorous law possible regarding criminals who rape children , " tusk said .
" i do not believe that we can call these individuals - these creatures - human beings , " he added .
" so in this case , we do n't need to discuss human rights . "
eu outrage bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the pills reduce libido chemical castration for repeat sex offenders is already offered in several us states , as well as european countries including sweden , germany and denmark .
however , it is a voluntary process .
human rights activists and legal experts have criticized the polish plans , saying that forcing a patient to undergo chemical castration was inadmissible according to both polish and international law .
but klaus haensch , a social democrat member of the european parliament , told spiegel online that brussels is powerless to intervene .
" it does not have the competence , because criminal law is decided at a national level , " he said .
" but i do not feel that enforced chemical castration is an appropriate punishment that can be reconciled with modern criminal law . "
christian democrat mep elmar brok agreed , telling spiegel online that it was not " a fitting solution . "
the plan also has detractors in poland .
" what the prime minister said was a scandal , " ryszard kalisz , a deputy for the opposition democratic left alliance , said in an interview with radio tok .

the suspect , dubbed poland 's josef fritzl in a reference to the austrian man accused of incarcerating his daughter and fathering seven children with her , faces up to 15 years behind bars if found guilty .
the woman in poland gave birth to two children , in 2005 and 2007 , allegedly from her father .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de banking -pipe- 25.09.2008 debt-averse germans unlikely to attract sub-prime trouble großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : it 's acceptable to go into debt to buy a house sub-prime mortgages are virtually unknown in germany since home ownership rates are relatively low .
germans tend to be debt-averse and are required to put down more equity in financing a home purchase . german politicians have criticized the us for failing to implement stringent controls on financial markets with many pointing out that the sub-prime mortgage crisis that felled wall street ’ s venerable financial institutions week could not happen in germany .
they may have a point . for one , experts say , the type of high risk lending practices that were exposed when the bubble burst in the us housing market a few years ago is more heavily regulated in germany . “ the sub-prime market is virtually non-existent , ” said elaine kempson , director of the personal finance research centre at the university of bristol . home ownership rates in germany are also among the lowest in europe - under 50 percent compared to around 70 percent in the us and the uk , said kempson , whose institute has done comparative studies in europe on personal credit risk and indebtedness . “ germans are much more conservative than americans and other europeans in terms of how much debt they are willing to take on , ” she said . larger down payments banks in germany also tend to have more stringent criteria in determining the creditworthiness of borrowers than their european or american counterparts . “ there is no such thing as zero financing on a home , ” said thomas beyerle , head of research at the degi , a frankfurt-based property investment company .
in germany , homeowners are required to make a down payment of at least 20 percent of the purchase price of a house to obtain a mortgage in the first place . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : foreclosures and defaulting on mortgage payments are far less common in germany michaela roth , spokesman of the german federation of savings and loan banks -lrb- dsgv -rrb- said it is not unusual to put down as much as 40 percent equity and finance the rest . “ germans generally are only prepared to be moderately indebted , ” she said .
even big ticket purchases such as a washing machine are paid for with hard cash or bank debit cards , with only five percent of consumers even bothering to use a credit card . mind-set averse to debt some say german financial prudence has its roots in the world wars , a period marked by acute economic hardship and suffering . “ the puritanical ethic of the war generation is still very much ingrained in germany today , ” said fabian christandl , a researcher at the institute for economic and social psychology at the university of cologne . germans work hard , put their cash in a savings account , earn a bit of interest and only take on debt for big investments , said christandl . “ a house is one of the very few purchases for which it ’ s viewed as acceptable to go into debt , ” he said . and homeowners who possess enough capital to invest in residential property beyond their own four walls are not interested in flipping over properties for quick profits either , said beyerle .
real estate investments are viewed either as a source of steady rental income or a way to reduce one ’ s tax burden . bubble burst only once beyerle explained that after german reunification in the 1990s , the government provided tax incentives for investors to buy up and develop real estate in the former east german states , but when the scheme ended ten years ago , the housing market collapsed from properties that wound up being overvalued . “ this was the only time that the bubble burst in germany , ” said beyerle . since property values in the rest of germany have remained fairly steady , even in prime locations near major urban centers such as munich , frankfurt , stuttgart , hamburg or cologne , speculation fever never caught on in germany , he added . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : even in prime urban areas , prices have not skyrocketed “ the us housing market was based on the premise that home values had no where to go but up and would keep rising very rapidly .
then when it got bad , the whole pack of cards crumbled , ” said kempson .
she cited a world bank report which indicated that as much as 20 percent of all mortgages in the us are in the sub-prime category . loans without income verification in us in the uk , five percent of the mortgage market is sub-prime , but those with impaired credit histories might be marginal bank risks , such as students or those who have a perspective of future employment that would enable them to pay back their bank loans . not so in the us , where unlicensed mortgage brokers targeted low income groups who never would have been able to borrow from more conventional banks , said kempson . “ these brokers were aggressively selling “ discounted ” packages to those surviving on social security , ” she said .
kempson added that as much as 40 percent of the loans were made without any income verification , which is much less likely to happen in europe . following a short period of loans made at fixed low rates , borrowers with “ sub-prime bargains ” found their mortgages being reset at double-digit rates .
then when soaring us housing prices started to plunge , borrowers were saddled with sub-prime mortgages that exceeded the value of their homes and couldn ’ t refinance their way out of debt , said kempson . a nation of renters bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : younger home buyers with no capital shop for best rates achim duebel , a mortgage sector expert based in berlin , said the problem with sub-prime mortgages doesn ’ t exist in germany since it is largely a nation of renters . “ every sub-prime borrower here is a renter ” , he said . but duebel added that younger germans are looking at more innovative ways to invest in property . “ the mortgage market is not as dull and boring as it looks in germany , ” he said , explaining that most germans still take out traditional mortgages at their local bank , but there is a growing number of marginal , but not sub-prime borrowers - those with no capital , but strong cash flow , such as the self-employed or freelancers , who can find mortgage brokers offering packages that require little or even no financing . “ there is cutthroat competition out there , a younger generation that wants to shop for the best rates , the best deals , so this is giving the entire mortgage market a push , ” said duebel . diana fong send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

germans tend to be debt-averse and are required to put down more equity in financing a home purchase . german politicians have criticized the us for failing to implement stringent controls on financial markets with many pointing out that the sub-prime mortgage crisis that felled wall street ’ s venerable financial institutions week could not happen in germany .
they may have a point . for one , experts say , the type of high risk lending practices that were exposed when the bubble burst in the us housing market a few years ago is more heavily regulated in germany . “ the sub-prime market is virtually non-existent , ” said elaine kempson , director of the personal finance research centre at the university of bristol . home ownership rates in germany are also among the lowest in europe - under 50 percent compared to around 70 percent in the us and the uk , said kempson , whose institute has done comparative studies in europe on personal credit risk and indebtedness . “ germans are much more conservative than americans and other europeans in terms of how much debt they are willing to take on , ” she said . larger down payments banks in germany also tend to have more stringent criteria in determining the creditworthiness of borrowers than their european or american counterparts . “ there is no such thing as zero financing on a home , ” said thomas beyerle , head of research at the degi , a frankfurt-based property investment company .
in germany , homeowners are required to make a down payment of at least 20 percent of the purchase price of a house to obtain a mortgage in the first place . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : foreclosures and defaulting on mortgage payments are far less common in germany michaela roth , spokesman of the german federation of savings and loan banks -lrb- dsgv -rrb- said it is not unusual to put down as much as 40 percent equity and finance the rest . “ germans generally are only prepared to be moderately indebted , ” she said .
even big ticket purchases such as a washing machine are paid for with hard cash or bank debit cards , with only five percent of consumers even bothering to use a credit card . mind-set averse to debt some say german financial prudence has its roots in the world wars , a period marked by acute economic hardship and suffering . “ the puritanical ethic of the war generation is still very much ingrained in germany today , ” said fabian christandl , a researcher at the institute for economic and social psychology at the university of cologne . germans work hard , put their cash in a savings account , earn a bit of interest and only take on debt for big investments , said christandl . “ a house is one of the very few purchases for which it ’ s viewed as acceptable to go into debt , ” he said . and homeowners who possess enough capital to invest in residential property beyond their own four walls are not interested in flipping over properties for quick profits either , said beyerle .
real estate investments are viewed either as a source of steady rental income or a way to reduce one ’ s tax burden . bubble burst only once beyerle explained that after german reunification in the 1990s , the government provided tax incentives for investors to buy up and develop real estate in the former east german states , but when the scheme ended ten years ago , the housing market collapsed from properties that wound up being overvalued . “ this was the only time that the bubble burst in germany , ” said beyerle . since property values in the rest of germany have remained fairly steady , even in prime locations near major urban centers such as munich , frankfurt , stuttgart , hamburg or cologne , speculation fever never caught on in germany , he added . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : even in prime urban areas , prices have not skyrocketed “ the us housing market was based on the premise that home values had no where to go but up and would keep rising very rapidly .
then when it got bad , the whole pack of cards crumbled , ” said kempson .
she cited a world bank report which indicated that as much as 20 percent of all mortgages in the us are in the sub-prime category . loans without income verification in us in the uk , five percent of the mortgage market is sub-prime , but those with impaired credit histories might be marginal bank risks , such as students or those who have a perspective of future employment that would enable them to pay back their bank loans . not so in the us , where unlicensed mortgage brokers targeted low income groups who never would have been able to borrow from more conventional banks , said kempson . “ these brokers were aggressively selling “ discounted ” packages to those surviving on social security , ” she said .
kempson added that as much as 40 percent of the loans were made without any income verification , which is much less likely to happen in europe . following a short period of loans made at fixed low rates , borrowers with “ sub-prime bargains ” found their mortgages being reset at double-digit rates .
then when soaring us housing prices started to plunge , borrowers were saddled with sub-prime mortgages that exceeded the value of their homes and couldn ’ t refinance their way out of debt , said kempson . a nation of renters bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : younger home buyers with no capital shop for best rates achim duebel , a mortgage sector expert based in berlin , said the problem with sub-prime mortgages doesn ’ t exist in germany since it is largely a nation of renters . “ every sub-prime borrower here is a renter ” , he said . but duebel added that younger germans are looking at more innovative ways to invest in property . “ the mortgage market is not as dull and boring as it looks in germany , ” he said , explaining that most germans still take out traditional mortgages at their local bank , but there is a growing number of marginal , but not sub-prime borrowers - those with no capital , but strong cash flow , such as the self-employed or freelancers , who can find mortgage brokers offering packages that require little or even no financing . “ there is cutthroat competition out there , a younger generation that wants to shop for the best rates , the best deals , so this is giving the entire mortgage market a push , ” said duebel . diana fong send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

"
conducted by omer welber , the istanbul philharmonic and the ra 'anana symphonette accompanied israeli virtuoso shlomo mintz , yair dalal and turkey 's cihat askin as they played sixteen violins that had outlasted the holocaust .
the concert was part of this year 's celebrations marking israel 's 60th anniversary .
proceeds from the event went to meir panim layeled , an organization that focuses on the welfare , education and health needs of children across israel .
16 violins , 16 stories bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : amnon weinstein some of the violins were responsible for saving jewish lives , and some helped fight the germans .
" each violin has its own story , " israeli violin maker amnon weinstein told reuters .
now 69 , he and his son have spent more than a decade restoring the violins collected from across europe .
weinstein said he received the instruments in various states of disrepair , many of them decorated with stars of david carved into the woodwork , a testimony to their former jewish owners .
" by restoring their violins , their legacy is born again , " said weinstein , who lost most of his family in the holocaust .
most of them were found in attics and cellars , where they had spent the last few decades gathering dust .
he said the majority originally came from ghettos and concentration camps , where nazis used to assemble orchestras . in some cases , weinstein was able to track their history and talk to the families they once belonged to .
the story of motele bildunterschrift : the event took place outside the walls of jerusalem 's old city according to the event 's website , one of the instruments originally belonged to a 12-year-old jewish boy who played it for nazi ss officers in belarus in 1944 .
his name was motele , and he had joined the resistance in a village near the border with ukraine and managed to infiltrate a nazi building there .
" the german officers heard him play in the streets one day and later brought him to perform every night in their compound in town , " said sefi hanegbi , whose father played alongside motele in a partisan camp in a forest during world war two .
after each performance , motele would hide his violin in the building and walk out with an empty case .
he would return with the violin case full of explosives , stuffing them into cracks in the walls , and eventually setting them off , hanegbi said .
motele was later killed in a german ambush , and hanegbi 's family brought his violin to israel where it sat in a closet for decades - forgotten until amnon weinstein gave it a second lease of life . dw staff -lrb- jp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

chancellor merkel 's call for greater transparency and regulation is not what the problem demands with regard to the failings of the financial markets .
the problem is rooted in the insistence by eu governments with regard to fractional reserve banking .
this enables vast amounts of credit to be made available and the ecb to back up any shortfall in bank reserves by placing the burden on tax payers and property owners .
to do what is necessary will necessitate the abandoning of the so-called social-market economy .
this is unlikely , so we can all expect further crises in the future . - charles smyth , great britain during these turbulent economic times , i 'm concerned that my investments are in jeopardy .
i am retired and 70 years old .
i 've seen my investment drop almost by half and then go up by a quarter this week .
i 'm trying to hang in but at my age do n't know if i 'm foolish . - janice speck , us wall street has reacted very irresponsibly to the financial crisis that has affected the world economy .
getting tax payers funds to try and rescue the economy might have a negative effect for voting patterns at the us presidential elections in november .
many ordinary voters will see their rights being neglected by the whims of wall street and the rich people associated with the financial sector .
this should benefit barack obama campaign rather than john mccain . - stuart john pearson , australia the bush administration has shown great arrogance by not listening to good advice given by their european friends .
starting with the invasion of iraq , then overacting to the sept .
11 attack and lastly the slashing of credit rates to falsely give the faltering economy a boost .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de immigration -pipe- 25.09.2008 eu agrees new guidelines on immigration großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the new eu blue card is meant to work like the american green card the european union 's interior ministers agreed thursday on common principles guiding the way member states manage the influx of non-eu nationals .
but a blue card scheme for skilled migrants is still on hold . the immigration and asylum pact , which is due to be formally adopted by eu leaders at their october 15-16 summit , seeks to improve the management of legal immigration , tighten controls on illegal immigrants and construct a common asylum policy .
" the aim of the pact is to avoid the two obvious potential pitfalls : the creation of a european fortress , and the total opening up to illegal immigration , " said french interior minister brice hortefeux , who was chairing the interior ministers ' meeting .
but critics argue that the final , watered-down version agreed by ministers in brussels on thursday is ineffective and gives too great a voice to national governments .
for instance , the pact calls on eu countries to attract more highly skilled workers from outside the bloc .
but it leaves governments with the power to decide who and how many of them should be admitted in their own countries .
the czech republic is also currently holding up a deal on a new european " blue card " workers visa program .
eu officials say a single and simplified eu-wide working visa is needed to attract doctors , nurses , engineers and scientsists .
but interior minister ivan langer said the czechs would not agree to the plan until internal eu restrictions are lifted on the movement of workers from new member states .
germany , belgium , austria and denmark have not fully opened up their labor markets to workers from those eastern european countries who joined the bloc over the last few years .
hortefeux said he was nonetheless confident that the eu could overcome this obstacle by the end of the year .
the scheme will not , however , allow recipients to move around as freely as first envisaged .
tougher controls bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the eu is divided over how to respond to the iraqi refugee crisis the pact also calls on member states to tighten controls on illegal immigrants and improve the effectiveness of controls on the bloc 's external borders , for instance by sharing the fingerprints of incoming foreigners in a common database .
another proposal involves national authorities enacting expulsion orders made by another member state .
however , the eu 's border control agency , frontex , remains grossly underfunded , while there is little evidence that the mutual recognition of expulsion decisions is being implemented , according to a recent study by the centre for european policy studies , a brussels-based think tank .
meanwhile , plans for a common asylum policy are progressing slowly and are now not expected to come into force before 2012 .
highlighting the difficulties existing in this area , some member states have resisted calls by germany and sweden to share out some 10,000 highly vulnerable iraqi refugees among member states .
on thursday , ministers limited themselves to giving the green-light to a fact-finding mission to syria and jordan , where many displaced iraqis have fled after the toppling of former dictator saddam hussein .
the mission , which is to take place at the beginning of november , aims to identify those most in need of being granted asylum in europe . dw staff -lrb- mrm / jg -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de immigration -pipe- 25.09.2008 eu agrees new guidelines on immigration großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the new eu blue card is meant to work like the american green card the european union 's interior ministers agreed thursday on common principles guiding the way member states manage the influx of non-eu nationals .
but a blue card scheme for skilled migrants is still on hold . the immigration and asylum pact , which is due to be formally adopted by eu leaders at their october 15-16 summit , seeks to improve the management of legal immigration , tighten controls on illegal immigrants and construct a common asylum policy .
" the aim of the pact is to avoid the two obvious potential pitfalls : the creation of a european fortress , and the total opening up to illegal immigration , " said french interior minister brice hortefeux , who was chairing the interior ministers ' meeting .
but critics argue that the final , watered-down version agreed by ministers in brussels on thursday is ineffective and gives too great a voice to national governments .
for instance , the pact calls on eu countries to attract more highly skilled workers from outside the bloc .
but it leaves governments with the power to decide who and how many of them should be admitted in their own countries .
the czech republic is also currently holding up a deal on a new european " blue card " workers visa program .
eu officials say a single and simplified eu-wide working visa is needed to attract doctors , nurses , engineers and scientsists .
but interior minister ivan langer said the czechs would not agree to the plan until internal eu restrictions are lifted on the movement of workers from new member states .
germany , belgium , austria and denmark have not fully opened up their labor markets to workers from those eastern european countries who joined the bloc over the last few years .
hortefeux said he was nonetheless confident that the eu could overcome this obstacle by the end of the year .
the scheme will not , however , allow recipients to move around as freely as first envisaged .
tougher controls bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the eu is divided over how to respond to the iraqi refugee crisis the pact also calls on member states to tighten controls on illegal immigrants and improve the effectiveness of controls on the bloc 's external borders , for instance by sharing the fingerprints of incoming foreigners in a common database .
another proposal involves national authorities enacting expulsion orders made by another member state .
however , the eu 's border control agency , frontex , remains grossly underfunded , while there is little evidence that the mutual recognition of expulsion decisions is being implemented , according to a recent study by the centre for european policy studies , a brussels-based think tank .
meanwhile , plans for a common asylum policy are progressing slowly and are now not expected to come into force before 2012 .
highlighting the difficulties existing in this area , some member states have resisted calls by germany and sweden to share out some 10,000 highly vulnerable iraqi refugees among member states .
on thursday , ministers limited themselves to giving the green-light to a fact-finding mission to syria and jordan , where many displaced iraqis have fled after the toppling of former dictator saddam hussein .
the mission , which is to take place at the beginning of november , aims to identify those most in need of being granted asylum in europe . dw staff -lrb- mrm / jg -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

but there is little they can do . in mid-september , the government issued a statement confirming that " work by ministers of health and justice on a draft law on obligatory chemical castration for pedophiles was nearing completion . "
according to polish media reports , the ministry plans to make the treatment compulsory for repeat offenders .
the pills would reduce or eliminate sex drive by suppressing the production of testosterone .
" our idea does n't yet have the form of a law , " ministry spokesman jakub golab told the daily polska .
" we 're currently consulting with sexologists ...
we want to bring it into effect as soon as possible . "
in as little as one year , convicted pedophiles would also be fitted with electronic collars if they have a court order against going near their victims , polska reported .
if the collars are found effective , the ministry of justice will decide if they should be given to all pedophiles .
poland 's fritzl bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : donald tusk prime minister donald tusk raised the controversial topic after a 45-year-old man was charged with having raped and held his 21-year-old daughter captive for six years .
the suspect , dubbed poland 's josef fritzl in a reference to the austrian man accused of incarcerating his daughter and fathering seven children with her , faces up to 15 years behind bars if found guilty .
the woman in poland gave birth to two children , in 2005 and 2007 , allegedly from her father .
she maintains that he pressured her to give them up for adoption .
the case triggered a nationwide debate on how criminal sex offenders should be punished , with the liberal prime minister taking a draconian stance .
" i want to gather all the laws in operation across europe to introduce in poland the most rigorous law possible regarding criminals who rape children , " tusk said .
" i do not believe that we can call these individuals - these creatures - human beings , " he added .
" so in this case , we do n't need to discuss human rights . "
eu outrage bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the pills reduce libido chemical castration for repeat sex offenders is already offered in several us states , as well as european countries including sweden , germany and denmark .
however , it is a voluntary process .
human rights activists and legal experts have criticized the polish plans , saying that forcing a patient to undergo chemical castration was inadmissible according to both polish and international law .
but klaus haensch , a social democrat member of the european parliament , told spiegel online that brussels is powerless to intervene .
" it does not have the competence , because criminal law is decided at a national level , " he said .
" but i do not feel that enforced chemical castration is an appropriate punishment that can be reconciled with modern criminal law . "
christian democrat mep elmar brok agreed , telling spiegel online that it was not " a fitting solution . "
the plan also has detractors in poland .
" what the prime minister said was a scandal , " ryszard kalisz , a deputy for the opposition democratic left alliance , said in an interview with radio tok .

elser was arrested , tortured and murdered at dachau by the nazis six years later .
the bust of elser was put up at private expense on a riverside near the interior ministry in berlin on wednesday , sept .
24 .
a plaque in his memory was put up several years ago in his hometown , koenigsbronn , in south-western germany .
elser , a wood joiner of strongly anti-nazi views , planted the bomb alone in a bid to stop the war .
the german resistance memorial movement said the bombing and a bomb set by colonel claus von stauffenberg in 1944 , which slightly wounded hitler , were the only assassination attempts that ever put hitler in danger .
a foundation established by a businessman , ernst freiberger , paid for the bust .
over decades , germany has only gradually come around to viewing the would-be assassins as heroes .
a film , valkyrie , set for us release in december , will depict the 1944 plot with tom cruise playing stauffenberg . dpa news agency -lrb- kjb -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de immigration -pipe- 25.09.2008 eu agrees new guidelines on immigration großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the new eu blue card is meant to work like the american green card the european union 's interior ministers agreed thursday on common principles guiding the way member states manage the influx of non-eu nationals .
but a blue card scheme for skilled migrants is still on hold . the immigration and asylum pact , which is due to be formally adopted by eu leaders at their october 15-16 summit , seeks to improve the management of legal immigration , tighten controls on illegal immigrants and construct a common asylum policy .
" the aim of the pact is to avoid the two obvious potential pitfalls : the creation of a european fortress , and the total opening up to illegal immigration , " said french interior minister brice hortefeux , who was chairing the interior ministers ' meeting .
but critics argue that the final , watered-down version agreed by ministers in brussels on thursday is ineffective and gives too great a voice to national governments .
for instance , the pact calls on eu countries to attract more highly skilled workers from outside the bloc .
but it leaves governments with the power to decide who and how many of them should be admitted in their own countries .
the czech republic is also currently holding up a deal on a new european " blue card " workers visa program .
eu officials say a single and simplified eu-wide working visa is needed to attract doctors , nurses , engineers and scientsists .
but interior minister ivan langer said the czechs would not agree to the plan until internal eu restrictions are lifted on the movement of workers from new member states .
germany , belgium , austria and denmark have not fully opened up their labor markets to workers from those eastern european countries who joined the bloc over the last few years .
hortefeux said he was nonetheless confident that the eu could overcome this obstacle by the end of the year .
the scheme will not , however , allow recipients to move around as freely as first envisaged .
tougher controls bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the eu is divided over how to respond to the iraqi refugee crisis the pact also calls on member states to tighten controls on illegal immigrants and improve the effectiveness of controls on the bloc 's external borders , for instance by sharing the fingerprints of incoming foreigners in a common database .
another proposal involves national authorities enacting expulsion orders made by another member state .
however , the eu 's border control agency , frontex , remains grossly underfunded , while there is little evidence that the mutual recognition of expulsion decisions is being implemented , according to a recent study by the centre for european policy studies , a brussels-based think tank .
meanwhile , plans for a common asylum policy are progressing slowly and are now not expected to come into force before 2012 .
highlighting the difficulties existing in this area , some member states have resisted calls by germany and sweden to share out some 10,000 highly vulnerable iraqi refugees among member states .
on thursday , ministers limited themselves to giving the green-light to a fact-finding mission to syria and jordan , where many displaced iraqis have fled after the toppling of former dictator saddam hussein .
the mission , which is to take place at the beginning of november , aims to identify those most in need of being granted asylum in europe . dw staff -lrb- mrm / jg -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

german broadcaster zdf had reported that western intelligence services now have indications that breininger , a convert to islam , had returned to europe , and possibly germany , and was trying to procure explosives .
but a spokesman said there was no concrete evidence breininger was plotting an actual attack .
police said , however , that breininger , who is from the state of saarland in western germany , had recorded an internet video in august in which he spoke of carrying out a suicide attack and supported jihad or holy war .
the federal crime office -lrb- bka -rrb- showed photos of the two men on its web page listing the most wanted suspects in the country .
both men are suspected of links to the islamic jihad union -lrb- iju -rrb- , which is affiliated with al qaeda and investigators say was behind a major bomb plot in germany that they thwarted last september .
its targets included frankfurt airport and the us base of ramstein . dw staff -lrb- jg -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

german broadcaster zdf had reported that western intelligence services now have indications that breininger , a convert to islam , had returned to europe , and possibly germany , and was trying to procure explosives .
but a spokesman said there was no concrete evidence breininger was plotting an actual attack .
police said , however , that breininger , who is from the state of saarland in western germany , had recorded an internet video in august in which he spoke of carrying out a suicide attack and supported jihad or holy war .
the federal crime office -lrb- bka -rrb- showed photos of the two men on its web page listing the most wanted suspects in the country .

"
this , he said , would strengthen the german banking system and boost its sustainability .
" financial support from the government in mopping up problems in this sector should not be expected , " he added . given that past attempts to fuse the " landesbanken " have failed , steinbrueck proposed a redefinition of their business models in order to avoid excessive risk and to increase returns .

he stressed that german banks can cope with losses . " wall street and the world will never again be the way they were before the crisis , " said steinbrueck in a speech to the german parliament , the bundestag , on thursday , sept .
25 .
write-downs and write-offs of bad credit spawned by " a blind drive for double-digit profits " have so far totaled $ 550 billion and no end to the crisis is in sight , he added .
the world financial system will consequently become more " multi-polar , " he predicted .
steinbrueck told the bundestag that the group of seven -lrb- g7 -rrb- finance ministers would be meeting in washington next month to discuss how to tighten regulation of capital markets .
the german federal government , meanwhile , would continue efforts to trim spending , but would also make some moves to stimulate the economy .
he reiterated germany 's refusal to set up its own bank bail-out scheme , saying the crisis was principally a us problem .
irresponsible moves bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : steinbrueck did n't pull his punches during the bundestag speech reiterating berlin 's push for tighter regulation , steinbrueck accused the us of blunders .
" the cause of the crisis was the irresponsible exaggeration of the principle of a free , unrestrained market , " he told the bundestag .
washington has been reluctant to increase minimum equity rules and has too many competing regulators over us investment banks .
" this system , which in many ways is inadequately regulated , is now collapsing , " he said , adding that germany 's banking system remained " relatively robust , " with german regulators confident they can absorb losses .
" new rules of the road " for the financial markets were needed , he said .
plans to be debated when the finance ministers of the g7 meet will include tightening cooperation between the international monetary fund -lrb- imf -rrb- and the financial stability forum -lrb- fsf -rrb- .
the agencies were created by western nations as an early warning system .
strengthening cooperation bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the german landesbanken need to pull together steinbrueck also renewed his call for fusion across germany 's state bank sector .
the country 's big commercial lenders , the so-called " landesbanken , " have been hard hit by the financial crisis . the next move needs to be made by the individual states , as co-owners of the leading state banks , said the social democrat minister : " they need to overcome regional political pride and embrace pan-regional co-operation . "
this , he said , would strengthen the german banking system and boost its sustainability .
" financial support from the government in mopping up problems in this sector should not be expected , " he added . given that past attempts to fuse the " landesbanken " have failed , steinbrueck proposed a redefinition of their business models in order to avoid excessive risk and to increase returns .

"
conducted by omer welber , the istanbul philharmonic and the ra 'anana symphonette accompanied israeli virtuoso shlomo mintz , yair dalal and turkey 's cihat askin as they played sixteen violins that had outlasted the holocaust .
the concert was part of this year 's celebrations marking israel 's 60th anniversary .

german broadcaster zdf had reported that western intelligence services now have indications that breininger , a convert to islam , had returned to europe , and possibly germany , and was trying to procure explosives .
but a spokesman said there was no concrete evidence breininger was plotting an actual attack .
police said , however , that breininger , who is from the state of saarland in western germany , had recorded an internet video in august in which he spoke of carrying out a suicide attack and supported jihad or holy war .
the federal crime office -lrb- bka -rrb- showed photos of the two men on its web page listing the most wanted suspects in the country .
both men are suspected of links to the islamic jihad union -lrb- iju -rrb- , which is affiliated with al qaeda and investigators say was behind a major bomb plot in germany that they thwarted last september .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de immigration -pipe- 25.09.2008 eu agrees new guidelines on immigration großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the new eu blue card is meant to work like the american green card the european union 's interior ministers agreed thursday on common principles guiding the way member states manage the influx of non-eu nationals .
but a blue card scheme for skilled migrants is still on hold . the immigration and asylum pact , which is due to be formally adopted by eu leaders at their october 15-16 summit , seeks to improve the management of legal immigration , tighten controls on illegal immigrants and construct a common asylum policy .
" the aim of the pact is to avoid the two obvious potential pitfalls : the creation of a european fortress , and the total opening up to illegal immigration , " said french interior minister brice hortefeux , who was chairing the interior ministers ' meeting .
but critics argue that the final , watered-down version agreed by ministers in brussels on thursday is ineffective and gives too great a voice to national governments .
for instance , the pact calls on eu countries to attract more highly skilled workers from outside the bloc .
but it leaves governments with the power to decide who and how many of them should be admitted in their own countries .
the czech republic is also currently holding up a deal on a new european " blue card " workers visa program .
eu officials say a single and simplified eu-wide working visa is needed to attract doctors , nurses , engineers and scientsists .
but interior minister ivan langer said the czechs would not agree to the plan until internal eu restrictions are lifted on the movement of workers from new member states .
germany , belgium , austria and denmark have not fully opened up their labor markets to workers from those eastern european countries who joined the bloc over the last few years .
hortefeux said he was nonetheless confident that the eu could overcome this obstacle by the end of the year .

tougher controls bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the eu is divided over how to respond to the iraqi refugee crisis the pact also calls on member states to tighten controls on illegal immigrants and improve the effectiveness of controls on the bloc 's external borders , for instance by sharing the fingerprints of incoming foreigners in a common database .
another proposal involves national authorities enacting expulsion orders made by another member state .
however , the eu 's border control agency , frontex , remains grossly underfunded , while there is little evidence that the mutual recognition of expulsion decisions is being implemented , according to a recent study by the centre for european policy studies , a brussels-based think tank .
meanwhile , plans for a common asylum policy are progressing slowly and are now not expected to come into force before 2012 .
highlighting the difficulties existing in this area , some member states have resisted calls by germany and sweden to share out some 10,000 highly vulnerable iraqi refugees among member states .
on thursday , ministers limited themselves to giving the green-light to a fact-finding mission to syria and jordan , where many displaced iraqis have fled after the toppling of former dictator saddam hussein .
the mission , which is to take place at the beginning of november , aims to identify those most in need of being granted asylum in europe . dw staff -lrb- mrm / jg -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de soccer -pipe- 25.09.2008 euro 2012 decision looms amid doubt großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : poland and ukraine celebrated the euro 2102 award in 2007 european soccer 's governing body is meeting to debate if the 2012 european championships can really be held in poland and ukraine .
even co-host poland has expressed doubts about its feasibility . europe 's governing football body uefa is facing a dilemma .
nobody is questioning that the euro 2012 preparations in the ukraine and poland are in trouble , but the million dollar question is : what to do about it ? for the first time in the history of the organization , the right to host the showpiece of european football could be taken away or germany could be used to find some sort of compromise .
there are also those who are , even in the face of ever-growing evidence to the contrary , saying that everything will be fine . the uefa executive committee , which started its meeting in the five-star grand hotel in bordeaux earlier on thursday , is not only trying to save its own reputation , probably more importantly , it is trying to find a solution . another option shortly before the start of the two-day meeting the 13-member committee was presented with another possible alternative by the president of the polish football federation .
michal listkiewicz suggested on the website of a german newspaper that it might make sense to host the euro finals in ukraine and poland four years later and give the 2012 finals to another country . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : platini now says the award can be removed listkiewicz seems far from convinced his country will be ready in four years time .
the biggest problem : poor infrastructure and terrible traffic , he said . " if the european championships took place in 2016 , we would no problems about being ready then , " listkiewicz told die zeit online , the internet platform of the weekly newspaper . " but realistically we are looking at having no good roads in time for 2012 . " said listkiewicz .
" from gdansk -lrb- in poland -rrb- to donetsk -lrb- in the ukraine -rrb- is more than 1,500 kilometers -lrb- 930 miles -rrb- .
this is not like in austria and switzerland where everything lies close together . " moreover , he cast doubt on whether poland 's partners in ukraine will be up to the job . " if things do n't go well now , and uefa has another suggestion , then that would be in order , " he said . awaiting a progress report the german member of the executive committee , gerhard mayer-vorfelder said that he could not speculate what decision they would reach .
" it is completely open .
i do not want to say which way it will go . " already it seems certain that the unexpected decision taken 17 months ago by the uefa executive in cardiff to give the 2012 euro finals to ukraine and poland was - at best - premature .
inadequate stadiums , problems with the transport system and not enough hotel beds has given rise to serious concerns and pushed uefa into a corner . mayer-vorfelder admits that the decision in april 2007 was not only positive .
" it was a unique situation .
we wanted to include east europe and there was only one other country bidding , italy .
they had their own problems and could not really be rewarded . " a long-awaited progress report on the ability of poland and ukraine to host the finals in four years ' time is expected to criticize the two nations , but stop short of recommending that uefa withdraw their right to host the tournament .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : uefa will decide how many teams can compete in 2012 in the event that the report is completely negative , spain seems to have the best chance of replacing ukraine and poland , while a possible germany-poland scenario , with games in berlin and leipzig , seems little more than a rumor . it could well be that the executive decides in bordeaux to wait a bit longer - after all , in 2011 there will be uefa presidential elections and the french president of the organization , michel platini , will need east european votes to be re-elected . dpa news agency -lrb- mrm -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

german broadcaster zdf had reported that western intelligence services now have indications that breininger , a convert to islam , had returned to europe , and possibly germany , and was trying to procure explosives .
but a spokesman said there was no concrete evidence breininger was plotting an actual attack .
police said , however , that breininger , who is from the state of saarland in western germany , had recorded an internet video in august in which he spoke of carrying out a suicide attack and supported jihad or holy war .
the federal crime office -lrb- bka -rrb- showed photos of the two men on its web page listing the most wanted suspects in the country .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de immigration -pipe- 25.09.2008 eu agrees new guidelines on immigration großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the new eu blue card is meant to work like the american green card the european union 's interior ministers agreed thursday on common principles guiding the way member states manage the influx of non-eu nationals .
but a blue card scheme for skilled migrants is still on hold . the immigration and asylum pact , which is due to be formally adopted by eu leaders at their october 15-16 summit , seeks to improve the management of legal immigration , tighten controls on illegal immigrants and construct a common asylum policy .
" the aim of the pact is to avoid the two obvious potential pitfalls : the creation of a european fortress , and the total opening up to illegal immigration , " said french interior minister brice hortefeux , who was chairing the interior ministers ' meeting .
but critics argue that the final , watered-down version agreed by ministers in brussels on thursday is ineffective and gives too great a voice to national governments .
for instance , the pact calls on eu countries to attract more highly skilled workers from outside the bloc .
but it leaves governments with the power to decide who and how many of them should be admitted in their own countries .
the czech republic is also currently holding up a deal on a new european " blue card " workers visa program .
eu officials say a single and simplified eu-wide working visa is needed to attract doctors , nurses , engineers and scientsists .
but interior minister ivan langer said the czechs would not agree to the plan until internal eu restrictions are lifted on the movement of workers from new member states .
germany , belgium , austria and denmark have not fully opened up their labor markets to workers from those eastern european countries who joined the bloc over the last few years .
hortefeux said he was nonetheless confident that the eu could overcome this obstacle by the end of the year .
the scheme will not , however , allow recipients to move around as freely as first envisaged .
tougher controls bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the eu is divided over how to respond to the iraqi refugee crisis the pact also calls on member states to tighten controls on illegal immigrants and improve the effectiveness of controls on the bloc 's external borders , for instance by sharing the fingerprints of incoming foreigners in a common database .
another proposal involves national authorities enacting expulsion orders made by another member state .
however , the eu 's border control agency , frontex , remains grossly underfunded , while there is little evidence that the mutual recognition of expulsion decisions is being implemented , according to a recent study by the centre for european policy studies , a brussels-based think tank .
meanwhile , plans for a common asylum policy are progressing slowly and are now not expected to come into force before 2012 .
highlighting the difficulties existing in this area , some member states have resisted calls by germany and sweden to share out some 10,000 highly vulnerable iraqi refugees among member states .
on thursday , ministers limited themselves to giving the green-light to a fact-finding mission to syria and jordan , where many displaced iraqis have fled after the toppling of former dictator saddam hussein .
the mission , which is to take place at the beginning of november , aims to identify those most in need of being granted asylum in europe . dw staff -lrb- mrm / jg -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de soccer -pipe- 25.09.2008 euro 2012 decision looms amid doubt großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : poland and ukraine celebrated the euro 2102 award in 2007 european soccer 's governing body is meeting to debate if the 2012 european championships can really be held in poland and ukraine .
even co-host poland has expressed doubts about its feasibility . europe 's governing football body uefa is facing a dilemma .
nobody is questioning that the euro 2012 preparations in the ukraine and poland are in trouble , but the million dollar question is : what to do about it ? for the first time in the history of the organization , the right to host the showpiece of european football could be taken away or germany could be used to find some sort of compromise .
there are also those who are , even in the face of ever-growing evidence to the contrary , saying that everything will be fine . the uefa executive committee , which started its meeting in the five-star grand hotel in bordeaux earlier on thursday , is not only trying to save its own reputation , probably more importantly , it is trying to find a solution . another option shortly before the start of the two-day meeting the 13-member committee was presented with another possible alternative by the president of the polish football federation .
michal listkiewicz suggested on the website of a german newspaper that it might make sense to host the euro finals in ukraine and poland four years later and give the 2012 finals to another country . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : platini now says the award can be removed listkiewicz seems far from convinced his country will be ready in four years time .
the biggest problem : poor infrastructure and terrible traffic , he said . " if the european championships took place in 2016 , we would no problems about being ready then , " listkiewicz told die zeit online , the internet platform of the weekly newspaper . " but realistically we are looking at having no good roads in time for 2012 . " said listkiewicz .
" from gdansk -lrb- in poland -rrb- to donetsk -lrb- in the ukraine -rrb- is more than 1,500 kilometers -lrb- 930 miles -rrb- .
this is not like in austria and switzerland where everything lies close together . " moreover , he cast doubt on whether poland 's partners in ukraine will be up to the job . " if things do n't go well now , and uefa has another suggestion , then that would be in order , " he said . awaiting a progress report the german member of the executive committee , gerhard mayer-vorfelder said that he could not speculate what decision they would reach .
" it is completely open .
i do not want to say which way it will go . " already it seems certain that the unexpected decision taken 17 months ago by the uefa executive in cardiff to give the 2012 euro finals to ukraine and poland was - at best - premature .
inadequate stadiums , problems with the transport system and not enough hotel beds has given rise to serious concerns and pushed uefa into a corner . mayer-vorfelder admits that the decision in april 2007 was not only positive .
" it was a unique situation .
we wanted to include east europe and there was only one other country bidding , italy .
they had their own problems and could not really be rewarded . " a long-awaited progress report on the ability of poland and ukraine to host the finals in four years ' time is expected to criticize the two nations , but stop short of recommending that uefa withdraw their right to host the tournament .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : uefa will decide how many teams can compete in 2012 in the event that the report is completely negative , spain seems to have the best chance of replacing ukraine and poland , while a possible germany-poland scenario , with games in berlin and leipzig , seems little more than a rumor . it could well be that the executive decides in bordeaux to wait a bit longer - after all , in 2011 there will be uefa presidential elections and the french president of the organization , michel platini , will need east european votes to be re-elected . dpa news agency -lrb- mrm -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

but a blue card scheme for skilled migrants is still on hold . the immigration and asylum pact , which is due to be formally adopted by eu leaders at their october 15-16 summit , seeks to improve the management of legal immigration , tighten controls on illegal immigrants and construct a common asylum policy .
" the aim of the pact is to avoid the two obvious potential pitfalls : the creation of a european fortress , and the total opening up to illegal immigration , " said french interior minister brice hortefeux , who was chairing the interior ministers ' meeting .
but critics argue that the final , watered-down version agreed by ministers in brussels on thursday is ineffective and gives too great a voice to national governments .
for instance , the pact calls on eu countries to attract more highly skilled workers from outside the bloc .
but it leaves governments with the power to decide who and how many of them should be admitted in their own countries .
the czech republic is also currently holding up a deal on a new european " blue card " workers visa program .
eu officials say a single and simplified eu-wide working visa is needed to attract doctors , nurses , engineers and scientsists .
but interior minister ivan langer said the czechs would not agree to the plan until internal eu restrictions are lifted on the movement of workers from new member states .
germany , belgium , austria and denmark have not fully opened up their labor markets to workers from those eastern european countries who joined the bloc over the last few years .
hortefeux said he was nonetheless confident that the eu could overcome this obstacle by the end of the year .
the scheme will not , however , allow recipients to move around as freely as first envisaged .
tougher controls bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the eu is divided over how to respond to the iraqi refugee crisis the pact also calls on member states to tighten controls on illegal immigrants and improve the effectiveness of controls on the bloc 's external borders , for instance by sharing the fingerprints of incoming foreigners in a common database .
another proposal involves national authorities enacting expulsion orders made by another member state .
however , the eu 's border control agency , frontex , remains grossly underfunded , while there is little evidence that the mutual recognition of expulsion decisions is being implemented , according to a recent study by the centre for european policy studies , a brussels-based think tank .
meanwhile , plans for a common asylum policy are progressing slowly and are now not expected to come into force before 2012 .
highlighting the difficulties existing in this area , some member states have resisted calls by germany and sweden to share out some 10,000 highly vulnerable iraqi refugees among member states .
on thursday , ministers limited themselves to giving the green-light to a fact-finding mission to syria and jordan , where many displaced iraqis have fled after the toppling of former dictator saddam hussein .

chancellor merkel 's call for greater transparency and regulation is not what the problem demands with regard to the failings of the financial markets .
the problem is rooted in the insistence by eu governments with regard to fractional reserve banking .
this enables vast amounts of credit to be made available and the ecb to back up any shortfall in bank reserves by placing the burden on tax payers and property owners .
to do what is necessary will necessitate the abandoning of the so-called social-market economy .
this is unlikely , so we can all expect further crises in the future . - charles smyth , great britain during these turbulent economic times , i 'm concerned that my investments are in jeopardy .
i am retired and 70 years old .
i 've seen my investment drop almost by half and then go up by a quarter this week .
i 'm trying to hang in but at my age do n't know if i 'm foolish . - janice speck , us wall street has reacted very irresponsibly to the financial crisis that has affected the world economy .
getting tax payers funds to try and rescue the economy might have a negative effect for voting patterns at the us presidential elections in november .
many ordinary voters will see their rights being neglected by the whims of wall street and the rich people associated with the financial sector .
this should benefit barack obama campaign rather than john mccain . - stuart john pearson , australia the bush administration has shown great arrogance by not listening to good advice given by their european friends .
starting with the invasion of iraq , then overacting to the sept .
11 attack and lastly the slashing of credit rates to falsely give the faltering economy a boost .
because of this financial disaster , the us has defaulted on their good reputation and only the next administration can hopefully build the trust needed to work again together as equal partners . - g. gosau , canada compiled by dw staff -lrb- ot -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

but there is little they can do . in mid-september , the government issued a statement confirming that " work by ministers of health and justice on a draft law on obligatory chemical castration for pedophiles was nearing completion . "
according to polish media reports , the ministry plans to make the treatment compulsory for repeat offenders .
the pills would reduce or eliminate sex drive by suppressing the production of testosterone .
" our idea does n't yet have the form of a law , " ministry spokesman jakub golab told the daily polska .
" we 're currently consulting with sexologists ...
we want to bring it into effect as soon as possible . "
in as little as one year , convicted pedophiles would also be fitted with electronic collars if they have a court order against going near their victims , polska reported .
if the collars are found effective , the ministry of justice will decide if they should be given to all pedophiles .
poland 's fritzl bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : donald tusk prime minister donald tusk raised the controversial topic after a 45-year-old man was charged with having raped and held his 21-year-old daughter captive for six years .
the suspect , dubbed poland 's josef fritzl in a reference to the austrian man accused of incarcerating his daughter and fathering seven children with her , faces up to 15 years behind bars if found guilty .
the woman in poland gave birth to two children , in 2005 and 2007 , allegedly from her father .
she maintains that he pressured her to give them up for adoption .
the case triggered a nationwide debate on how criminal sex offenders should be punished , with the liberal prime minister taking a draconian stance .
" i want to gather all the laws in operation across europe to introduce in poland the most rigorous law possible regarding criminals who rape children , " tusk said .
" i do not believe that we can call these individuals - these creatures - human beings , " he added .
" so in this case , we do n't need to discuss human rights . "
eu outrage bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the pills reduce libido chemical castration for repeat sex offenders is already offered in several us states , as well as european countries including sweden , germany and denmark .
however , it is a voluntary process .
human rights activists and legal experts have criticized the polish plans , saying that forcing a patient to undergo chemical castration was inadmissible according to both polish and international law .
but klaus haensch , a social democrat member of the european parliament , told spiegel online that brussels is powerless to intervene .
" it does not have the competence , because criminal law is decided at a national level , " he said .
" but i do not feel that enforced chemical castration is an appropriate punishment that can be reconciled with modern criminal law . "
christian democrat mep elmar brok agreed , telling spiegel online that it was not " a fitting solution . "
the plan also has detractors in poland .
" what the prime minister said was a scandal , " ryszard kalisz , a deputy for the opposition democratic left alliance , said in an interview with radio tok .

this enables vast amounts of credit to be made available and the ecb to back up any shortfall in bank reserves by placing the burden on tax payers and property owners .
to do what is necessary will necessitate the abandoning of the so-called social-market economy .
this is unlikely , so we can all expect further crises in the future . - charles smyth , great britain during these turbulent economic times , i 'm concerned that my investments are in jeopardy .
i am retired and 70 years old .
i 've seen my investment drop almost by half and then go up by a quarter this week .

getting tax payers funds to try and rescue the economy might have a negative effect for voting patterns at the us presidential elections in november .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de soccer -pipe- 25.09.2008 euro 2012 decision looms amid doubt großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : poland and ukraine celebrated the euro 2102 award in 2007 european soccer 's governing body is meeting to debate if the 2012 european championships can really be held in poland and ukraine .
even co-host poland has expressed doubts about its feasibility . europe 's governing football body uefa is facing a dilemma .
nobody is questioning that the euro 2012 preparations in the ukraine and poland are in trouble , but the million dollar question is : what to do about it ? for the first time in the history of the organization , the right to host the showpiece of european football could be taken away or germany could be used to find some sort of compromise .
there are also those who are , even in the face of ever-growing evidence to the contrary , saying that everything will be fine . the uefa executive committee , which started its meeting in the five-star grand hotel in bordeaux earlier on thursday , is not only trying to save its own reputation , probably more importantly , it is trying to find a solution . another option shortly before the start of the two-day meeting the 13-member committee was presented with another possible alternative by the president of the polish football federation .
michal listkiewicz suggested on the website of a german newspaper that it might make sense to host the euro finals in ukraine and poland four years later and give the 2012 finals to another country . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : platini now says the award can be removed listkiewicz seems far from convinced his country will be ready in four years time .
the biggest problem : poor infrastructure and terrible traffic , he said . " if the european championships took place in 2016 , we would no problems about being ready then , " listkiewicz told die zeit online , the internet platform of the weekly newspaper . " but realistically we are looking at having no good roads in time for 2012 . " said listkiewicz .
" from gdansk -lrb- in poland -rrb- to donetsk -lrb- in the ukraine -rrb- is more than 1,500 kilometers -lrb- 930 miles -rrb- .
this is not like in austria and switzerland where everything lies close together . " moreover , he cast doubt on whether poland 's partners in ukraine will be up to the job . " if things do n't go well now , and uefa has another suggestion , then that would be in order , " he said . awaiting a progress report the german member of the executive committee , gerhard mayer-vorfelder said that he could not speculate what decision they would reach .
" it is completely open .
i do not want to say which way it will go . " already it seems certain that the unexpected decision taken 17 months ago by the uefa executive in cardiff to give the 2012 euro finals to ukraine and poland was - at best - premature .
inadequate stadiums , problems with the transport system and not enough hotel beds has given rise to serious concerns and pushed uefa into a corner . mayer-vorfelder admits that the decision in april 2007 was not only positive .
" it was a unique situation .
we wanted to include east europe and there was only one other country bidding , italy .
they had their own problems and could not really be rewarded . " a long-awaited progress report on the ability of poland and ukraine to host the finals in four years ' time is expected to criticize the two nations , but stop short of recommending that uefa withdraw their right to host the tournament .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : uefa will decide how many teams can compete in 2012 in the event that the report is completely negative , spain seems to have the best chance of replacing ukraine and poland , while a possible germany-poland scenario , with games in berlin and leipzig , seems little more than a rumor . it could well be that the executive decides in bordeaux to wait a bit longer - after all , in 2011 there will be uefa presidential elections and the french president of the organization , michel platini , will need east european votes to be re-elected . dpa news agency -lrb- mrm -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de immigration -pipe- 25.09.2008 eu agrees new guidelines on immigration großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the new eu blue card is meant to work like the american green card the european union 's interior ministers agreed thursday on common principles guiding the way member states manage the influx of non-eu nationals .
but a blue card scheme for skilled migrants is still on hold . the immigration and asylum pact , which is due to be formally adopted by eu leaders at their october 15-16 summit , seeks to improve the management of legal immigration , tighten controls on illegal immigrants and construct a common asylum policy .
" the aim of the pact is to avoid the two obvious potential pitfalls : the creation of a european fortress , and the total opening up to illegal immigration , " said french interior minister brice hortefeux , who was chairing the interior ministers ' meeting .
but critics argue that the final , watered-down version agreed by ministers in brussels on thursday is ineffective and gives too great a voice to national governments .
for instance , the pact calls on eu countries to attract more highly skilled workers from outside the bloc .
but it leaves governments with the power to decide who and how many of them should be admitted in their own countries .
the czech republic is also currently holding up a deal on a new european " blue card " workers visa program .
eu officials say a single and simplified eu-wide working visa is needed to attract doctors , nurses , engineers and scientsists .
but interior minister ivan langer said the czechs would not agree to the plan until internal eu restrictions are lifted on the movement of workers from new member states .
germany , belgium , austria and denmark have not fully opened up their labor markets to workers from those eastern european countries who joined the bloc over the last few years .
hortefeux said he was nonetheless confident that the eu could overcome this obstacle by the end of the year .
the scheme will not , however , allow recipients to move around as freely as first envisaged .
tougher controls bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the eu is divided over how to respond to the iraqi refugee crisis the pact also calls on member states to tighten controls on illegal immigrants and improve the effectiveness of controls on the bloc 's external borders , for instance by sharing the fingerprints of incoming foreigners in a common database .
another proposal involves national authorities enacting expulsion orders made by another member state .
however , the eu 's border control agency , frontex , remains grossly underfunded , while there is little evidence that the mutual recognition of expulsion decisions is being implemented , according to a recent study by the centre for european policy studies , a brussels-based think tank .
meanwhile , plans for a common asylum policy are progressing slowly and are now not expected to come into force before 2012 .
highlighting the difficulties existing in this area , some member states have resisted calls by germany and sweden to share out some 10,000 highly vulnerable iraqi refugees among member states .
on thursday , ministers limited themselves to giving the green-light to a fact-finding mission to syria and jordan , where many displaced iraqis have fled after the toppling of former dictator saddam hussein .
the mission , which is to take place at the beginning of november , aims to identify those most in need of being granted asylum in europe . dw staff -lrb- mrm / jg -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de immigration -pipe- 25.09.2008 eu agrees new guidelines on immigration großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the new eu blue card is meant to work like the american green card the european union 's interior ministers agreed thursday on common principles guiding the way member states manage the influx of non-eu nationals .
but a blue card scheme for skilled migrants is still on hold . the immigration and asylum pact , which is due to be formally adopted by eu leaders at their october 15-16 summit , seeks to improve the management of legal immigration , tighten controls on illegal immigrants and construct a common asylum policy .
" the aim of the pact is to avoid the two obvious potential pitfalls : the creation of a european fortress , and the total opening up to illegal immigration , " said french interior minister brice hortefeux , who was chairing the interior ministers ' meeting .
but critics argue that the final , watered-down version agreed by ministers in brussels on thursday is ineffective and gives too great a voice to national governments .
for instance , the pact calls on eu countries to attract more highly skilled workers from outside the bloc .
but it leaves governments with the power to decide who and how many of them should be admitted in their own countries .
the czech republic is also currently holding up a deal on a new european " blue card " workers visa program .
eu officials say a single and simplified eu-wide working visa is needed to attract doctors , nurses , engineers and scientsists .
but interior minister ivan langer said the czechs would not agree to the plan until internal eu restrictions are lifted on the movement of workers from new member states .
germany , belgium , austria and denmark have not fully opened up their labor markets to workers from those eastern european countries who joined the bloc over the last few years .
hortefeux said he was nonetheless confident that the eu could overcome this obstacle by the end of the year .
the scheme will not , however , allow recipients to move around as freely as first envisaged .

even co-host poland has expressed doubts about its feasibility . europe 's governing football body uefa is facing a dilemma .
nobody is questioning that the euro 2012 preparations in the ukraine and poland are in trouble , but the million dollar question is : what to do about it ? for the first time in the history of the organization , the right to host the showpiece of european football could be taken away or germany could be used to find some sort of compromise .
there are also those who are , even in the face of ever-growing evidence to the contrary , saying that everything will be fine . the uefa executive committee , which started its meeting in the five-star grand hotel in bordeaux earlier on thursday , is not only trying to save its own reputation , probably more importantly , it is trying to find a solution . another option shortly before the start of the two-day meeting the 13-member committee was presented with another possible alternative by the president of the polish football federation .
michal listkiewicz suggested on the website of a german newspaper that it might make sense to host the euro finals in ukraine and poland four years later and give the 2012 finals to another country . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : platini now says the award can be removed listkiewicz seems far from convinced his country will be ready in four years time .
the biggest problem : poor infrastructure and terrible traffic , he said . " if the european championships took place in 2016 , we would no problems about being ready then , " listkiewicz told die zeit online , the internet platform of the weekly newspaper . " but realistically we are looking at having no good roads in time for 2012 . " said listkiewicz .
" from gdansk -lrb- in poland -rrb- to donetsk -lrb- in the ukraine -rrb- is more than 1,500 kilometers -lrb- 930 miles -rrb- .
this is not like in austria and switzerland where everything lies close together . " moreover , he cast doubt on whether poland 's partners in ukraine will be up to the job . " if things do n't go well now , and uefa has another suggestion , then that would be in order , " he said . awaiting a progress report the german member of the executive committee , gerhard mayer-vorfelder said that he could not speculate what decision they would reach .
" it is completely open .
i do not want to say which way it will go . " already it seems certain that the unexpected decision taken 17 months ago by the uefa executive in cardiff to give the 2012 euro finals to ukraine and poland was - at best - premature .
inadequate stadiums , problems with the transport system and not enough hotel beds has given rise to serious concerns and pushed uefa into a corner . mayer-vorfelder admits that the decision in april 2007 was not only positive .
" it was a unique situation .
we wanted to include east europe and there was only one other country bidding , italy .
they had their own problems and could not really be rewarded . " a long-awaited progress report on the ability of poland and ukraine to host the finals in four years ' time is expected to criticize the two nations , but stop short of recommending that uefa withdraw their right to host the tournament .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : uefa will decide how many teams can compete in 2012 in the event that the report is completely negative , spain seems to have the best chance of replacing ukraine and poland , while a possible germany-poland scenario , with games in berlin and leipzig , seems little more than a rumor . it could well be that the executive decides in bordeaux to wait a bit longer - after all , in 2011 there will be uefa presidential elections and the french president of the organization , michel platini , will need east european votes to be re-elected . dpa news agency -lrb- mrm -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de business -pipe- 25.09.2008 german finance minister blames us for financial crisis großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : wall street will never be the same again , said steinbrueck german finance minister peer steinbrueck deemed the us banking crisis an " earthquake " that will cost the us its role as a superpower of the world financial system .
he stressed that german banks can cope with losses . " wall street and the world will never again be the way they were before the crisis , " said steinbrueck in a speech to the german parliament , the bundestag , on thursday , sept .
25 .
write-downs and write-offs of bad credit spawned by " a blind drive for double-digit profits " have so far totaled $ 550 billion and no end to the crisis is in sight , he added .
the world financial system will consequently become more " multi-polar , " he predicted .
steinbrueck told the bundestag that the group of seven -lrb- g7 -rrb- finance ministers would be meeting in washington next month to discuss how to tighten regulation of capital markets .
the german federal government , meanwhile , would continue efforts to trim spending , but would also make some moves to stimulate the economy .
he reiterated germany 's refusal to set up its own bank bail-out scheme , saying the crisis was principally a us problem .
irresponsible moves bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : steinbrueck did n't pull his punches during the bundestag speech reiterating berlin 's push for tighter regulation , steinbrueck accused the us of blunders .
" the cause of the crisis was the irresponsible exaggeration of the principle of a free , unrestrained market , " he told the bundestag .
washington has been reluctant to increase minimum equity rules and has too many competing regulators over us investment banks .
" this system , which in many ways is inadequately regulated , is now collapsing , " he said , adding that germany 's banking system remained " relatively robust , " with german regulators confident they can absorb losses .
" new rules of the road " for the financial markets were needed , he said .
plans to be debated when the finance ministers of the g7 meet will include tightening cooperation between the international monetary fund -lrb- imf -rrb- and the financial stability forum -lrb- fsf -rrb- .
the agencies were created by western nations as an early warning system .
strengthening cooperation bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the german landesbanken need to pull together steinbrueck also renewed his call for fusion across germany 's state bank sector .
the country 's big commercial lenders , the so-called " landesbanken , " have been hard hit by the financial crisis . the next move needs to be made by the individual states , as co-owners of the leading state banks , said the social democrat minister : " they need to overcome regional political pride and embrace pan-regional co-operation . "
this , he said , would strengthen the german banking system and boost its sustainability .
" financial support from the government in mopping up problems in this sector should not be expected , " he added . given that past attempts to fuse the " landesbanken " have failed , steinbrueck proposed a redefinition of their business models in order to avoid excessive risk and to increase returns .
the financial crisis has , however , shown that both savings banks and cooperative banking institutions are stable and reliable , said steinbrueck . dw staff -lrb- jp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

german broadcaster zdf had reported that western intelligence services now have indications that breininger , a convert to islam , had returned to europe , and possibly germany , and was trying to procure explosives .
but a spokesman said there was no concrete evidence breininger was plotting an actual attack .
police said , however , that breininger , who is from the state of saarland in western germany , had recorded an internet video in august in which he spoke of carrying out a suicide attack and supported jihad or holy war .
the federal crime office -lrb- bka -rrb- showed photos of the two men on its web page listing the most wanted suspects in the country .

dw-world.de reserves the right to edit for length and appropriateness of content .
chancellor merkel 's call for greater transparency and regulation is not what the problem demands with regard to the failings of the financial markets .
the problem is rooted in the insistence by eu governments with regard to fractional reserve banking .
this enables vast amounts of credit to be made available and the ecb to back up any shortfall in bank reserves by placing the burden on tax payers and property owners .
to do what is necessary will necessitate the abandoning of the so-called social-market economy .
this is unlikely , so we can all expect further crises in the future . - charles smyth , great britain during these turbulent economic times , i 'm concerned that my investments are in jeopardy .
i am retired and 70 years old .
i 've seen my investment drop almost by half and then go up by a quarter this week .
i 'm trying to hang in but at my age do n't know if i 'm foolish . - janice speck , us wall street has reacted very irresponsibly to the financial crisis that has affected the world economy .
getting tax payers funds to try and rescue the economy might have a negative effect for voting patterns at the us presidential elections in november .
many ordinary voters will see their rights being neglected by the whims of wall street and the rich people associated with the financial sector .
this should benefit barack obama campaign rather than john mccain . - stuart john pearson , australia the bush administration has shown great arrogance by not listening to good advice given by their european friends .
starting with the invasion of iraq , then overacting to the sept .
11 attack and lastly the slashing of credit rates to falsely give the faltering economy a boost .
because of this financial disaster , the us has defaulted on their good reputation and only the next administration can hopefully build the trust needed to work again together as equal partners . - g. gosau , canada compiled by dw staff -lrb- ot -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

"
conducted by omer welber , the istanbul philharmonic and the ra 'anana symphonette accompanied israeli virtuoso shlomo mintz , yair dalal and turkey 's cihat askin as they played sixteen violins that had outlasted the holocaust .
the concert was part of this year 's celebrations marking israel 's 60th anniversary .
proceeds from the event went to meir panim layeled , an organization that focuses on the welfare , education and health needs of children across israel .
16 violins , 16 stories bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : amnon weinstein some of the violins were responsible for saving jewish lives , and some helped fight the germans .
" each violin has its own story , " israeli violin maker amnon weinstein told reuters .
now 69 , he and his son have spent more than a decade restoring the violins collected from across europe .
weinstein said he received the instruments in various states of disrepair , many of them decorated with stars of david carved into the woodwork , a testimony to their former jewish owners .
" by restoring their violins , their legacy is born again , " said weinstein , who lost most of his family in the holocaust .
most of them were found in attics and cellars , where they had spent the last few decades gathering dust .
he said the majority originally came from ghettos and concentration camps , where nazis used to assemble orchestras . in some cases , weinstein was able to track their history and talk to the families they once belonged to .
the story of motele bildunterschrift : the event took place outside the walls of jerusalem 's old city according to the event 's website , one of the instruments originally belonged to a 12-year-old jewish boy who played it for nazi ss officers in belarus in 1944 .
his name was motele , and he had joined the resistance in a village near the border with ukraine and managed to infiltrate a nazi building there .
" the german officers heard him play in the streets one day and later brought him to perform every night in their compound in town , " said sefi hanegbi , whose father played alongside motele in a partisan camp in a forest during world war two .
after each performance , motele would hide his violin in the building and walk out with an empty case .
he would return with the violin case full of explosives , stuffing them into cracks in the walls , and eventually setting them off , hanegbi said .
motele was later killed in a german ambush , and hanegbi 's family brought his violin to israel where it sat in a closet for decades - forgotten until amnon weinstein gave it a second lease of life . dw staff -lrb- jp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

but a spokesman said there was no concrete evidence breininger was plotting an actual attack .

germans tend to be debt-averse and are required to put down more equity in financing a home purchase . german politicians have criticized the us for failing to implement stringent controls on financial markets with many pointing out that the sub-prime mortgage crisis that felled wall street ’ s venerable financial institutions week could not happen in germany .
they may have a point . for one , experts say , the type of high risk lending practices that were exposed when the bubble burst in the us housing market a few years ago is more heavily regulated in germany . “ the sub-prime market is virtually non-existent , ” said elaine kempson , director of the personal finance research centre at the university of bristol . home ownership rates in germany are also among the lowest in europe - under 50 percent compared to around 70 percent in the us and the uk , said kempson , whose institute has done comparative studies in europe on personal credit risk and indebtedness . “ germans are much more conservative than americans and other europeans in terms of how much debt they are willing to take on , ” she said . larger down payments banks in germany also tend to have more stringent criteria in determining the creditworthiness of borrowers than their european or american counterparts . “ there is no such thing as zero financing on a home , ” said thomas beyerle , head of research at the degi , a frankfurt-based property investment company .
in germany , homeowners are required to make a down payment of at least 20 percent of the purchase price of a house to obtain a mortgage in the first place . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : foreclosures and defaulting on mortgage payments are far less common in germany michaela roth , spokesman of the german federation of savings and loan banks -lrb- dsgv -rrb- said it is not unusual to put down as much as 40 percent equity and finance the rest . “ germans generally are only prepared to be moderately indebted , ” she said .
even big ticket purchases such as a washing machine are paid for with hard cash or bank debit cards , with only five percent of consumers even bothering to use a credit card . mind-set averse to debt some say german financial prudence has its roots in the world wars , a period marked by acute economic hardship and suffering . “ the puritanical ethic of the war generation is still very much ingrained in germany today , ” said fabian christandl , a researcher at the institute for economic and social psychology at the university of cologne . germans work hard , put their cash in a savings account , earn a bit of interest and only take on debt for big investments , said christandl . “ a house is one of the very few purchases for which it ’ s viewed as acceptable to go into debt , ” he said . and homeowners who possess enough capital to invest in residential property beyond their own four walls are not interested in flipping over properties for quick profits either , said beyerle .
real estate investments are viewed either as a source of steady rental income or a way to reduce one ’ s tax burden . bubble burst only once beyerle explained that after german reunification in the 1990s , the government provided tax incentives for investors to buy up and develop real estate in the former east german states , but when the scheme ended ten years ago , the housing market collapsed from properties that wound up being overvalued . “ this was the only time that the bubble burst in germany , ” said beyerle . since property values in the rest of germany have remained fairly steady , even in prime locations near major urban centers such as munich , frankfurt , stuttgart , hamburg or cologne , speculation fever never caught on in germany , he added . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : even in prime urban areas , prices have not skyrocketed “ the us housing market was based on the premise that home values had no where to go but up and would keep rising very rapidly .
then when it got bad , the whole pack of cards crumbled , ” said kempson .
she cited a world bank report which indicated that as much as 20 percent of all mortgages in the us are in the sub-prime category . loans without income verification in us in the uk , five percent of the mortgage market is sub-prime , but those with impaired credit histories might be marginal bank risks , such as students or those who have a perspective of future employment that would enable them to pay back their bank loans . not so in the us , where unlicensed mortgage brokers targeted low income groups who never would have been able to borrow from more conventional banks , said kempson . “ these brokers were aggressively selling “ discounted ” packages to those surviving on social security , ” she said .
kempson added that as much as 40 percent of the loans were made without any income verification , which is much less likely to happen in europe . following a short period of loans made at fixed low rates , borrowers with “ sub-prime bargains ” found their mortgages being reset at double-digit rates .
then when soaring us housing prices started to plunge , borrowers were saddled with sub-prime mortgages that exceeded the value of their homes and couldn ’ t refinance their way out of debt , said kempson . a nation of renters bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : younger home buyers with no capital shop for best rates achim duebel , a mortgage sector expert based in berlin , said the problem with sub-prime mortgages doesn ’ t exist in germany since it is largely a nation of renters . “ every sub-prime borrower here is a renter ” , he said . but duebel added that younger germans are looking at more innovative ways to invest in property . “ the mortgage market is not as dull and boring as it looks in germany , ” he said , explaining that most germans still take out traditional mortgages at their local bank , but there is a growing number of marginal , but not sub-prime borrowers - those with no capital , but strong cash flow , such as the self-employed or freelancers , who can find mortgage brokers offering packages that require little or even no financing . “ there is cutthroat competition out there , a younger generation that wants to shop for the best rates , the best deals , so this is giving the entire mortgage market a push , ” said duebel . diana fong send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

germans tend to be debt-averse and are required to put down more equity in financing a home purchase . german politicians have criticized the us for failing to implement stringent controls on financial markets with many pointing out that the sub-prime mortgage crisis that felled wall street ’ s venerable financial institutions week could not happen in germany .
they may have a point . for one , experts say , the type of high risk lending practices that were exposed when the bubble burst in the us housing market a few years ago is more heavily regulated in germany . “ the sub-prime market is virtually non-existent , ” said elaine kempson , director of the personal finance research centre at the university of bristol . home ownership rates in germany are also among the lowest in europe - under 50 percent compared to around 70 percent in the us and the uk , said kempson , whose institute has done comparative studies in europe on personal credit risk and indebtedness . “ germans are much more conservative than americans and other europeans in terms of how much debt they are willing to take on , ” she said . larger down payments banks in germany also tend to have more stringent criteria in determining the creditworthiness of borrowers than their european or american counterparts . “ there is no such thing as zero financing on a home , ” said thomas beyerle , head of research at the degi , a frankfurt-based property investment company .
in germany , homeowners are required to make a down payment of at least 20 percent of the purchase price of a house to obtain a mortgage in the first place . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : foreclosures and defaulting on mortgage payments are far less common in germany michaela roth , spokesman of the german federation of savings and loan banks -lrb- dsgv -rrb- said it is not unusual to put down as much as 40 percent equity and finance the rest . “ germans generally are only prepared to be moderately indebted , ” she said .
even big ticket purchases such as a washing machine are paid for with hard cash or bank debit cards , with only five percent of consumers even bothering to use a credit card . mind-set averse to debt some say german financial prudence has its roots in the world wars , a period marked by acute economic hardship and suffering . “ the puritanical ethic of the war generation is still very much ingrained in germany today , ” said fabian christandl , a researcher at the institute for economic and social psychology at the university of cologne . germans work hard , put their cash in a savings account , earn a bit of interest and only take on debt for big investments , said christandl . “ a house is one of the very few purchases for which it ’ s viewed as acceptable to go into debt , ” he said . and homeowners who possess enough capital to invest in residential property beyond their own four walls are not interested in flipping over properties for quick profits either , said beyerle .
real estate investments are viewed either as a source of steady rental income or a way to reduce one ’ s tax burden . bubble burst only once beyerle explained that after german reunification in the 1990s , the government provided tax incentives for investors to buy up and develop real estate in the former east german states , but when the scheme ended ten years ago , the housing market collapsed from properties that wound up being overvalued . “ this was the only time that the bubble burst in germany , ” said beyerle . since property values in the rest of germany have remained fairly steady , even in prime locations near major urban centers such as munich , frankfurt , stuttgart , hamburg or cologne , speculation fever never caught on in germany , he added . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : even in prime urban areas , prices have not skyrocketed “ the us housing market was based on the premise that home values had no where to go but up and would keep rising very rapidly .
then when it got bad , the whole pack of cards crumbled , ” said kempson .
she cited a world bank report which indicated that as much as 20 percent of all mortgages in the us are in the sub-prime category . loans without income verification in us in the uk , five percent of the mortgage market is sub-prime , but those with impaired credit histories might be marginal bank risks , such as students or those who have a perspective of future employment that would enable them to pay back their bank loans . not so in the us , where unlicensed mortgage brokers targeted low income groups who never would have been able to borrow from more conventional banks , said kempson . “ these brokers were aggressively selling “ discounted ” packages to those surviving on social security , ” she said .
kempson added that as much as 40 percent of the loans were made without any income verification , which is much less likely to happen in europe . following a short period of loans made at fixed low rates , borrowers with “ sub-prime bargains ” found their mortgages being reset at double-digit rates .
then when soaring us housing prices started to plunge , borrowers were saddled with sub-prime mortgages that exceeded the value of their homes and couldn ’ t refinance their way out of debt , said kempson . a nation of renters bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : younger home buyers with no capital shop for best rates achim duebel , a mortgage sector expert based in berlin , said the problem with sub-prime mortgages doesn ’ t exist in germany since it is largely a nation of renters . “ every sub-prime borrower here is a renter ” , he said . but duebel added that younger germans are looking at more innovative ways to invest in property . “ the mortgage market is not as dull and boring as it looks in germany , ” he said , explaining that most germans still take out traditional mortgages at their local bank , but there is a growing number of marginal , but not sub-prime borrowers - those with no capital , but strong cash flow , such as the self-employed or freelancers , who can find mortgage brokers offering packages that require little or even no financing . “ there is cutthroat competition out there , a younger generation that wants to shop for the best rates , the best deals , so this is giving the entire mortgage market a push , ” said duebel . diana fong send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

elser was arrested , tortured and murdered at dachau by the nazis six years later .
the bust of elser was put up at private expense on a riverside near the interior ministry in berlin on wednesday , sept .
24 .
a plaque in his memory was put up several years ago in his hometown , koenigsbronn , in south-western germany .
elser , a wood joiner of strongly anti-nazi views , planted the bomb alone in a bid to stop the war .
the german resistance memorial movement said the bombing and a bomb set by colonel claus von stauffenberg in 1944 , which slightly wounded hitler , were the only assassination attempts that ever put hitler in danger .
a foundation established by a businessman , ernst freiberger , paid for the bust .
over decades , germany has only gradually come around to viewing the would-be assassins as heroes .
a film , valkyrie , set for us release in december , will depict the 1944 plot with tom cruise playing stauffenberg . dpa news agency -lrb- kjb -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

he stressed that german banks can cope with losses . " wall street and the world will never again be the way they were before the crisis , " said steinbrueck in a speech to the german parliament , the bundestag , on thursday , sept .

write-downs and write-offs of bad credit spawned by " a blind drive for double-digit profits " have so far totaled $ 550 billion and no end to the crisis is in sight , he added .
the world financial system will consequently become more " multi-polar , " he predicted .
steinbrueck told the bundestag that the group of seven -lrb- g7 -rrb- finance ministers would be meeting in washington next month to discuss how to tighten regulation of capital markets .
the german federal government , meanwhile , would continue efforts to trim spending , but would also make some moves to stimulate the economy .
he reiterated germany 's refusal to set up its own bank bail-out scheme , saying the crisis was principally a us problem .
irresponsible moves bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : steinbrueck did n't pull his punches during the bundestag speech reiterating berlin 's push for tighter regulation , steinbrueck accused the us of blunders .
" the cause of the crisis was the irresponsible exaggeration of the principle of a free , unrestrained market , " he told the bundestag .
washington has been reluctant to increase minimum equity rules and has too many competing regulators over us investment banks .
" this system , which in many ways is inadequately regulated , is now collapsing , " he said , adding that germany 's banking system remained " relatively robust , " with german regulators confident they can absorb losses .
" new rules of the road " for the financial markets were needed , he said .
plans to be debated when the finance ministers of the g7 meet will include tightening cooperation between the international monetary fund -lrb- imf -rrb- and the financial stability forum -lrb- fsf -rrb- .
the agencies were created by western nations as an early warning system .
strengthening cooperation bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the german landesbanken need to pull together steinbrueck also renewed his call for fusion across germany 's state bank sector .
the country 's big commercial lenders , the so-called " landesbanken , " have been hard hit by the financial crisis . the next move needs to be made by the individual states , as co-owners of the leading state banks , said the social democrat minister : " they need to overcome regional political pride and embrace pan-regional co-operation . "
this , he said , would strengthen the german banking system and boost its sustainability .
" financial support from the government in mopping up problems in this sector should not be expected , " he added . given that past attempts to fuse the " landesbanken " have failed , steinbrueck proposed a redefinition of their business models in order to avoid excessive risk and to increase returns .

he stressed that german banks can cope with losses . " wall street and the world will never again be the way they were before the crisis , " said steinbrueck in a speech to the german parliament , the bundestag , on thursday , sept .
25 .
write-downs and write-offs of bad credit spawned by " a blind drive for double-digit profits " have so far totaled $ 550 billion and no end to the crisis is in sight , he added .
the world financial system will consequently become more " multi-polar , " he predicted .
steinbrueck told the bundestag that the group of seven -lrb- g7 -rrb- finance ministers would be meeting in washington next month to discuss how to tighten regulation of capital markets .
the german federal government , meanwhile , would continue efforts to trim spending , but would also make some moves to stimulate the economy .
he reiterated germany 's refusal to set up its own bank bail-out scheme , saying the crisis was principally a us problem .
irresponsible moves bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : steinbrueck did n't pull his punches during the bundestag speech reiterating berlin 's push for tighter regulation , steinbrueck accused the us of blunders .
" the cause of the crisis was the irresponsible exaggeration of the principle of a free , unrestrained market , " he told the bundestag .
washington has been reluctant to increase minimum equity rules and has too many competing regulators over us investment banks .
" this system , which in many ways is inadequately regulated , is now collapsing , " he said , adding that germany 's banking system remained " relatively robust , " with german regulators confident they can absorb losses .
" new rules of the road " for the financial markets were needed , he said .
plans to be debated when the finance ministers of the g7 meet will include tightening cooperation between the international monetary fund -lrb- imf -rrb- and the financial stability forum -lrb- fsf -rrb- .
the agencies were created by western nations as an early warning system .
strengthening cooperation bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the german landesbanken need to pull together steinbrueck also renewed his call for fusion across germany 's state bank sector .
the country 's big commercial lenders , the so-called " landesbanken , " have been hard hit by the financial crisis . the next move needs to be made by the individual states , as co-owners of the leading state banks , said the social democrat minister : " they need to overcome regional political pride and embrace pan-regional co-operation . "
this , he said , would strengthen the german banking system and boost its sustainability .
" financial support from the government in mopping up problems in this sector should not be expected , " he added . given that past attempts to fuse the " landesbanken " have failed , steinbrueck proposed a redefinition of their business models in order to avoid excessive risk and to increase returns .
the financial crisis has , however , shown that both savings banks and cooperative banking institutions are stable and reliable , said steinbrueck . dw staff -lrb- jp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

chancellor merkel 's call for greater transparency and regulation is not what the problem demands with regard to the failings of the financial markets .
the problem is rooted in the insistence by eu governments with regard to fractional reserve banking .
this enables vast amounts of credit to be made available and the ecb to back up any shortfall in bank reserves by placing the burden on tax payers and property owners .
to do what is necessary will necessitate the abandoning of the so-called social-market economy .
this is unlikely , so we can all expect further crises in the future . - charles smyth , great britain during these turbulent economic times , i 'm concerned that my investments are in jeopardy .
i am retired and 70 years old .
i 've seen my investment drop almost by half and then go up by a quarter this week .
i 'm trying to hang in but at my age do n't know if i 'm foolish . - janice speck , us wall street has reacted very irresponsibly to the financial crisis that has affected the world economy .
getting tax payers funds to try and rescue the economy might have a negative effect for voting patterns at the us presidential elections in november .
many ordinary voters will see their rights being neglected by the whims of wall street and the rich people associated with the financial sector .
this should benefit barack obama campaign rather than john mccain . - stuart john pearson , australia the bush administration has shown great arrogance by not listening to good advice given by their european friends .
starting with the invasion of iraq , then overacting to the sept .
11 attack and lastly the slashing of credit rates to falsely give the faltering economy a boost .
because of this financial disaster , the us has defaulted on their good reputation and only the next administration can hopefully build the trust needed to work again together as equal partners . - g. gosau , canada compiled by dw staff -lrb- ot -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

-lrb- 25.09.2008 -rrb- debt-averse germans unlikely to attract sub-prime trouble sub-prime mortgages are virtually unknown in germany since home ownership rates are relatively low .

but there is little they can do . in mid-september , the government issued a statement confirming that " work by ministers of health and justice on a draft law on obligatory chemical castration for pedophiles was nearing completion . "
according to polish media reports , the ministry plans to make the treatment compulsory for repeat offenders .
the pills would reduce or eliminate sex drive by suppressing the production of testosterone .
" our idea does n't yet have the form of a law , " ministry spokesman jakub golab told the daily polska .
" we 're currently consulting with sexologists ...
we want to bring it into effect as soon as possible . "

poland 's fritzl bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : donald tusk prime minister donald tusk raised the controversial topic after a 45-year-old man was charged with having raped and held his 21-year-old daughter captive for six years .
the suspect , dubbed poland 's josef fritzl in a reference to the austrian man accused of incarcerating his daughter and fathering seven children with her , faces up to 15 years behind bars if found guilty .
the woman in poland gave birth to two children , in 2005 and 2007 , allegedly from her father .
she maintains that he pressured her to give them up for adoption .
the case triggered a nationwide debate on how criminal sex offenders should be punished , with the liberal prime minister taking a draconian stance .
" i want to gather all the laws in operation across europe to introduce in poland the most rigorous law possible regarding criminals who rape children , " tusk said .
" i do not believe that we can call these individuals - these creatures - human beings , " he added .
" so in this case , we do n't need to discuss human rights . "

he stressed that german banks can cope with losses . " wall street and the world will never again be the way they were before the crisis , " said steinbrueck in a speech to the german parliament , the bundestag , on thursday , sept .
25 .
write-downs and write-offs of bad credit spawned by " a blind drive for double-digit profits " have so far totaled $ 550 billion and no end to the crisis is in sight , he added .
the world financial system will consequently become more " multi-polar , " he predicted .
steinbrueck told the bundestag that the group of seven -lrb- g7 -rrb- finance ministers would be meeting in washington next month to discuss how to tighten regulation of capital markets .
the german federal government , meanwhile , would continue efforts to trim spending , but would also make some moves to stimulate the economy .
he reiterated germany 's refusal to set up its own bank bail-out scheme , saying the crisis was principally a us problem .
irresponsible moves bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : steinbrueck did n't pull his punches during the bundestag speech reiterating berlin 's push for tighter regulation , steinbrueck accused the us of blunders .
" the cause of the crisis was the irresponsible exaggeration of the principle of a free , unrestrained market , " he told the bundestag .
washington has been reluctant to increase minimum equity rules and has too many competing regulators over us investment banks .
" this system , which in many ways is inadequately regulated , is now collapsing , " he said , adding that germany 's banking system remained " relatively robust , " with german regulators confident they can absorb losses .
" new rules of the road " for the financial markets were needed , he said .
plans to be debated when the finance ministers of the g7 meet will include tightening cooperation between the international monetary fund -lrb- imf -rrb- and the financial stability forum -lrb- fsf -rrb- .
the agencies were created by western nations as an early warning system .
strengthening cooperation bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the german landesbanken need to pull together steinbrueck also renewed his call for fusion across germany 's state bank sector .
the country 's big commercial lenders , the so-called " landesbanken , " have been hard hit by the financial crisis . the next move needs to be made by the individual states , as co-owners of the leading state banks , said the social democrat minister : " they need to overcome regional political pride and embrace pan-regional co-operation . "
this , he said , would strengthen the german banking system and boost its sustainability .
" financial support from the government in mopping up problems in this sector should not be expected , " he added . given that past attempts to fuse the " landesbanken " have failed , steinbrueck proposed a redefinition of their business models in order to avoid excessive risk and to increase returns .
the financial crisis has , however , shown that both savings banks and cooperative banking institutions are stable and reliable , said steinbrueck . dw staff -lrb- jp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

steinbrueck told the bundestag that the group of seven -lrb- g7 -rrb- finance ministers would be meeting in washington next month to discuss how to tighten regulation of capital markets .
the german federal government , meanwhile , would continue efforts to trim spending , but would also make some moves to stimulate the economy .

"
this , he said , would strengthen the german banking system and boost its sustainability .
" financial support from the government in mopping up problems in this sector should not be expected , " he added . given that past attempts to fuse the " landesbanken " have failed , steinbrueck proposed a redefinition of their business models in order to avoid excessive risk and to increase returns .

german broadcaster zdf had reported that western intelligence services now have indications that breininger , a convert to islam , had returned to europe , and possibly germany , and was trying to procure explosives .
but a spokesman said there was no concrete evidence breininger was plotting an actual attack .
police said , however , that breininger , who is from the state of saarland in western germany , had recorded an internet video in august in which he spoke of carrying out a suicide attack and supported jihad or holy war .
the federal crime office -lrb- bka -rrb- showed photos of the two men on its web page listing the most wanted suspects in the country .
both men are suspected of links to the islamic jihad union -lrb- iju -rrb- , which is affiliated with al qaeda and investigators say was behind a major bomb plot in germany that they thwarted last september .

chancellor merkel 's call for greater transparency and regulation is not what the problem demands with regard to the failings of the financial markets .
the problem is rooted in the insistence by eu governments with regard to fractional reserve banking .
this enables vast amounts of credit to be made available and the ecb to back up any shortfall in bank reserves by placing the burden on tax payers and property owners .
to do what is necessary will necessitate the abandoning of the so-called social-market economy .
this is unlikely , so we can all expect further crises in the future . - charles smyth , great britain during these turbulent economic times , i 'm concerned that my investments are in jeopardy .
i am retired and 70 years old .
i 've seen my investment drop almost by half and then go up by a quarter this week .
i 'm trying to hang in but at my age do n't know if i 'm foolish . - janice speck , us wall street has reacted very irresponsibly to the financial crisis that has affected the world economy .
getting tax payers funds to try and rescue the economy might have a negative effect for voting patterns at the us presidential elections in november .
many ordinary voters will see their rights being neglected by the whims of wall street and the rich people associated with the financial sector .
this should benefit barack obama campaign rather than john mccain . - stuart john pearson , australia the bush administration has shown great arrogance by not listening to good advice given by their european friends .
starting with the invasion of iraq , then overacting to the sept .
11 attack and lastly the slashing of credit rates to falsely give the faltering economy a boost .

he stressed that german banks can cope with losses . " wall street and the world will never again be the way they were before the crisis , " said steinbrueck in a speech to the german parliament , the bundestag , on thursday , sept .
25 .
write-downs and write-offs of bad credit spawned by " a blind drive for double-digit profits " have so far totaled $ 550 billion and no end to the crisis is in sight , he added .
the world financial system will consequently become more " multi-polar , " he predicted .
steinbrueck told the bundestag that the group of seven -lrb- g7 -rrb- finance ministers would be meeting in washington next month to discuss how to tighten regulation of capital markets .
the german federal government , meanwhile , would continue efforts to trim spending , but would also make some moves to stimulate the economy .
he reiterated germany 's refusal to set up its own bank bail-out scheme , saying the crisis was principally a us problem .
irresponsible moves bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : steinbrueck did n't pull his punches during the bundestag speech reiterating berlin 's push for tighter regulation , steinbrueck accused the us of blunders .
" the cause of the crisis was the irresponsible exaggeration of the principle of a free , unrestrained market , " he told the bundestag .
washington has been reluctant to increase minimum equity rules and has too many competing regulators over us investment banks .
" this system , which in many ways is inadequately regulated , is now collapsing , " he said , adding that germany 's banking system remained " relatively robust , " with german regulators confident they can absorb losses .
" new rules of the road " for the financial markets were needed , he said .
plans to be debated when the finance ministers of the g7 meet will include tightening cooperation between the international monetary fund -lrb- imf -rrb- and the financial stability forum -lrb- fsf -rrb- .
the agencies were created by western nations as an early warning system .
strengthening cooperation bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the german landesbanken need to pull together steinbrueck also renewed his call for fusion across germany 's state bank sector .
the country 's big commercial lenders , the so-called " landesbanken , " have been hard hit by the financial crisis . the next move needs to be made by the individual states , as co-owners of the leading state banks , said the social democrat minister : " they need to overcome regional political pride and embrace pan-regional co-operation . "
this , he said , would strengthen the german banking system and boost its sustainability .
" financial support from the government in mopping up problems in this sector should not be expected , " he added . given that past attempts to fuse the " landesbanken " have failed , steinbrueck proposed a redefinition of their business models in order to avoid excessive risk and to increase returns .
the financial crisis has , however , shown that both savings banks and cooperative banking institutions are stable and reliable , said steinbrueck . dw staff -lrb- jp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de immigration -pipe- 25.09.2008 eu agrees new guidelines on immigration großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the new eu blue card is meant to work like the american green card the european union 's interior ministers agreed thursday on common principles guiding the way member states manage the influx of non-eu nationals .
but a blue card scheme for skilled migrants is still on hold . the immigration and asylum pact , which is due to be formally adopted by eu leaders at their october 15-16 summit , seeks to improve the management of legal immigration , tighten controls on illegal immigrants and construct a common asylum policy .
" the aim of the pact is to avoid the two obvious potential pitfalls : the creation of a european fortress , and the total opening up to illegal immigration , " said french interior minister brice hortefeux , who was chairing the interior ministers ' meeting .
but critics argue that the final , watered-down version agreed by ministers in brussels on thursday is ineffective and gives too great a voice to national governments .
for instance , the pact calls on eu countries to attract more highly skilled workers from outside the bloc .
but it leaves governments with the power to decide who and how many of them should be admitted in their own countries .
the czech republic is also currently holding up a deal on a new european " blue card " workers visa program .
eu officials say a single and simplified eu-wide working visa is needed to attract doctors , nurses , engineers and scientsists .
but interior minister ivan langer said the czechs would not agree to the plan until internal eu restrictions are lifted on the movement of workers from new member states .
germany , belgium , austria and denmark have not fully opened up their labor markets to workers from those eastern european countries who joined the bloc over the last few years .
hortefeux said he was nonetheless confident that the eu could overcome this obstacle by the end of the year .
the scheme will not , however , allow recipients to move around as freely as first envisaged .
tougher controls bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the eu is divided over how to respond to the iraqi refugee crisis the pact also calls on member states to tighten controls on illegal immigrants and improve the effectiveness of controls on the bloc 's external borders , for instance by sharing the fingerprints of incoming foreigners in a common database .
another proposal involves national authorities enacting expulsion orders made by another member state .
however , the eu 's border control agency , frontex , remains grossly underfunded , while there is little evidence that the mutual recognition of expulsion decisions is being implemented , according to a recent study by the centre for european policy studies , a brussels-based think tank .
meanwhile , plans for a common asylum policy are progressing slowly and are now not expected to come into force before 2012 .
highlighting the difficulties existing in this area , some member states have resisted calls by germany and sweden to share out some 10,000 highly vulnerable iraqi refugees among member states .
on thursday , ministers limited themselves to giving the green-light to a fact-finding mission to syria and jordan , where many displaced iraqis have fled after the toppling of former dictator saddam hussein .
the mission , which is to take place at the beginning of november , aims to identify those most in need of being granted asylum in europe . dw staff -lrb- mrm / jg -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" each violin has its own story , " israeli violin maker amnon weinstein told reuters .

weinstein said he received the instruments in various states of disrepair , many of them decorated with stars of david carved into the woodwork , a testimony to their former jewish owners .
" by restoring their violins , their legacy is born again , " said weinstein , who lost most of his family in the holocaust .
most of them were found in attics and cellars , where they had spent the last few decades gathering dust .

his name was motele , and he had joined the resistance in a village near the border with ukraine and managed to infiltrate a nazi building there .
" the german officers heard him play in the streets one day and later brought him to perform every night in their compound in town , " said sefi hanegbi , whose father played alongside motele in a partisan camp in a forest during world war two .
after each performance , motele would hide his violin in the building and walk out with an empty case .
he would return with the violin case full of explosives , stuffing them into cracks in the walls , and eventually setting them off , hanegbi said .
motele was later killed in a german ambush , and hanegbi 's family brought his violin to israel where it sat in a closet for decades - forgotten until amnon weinstein gave it a second lease of life . dw staff -lrb- jp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

"
conducted by omer welber , the istanbul philharmonic and the ra 'anana symphonette accompanied israeli virtuoso shlomo mintz , yair dalal and turkey 's cihat askin as they played sixteen violins that had outlasted the holocaust .
the concert was part of this year 's celebrations marking israel 's 60th anniversary .
proceeds from the event went to meir panim layeled , an organization that focuses on the welfare , education and health needs of children across israel .
16 violins , 16 stories bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : amnon weinstein some of the violins were responsible for saving jewish lives , and some helped fight the germans .
" each violin has its own story , " israeli violin maker amnon weinstein told reuters .
now 69 , he and his son have spent more than a decade restoring the violins collected from across europe .
weinstein said he received the instruments in various states of disrepair , many of them decorated with stars of david carved into the woodwork , a testimony to their former jewish owners .
" by restoring their violins , their legacy is born again , " said weinstein , who lost most of his family in the holocaust .
most of them were found in attics and cellars , where they had spent the last few decades gathering dust .
he said the majority originally came from ghettos and concentration camps , where nazis used to assemble orchestras . in some cases , weinstein was able to track their history and talk to the families they once belonged to .
the story of motele bildunterschrift : the event took place outside the walls of jerusalem 's old city according to the event 's website , one of the instruments originally belonged to a 12-year-old jewish boy who played it for nazi ss officers in belarus in 1944 .
his name was motele , and he had joined the resistance in a village near the border with ukraine and managed to infiltrate a nazi building there .
" the german officers heard him play in the streets one day and later brought him to perform every night in their compound in town , " said sefi hanegbi , whose father played alongside motele in a partisan camp in a forest during world war two .
after each performance , motele would hide his violin in the building and walk out with an empty case .
he would return with the violin case full of explosives , stuffing them into cracks in the walls , and eventually setting them off , hanegbi said .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de banking -pipe- 25.09.2008 debt-averse germans unlikely to attract sub-prime trouble großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : it 's acceptable to go into debt to buy a house sub-prime mortgages are virtually unknown in germany since home ownership rates are relatively low .
germans tend to be debt-averse and are required to put down more equity in financing a home purchase . german politicians have criticized the us for failing to implement stringent controls on financial markets with many pointing out that the sub-prime mortgage crisis that felled wall street ’ s venerable financial institutions week could not happen in germany .
they may have a point . for one , experts say , the type of high risk lending practices that were exposed when the bubble burst in the us housing market a few years ago is more heavily regulated in germany . “ the sub-prime market is virtually non-existent , ” said elaine kempson , director of the personal finance research centre at the university of bristol . home ownership rates in germany are also among the lowest in europe - under 50 percent compared to around 70 percent in the us and the uk , said kempson , whose institute has done comparative studies in europe on personal credit risk and indebtedness . “ germans are much more conservative than americans and other europeans in terms of how much debt they are willing to take on , ” she said . larger down payments banks in germany also tend to have more stringent criteria in determining the creditworthiness of borrowers than their european or american counterparts . “ there is no such thing as zero financing on a home , ” said thomas beyerle , head of research at the degi , a frankfurt-based property investment company .
in germany , homeowners are required to make a down payment of at least 20 percent of the purchase price of a house to obtain a mortgage in the first place . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : foreclosures and defaulting on mortgage payments are far less common in germany michaela roth , spokesman of the german federation of savings and loan banks -lrb- dsgv -rrb- said it is not unusual to put down as much as 40 percent equity and finance the rest . “ germans generally are only prepared to be moderately indebted , ” she said .
even big ticket purchases such as a washing machine are paid for with hard cash or bank debit cards , with only five percent of consumers even bothering to use a credit card . mind-set averse to debt some say german financial prudence has its roots in the world wars , a period marked by acute economic hardship and suffering . “ the puritanical ethic of the war generation is still very much ingrained in germany today , ” said fabian christandl , a researcher at the institute for economic and social psychology at the university of cologne . germans work hard , put their cash in a savings account , earn a bit of interest and only take on debt for big investments , said christandl . “ a house is one of the very few purchases for which it ’ s viewed as acceptable to go into debt , ” he said . and homeowners who possess enough capital to invest in residential property beyond their own four walls are not interested in flipping over properties for quick profits either , said beyerle .
real estate investments are viewed either as a source of steady rental income or a way to reduce one ’ s tax burden . bubble burst only once beyerle explained that after german reunification in the 1990s , the government provided tax incentives for investors to buy up and develop real estate in the former east german states , but when the scheme ended ten years ago , the housing market collapsed from properties that wound up being overvalued . “ this was the only time that the bubble burst in germany , ” said beyerle . since property values in the rest of germany have remained fairly steady , even in prime locations near major urban centers such as munich , frankfurt , stuttgart , hamburg or cologne , speculation fever never caught on in germany , he added . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : even in prime urban areas , prices have not skyrocketed “ the us housing market was based on the premise that home values had no where to go but up and would keep rising very rapidly .
then when it got bad , the whole pack of cards crumbled , ” said kempson .
she cited a world bank report which indicated that as much as 20 percent of all mortgages in the us are in the sub-prime category . loans without income verification in us in the uk , five percent of the mortgage market is sub-prime , but those with impaired credit histories might be marginal bank risks , such as students or those who have a perspective of future employment that would enable them to pay back their bank loans . not so in the us , where unlicensed mortgage brokers targeted low income groups who never would have been able to borrow from more conventional banks , said kempson . “ these brokers were aggressively selling “ discounted ” packages to those surviving on social security , ” she said .
kempson added that as much as 40 percent of the loans were made without any income verification , which is much less likely to happen in europe . following a short period of loans made at fixed low rates , borrowers with “ sub-prime bargains ” found their mortgages being reset at double-digit rates .
then when soaring us housing prices started to plunge , borrowers were saddled with sub-prime mortgages that exceeded the value of their homes and couldn ’ t refinance their way out of debt , said kempson . a nation of renters bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : younger home buyers with no capital shop for best rates achim duebel , a mortgage sector expert based in berlin , said the problem with sub-prime mortgages doesn ’ t exist in germany since it is largely a nation of renters . “ every sub-prime borrower here is a renter ” , he said . but duebel added that younger germans are looking at more innovative ways to invest in property . “ the mortgage market is not as dull and boring as it looks in germany , ” he said , explaining that most germans still take out traditional mortgages at their local bank , but there is a growing number of marginal , but not sub-prime borrowers - those with no capital , but strong cash flow , such as the self-employed or freelancers , who can find mortgage brokers offering packages that require little or even no financing . “ there is cutthroat competition out there , a younger generation that wants to shop for the best rates , the best deals , so this is giving the entire mortgage market a push , ” said duebel . diana fong send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

real estate investments are viewed either as a source of steady rental income or a way to reduce one ’ s tax burden . bubble burst only once beyerle explained that after german reunification in the 1990s , the government provided tax incentives for investors to buy up and develop real estate in the former east german states , but when the scheme ended ten years ago , the housing market collapsed from properties that wound up being overvalued . “ this was the only time that the bubble burst in germany , ” said beyerle . since property values in the rest of germany have remained fairly steady , even in prime locations near major urban centers such as munich , frankfurt , stuttgart , hamburg or cologne , speculation fever never caught on in germany , he added . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : even in prime urban areas , prices have not skyrocketed “ the us housing market was based on the premise that home values had no where to go but up and would keep rising very rapidly .
then when it got bad , the whole pack of cards crumbled , ” said kempson .
she cited a world bank report which indicated that as much as 20 percent of all mortgages in the us are in the sub-prime category . loans without income verification in us in the uk , five percent of the mortgage market is sub-prime , but those with impaired credit histories might be marginal bank risks , such as students or those who have a perspective of future employment that would enable them to pay back their bank loans . not so in the us , where unlicensed mortgage brokers targeted low income groups who never would have been able to borrow from more conventional banks , said kempson . “ these brokers were aggressively selling “ discounted ” packages to those surviving on social security , ” she said .
kempson added that as much as 40 percent of the loans were made without any income verification , which is much less likely to happen in europe . following a short period of loans made at fixed low rates , borrowers with “ sub-prime bargains ” found their mortgages being reset at double-digit rates .
then when soaring us housing prices started to plunge , borrowers were saddled with sub-prime mortgages that exceeded the value of their homes and couldn ’ t refinance their way out of debt , said kempson . a nation of renters bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : younger home buyers with no capital shop for best rates achim duebel , a mortgage sector expert based in berlin , said the problem with sub-prime mortgages doesn ’ t exist in germany since it is largely a nation of renters . “ every sub-prime borrower here is a renter ” , he said . but duebel added that younger germans are looking at more innovative ways to invest in property . “ the mortgage market is not as dull and boring as it looks in germany , ” he said , explaining that most germans still take out traditional mortgages at their local bank , but there is a growing number of marginal , but not sub-prime borrowers - those with no capital , but strong cash flow , such as the self-employed or freelancers , who can find mortgage brokers offering packages that require little or even no financing . “ there is cutthroat competition out there , a younger generation that wants to shop for the best rates , the best deals , so this is giving the entire mortgage market a push , ” said duebel . diana fong send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

even co-host poland has expressed doubts about its feasibility . europe 's governing football body uefa is facing a dilemma .
nobody is questioning that the euro 2012 preparations in the ukraine and poland are in trouble , but the million dollar question is : what to do about it ? for the first time in the history of the organization , the right to host the showpiece of european football could be taken away or germany could be used to find some sort of compromise .
there are also those who are , even in the face of ever-growing evidence to the contrary , saying that everything will be fine . the uefa executive committee , which started its meeting in the five-star grand hotel in bordeaux earlier on thursday , is not only trying to save its own reputation , probably more importantly , it is trying to find a solution . another option shortly before the start of the two-day meeting the 13-member committee was presented with another possible alternative by the president of the polish football federation .
michal listkiewicz suggested on the website of a german newspaper that it might make sense to host the euro finals in ukraine and poland four years later and give the 2012 finals to another country . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : platini now says the award can be removed listkiewicz seems far from convinced his country will be ready in four years time .
the biggest problem : poor infrastructure and terrible traffic , he said . " if the european championships took place in 2016 , we would no problems about being ready then , " listkiewicz told die zeit online , the internet platform of the weekly newspaper . " but realistically we are looking at having no good roads in time for 2012 . " said listkiewicz .
" from gdansk -lrb- in poland -rrb- to donetsk -lrb- in the ukraine -rrb- is more than 1,500 kilometers -lrb- 930 miles -rrb- .
this is not like in austria and switzerland where everything lies close together . " moreover , he cast doubt on whether poland 's partners in ukraine will be up to the job . " if things do n't go well now , and uefa has another suggestion , then that would be in order , " he said . awaiting a progress report the german member of the executive committee , gerhard mayer-vorfelder said that he could not speculate what decision they would reach .
" it is completely open .
i do not want to say which way it will go . " already it seems certain that the unexpected decision taken 17 months ago by the uefa executive in cardiff to give the 2012 euro finals to ukraine and poland was - at best - premature .
inadequate stadiums , problems with the transport system and not enough hotel beds has given rise to serious concerns and pushed uefa into a corner . mayer-vorfelder admits that the decision in april 2007 was not only positive .
" it was a unique situation .
we wanted to include east europe and there was only one other country bidding , italy .
they had their own problems and could not really be rewarded . " a long-awaited progress report on the ability of poland and ukraine to host the finals in four years ' time is expected to criticize the two nations , but stop short of recommending that uefa withdraw their right to host the tournament .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : uefa will decide how many teams can compete in 2012 in the event that the report is completely negative , spain seems to have the best chance of replacing ukraine and poland , while a possible germany-poland scenario , with games in berlin and leipzig , seems little more than a rumor . it could well be that the executive decides in bordeaux to wait a bit longer - after all , in 2011 there will be uefa presidential elections and the french president of the organization , michel platini , will need east european votes to be re-elected . dpa news agency -lrb- mrm -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de immigration -pipe- 25.09.2008 eu agrees new guidelines on immigration großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the new eu blue card is meant to work like the american green card the european union 's interior ministers agreed thursday on common principles guiding the way member states manage the influx of non-eu nationals .
but a blue card scheme for skilled migrants is still on hold . the immigration and asylum pact , which is due to be formally adopted by eu leaders at their october 15-16 summit , seeks to improve the management of legal immigration , tighten controls on illegal immigrants and construct a common asylum policy .
" the aim of the pact is to avoid the two obvious potential pitfalls : the creation of a european fortress , and the total opening up to illegal immigration , " said french interior minister brice hortefeux , who was chairing the interior ministers ' meeting .
but critics argue that the final , watered-down version agreed by ministers in brussels on thursday is ineffective and gives too great a voice to national governments .
for instance , the pact calls on eu countries to attract more highly skilled workers from outside the bloc .
but it leaves governments with the power to decide who and how many of them should be admitted in their own countries .
the czech republic is also currently holding up a deal on a new european " blue card " workers visa program .
eu officials say a single and simplified eu-wide working visa is needed to attract doctors , nurses , engineers and scientsists .
but interior minister ivan langer said the czechs would not agree to the plan until internal eu restrictions are lifted on the movement of workers from new member states .
germany , belgium , austria and denmark have not fully opened up their labor markets to workers from those eastern european countries who joined the bloc over the last few years .
hortefeux said he was nonetheless confident that the eu could overcome this obstacle by the end of the year .
the scheme will not , however , allow recipients to move around as freely as first envisaged .
tougher controls bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the eu is divided over how to respond to the iraqi refugee crisis the pact also calls on member states to tighten controls on illegal immigrants and improve the effectiveness of controls on the bloc 's external borders , for instance by sharing the fingerprints of incoming foreigners in a common database .
another proposal involves national authorities enacting expulsion orders made by another member state .
however , the eu 's border control agency , frontex , remains grossly underfunded , while there is little evidence that the mutual recognition of expulsion decisions is being implemented , according to a recent study by the centre for european policy studies , a brussels-based think tank .
meanwhile , plans for a common asylum policy are progressing slowly and are now not expected to come into force before 2012 .
highlighting the difficulties existing in this area , some member states have resisted calls by germany and sweden to share out some 10,000 highly vulnerable iraqi refugees among member states .
on thursday , ministers limited themselves to giving the green-light to a fact-finding mission to syria and jordan , where many displaced iraqis have fled after the toppling of former dictator saddam hussein .
the mission , which is to take place at the beginning of november , aims to identify those most in need of being granted asylum in europe . dw staff -lrb- mrm / jg -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

but there is little they can do . in mid-september , the government issued a statement confirming that " work by ministers of health and justice on a draft law on obligatory chemical castration for pedophiles was nearing completion . "
according to polish media reports , the ministry plans to make the treatment compulsory for repeat offenders .
the pills would reduce or eliminate sex drive by suppressing the production of testosterone .
" our idea does n't yet have the form of a law , " ministry spokesman jakub golab told the daily polska .
" we 're currently consulting with sexologists ...
we want to bring it into effect as soon as possible . "
in as little as one year , convicted pedophiles would also be fitted with electronic collars if they have a court order against going near their victims , polska reported .
if the collars are found effective , the ministry of justice will decide if they should be given to all pedophiles .
poland 's fritzl bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : donald tusk prime minister donald tusk raised the controversial topic after a 45-year-old man was charged with having raped and held his 21-year-old daughter captive for six years .
the suspect , dubbed poland 's josef fritzl in a reference to the austrian man accused of incarcerating his daughter and fathering seven children with her , faces up to 15 years behind bars if found guilty .
the woman in poland gave birth to two children , in 2005 and 2007 , allegedly from her father .
she maintains that he pressured her to give them up for adoption .
the case triggered a nationwide debate on how criminal sex offenders should be punished , with the liberal prime minister taking a draconian stance .
" i want to gather all the laws in operation across europe to introduce in poland the most rigorous law possible regarding criminals who rape children , " tusk said .
" i do not believe that we can call these individuals - these creatures - human beings , " he added .
" so in this case , we do n't need to discuss human rights . "
eu outrage bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the pills reduce libido chemical castration for repeat sex offenders is already offered in several us states , as well as european countries including sweden , germany and denmark .
however , it is a voluntary process .
human rights activists and legal experts have criticized the polish plans , saying that forcing a patient to undergo chemical castration was inadmissible according to both polish and international law .
but klaus haensch , a social democrat member of the european parliament , told spiegel online that brussels is powerless to intervene .
" it does not have the competence , because criminal law is decided at a national level , " he said .
" but i do not feel that enforced chemical castration is an appropriate punishment that can be reconciled with modern criminal law . "
christian democrat mep elmar brok agreed , telling spiegel online that it was not " a fitting solution . "
the plan also has detractors in poland .

but there is little they can do . in mid-september , the government issued a statement confirming that " work by ministers of health and justice on a draft law on obligatory chemical castration for pedophiles was nearing completion . "
according to polish media reports , the ministry plans to make the treatment compulsory for repeat offenders .
the pills would reduce or eliminate sex drive by suppressing the production of testosterone .
" our idea does n't yet have the form of a law , " ministry spokesman jakub golab told the daily polska .
" we 're currently consulting with sexologists ...
we want to bring it into effect as soon as possible . "
in as little as one year , convicted pedophiles would also be fitted with electronic collars if they have a court order against going near their victims , polska reported .
if the collars are found effective , the ministry of justice will decide if they should be given to all pedophiles .
poland 's fritzl bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : donald tusk prime minister donald tusk raised the controversial topic after a 45-year-old man was charged with having raped and held his 21-year-old daughter captive for six years .
the suspect , dubbed poland 's josef fritzl in a reference to the austrian man accused of incarcerating his daughter and fathering seven children with her , faces up to 15 years behind bars if found guilty .
the woman in poland gave birth to two children , in 2005 and 2007 , allegedly from her father .
she maintains that he pressured her to give them up for adoption .
the case triggered a nationwide debate on how criminal sex offenders should be punished , with the liberal prime minister taking a draconian stance .
" i want to gather all the laws in operation across europe to introduce in poland the most rigorous law possible regarding criminals who rape children , " tusk said .
" i do not believe that we can call these individuals - these creatures - human beings , " he added .
" so in this case , we do n't need to discuss human rights . "
eu outrage bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the pills reduce libido chemical castration for repeat sex offenders is already offered in several us states , as well as european countries including sweden , germany and denmark .
however , it is a voluntary process .
human rights activists and legal experts have criticized the polish plans , saying that forcing a patient to undergo chemical castration was inadmissible according to both polish and international law .
but klaus haensch , a social democrat member of the european parliament , told spiegel online that brussels is powerless to intervene .
" it does not have the competence , because criminal law is decided at a national level , " he said .
" but i do not feel that enforced chemical castration is an appropriate punishment that can be reconciled with modern criminal law . "
christian democrat mep elmar brok agreed , telling spiegel online that it was not " a fitting solution . "
the plan also has detractors in poland .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de banking -pipe- 25.09.2008 debt-averse germans unlikely to attract sub-prime trouble großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : it 's acceptable to go into debt to buy a house sub-prime mortgages are virtually unknown in germany since home ownership rates are relatively low .
germans tend to be debt-averse and are required to put down more equity in financing a home purchase . german politicians have criticized the us for failing to implement stringent controls on financial markets with many pointing out that the sub-prime mortgage crisis that felled wall street ’ s venerable financial institutions week could not happen in germany .
they may have a point . for one , experts say , the type of high risk lending practices that were exposed when the bubble burst in the us housing market a few years ago is more heavily regulated in germany . “ the sub-prime market is virtually non-existent , ” said elaine kempson , director of the personal finance research centre at the university of bristol . home ownership rates in germany are also among the lowest in europe - under 50 percent compared to around 70 percent in the us and the uk , said kempson , whose institute has done comparative studies in europe on personal credit risk and indebtedness . “ germans are much more conservative than americans and other europeans in terms of how much debt they are willing to take on , ” she said . larger down payments banks in germany also tend to have more stringent criteria in determining the creditworthiness of borrowers than their european or american counterparts . “ there is no such thing as zero financing on a home , ” said thomas beyerle , head of research at the degi , a frankfurt-based property investment company .
in germany , homeowners are required to make a down payment of at least 20 percent of the purchase price of a house to obtain a mortgage in the first place . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : foreclosures and defaulting on mortgage payments are far less common in germany michaela roth , spokesman of the german federation of savings and loan banks -lrb- dsgv -rrb- said it is not unusual to put down as much as 40 percent equity and finance the rest . “ germans generally are only prepared to be moderately indebted , ” she said .
even big ticket purchases such as a washing machine are paid for with hard cash or bank debit cards , with only five percent of consumers even bothering to use a credit card . mind-set averse to debt some say german financial prudence has its roots in the world wars , a period marked by acute economic hardship and suffering . “ the puritanical ethic of the war generation is still very much ingrained in germany today , ” said fabian christandl , a researcher at the institute for economic and social psychology at the university of cologne . germans work hard , put their cash in a savings account , earn a bit of interest and only take on debt for big investments , said christandl . “ a house is one of the very few purchases for which it ’ s viewed as acceptable to go into debt , ” he said . and homeowners who possess enough capital to invest in residential property beyond their own four walls are not interested in flipping over properties for quick profits either , said beyerle .
real estate investments are viewed either as a source of steady rental income or a way to reduce one ’ s tax burden . bubble burst only once beyerle explained that after german reunification in the 1990s , the government provided tax incentives for investors to buy up and develop real estate in the former east german states , but when the scheme ended ten years ago , the housing market collapsed from properties that wound up being overvalued . “ this was the only time that the bubble burst in germany , ” said beyerle . since property values in the rest of germany have remained fairly steady , even in prime locations near major urban centers such as munich , frankfurt , stuttgart , hamburg or cologne , speculation fever never caught on in germany , he added . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : even in prime urban areas , prices have not skyrocketed “ the us housing market was based on the premise that home values had no where to go but up and would keep rising very rapidly .
then when it got bad , the whole pack of cards crumbled , ” said kempson .
she cited a world bank report which indicated that as much as 20 percent of all mortgages in the us are in the sub-prime category . loans without income verification in us in the uk , five percent of the mortgage market is sub-prime , but those with impaired credit histories might be marginal bank risks , such as students or those who have a perspective of future employment that would enable them to pay back their bank loans . not so in the us , where unlicensed mortgage brokers targeted low income groups who never would have been able to borrow from more conventional banks , said kempson . “ these brokers were aggressively selling “ discounted ” packages to those surviving on social security , ” she said .
kempson added that as much as 40 percent of the loans were made without any income verification , which is much less likely to happen in europe . following a short period of loans made at fixed low rates , borrowers with “ sub-prime bargains ” found their mortgages being reset at double-digit rates .
then when soaring us housing prices started to plunge , borrowers were saddled with sub-prime mortgages that exceeded the value of their homes and couldn ’ t refinance their way out of debt , said kempson . a nation of renters bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : younger home buyers with no capital shop for best rates achim duebel , a mortgage sector expert based in berlin , said the problem with sub-prime mortgages doesn ’ t exist in germany since it is largely a nation of renters . “ every sub-prime borrower here is a renter ” , he said . but duebel added that younger germans are looking at more innovative ways to invest in property . “ the mortgage market is not as dull and boring as it looks in germany , ” he said , explaining that most germans still take out traditional mortgages at their local bank , but there is a growing number of marginal , but not sub-prime borrowers - those with no capital , but strong cash flow , such as the self-employed or freelancers , who can find mortgage brokers offering packages that require little or even no financing . “ there is cutthroat competition out there , a younger generation that wants to shop for the best rates , the best deals , so this is giving the entire mortgage market a push , ” said duebel . diana fong send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de soccer -pipe- 25.09.2008 euro 2012 decision looms amid doubt großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : poland and ukraine celebrated the euro 2102 award in 2007 european soccer 's governing body is meeting to debate if the 2012 european championships can really be held in poland and ukraine .
even co-host poland has expressed doubts about its feasibility . europe 's governing football body uefa is facing a dilemma .
nobody is questioning that the euro 2012 preparations in the ukraine and poland are in trouble , but the million dollar question is : what to do about it ? for the first time in the history of the organization , the right to host the showpiece of european football could be taken away or germany could be used to find some sort of compromise .
there are also those who are , even in the face of ever-growing evidence to the contrary , saying that everything will be fine . the uefa executive committee , which started its meeting in the five-star grand hotel in bordeaux earlier on thursday , is not only trying to save its own reputation , probably more importantly , it is trying to find a solution . another option shortly before the start of the two-day meeting the 13-member committee was presented with another possible alternative by the president of the polish football federation .
michal listkiewicz suggested on the website of a german newspaper that it might make sense to host the euro finals in ukraine and poland four years later and give the 2012 finals to another country . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : platini now says the award can be removed listkiewicz seems far from convinced his country will be ready in four years time .
the biggest problem : poor infrastructure and terrible traffic , he said . " if the european championships took place in 2016 , we would no problems about being ready then , " listkiewicz told die zeit online , the internet platform of the weekly newspaper . " but realistically we are looking at having no good roads in time for 2012 . " said listkiewicz .
" from gdansk -lrb- in poland -rrb- to donetsk -lrb- in the ukraine -rrb- is more than 1,500 kilometers -lrb- 930 miles -rrb- .
this is not like in austria and switzerland where everything lies close together . " moreover , he cast doubt on whether poland 's partners in ukraine will be up to the job . " if things do n't go well now , and uefa has another suggestion , then that would be in order , " he said . awaiting a progress report the german member of the executive committee , gerhard mayer-vorfelder said that he could not speculate what decision they would reach .
" it is completely open .
i do not want to say which way it will go . " already it seems certain that the unexpected decision taken 17 months ago by the uefa executive in cardiff to give the 2012 euro finals to ukraine and poland was - at best - premature .
inadequate stadiums , problems with the transport system and not enough hotel beds has given rise to serious concerns and pushed uefa into a corner . mayer-vorfelder admits that the decision in april 2007 was not only positive .
" it was a unique situation .
we wanted to include east europe and there was only one other country bidding , italy .
they had their own problems and could not really be rewarded . " a long-awaited progress report on the ability of poland and ukraine to host the finals in four years ' time is expected to criticize the two nations , but stop short of recommending that uefa withdraw their right to host the tournament .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : uefa will decide how many teams can compete in 2012 in the event that the report is completely negative , spain seems to have the best chance of replacing ukraine and poland , while a possible germany-poland scenario , with games in berlin and leipzig , seems little more than a rumor . it could well be that the executive decides in bordeaux to wait a bit longer - after all , in 2011 there will be uefa presidential elections and the french president of the organization , michel platini , will need east european votes to be re-elected . dpa news agency -lrb- mrm -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

this is not like in austria and switzerland where everything lies close together . " moreover , he cast doubt on whether poland 's partners in ukraine will be up to the job . " if things do n't go well now , and uefa has another suggestion , then that would be in order , " he said . awaiting a progress report the german member of the executive committee , gerhard mayer-vorfelder said that he could not speculate what decision they would reach .
" it is completely open .
i do not want to say which way it will go . " already it seems certain that the unexpected decision taken 17 months ago by the uefa executive in cardiff to give the 2012 euro finals to ukraine and poland was - at best - premature .
inadequate stadiums , problems with the transport system and not enough hotel beds has given rise to serious concerns and pushed uefa into a corner . mayer-vorfelder admits that the decision in april 2007 was not only positive .
" it was a unique situation .
we wanted to include east europe and there was only one other country bidding , italy .
they had their own problems and could not really be rewarded . " a long-awaited progress report on the ability of poland and ukraine to host the finals in four years ' time is expected to criticize the two nations , but stop short of recommending that uefa withdraw their right to host the tournament .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : uefa will decide how many teams can compete in 2012 in the event that the report is completely negative , spain seems to have the best chance of replacing ukraine and poland , while a possible germany-poland scenario , with games in berlin and leipzig , seems little more than a rumor . it could well be that the executive decides in bordeaux to wait a bit longer - after all , in 2011 there will be uefa presidential elections and the french president of the organization , michel platini , will need east european votes to be re-elected . dpa news agency -lrb- mrm -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

"
conducted by omer welber , the istanbul philharmonic and the ra 'anana symphonette accompanied israeli virtuoso shlomo mintz , yair dalal and turkey 's cihat askin as they played sixteen violins that had outlasted the holocaust .
the concert was part of this year 's celebrations marking israel 's 60th anniversary .

weinstein said he received the instruments in various states of disrepair , many of them decorated with stars of david carved into the woodwork , a testimony to their former jewish owners .
" by restoring their violins , their legacy is born again , " said weinstein , who lost most of his family in the holocaust .
most of them were found in attics and cellars , where they had spent the last few decades gathering dust .

his name was motele , and he had joined the resistance in a village near the border with ukraine and managed to infiltrate a nazi building there .
" the german officers heard him play in the streets one day and later brought him to perform every night in their compound in town , " said sefi hanegbi , whose father played alongside motele in a partisan camp in a forest during world war two .
after each performance , motele would hide his violin in the building and walk out with an empty case .
he would return with the violin case full of explosives , stuffing them into cracks in the walls , and eventually setting them off , hanegbi said .

he stressed that german banks can cope with losses . " wall street and the world will never again be the way they were before the crisis , " said steinbrueck in a speech to the german parliament , the bundestag , on thursday , sept .

write-downs and write-offs of bad credit spawned by " a blind drive for double-digit profits " have so far totaled $ 550 billion and no end to the crisis is in sight , he added .
the world financial system will consequently become more " multi-polar , " he predicted .
steinbrueck told the bundestag that the group of seven -lrb- g7 -rrb- finance ministers would be meeting in washington next month to discuss how to tighten regulation of capital markets .
the german federal government , meanwhile , would continue efforts to trim spending , but would also make some moves to stimulate the economy .
he reiterated germany 's refusal to set up its own bank bail-out scheme , saying the crisis was principally a us problem .
irresponsible moves bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : steinbrueck did n't pull his punches during the bundestag speech reiterating berlin 's push for tighter regulation , steinbrueck accused the us of blunders .
" the cause of the crisis was the irresponsible exaggeration of the principle of a free , unrestrained market , " he told the bundestag .
washington has been reluctant to increase minimum equity rules and has too many competing regulators over us investment banks .
" this system , which in many ways is inadequately regulated , is now collapsing , " he said , adding that germany 's banking system remained " relatively robust , " with german regulators confident they can absorb losses .
" new rules of the road " for the financial markets were needed , he said .
plans to be debated when the finance ministers of the g7 meet will include tightening cooperation between the international monetary fund -lrb- imf -rrb- and the financial stability forum -lrb- fsf -rrb- .
the agencies were created by western nations as an early warning system .
strengthening cooperation bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the german landesbanken need to pull together steinbrueck also renewed his call for fusion across germany 's state bank sector .
the country 's big commercial lenders , the so-called " landesbanken , " have been hard hit by the financial crisis . the next move needs to be made by the individual states , as co-owners of the leading state banks , said the social democrat minister : " they need to overcome regional political pride and embrace pan-regional co-operation . "
this , he said , would strengthen the german banking system and boost its sustainability .
" financial support from the government in mopping up problems in this sector should not be expected , " he added . given that past attempts to fuse the " landesbanken " have failed , steinbrueck proposed a redefinition of their business models in order to avoid excessive risk and to increase returns .

the suspect , dubbed poland 's josef fritzl in a reference to the austrian man accused of incarcerating his daughter and fathering seven children with her , faces up to 15 years behind bars if found guilty .
the woman in poland gave birth to two children , in 2005 and 2007 , allegedly from her father .

the case triggered a nationwide debate on how criminal sex offenders should be punished , with the liberal prime minister taking a draconian stance .

chancellor merkel 's call for greater transparency and regulation is not what the problem demands with regard to the failings of the financial markets .
the problem is rooted in the insistence by eu governments with regard to fractional reserve banking .
this enables vast amounts of credit to be made available and the ecb to back up any shortfall in bank reserves by placing the burden on tax payers and property owners .
to do what is necessary will necessitate the abandoning of the so-called social-market economy .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de immigration -pipe- 25.09.2008 eu agrees new guidelines on immigration großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the new eu blue card is meant to work like the american green card the european union 's interior ministers agreed thursday on common principles guiding the way member states manage the influx of non-eu nationals .
but a blue card scheme for skilled migrants is still on hold . the immigration and asylum pact , which is due to be formally adopted by eu leaders at their october 15-16 summit , seeks to improve the management of legal immigration , tighten controls on illegal immigrants and construct a common asylum policy .
" the aim of the pact is to avoid the two obvious potential pitfalls : the creation of a european fortress , and the total opening up to illegal immigration , " said french interior minister brice hortefeux , who was chairing the interior ministers ' meeting .
but critics argue that the final , watered-down version agreed by ministers in brussels on thursday is ineffective and gives too great a voice to national governments .
for instance , the pact calls on eu countries to attract more highly skilled workers from outside the bloc .
but it leaves governments with the power to decide who and how many of them should be admitted in their own countries .
the czech republic is also currently holding up a deal on a new european " blue card " workers visa program .
eu officials say a single and simplified eu-wide working visa is needed to attract doctors , nurses , engineers and scientsists .
but interior minister ivan langer said the czechs would not agree to the plan until internal eu restrictions are lifted on the movement of workers from new member states .
germany , belgium , austria and denmark have not fully opened up their labor markets to workers from those eastern european countries who joined the bloc over the last few years .
hortefeux said he was nonetheless confident that the eu could overcome this obstacle by the end of the year .
the scheme will not , however , allow recipients to move around as freely as first envisaged .
tougher controls bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the eu is divided over how to respond to the iraqi refugee crisis the pact also calls on member states to tighten controls on illegal immigrants and improve the effectiveness of controls on the bloc 's external borders , for instance by sharing the fingerprints of incoming foreigners in a common database .
another proposal involves national authorities enacting expulsion orders made by another member state .
however , the eu 's border control agency , frontex , remains grossly underfunded , while there is little evidence that the mutual recognition of expulsion decisions is being implemented , according to a recent study by the centre for european policy studies , a brussels-based think tank .
meanwhile , plans for a common asylum policy are progressing slowly and are now not expected to come into force before 2012 .
highlighting the difficulties existing in this area , some member states have resisted calls by germany and sweden to share out some 10,000 highly vulnerable iraqi refugees among member states .
on thursday , ministers limited themselves to giving the green-light to a fact-finding mission to syria and jordan , where many displaced iraqis have fled after the toppling of former dictator saddam hussein .
the mission , which is to take place at the beginning of november , aims to identify those most in need of being granted asylum in europe . dw staff -lrb- mrm / jg -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de banking -pipe- 25.09.2008 debt-averse germans unlikely to attract sub-prime trouble großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : it 's acceptable to go into debt to buy a house sub-prime mortgages are virtually unknown in germany since home ownership rates are relatively low .
germans tend to be debt-averse and are required to put down more equity in financing a home purchase . german politicians have criticized the us for failing to implement stringent controls on financial markets with many pointing out that the sub-prime mortgage crisis that felled wall street ’ s venerable financial institutions week could not happen in germany .
they may have a point . for one , experts say , the type of high risk lending practices that were exposed when the bubble burst in the us housing market a few years ago is more heavily regulated in germany . “ the sub-prime market is virtually non-existent , ” said elaine kempson , director of the personal finance research centre at the university of bristol . home ownership rates in germany are also among the lowest in europe - under 50 percent compared to around 70 percent in the us and the uk , said kempson , whose institute has done comparative studies in europe on personal credit risk and indebtedness . “ germans are much more conservative than americans and other europeans in terms of how much debt they are willing to take on , ” she said . larger down payments banks in germany also tend to have more stringent criteria in determining the creditworthiness of borrowers than their european or american counterparts . “ there is no such thing as zero financing on a home , ” said thomas beyerle , head of research at the degi , a frankfurt-based property investment company .
in germany , homeowners are required to make a down payment of at least 20 percent of the purchase price of a house to obtain a mortgage in the first place . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : foreclosures and defaulting on mortgage payments are far less common in germany michaela roth , spokesman of the german federation of savings and loan banks -lrb- dsgv -rrb- said it is not unusual to put down as much as 40 percent equity and finance the rest . “ germans generally are only prepared to be moderately indebted , ” she said .
even big ticket purchases such as a washing machine are paid for with hard cash or bank debit cards , with only five percent of consumers even bothering to use a credit card . mind-set averse to debt some say german financial prudence has its roots in the world wars , a period marked by acute economic hardship and suffering . “ the puritanical ethic of the war generation is still very much ingrained in germany today , ” said fabian christandl , a researcher at the institute for economic and social psychology at the university of cologne . germans work hard , put their cash in a savings account , earn a bit of interest and only take on debt for big investments , said christandl . “ a house is one of the very few purchases for which it ’ s viewed as acceptable to go into debt , ” he said . and homeowners who possess enough capital to invest in residential property beyond their own four walls are not interested in flipping over properties for quick profits either , said beyerle .
real estate investments are viewed either as a source of steady rental income or a way to reduce one ’ s tax burden . bubble burst only once beyerle explained that after german reunification in the 1990s , the government provided tax incentives for investors to buy up and develop real estate in the former east german states , but when the scheme ended ten years ago , the housing market collapsed from properties that wound up being overvalued . “ this was the only time that the bubble burst in germany , ” said beyerle . since property values in the rest of germany have remained fairly steady , even in prime locations near major urban centers such as munich , frankfurt , stuttgart , hamburg or cologne , speculation fever never caught on in germany , he added . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : even in prime urban areas , prices have not skyrocketed “ the us housing market was based on the premise that home values had no where to go but up and would keep rising very rapidly .
then when it got bad , the whole pack of cards crumbled , ” said kempson .
she cited a world bank report which indicated that as much as 20 percent of all mortgages in the us are in the sub-prime category . loans without income verification in us in the uk , five percent of the mortgage market is sub-prime , but those with impaired credit histories might be marginal bank risks , such as students or those who have a perspective of future employment that would enable them to pay back their bank loans . not so in the us , where unlicensed mortgage brokers targeted low income groups who never would have been able to borrow from more conventional banks , said kempson . “ these brokers were aggressively selling “ discounted ” packages to those surviving on social security , ” she said .
kempson added that as much as 40 percent of the loans were made without any income verification , which is much less likely to happen in europe . following a short period of loans made at fixed low rates , borrowers with “ sub-prime bargains ” found their mortgages being reset at double-digit rates .
then when soaring us housing prices started to plunge , borrowers were saddled with sub-prime mortgages that exceeded the value of their homes and couldn ’ t refinance their way out of debt , said kempson . a nation of renters bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : younger home buyers with no capital shop for best rates achim duebel , a mortgage sector expert based in berlin , said the problem with sub-prime mortgages doesn ’ t exist in germany since it is largely a nation of renters . “ every sub-prime borrower here is a renter ” , he said . but duebel added that younger germans are looking at more innovative ways to invest in property . “ the mortgage market is not as dull and boring as it looks in germany , ” he said , explaining that most germans still take out traditional mortgages at their local bank , but there is a growing number of marginal , but not sub-prime borrowers - those with no capital , but strong cash flow , such as the self-employed or freelancers , who can find mortgage brokers offering packages that require little or even no financing . “ there is cutthroat competition out there , a younger generation that wants to shop for the best rates , the best deals , so this is giving the entire mortgage market a push , ” said duebel . diana fong send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

germans tend to be debt-averse and are required to put down more equity in financing a home purchase . german politicians have criticized the us for failing to implement stringent controls on financial markets with many pointing out that the sub-prime mortgage crisis that felled wall street ’ s venerable financial institutions week could not happen in germany .
they may have a point . for one , experts say , the type of high risk lending practices that were exposed when the bubble burst in the us housing market a few years ago is more heavily regulated in germany . “ the sub-prime market is virtually non-existent , ” said elaine kempson , director of the personal finance research centre at the university of bristol . home ownership rates in germany are also among the lowest in europe - under 50 percent compared to around 70 percent in the us and the uk , said kempson , whose institute has done comparative studies in europe on personal credit risk and indebtedness . “ germans are much more conservative than americans and other europeans in terms of how much debt they are willing to take on , ” she said . larger down payments banks in germany also tend to have more stringent criteria in determining the creditworthiness of borrowers than their european or american counterparts . “ there is no such thing as zero financing on a home , ” said thomas beyerle , head of research at the degi , a frankfurt-based property investment company .
in germany , homeowners are required to make a down payment of at least 20 percent of the purchase price of a house to obtain a mortgage in the first place . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : foreclosures and defaulting on mortgage payments are far less common in germany michaela roth , spokesman of the german federation of savings and loan banks -lrb- dsgv -rrb- said it is not unusual to put down as much as 40 percent equity and finance the rest . “ germans generally are only prepared to be moderately indebted , ” she said .
even big ticket purchases such as a washing machine are paid for with hard cash or bank debit cards , with only five percent of consumers even bothering to use a credit card . mind-set averse to debt some say german financial prudence has its roots in the world wars , a period marked by acute economic hardship and suffering . “ the puritanical ethic of the war generation is still very much ingrained in germany today , ” said fabian christandl , a researcher at the institute for economic and social psychology at the university of cologne . germans work hard , put their cash in a savings account , earn a bit of interest and only take on debt for big investments , said christandl . “ a house is one of the very few purchases for which it ’ s viewed as acceptable to go into debt , ” he said . and homeowners who possess enough capital to invest in residential property beyond their own four walls are not interested in flipping over properties for quick profits either , said beyerle .
real estate investments are viewed either as a source of steady rental income or a way to reduce one ’ s tax burden . bubble burst only once beyerle explained that after german reunification in the 1990s , the government provided tax incentives for investors to buy up and develop real estate in the former east german states , but when the scheme ended ten years ago , the housing market collapsed from properties that wound up being overvalued . “ this was the only time that the bubble burst in germany , ” said beyerle . since property values in the rest of germany have remained fairly steady , even in prime locations near major urban centers such as munich , frankfurt , stuttgart , hamburg or cologne , speculation fever never caught on in germany , he added . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : even in prime urban areas , prices have not skyrocketed “ the us housing market was based on the premise that home values had no where to go but up and would keep rising very rapidly .
then when it got bad , the whole pack of cards crumbled , ” said kempson .
she cited a world bank report which indicated that as much as 20 percent of all mortgages in the us are in the sub-prime category . loans without income verification in us in the uk , five percent of the mortgage market is sub-prime , but those with impaired credit histories might be marginal bank risks , such as students or those who have a perspective of future employment that would enable them to pay back their bank loans . not so in the us , where unlicensed mortgage brokers targeted low income groups who never would have been able to borrow from more conventional banks , said kempson . “ these brokers were aggressively selling “ discounted ” packages to those surviving on social security , ” she said .
kempson added that as much as 40 percent of the loans were made without any income verification , which is much less likely to happen in europe . following a short period of loans made at fixed low rates , borrowers with “ sub-prime bargains ” found their mortgages being reset at double-digit rates .
then when soaring us housing prices started to plunge , borrowers were saddled with sub-prime mortgages that exceeded the value of their homes and couldn ’ t refinance their way out of debt , said kempson . a nation of renters bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : younger home buyers with no capital shop for best rates achim duebel , a mortgage sector expert based in berlin , said the problem with sub-prime mortgages doesn ’ t exist in germany since it is largely a nation of renters . “ every sub-prime borrower here is a renter ” , he said . but duebel added that younger germans are looking at more innovative ways to invest in property . “ the mortgage market is not as dull and boring as it looks in germany , ” he said , explaining that most germans still take out traditional mortgages at their local bank , but there is a growing number of marginal , but not sub-prime borrowers - those with no capital , but strong cash flow , such as the self-employed or freelancers , who can find mortgage brokers offering packages that require little or even no financing . “ there is cutthroat competition out there , a younger generation that wants to shop for the best rates , the best deals , so this is giving the entire mortgage market a push , ” said duebel . diana fong send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de immigration -pipe- 25.09.2008 eu agrees new guidelines on immigration großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the new eu blue card is meant to work like the american green card the european union 's interior ministers agreed thursday on common principles guiding the way member states manage the influx of non-eu nationals .
but a blue card scheme for skilled migrants is still on hold . the immigration and asylum pact , which is due to be formally adopted by eu leaders at their october 15-16 summit , seeks to improve the management of legal immigration , tighten controls on illegal immigrants and construct a common asylum policy .
" the aim of the pact is to avoid the two obvious potential pitfalls : the creation of a european fortress , and the total opening up to illegal immigration , " said french interior minister brice hortefeux , who was chairing the interior ministers ' meeting .
but critics argue that the final , watered-down version agreed by ministers in brussels on thursday is ineffective and gives too great a voice to national governments .
for instance , the pact calls on eu countries to attract more highly skilled workers from outside the bloc .
but it leaves governments with the power to decide who and how many of them should be admitted in their own countries .
the czech republic is also currently holding up a deal on a new european " blue card " workers visa program .
eu officials say a single and simplified eu-wide working visa is needed to attract doctors , nurses , engineers and scientsists .
but interior minister ivan langer said the czechs would not agree to the plan until internal eu restrictions are lifted on the movement of workers from new member states .
germany , belgium , austria and denmark have not fully opened up their labor markets to workers from those eastern european countries who joined the bloc over the last few years .
hortefeux said he was nonetheless confident that the eu could overcome this obstacle by the end of the year .
the scheme will not , however , allow recipients to move around as freely as first envisaged .
tougher controls bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the eu is divided over how to respond to the iraqi refugee crisis the pact also calls on member states to tighten controls on illegal immigrants and improve the effectiveness of controls on the bloc 's external borders , for instance by sharing the fingerprints of incoming foreigners in a common database .
another proposal involves national authorities enacting expulsion orders made by another member state .
however , the eu 's border control agency , frontex , remains grossly underfunded , while there is little evidence that the mutual recognition of expulsion decisions is being implemented , according to a recent study by the centre for european policy studies , a brussels-based think tank .
meanwhile , plans for a common asylum policy are progressing slowly and are now not expected to come into force before 2012 .
highlighting the difficulties existing in this area , some member states have resisted calls by germany and sweden to share out some 10,000 highly vulnerable iraqi refugees among member states .
on thursday , ministers limited themselves to giving the green-light to a fact-finding mission to syria and jordan , where many displaced iraqis have fled after the toppling of former dictator saddam hussein .
the mission , which is to take place at the beginning of november , aims to identify those most in need of being granted asylum in europe . dw staff -lrb- mrm / jg -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de immigration -pipe- 25.09.2008 eu agrees new guidelines on immigration großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the new eu blue card is meant to work like the american green card the european union 's interior ministers agreed thursday on common principles guiding the way member states manage the influx of non-eu nationals .
but a blue card scheme for skilled migrants is still on hold . the immigration and asylum pact , which is due to be formally adopted by eu leaders at their october 15-16 summit , seeks to improve the management of legal immigration , tighten controls on illegal immigrants and construct a common asylum policy .
" the aim of the pact is to avoid the two obvious potential pitfalls : the creation of a european fortress , and the total opening up to illegal immigration , " said french interior minister brice hortefeux , who was chairing the interior ministers ' meeting .
but critics argue that the final , watered-down version agreed by ministers in brussels on thursday is ineffective and gives too great a voice to national governments .
for instance , the pact calls on eu countries to attract more highly skilled workers from outside the bloc .
but it leaves governments with the power to decide who and how many of them should be admitted in their own countries .
the czech republic is also currently holding up a deal on a new european " blue card " workers visa program .
eu officials say a single and simplified eu-wide working visa is needed to attract doctors , nurses , engineers and scientsists .
but interior minister ivan langer said the czechs would not agree to the plan until internal eu restrictions are lifted on the movement of workers from new member states .
germany , belgium , austria and denmark have not fully opened up their labor markets to workers from those eastern european countries who joined the bloc over the last few years .
hortefeux said he was nonetheless confident that the eu could overcome this obstacle by the end of the year .
the scheme will not , however , allow recipients to move around as freely as first envisaged .
tougher controls bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the eu is divided over how to respond to the iraqi refugee crisis the pact also calls on member states to tighten controls on illegal immigrants and improve the effectiveness of controls on the bloc 's external borders , for instance by sharing the fingerprints of incoming foreigners in a common database .
another proposal involves national authorities enacting expulsion orders made by another member state .
however , the eu 's border control agency , frontex , remains grossly underfunded , while there is little evidence that the mutual recognition of expulsion decisions is being implemented , according to a recent study by the centre for european policy studies , a brussels-based think tank .
meanwhile , plans for a common asylum policy are progressing slowly and are now not expected to come into force before 2012 .
highlighting the difficulties existing in this area , some member states have resisted calls by germany and sweden to share out some 10,000 highly vulnerable iraqi refugees among member states .
on thursday , ministers limited themselves to giving the green-light to a fact-finding mission to syria and jordan , where many displaced iraqis have fled after the toppling of former dictator saddam hussein .
the mission , which is to take place at the beginning of november , aims to identify those most in need of being granted asylum in europe . dw staff -lrb- mrm / jg -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

german broadcaster zdf had reported that western intelligence services now have indications that breininger , a convert to islam , had returned to europe , and possibly germany , and was trying to procure explosives .
but a spokesman said there was no concrete evidence breininger was plotting an actual attack .
police said , however , that breininger , who is from the state of saarland in western germany , had recorded an internet video in august in which he spoke of carrying out a suicide attack and supported jihad or holy war .
the federal crime office -lrb- bka -rrb- showed photos of the two men on its web page listing the most wanted suspects in the country .
both men are suspected of links to the islamic jihad union -lrb- iju -rrb- , which is affiliated with al qaeda and investigators say was behind a major bomb plot in germany that they thwarted last september .
its targets included frankfurt airport and the us base of ramstein . dw staff -lrb- jg -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

elser was arrested , tortured and murdered at dachau by the nazis six years later .
the bust of elser was put up at private expense on a riverside near the interior ministry in berlin on wednesday , sept .
24 .
a plaque in his memory was put up several years ago in his hometown , koenigsbronn , in south-western germany .
elser , a wood joiner of strongly anti-nazi views , planted the bomb alone in a bid to stop the war .
the german resistance memorial movement said the bombing and a bomb set by colonel claus von stauffenberg in 1944 , which slightly wounded hitler , were the only assassination attempts that ever put hitler in danger .
a foundation established by a businessman , ernst freiberger , paid for the bust .
over decades , germany has only gradually come around to viewing the would-be assassins as heroes .
a film , valkyrie , set for us release in december , will depict the 1944 plot with tom cruise playing stauffenberg . dpa news agency -lrb- kjb -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" the aim of the pact is to avoid the two obvious potential pitfalls : the creation of a european fortress , and the total opening up to illegal immigration , " said french interior minister brice hortefeux , who was chairing the interior ministers ' meeting .
but critics argue that the final , watered-down version agreed by ministers in brussels on thursday is ineffective and gives too great a voice to national governments .
for instance , the pact calls on eu countries to attract more highly skilled workers from outside the bloc .
but it leaves governments with the power to decide who and how many of them should be admitted in their own countries .
the czech republic is also currently holding up a deal on a new european " blue card " workers visa program .
eu officials say a single and simplified eu-wide working visa is needed to attract doctors , nurses , engineers and scientsists .
but interior minister ivan langer said the czechs would not agree to the plan until internal eu restrictions are lifted on the movement of workers from new member states .
germany , belgium , austria and denmark have not fully opened up their labor markets to workers from those eastern european countries who joined the bloc over the last few years .
hortefeux said he was nonetheless confident that the eu could overcome this obstacle by the end of the year .
the scheme will not , however , allow recipients to move around as freely as first envisaged .
tougher controls bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the eu is divided over how to respond to the iraqi refugee crisis the pact also calls on member states to tighten controls on illegal immigrants and improve the effectiveness of controls on the bloc 's external borders , for instance by sharing the fingerprints of incoming foreigners in a common database .
another proposal involves national authorities enacting expulsion orders made by another member state .
however , the eu 's border control agency , frontex , remains grossly underfunded , while there is little evidence that the mutual recognition of expulsion decisions is being implemented , according to a recent study by the centre for european policy studies , a brussels-based think tank .
meanwhile , plans for a common asylum policy are progressing slowly and are now not expected to come into force before 2012 .
highlighting the difficulties existing in this area , some member states have resisted calls by germany and sweden to share out some 10,000 highly vulnerable iraqi refugees among member states .
on thursday , ministers limited themselves to giving the green-light to a fact-finding mission to syria and jordan , where many displaced iraqis have fled after the toppling of former dictator saddam hussein .
the mission , which is to take place at the beginning of november , aims to identify those most in need of being granted asylum in europe . dw staff -lrb- mrm / jg -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

schools close due to action hopes for quick end to pay dispute hundreds march at pay rally up to 150,000 council staff in scotland have staged the second 24-hour strike over pay in two months .
schools , ferry services and rubbish collections were disrupted as members of the unite , unison and gmb unions took part in the action .
it comes after the rejection of an amended offer from local authority umbrella group cosla to change the 2.5 % pay offer from three years to one year .
the unions are calling for a 5 % increase in line with inflation .
matt smith , unison 's scottish secretary , said he was impressed by the turnout for the strike and threatened more industrial action if the dispute continued .

he said : " attitudes have hardened on behalf of the unions since last month 's day of action because our members feel really let down by the employers .
there is not a penny more on the table , despite their public recognition of the need to reconsider the offer . "
a spokesman from cosla said the strike was " disappointing . "
he said : " striking is not the way to resolve this .
as employers we are always willing to talk , we want to settle this dispute , but there must be a reality check .
" the time has come for the unions to be more realistic in their demands . "
the scottish government said it had urged both sides to settle the dispute .
' level of disruption ' a spokesman said : " throughout this dispute , the scottish government has been absolutely clear that it expects the two sides to engage in constructive dialogue .
indeed , getting back round the table is the only way that a solution can be found without further frustrating inconvenience for people across scotland .
" therefore , we would urge both parties to continue talking as a matter of urgency and avoid the need for strike action .
john swinney has again made this point to both parties in recent days . "
the level of disruption had been similar to that during the strike on 20 august .
while teachers were not involved in the industrial action , more than 1,000 schools were closed or partially shut as support staff , such as caretakers and teaching assistants , took part in the strike .
unison has criticised perth and kinross and east ayrshire councils for keeping schools open which were closed during the last strike .
perth and kinross council said health and safety had been fully considered .
the level of disruption is likely to be the same as during the august strike a spokesman from the educational institute of scotland -lrb- eis -rrb- said the organisation supported its local authority colleagues .
he said : " the impact on schools will probably be varied , with some schools closing and others opening as normal .
" as teachers are not involved in this industrial action , they are contractually bound to make themselves available for work as normal if their school is open .
" however , teachers will only undertake their normal work , and can not be compelled by their employer to do the work of a colleague who is on strike action . "
leisure and community centres , museums and council offices were affected by the action in some parts of the country .
rallies were also held , with a large demonstration at princes street gardens in edinburgh .
hundreds of protesters also held a rally in the centre of aberdeen , where about 10,000 pupils were affected by school closures .
the strike follows a 24-hour-walkout this week by hundreds of court staff in the public and commercial services -lrb- pcs -rrb- union over a 2 % pay cap .
sportscotland and the national museums of scotland were also affected by tuesday 's walkout by 1,700 workers .
tens of thousands of council workers are taking part in the 24-hour walkout which is having an impact on local services across scotland .
here is a selection of your views on the industrial action : i 'm on strike today from east lothian council .
some union members are n't because they ca n't afford to and with some really bad middle-management going on we see the money wasted .
no one can afford to strike but for years we 've taken below inflation rises .
all staff are working to do a good job for themselves and the public and we all regret any losses of services but working for a local authority can be so frustrating that being told to " put up with it " is n't the way forward .
sorry to the public who may be affected , but this time we have no other choices .
i hope it all gets resolved soon .
steve donnelly , edinburgh i am the head teacher of a large primary school in central scotland .
despite my request to my local authority to close my school on safety grounds , having no janitor or support staff , and on health grounds , down to the fact classrooms and toilets will not be cleaned and the bins not emptied , my request was declined .
local authorities are not willing to support school staff and as a result are putting pupil safety at risk .
i am unwilling to provide my contact details as i know that i will be targeted by the education authority as a result .
i also know that i am one of many head teachers who are being forced to put pupils at risk today .
anon , central scotland i am at work today at glasgow city council and feel that we are lucky in the current climate , and particularly in the reflection of the last week , to even have a job .
my brother in law will soon be laid off and will have no work whatsoever .
what a privilege to even be offered a wage rise at all .
time for the unions to pull their heads out of their own little fluffy cloud and see the bigger picture .
there is no money to go round anywhere , and that includes councils -lrb- i bet they 'd be the first to complain when the council tax goes up again to pay for what they want -rrb- .
john smith , glasgow john swinney can not wriggle out of his responsibility for the strike by claiming it is a matter for cosla and the unions .
the reason councils do n't have enough money to pay their staff properly is that the scottish government forced them to freeze council tax levels .
since then , inflation has risen sharply and his sums no longer add up .
keith bathgate , erskine , renfrewshire my kids are not at school today because of this industrial action .
in this day and age it is shocking that children 's education is being targeted like this .
striking militant teachers ruined my education in the 80 's now my own kids will be impacted by this bunch .
at least they are getting a payrise , many private companies are giving none !
hamish barrie , edinburgh i am a striking council worker and as such am very sincere in my desire to get a fair pay deal .
there are on the surface very valid points from both sides of the divide .
what strikes me listening to leaders from all parties involved is that cosla and the employers want to ' talk ' where the unions want to ' negotiate ' .
two entirely different approaches .
negotiation requires talking but talking does n't necessarily mean negotiating !
the employers do not want to negotiate but to dictate .
mike brown , glenrothes , fife these strikes are disgusting , why should we have to live with rubbish all over the streets , it has nothing to do with the people who live here and pay an awful lot of money for council tax .
marcus , edinburgh great , just what we need .
our rubbish has n't been collected in 8 weeks anyway , so now they have a good excuse not to do it for a 9th !

hong kong 's central bank has added an estimated hk $ 3.9bn -lrb- $ 500m , £ 269m -rrb- to the territory 's banking system .
the government has also repeated the bank 's assurances that it is sound and that depositors have nothing to fear .
on wednesday , rumours that the bank was vulnerable spurred thousands of people to withdraw their money .
on thursday , the queues at bank branches were much smaller and before midday local time , the stock market had recovered most of what it had lost the day before .
panic over ?
newspaper front pages on thursday were dominated by the government 's promise to support bea and hong kong 's banking system .
analysts said that while investors in hong kong , as elsewhere , were nervous about the stability of the global financial system , there was little cause to fear a bea collapse .
the government has traditionally stepped in to support local institutions to avoid unrest .
there were no signs of concern at other banks in the territory with business apparently at normal levels .
traders and brokers , analysts and financial journalists , talk a lot - often with each other , even when they are not supposed to .
the origins of financial rumour bae chairman david li insisted his bank was sound .
in televised comments made late on wednesday , he said : " somebody is attacking bea .
i will buy bank of east asia shares tomorrow .
people are doing this because they want to pummel the stock . "
a half-page advertisement was published by the bank in local papers , stressing the support for bea from the monetary authority , and its statements that rumours of bank instability were " unfounded " .
" the business of the bank remains normal and all bea branches continue to operate as usual , " the advertisement said .
chinese-language newspapers also gave prominence to reports that asia 's richest man , hong kong 's li ka-shing , was buying heavily into bea stock .
mr li , no relation to the li family that controls bea , is an octogenarian billionaire whose wisdom in investments is taken seriously .
' no concerns ' the bank 's troubles began on tuesday when a spate of mobile telephone text messages were sent alleging bea would have to stop trading " in a day " because of its alleged exposure to the troubled us financial institutions lehman brothers and aig .
bea immediately responded by revealing its exposure , at about $ 60m , saying this was insignificant .
bea is the territory 's fifth largest lender , and has been in business since january 1919 .
moody 's investor service downgraded bea to " negative " last week after the bank booked losses made by a " rogue derivatives trader " .
moody 's stressed this week it had no concerns about bea 's liquidity .

a report by the broadcasting regulator ofcom warns these changes could have a serious impact on the independent television sector in wales .
it also sets out the latest funding ideas for public service broadcasters such as the bbc , channel 4 and s4c .
the heritage minister alun ffred jones expressed " huge concern " at the report .
the ofcom document is the second phase of its investigation into the future of public service broadcasting .
although the main itv wales news programme will be protected , a 20 % cut in news output from 5 hours 20 minutes per week to 4 hours will see mid-morning and weekend bulletins axed .
itv 's prime-time news shows remain hugely important , ofcom said itv ' can cut ' regional programmes the scale and speed of cuts in non-news output will see the channel 's welsh programming shrink from the current four hours a week , to just an hour-and-a-half after january .
it is thought this could lead to compulsory redundancies .
this is despite an emphasis in the ofcom report on the importance of news in the devolved nations and english regions - although it warns this is likely to require new and extra funding .
ofcom 's wales director rhodri williams said the proposals provided a " sustainable settlement " despite " the extensive economic pressures faced by itv " .
he said : " it is strongly in the interest of viewers in wales to retain public service programming from itv at a realistic level rather than risk losing such delivery altogether . "
wales ' heritage minister has said he plans to seek an urgent meeting with uk government ministers at westminster to discuss the assembly government 's concerns .
he said the proposal to cut the hours of public service broadcasting on itv wales was a dramatic loss and a blow for welsh audiences .
mr jones said : " it is a matter of huge concern to me that cutting the services offered by itv wales will deprive welsh citizens from receiving a diverse range of programmes which reflect their everyday lives .
channel 3 " welsh audiences , loyal to itv wales , could also be deprived from gaining access to information about the democratic institutions which serve them - this , in turn , could affect their level of participation in those political processes . "
in the long term , ofcom said it saw a key role for s4c as a provider of welsh language programmes .
it said the " evolution " of public service broadcasting could also include a wales-only channel 3 licence , instead of wales and west of england as currently , although this would need a public subsidy .

advertisement itv to cut welsh news broadcasts itv is to be allowed to slash its welsh programming by more than half because of the slump in income from advertising .
a report by the broadcasting regulator ofcom warns these changes could have a serious impact on the independent television sector in wales .
it also sets out the latest funding ideas for public service broadcasters such as the bbc , channel 4 and s4c .
the heritage minister alun ffred jones expressed " huge concern " at the report .
the ofcom document is the second phase of its investigation into the future of public service broadcasting .
although the main itv wales news programme will be protected , a 20 % cut in news output from 5 hours 20 minutes per week to 4 hours will see mid-morning and weekend bulletins axed .
itv 's prime-time news shows remain hugely important , ofcom said itv ' can cut ' regional programmes the scale and speed of cuts in non-news output will see the channel 's welsh programming shrink from the current four hours a week , to just an hour-and-a-half after january .
it is thought this could lead to compulsory redundancies .
this is despite an emphasis in the ofcom report on the importance of news in the devolved nations and english regions - although it warns this is likely to require new and extra funding .
ofcom 's wales director rhodri williams said the proposals provided a " sustainable settlement " despite " the extensive economic pressures faced by itv " .

he said : " it is strongly in the interest of viewers in wales to retain public service programming from itv at a realistic level rather than risk losing such delivery altogether . "
wales ' heritage minister has said he plans to seek an urgent meeting with uk government ministers at westminster to discuss the assembly government 's concerns .
he said the proposal to cut the hours of public service broadcasting on itv wales was a dramatic loss and a blow for welsh audiences .
mr jones said : " it is a matter of huge concern to me that cutting the services offered by itv wales will deprive welsh citizens from receiving a diverse range of programmes which reflect their everyday lives .
channel 3 " welsh audiences , loyal to itv wales , could also be deprived from gaining access to information about the democratic institutions which serve them - this , in turn , could affect their level of participation in those political processes . "
in the long term , ofcom said it saw a key role for s4c as a provider of welsh language programmes .
it said the " evolution " of public service broadcasting could also include a wales-only channel 3 licence , instead of wales and west of england as currently , although this would need a public subsidy .
in a statement , itv plc said : " we have consistently argued that the regulatory costs and commercial benefits of holding the itv plc licences need to be re-balanced between now and analogue switch off in 2012 .

on tuesday , matti juhani saari , aged 22 , shot 10 people in kauhajoki , before turning his gun on himself .
last year , pekka-eric auvinen , 18 , shot eight people and himself in jokela .
investigators say the two killers had bought their guns in jokela , possibly even at the same shop .
they also could have been in contact with each other .
auvinen apparently selected his victims at random " their actions seem so similar that i would consider it a miracle if we did not find some connecting link , " chief investigator jari neulaniemi was quoted as saying by finland 's stt news agency on wednesday .
mr neulaniemi also said the two shooters ' gun licences indicated that the weapons had been bought at the same store in jokela .
investigators declined to provide any further details .
the new information adds to the growing list of similarities between the two shootings : both men posted threatening clips on youtube before the attacks ; both were fascinated by the 1999 columbine school shooting in the us ; both shot themselves in the head .
however , investigators have so far not established a direct link between the two gunmen .
gun law rethink the kauhajoki attack has shocked finland , with the government now considering tightening gun laws - which are some of the most liberal in europe .
finland 's gun culture all gun owners are required to have a licence minimum age for buying a gun is 15 about 14 % of homicides in finland are gun-related focus on gun law in pictures : finnish shooting " in terms of handguns that can easily be carried about , we have to think about whether they should be available for private people .
in my opinion , they belong on shooting ranges , " prime minister matti vanhanen said on wednesday .
although finland said it would consider new laws after last year 's jokela attack , no changes have been made and 15-year-olds can still own guns .
the country has a long tradition of hunting and weapons-bearing .
an international small arms survey in 2007 estimated a total of 2.9 million firearms held by the population of 5.2 million people .
an investigation is also to be launched into the police handling of the latest shooting and the role of the internet .
saari was questioned by police a day before the attack but was not detained .
mr vanhanen also said authorities would look at whether there needed to be changes in internet monitoring .
" the internet and youtube forums ... are not another planet .
this is part of our world and we adults have the responsibility to check what is happening , and create borders and safety there , " he said .

on tuesday , matti juhani saari , aged 22 , shot 10 people in kauhajoki , before turning his gun on himself .
last year , pekka-eric auvinen , 18 , shot eight people and himself in jokela .
investigators say the two killers had bought their guns in jokela , possibly even at the same shop .
they also could have been in contact with each other .
auvinen apparently selected his victims at random " their actions seem so similar that i would consider it a miracle if we did not find some connecting link , " chief investigator jari neulaniemi was quoted as saying by finland 's stt news agency on wednesday .
mr neulaniemi also said the two shooters ' gun licences indicated that the weapons had been bought at the same store in jokela .
investigators declined to provide any further details .
the new information adds to the growing list of similarities between the two shootings : both men posted threatening clips on youtube before the attacks ; both were fascinated by the 1999 columbine school shooting in the us ; both shot themselves in the head .
however , investigators have so far not established a direct link between the two gunmen .
gun law rethink the kauhajoki attack has shocked finland , with the government now considering tightening gun laws - which are some of the most liberal in europe .

although finland said it would consider new laws after last year 's jokela attack , no changes have been made and 15-year-olds can still own guns .
the country has a long tradition of hunting and weapons-bearing .
an international small arms survey in 2007 estimated a total of 2.9 million firearms held by the population of 5.2 million people .
an investigation is also to be launched into the police handling of the latest shooting and the role of the internet .
saari was questioned by police a day before the attack but was not detained .
mr vanhanen also said authorities would look at whether there needed to be changes in internet monitoring .
" the internet and youtube forums ... are not another planet .
this is part of our world and we adults have the responsibility to check what is happening , and create borders and safety there , " he said .

over the last two years the brighton ball has raised more than £ 80,000 for breast cancer charities in sussex , largely supported by local businesses .

cricket gear signed by the sussex squad , jeremy clarkson 's pants , and jenny bond 's bra were among items due to have been auctioned this year .

roberto maroni said the local mafia , the camorra , was trying to stamp out any opposition to its criminal power .
he was speaking after the government announced it would send 500 troops to the campania region to help police fight local crime syndicates .
the move followed last week 's killings of six africans and an italian near naples which are blamed on the camorra .
speaking in parliament on wednesday , mr maroni described the killings of the italian national and the immigrants from ghana , liberia and togo as an " act of terrorism " .
he said the italian government " must respond firmly and regain control of the region " .
mr maroni said that was the reason why the government on tuesday approved a three-month deployment of 500 soldiers to campania .
the soldiers will join an extra 400 police and paramilitary carabinieri who have already been deployed in an effort to break the camorra 's stranglehold on its heartlands around naples .
this is the second time since the 1990s that the army has been ordered to join the fight against organised crime in southern italy .
some 150,000 soldiers were sent to sicily in 1992 , following the murder there of two leading anti-mafia judges .
' drug war ' last week 's killings near naples shocked italy .
the african immigrants were attacked by gunmen last thursday in the town of castelvolturno , near naples .
shortly before , gunmen shot dead the owner of a games arcade in the same town , firing 60 bullets into his head and stomach .
the killings - which are believed to be drug related - sparked a riot by immigrants .
police later arrested a man in connection with the shootings .

the film , released in the uk next week , was adapted from writer toby young 's memoir documenting his time working for vanity fair magazine in new york .
speaking on the red carpet , 38-year-old pegg said shooting the movie had been a " thrill from start to finish " .
" having my trailer on times square was amazing , " he told reporters .
" to be sat in this weird little air-conditioned environment and then open the door onto times square was sensational . "
kirsten dunst and jeff bridges also appear in the film , alongside transformers star megan fox .
' sensational ' pegg said it had been " great fun " to play the hero of the film , a character based on british writer young .
" peter straughan , who did the adaptation , did a great job of creating this fictional version of toby , " the hot fuzz star explained . "
i am so close to popping out " gillian anderson " he 's an idiot , and it 's fun playing an idiot . "
however , pegg admitted the film did not stay entirely true to the book .
" it stays true to the spirit , but you could n't really adapt toby 's book as a film , " he continued .
" it 's a series of anecdotes , strung together with notions of philosophy .
it would be very hard to put that on the screen . "
speaking to bbc news ahead of the premiere in leicester square , director robert weide said it was the script that attracted him to the project .
" it was funny and made me laugh out loud , which does n't happen very often , " he said .
" i love the central character of sidney , and the story is very engaging .
as soon as i read the script i knew i wanted to do this film . "
weide , best known for directing us sitcom curb your enthusiasm , said he had no knowledge of pegg 's acting career before casting .
" i did not know simon 's work , so when his name came up i did my homework and saw shaun of the dead , " he revealed .
" i knew after about 15 seconds he was the right guy for the job . "
megan fox has since found fame as one of the human stars of transformers , but weide claimed michael bay 's blockbuster did not figure in the casting .
' robot movie ' " transformers was months away from coming out when we cast her , " said the us director .
" i thought i 'd go down in history as the guy who discovered megan fox .
then that robot movie came out and made her a big star overnight .
" now everyone says , ' you cast her because of transformers ? '
no i did n't !
i knew nothing about it . "
anderson , who is eight months pregnant with her third child , plays a glamorous agent in the film .
" i 'm so close to popping out , " she joked with reporters at the premiere .

the film , released in the uk next week , was adapted from writer toby young 's memoir documenting his time working for vanity fair magazine in new york .
speaking on the red carpet , 38-year-old pegg said shooting the movie had been a " thrill from start to finish " .
" having my trailer on times square was amazing , " he told reporters .
" to be sat in this weird little air-conditioned environment and then open the door onto times square was sensational . "
kirsten dunst and jeff bridges also appear in the film , alongside transformers star megan fox .
' sensational ' pegg said it had been " great fun " to play the hero of the film , a character based on british writer young .
" peter straughan , who did the adaptation , did a great job of creating this fictional version of toby , " the hot fuzz star explained .
i am so close to popping out gillian anderson " he 's an idiot , and it 's fun playing an idiot . "
however , pegg admitted the film did not stay entirely true to the book .
" it stays true to the spirit , but you could n't really adapt toby 's book as a film , " he continued .
" it 's a series of anecdotes , strung together with notions of philosophy .
it would be very hard to put that on the screen . "
speaking to bbc news ahead of the premiere in leicester square , director robert weide said it was the script that attracted him to the project .
" it was funny and made me laugh out loud , which does n't happen very often , " he said .
pegg plays sidney , a character based on toby young -lrb- pictured -rrb- " i love the central character of sidney , and the story is very engaging .
as soon as i read the script i knew i wanted to do this film . "
weide , best known for directing us sitcom curb your enthusiasm , said he had no knowledge of pegg 's acting career before casting .
" i did not know simon 's work , so when his name came up i did my homework and saw shaun of the dead , " he revealed .
" i knew after about 15 seconds he was the right guy for the job . "
megan fox has since found fame as one of the human stars of transformers , but weide claimed michael bay 's blockbuster did not figure in the casting .
' robot movie ' " transformers was months away from coming out when we cast her , " said the us director .
" i thought i 'd go down in history as the guy who discovered megan fox .
then that robot movie came out and made her a big star overnight .
" now everyone says , ' you cast her because of transformers ? '
no i did n't !
i knew nothing about it . "
anderson , who is eight months pregnant with her third child , plays a glamorous agent in the film .
" i 'm so close to popping out , " she joked with reporters at the premiere .
